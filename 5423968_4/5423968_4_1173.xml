   <p>After the holidays, our Polish women returned zealously to their nationalistic and organizational work.</p>
   <p>According to information given by Mrs. [M.] Milewski, from her personal observation in the Polish Army barracks, the items needed most by the Polish soldiers are socks and mufflers. They have enough sweaters. Due to the dampness in that vicinity, it is difficult to keep the feet and shoes dry, and so the soldiers there can never be oversupplied with socks. Let us try, then, to supply them with these items as soon as possible, lest by our negligence we expose our warriors to illness. Working hours in the Clothing Committee of the Women's Department of the Polish National Alliance are as before, from two to nine o'clock in the evening on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays.</p>
   <p>We announce with pleasure that the Clothing Committee recently received a letter of acknowledgement and thanks from the Irkutsk Committee of the Polish War Relief <pb facs="5423968_4_1174.jpg" n="2"/>Association of Petrograd for the clothing, in part donated and in part purchased, sent there by our Committee. The text of this letter appeared in the January 9 issue of Dziennik Zwiazkowy; we only wish to show here that the generosity of our Polish women of the Clothing Committee.... is being put to effective use; many Polish families are being shielded from the illness, or perhaps death, that results from lack of warm clothing. Let the conviction that our efforts have dried a great many tears of suffering, dear sisters, encourage us to work with greater zeal and self-sacrifice in the future.</p>
   <p>Our sisters of the Women's Department are equally zealous in organizational work. Not long ago, Mrs. [M.] Sakowski visited Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where she spoke at a gathering, urging everyone to become a member of the greatest Polish organization, the Polish National Alliance. Mrs. J. Dunin, former editor of Zgoda, also spoke at this meeting. We have hopes that the ardent appeals of these two women will find an echo--that as a result of this encouragement, a great many women will decide to join our organization and have the honor of being called "members of the Polish National Alliance."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1175.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On Thursday, a meeting of the Women's Department was held, at which the women's commissioner, Mrs. V. Lipinski, who recently returned from Florida, was present. She shared with us a great many impressions she received in the course of her travels, and made some important suggestions concerning co-operation in order that the work for our organization be most effective.</p>
   <p>The meeting continued until very late, for there were many important matters to discuss and many projects to be examined. Each matter was considered in detail, and everything led to one end--the good of our motherland and the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>We would like also to mention here that the Women's Department of the Polish National Alliance participates in all activities of various collective organizational groups. One of our members, Mrs. Sakowski, is a member of the National Department, another, Mrs. M. Milewski, is a member of the Executive Committee of the Polish Central Relief Committee. We also have a representative in the <pb facs="5423968_4_1176.jpg" n="4"/>Citizens' Committee. Thus it can be seen that the women of the Polish National Alliance are always represented everywhere, always occupying an important position.</p>
   <p>We would also like to share with our women readers one other triumph of the women of America. On January 10, the House of Representatives made an amendment to the Constitution, giving women equal voting rights with men. This question will be more thoroughly discussed in the next issue [of Dziennik Zwiazkowy].</p>
