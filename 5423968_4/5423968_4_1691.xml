   <p>For some time, we have been agitating in our columns for the support of Polish business and industry, but thus far, the results have been small. A certain portion of our countrymen regard the slogan "Buy from Poles" as a bait thought up by Polish businessmen to help fill their own pockets; others admit that it is a very good principle, but that it applies to others rather than themselves. As a result, Polish business in America as a whole, as well as Polish business in Chicago, is not making much progress.</p>
   <p>On the conviction that the expansion of Polish business and industry is desirable and necessary from a nationalistic point of view, a group of Polish businessmen of Chicago who understand their duties to the Polish nation has decided, with the support of the Polish press, to conduct an energetic campaign for the promotion of Polish business and industry in Chicago. We shall try to show in our articles that the desire for personal gain is not <pb facs="5423968_4_1692.jpg" n="2"/>the most important factor by which those who call for support of Polish business are governed, and, at the same time, we shall advertise Polish stores, shops, and factories to the extent of our means.</p>
   <p>It is not our intention to harm anyone; we have no desire to ruin businessmen of other nationalities. Our one aim is to create a harmonious co-operation between the various elements of our nation, so that collectively we can render the greatest possible service to Poland.</p>
   <p>It is wrongly assumed by some people that a well-organized national group in America cannot do much to help its native land. Let us compare, for example, the sums of money collected for nationalistic purposes by the Jewish element here with that of the Polish. No one accuses the Poles of being less generous than the Jews, although it is quite probable that, after more than a hundred years of oppression by conquerors, we may have lost our sense of national duty to a certain extent.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1693.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>......But another factor should be taken into consideration--he who has very little or nothing himself cannot give much to others.</p>
   <p>The wealthy Jews raised millions when their people required aid. At such a time, it was their duty to give, and to give proportionately more than can be given by people whose earnings are sufficient only for their own support. The Polish element had no such wealthy members who, upon necessity, could come forth with large sums of money. We must openly admit to ourselves that, although we have all been giving a little, the aggregate has not been very large.</p>
   <p>It is time that we stopped complaining of disunion, that we lack harmony and because of this, strength. Let us try to do something to concentrate our forces and thus create strength. Political power goes hand in hand with economic power. Let us help to expand Polish business and industry by supporting Polish enterprise and create such economic power.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1694.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Below you will find the advertisements of Polish merchants who recommend their stores to you, both for the quality of the merchandise offered and for the prices at which they sell. You have nothing to lose by patronising Polish stores; on the contrary, you may even gain, if you compare the merchandise they offer with that of stores owned by non-Polish people in the same community.</p>
   <p>Poles! Support Polish business and industry!</p>
