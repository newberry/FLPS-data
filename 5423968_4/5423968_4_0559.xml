   <p>Great words have been uttered in the English Parliament. In the name of the Government of Great Britain, Chancellor of the Exchequer Bonar Law has spoken for the first time for our cause, showing the clear and decided intentions of the Allies in respect to Poland.</p>
   <p>Chancellor Bonar Law sincerely welcomed the proclamation to the Poles of the free Russian nation and declared that "thanks to the liberal and diplomatic activity of the temporary Russian government, Poland will again appear on the horizon of international life, and will fulfill her duty together with other nations in their joint efforts for the common good and civilization. Our efforts in the war will be aimed in the direction of helping Poland, in order that it may realize its unity within the boundaries defined by the Russian proclamation to the Poles, and on the conditions that will make Poland a <pb facs="5423968_4_0560.jpg" n="2"/>strong and independent country."</p>
   <p>Therefore, Poland will be free and independent on the conclusion of this war; Poland will make her own decisions; Poland will be rid of foreign protectorates; and realizing full well to whom she owes her deliverance and unity, will stand guard over our national ideals as a bulwark of the freedom of nations, as an impassable wall against all temptations of Germanic dreams of conquering the East.</p>
   <p>Poland will fulfill her duty together with other nations and will share in the efforts of all for the common good and for civilization. To what extent Poland will do this, depends upon how she will appear after her resurrection. If the nations of the world decree that she will be strong and will have the boundaries of her former domain, then the position of Poland through these efforts will be great and perhaps even decisive in the problems which she must confront in order to develop properly and to work harmoniously toward her ideal.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0561.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Poland and Poles clearly realize that only a nation which intends and is able to contribute something to humanity, can win a place for itself among other independent nations. A nation which develops its strength, its culture, perfecting itself and its own individuality, by the same token enriches, by new spiritual or material benefits, the civilization of all mankind. The entire history of Poland shows this most clearly, and one does not have to look very far in the search for examples.</p>
   <p>Almost fanatically faithful to the ideal of freedom, constantly seeking to draw our program of activity from the ideal of "free among the free and equal among equals," we have never, as a nation, known how to "consolidate" our assets in such a way as to absorb some other nationality. We never sought battles of conquest, and never broke relations with others nations out of greed for their possessions, their land and property.</p>
   <p>And thus we shall remain. We will not permit others to take what is ours. We will resist to the last drop of blood and defend every foot of soil soaked <pb facs="5423968_4_0562.jpg" n="4"/>with Polish blood, because that is our heritage from our fathers, our most sacred inheritance, but we will never unite our cause with agressive imperialism, or with anyone's aim of world rule, because this would be contrary to our national ideal, to our conception of the freedom of peoples and of individuals.</p>
   <p>Our people gave clear proof of this in the present war, when they resisted with all their strength the temptations and promises of the Central Powers, when they did not raise an insurrection in the Kingdom [district in Poland], when they finally gave recruits to despised, autocratic Russia and embraced with their entire being the cause of the Allies; in spite of the fact that Russia was included in the alliance, in spite of the fact that the temptations from the other side were very strong. They did not betray the Allied flag even when the Germans after occupying the Kingdom used all sorts of tricks to draw the people over to their side. Even the temporary State Council created by the Germans in Warsaw did not yield to the command to announce compulsory military service, but left the matter of participation and enlisting in the army being raised in Warsaw to the will of the people of the Kingdom, because <pb facs="5423968_4_0563.jpg" n="5"/>common sense and the Polish ideal conquered there. And this happened at a time when no one dreamed of the overthrow of the Czar, when no one dreamed of the proclamation of freedom for the Poles by the Russian nation.</p>
   <p>Today, when other nations are following Russia's example, when the Italian premier demands a free and independent Poland, when Bonar Law, in the name of the Government of Great Britain, confirms the intentions of free Russia, when the entire French press clamors loudly for compensation to Poland for the crimes committed against her, and already looks upon the Polish question as solved, when, finally, the United States, in which Poland has its best spokesman, has joined the side of the Allies, and with the United States all of America, there will not be found among our people a single individual openly admiring the Teutons, with the exception of those who can be bought and who have nothing in common with the nation, who want to make money and gain personal influence through the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>Great deeds of our nation will follow the great words which are now being uttered in behalf of our cause. The four million Polish emigres in the <pb facs="5423968_4_0564.jpg" n="6"/>States, who have freedom of action and can express the most ardent wishes and desires of the nation, will prove this to the best of their ability.</p>
   <p>If we are given the opportunity to fulfill the promise given at Pittsburgh to the President of this great republic, we will do so to the letter. The Kosciusko army will be raised if this is within the bounds of possibility and the laws of the government of this country. If not then our young men will join the United States army, as they are already doing in all cities and settlements where Poles live, in spite of the fact that our best and most patriotic young men are still waiting for the call from the Falcons.</p>
   <p>We cannot defend our homeland on Polish soil. Therefore let us join up under The Stars and Stripes in order to defend a mutual cause with joint forces and help to gain a victory for the democracy of the world over the militarism of Prussia, to gain a victory for truth over meanness and the antithesis of freedom, that, through this bloody baptism, there may be a renascence of all humanity, and that justice and universal equality may reign on earth.</p>
