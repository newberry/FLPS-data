   <p>On May 25, a monthly meeting was held by the Polish Doctors Association. After the disposition of administrative matters, Dr. K. Zurawski delegated at the previous meeting as a representative of the Polish Doctors Association to co-operate with the Chicago Medical Society, commenced his campaign against quack medical institutions, by proposing the elimination of their advertisements from the Polish press. This initiative of the Polish Doctors Association brought about the formation of committees in the following organizations: the Chicago Medical Society, the Chicago Homeopath Medical Society, the Chicago Eclectic Medicine Society, and the Chicago Dental Society. The committee began its task by engaging prominent lawyers to gather the evidence necessary to bring about an early prosecution against the whole rank of these unconscientious exploiters, <pb facs="5423968_4_1337.jpg" n="2"/>and in order to carry on this fight more efficiently, the Polish Doctors Association has requested the Polish press to inform the public that all persons wronged or cheated by these quacks should send in their complaints to the representative of the polish Doctors Association, and simultaneously to the newly organized active committee [headed by] K. Eurawski, 4630 South Ashland Avenue.</p>
