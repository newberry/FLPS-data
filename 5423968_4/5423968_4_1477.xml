  <body>
   <p>In 1918 Mr. Joseph Slodkowski started a sausage factory on Commercial Avenue, and conducted it there until 1923. Then he moved to 2017-23 W. 18th St.</p>
   <p>In 1925 he started to enlarge the building, which he completed next year. His sausage factory now has a good appearance and it occupies almost a whole block. Mr. Slodkowski employs thirty-five men. In April, 1936, there was a grand opening of his new factory, in which Dr. Gawronski, the Polish consul, participated with about five thousand people from all parts of the city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Slodkowski, due to his hard work and perseverance, is in a position to take his life easy. He has now entered into the best stage of his life.</p>
   <p>His wife helps him in his work; so does one of his sons. Another son, Eugene, who was born in South Chicago, attends St. Beads College in Peru, Illinois.</p>
