   <p>Members of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union:</p>
   <p>The Poles were always grateful. This springs from the Polish nature. Whoever in a great cause demonstrated to us a friendly heart and gave us a hand, to him every Pole has a duty to show his gratitude.</p>
   <p>In Europe not one of the men of state dared to swallow the words, "Independence for Poland." President Wilson did not only utter these words but put up the independence of a United Poland as one of the conditions of a world peace, and these were not empty words. To overcome Prussian autocracy and to liberate from slavery Poland and other oppressed nations, he put up all the powers and means of the United States. Today when the German power has been conquered, President Wilson is endeavoring for the fulfillment of these preliminary demands. President Wilson was the first to recognize the Polish government with Premier Paderewski at its head. Behind him went France, England and Italy. President Wilson did not only do for Poland what he promised, but secured for us indemnity <pb facs="5423968_4_0126.jpg" n="2"/>from Germany, which a relative commission calculates at a billion dollars.</p>
   <p>With the recommendation of President Wilson, the food commission as well as the main command of the Red Cross are conducting activities to feed Poland. He sent two cablegrams from Paris to Congress in Washington about awarding the one hundred million dollar fund for feeding devastated countries, and Poland was in the first line.</p>
   <p>In return for this ought we not feel grateful in the presence of President Wilson and the government of this country? This country, to conduct such a war and to defeat such a terrible enemy, made itself liable to great costs and in order to cover these costs, is contracting a loan in bonds. This loan should hold up the credit and the outside defensive position of the United States.</p>
   <p>In this persuasion we owe it, dear members of the Union, to lead in the buying of Victory Liberty Loan Bonds. The conditions of purchase are exceptionally beneficial. The interest reaches 4 3/4%, and it is <pb facs="5423968_4_0127.jpg" n="3"/>exempt from income tax and other fees. The payment can be completed in a period of six months.</p>
   <p>These conditions make this loan an investment of exceptional value and on account of that I beg you, members of the Union, to support this cause with all your might. Buy Victory Liberty Loan Bonds. He who buys such a bond helps Poland.</p>
   <p>Poland needs our help today, and we cannot succeed except in a harmonious, honest understanding with President Wilson and his government.</p>
   <p>Members of the Union, let us show ourselves grateful and faithful. Contribute toward the success of this cause.</p>
   <p>Yours always devoted,</p>
   <p>N. L. Piotrowski</p>
   <p>President P. R. C. Union.</p>
  </body>
