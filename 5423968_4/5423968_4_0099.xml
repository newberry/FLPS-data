   <p>A very interesting article written by Captain Robert Ginsburg, of the United States Army, appeared in the November issue of Plain Talk; it was titled "Preparation for What?"</p>
   <p>Captain Ginsburg, who is considered one of the foremost authorities on the affair of war, writes that preparation for the next war is practically impossible.</p>
   <p>To work out a plan of action, that will bring victory in face of the enemy's strength, would be most difficult, writes Mr. Ginsburd. If we knew exactly when and with whom, we will have war, it would be possible to work out a more definite plan of campaign. But, we do not know this, and it would not be wise or practical to regard each nation in the world as a possible enemy.</p>
   <p>Despite this situation, we must properly prepare for war in advance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0100.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the event of a war between two evenly matched powers, we predict war in the air. Many persons may think this impossible; it has however, been evidenced in many ways. In the event that the strength of the enemy be equal to that of its opponent, or if the strength of the battleships on one side be equal to those on the other, the result would be that counterattacks, too, would be equal. We would find ourselves engaged in a long lasting war, depending entirely on the effort expended in breaking down and exhausting the spirit of the foe, and with a final victory to the faction, which could most readily replace the loss of men and war equipment.</p>
   <p>Some people believe that the mechanizing of war would hasten its end. However, if the United States would happen to find the enemy equally prepared in this respect, the war would have to be fought on an equal basis, and would last for many years, as did the past World War.</p>
   <p>The fact is, that we, Americans, were not prepared for war. It is characteristic, that we prefer not to lead other nations in the preparation for war. It was for that reason, that we were forced to pay a high price at the beginning of the war. It was our luck, however, that we did not <pb facs="5423968_4_0101.jpg" n="3"/>have to send our army out on the same day, that war was declared.</p>
   <p>There is not a nation that can prepare itself for every possible eventuality. A war may be one of either a short or long duration; it may be carried on in an open field or in some designated spot. We cannot rely wholly on one method of defense and exclude all others. Objections arise from the fact that all absolete machinery is removed, as soon as the new has proved more practical, whereas, the Army should be prepared to utilize all kinds of available arms. The next foe may be equipped with mechanized strength, of a character that will carry the battle in an unusual manner. The next war may be won by airplanes and tanks, or it may be won by bayonets.</p>
   <p>Preparation for war today, depends, above all, on the knowledge and observation of all the methods of war.</p>
   <p>There is not a person who can today predict what the next war will be, and what methods or instruments of defense will be used. The predictions of today relative to airplanes, motors, gases, machine guns and submarines, are of the same nature as those of 1915.</p>
