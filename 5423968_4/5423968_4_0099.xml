   <p>In the event of a war between two evenly matched powers, we predict war in the air. Many persons may think this impossible; it has however, been evidenced in many ways. In the event that the strength of the enemy be equal to that of its opponent, or if the strength of the battleships on one side be equal to those on the other, the result would be that counterattacks, too, would be equal. We would find ourselves engaged in a long lasting war, depending entirely on the effort expended in breaking down and exhausting the spirit of the foe, and with a final victory to the faction, which could most readily replace the loss of men and war equipment.</p>
   <p>Some people believe that the mechanizing of war would hasten its end. However, if the United States would happen to find the enemy equally prepared in this respect, the war would have to be fought on an equal basis, and would last for many years, as did the past World War.</p>
   <p>The fact is, that we, Americans, were not prepared for war. It is characteristic, that we prefer not to lead other nations in the preparation for war. It was for that reason, that we were forced to pay a high price at the beginning of the war. It was our luck, however, that we did not <pb facs="5423968_4_0101.jpg" n="3"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[blank]"/></p>
