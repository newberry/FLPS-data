   <p>The question of the Universal Machine and Tool Corporation, which declared itself insolvent on October 7 of last year, was again taken up yesterday in the receiver's office. The following witnesses were examined: Dr. Chrzan; Attorney Julius Kwasigroch; Commissioner Albert Nowak; Mr. Pontkowski, president of the firm; Peter Niemira, president of the Guaranty Mortgage and Security Company; and Miss Cartwright, witness for the State in matters of corporation law.</p>
   <p>As is seen from the depositions of the witnesses so far examined, the chief causes of the bankruptcy were the irregularities in the financial management and the bookkeeping and the disregard of the State corporation laws. Exact bookkeeping records were not kept, and only occasional official entries were made in the books. Of course many mistakes and inaccuracies crept in, and finally the deficits became known. Even the articles of incorporation were violated as to the number of men on the board of directors, for there were <pb facs="5423968_4_1554.jpg" n="2"/>nine directors instead of five, as the articles prescribe.</p>
   <p>Commissioner Albert Nowak declared that he had accepted the offices of director and treasurer of this corporation believing that the corporation was organized and managed according to the laws of the State; that otherwise he would have had nothing to do with the business. And so far as his being treasurer was concerned, it was only an empty title, since he never even touched any of the company's money, his main function being the signing of checks drawn by Mr. Pontkowski. According to depositions of Peter Niemira, treasurer of the Politowski firm which was merged with the Universal Corporation last July, neither Mr. Szalaj nor anybody else ever received any compensation for bringing about the merger of these two concerns. Later it was shown that Mr. Szalaj received $4,000, of which $1,600 went to Dr. Chrzan, and an equal amount to Joseph Sochon; besides, Dr. Chrzan also received $250 for his speeches during the stock-selling campaign. Mr. Szalaj admitted that though he had not received any compensation from Politowski, he was to be paid $4,000 by the Universal Corporation for his promotional work leading to <pb facs="5423968_4_1555.jpg" n="3"/>the merger of these two firms, which he with the help of others had succeeded in accomplishing. It was further shown that though Mr. Szalaj was agitating for the benefit of the company, he had never been connected with it in an official capacity, either as a manager or as a bookkeeper, as Mr. Pontkowski had declared at the inquiry last week. But he conducted his own business, the Universal Sales Company, which sold moving-picture machines made by the Universal Corporation. He had a right, therefore, to keep samples of the goods which he was selling. It was finally shown that Mr. Lemacki (or rather Gramacki) did not accuse either Commissioner Nowakowski or Dr. Chrzan of carrying away moving-picture machines; what he really was concerned about was the $250 that Dr. Chrzan received as his share for services rendered to the corporation.</p>
   <p>The Universal Machine and Tool Corporation was organized in the year 1918 with a capital of $25,000. Shortly afterwards this sum was raised to $50,000 and later to $100,000. This corporation was at that time one of the largest Polish concerns, and its future looked quite promising.</p>
