   <p>Yesterday, at the Polish Alma Mater Hall, Milwaukee Avenue near North Avenue, a large number of members of the Kiwanis Club, consisting of business men of the Northwest Side, assembled at a dinner. This meeting was called for the purpose of installing a new president for the year 1928. This important post went to a well-known representative of the Polish people, August J. Kowalski, vice-president of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, an institution largely serving, and managed by, Poles.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kowalski, because of his work not only among the Polish people but also among people of other nationalities, has earned this distinguished position. He has been recognized for this work by the members of the Kiwanis Club, many of whom are not Polish.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was indeed an eventful day in the life of Mr. Kowalski, who not only became president of this organization but also received a promotion <pb facs="5423968_4_1502.jpg" n="2"/>at his place of employment. He was appointed vice-president of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, headed by John F. Smulski. Congratulations!</p>
