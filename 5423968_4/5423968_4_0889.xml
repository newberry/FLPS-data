   <p>The American Protective Association (so called A. P. A's) and all other enemies are constantly coming out as our foes.</p>
   <p>In time of war, or to say when the United States is in need, it is shown best who truly loves his new country, and who offers his blood and life for it.</p>
   <p>We are sure that, taking into consideration the number of Poles living in the United States, a large proportion of them enlisted perhaps even more than any other nationality.</p>
   <p>It is true that there was only one exclusively Polish company, and that was from Milwaukee, (and for that "Hurrah Milwaukee!") but many Poles could be found singly and in small numbers in many regiments. They were not lacking where the blood was flowing in Santiago and in Manila -- and also in hospitals, bedridden with pain are our kind and the many new graves and plenty of older ones prove that Poles are even prepared to die for their adopted country and the glory of the Stars and Stripes.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, it has been found that many volunteers, when enlisting in the army had changed their names, only because the American people found it difficult to <pb facs="5423968_4_0890.jpg" n="2"/>pronounce their real names.</p>
   <p>They have done wrong because you should never be ashamed of your parental and Polish name and never change it. They not only harmed themselves but all the Poles.</p>
   <p>Let us try at once to compile a list of names of all the Poles real and assumed who were under arms in the late war -- and in due time we will have a real weapon against the "A. P. A's" and other foes, because it surely will show that the percentage of Poles in proportion to their total population was very large.</p>
   <p>We expect other papers to support us, and encougage their readers to cooperate in collecting the names of all our warriors.</p>
   <p>The "Narod" will gladly publish the names of all those who participated in the war.</p>
   <p>Valiant warriors, give us your names, your regiment and the company with which you served.</p>
