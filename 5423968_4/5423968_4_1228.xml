   <p>A small number of Polish women and young women from time to time take a book in their hands so as to read it, just to kill time or more rarely for pleasure or to acquire some knowledge. The majority of women do not reflect upon what kind of book should be read, and what kind should be avoided.</p>
   <p>The necessity of reading, Rolnik (Agriculturist) tells us, is felt by every intelligent woman capable of thinking and reflecting upon the world and the happenings in the course of life. Such motives every sensible person will praise. For it is better that a woman occupy her spare moments with the reading of good books than to gossip with a neighbor. Gossiping usually results in arguments, misunderstandings and often enough law-suits.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, however, a considerable portion of our Polish women read unsuitable books. Agents of various Jewish firms visit Polish homes and sell books containing stories published in parts which, supposedly, <pb facs="5423968_4_1229.jpg" n="2"/>are eagerly ready by our women. These books describe terrible horrors which never existed. These books are issued every week and are sold for ten cents. Usually a story of this kind is continued for two or three years, making a woman pay up to ten dollars and sometimes even more in order to finish the story.</p>
   <p>However, when it comes to buying a good book from a Polish firm and paying for it 50 cents or a dollar, the same woman complains about hard times and claims that the book is too expensive.</p>
   <p>And now let us talk somewhat about the contents of these ten-cent-criminal stories. Overlooking the terrible Polish language in which they are written, they possess the defect of depraving the hearts and minds of te younger women as well as the older ones, through descriptions of reluctant, lustful scenes, mass murders, attempts at poisoning, leaving husbands for worthless lovers, the murdering of children and so forth. There is possibly no other literature so poisonous as these dime novels. It has not been possible for me to run across one story in these ten cent books which represented some value, whether literary, artistic, or <pb facs="5423968_4_1230.jpg" n="3"/>scientific. There is nothing there except senseless babbling about foolish trash.</p>
   <p>Such literature should be positively avoided and thrown out of every home, wherever it is found.</p>
   <p>The agent who sells such "masterpieces" should be invited outside the door. It is interesting to note that not one dignified Polish publishing firm sells these ten cent crime stories. This attests very well as to the character of our Polish publishers.</p>
   <p>We see that the Polish publishers do not want to give the Polish people "poison" to read. Let no one, therefore, buy books from other sources. A woman ought to read as much as possible and as often as she can, because through this she enlightens her heart and her mind.</p>
   <p>We ask you not to read such books, not to poison yourselves. There are enough good Polish books, whether novels, romance, or books of learning.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1231.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There are books for diversion and for learning. Why then read scandalous nonsense, which is of no useful value and gives you no satisfaction? It is high time for Polish women to start a war on such useless ten cent romances.</p>
   <p>We Polish women should endeavor to read as many books as we can, but good books, not moral rottenness and imbecilities.</p>
   <p>Particularly, you Polish mothers should watch what kind of books your daughters are reading. Thousands of girls have already fallen over a precipice thanks to reading criminal romances in ten cent story books. Do you wish your daughter to go the same way? A young and inexperienced mind graps everything it comes in contact with and takes it for good. Therefore you have to watch it so that it takes only that which is useful.</p>
   <p>Very often the girls read about different women of the streets who afterwards became "countesses." They judge that in the life of these dime <pb facs="5423968_4_1232.jpg" n="5"/>novels, some great millionaire will fall in love with them and they will be come rich ladies forever after. Many a ruffian can be found pretending he is some important man, who would stop at nothing. How many women had things upset in their heads due to these <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> novels How many marriages have been broken up for this reason?</p>
   <p>Remember, a good book is a man's best friend; a bad book, his greatest enemy. Let us do away with ten cent romances sold to us by our enemies!</p>
