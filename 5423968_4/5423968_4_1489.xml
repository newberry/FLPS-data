   <p>The Standard Coal and Coke Company, a Polish coal firm, has been in the business for the last thirty-five years.</p>
   <p>This firm was started in the year 1901 by Mr. Ziolkowski, the father of the present owner. At first he conducted it on a small scale with one horse and wagon; later on his son and brother of the present owner conducted it at 8847 Escanaba avenue. He was helped by his younger brother Felix, who was then sixteen years old.</p>
   <p>Felix, the owner of the firm who was then seventeen years old, took the management in his hands and by hard work and good management developed it into a large business.</p>
   <p>He was also known for his honesty, (honest weight) was his motto. His honesty and good service gained the confidence of the public, with the result that from a one truck firm it grew into an eight-truck, big concern.</p>
   <p>At present this firm employs eighteen men distributing coal and ice in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felix Ziolkowski is a self-made man. He is married. His wife, Lillian, helps him in his business.</p>
