   <p>Complaints are coming in from all sides that the volunteer system of recruiting men for the United States army is a great disappointment, and that young Americans are not enlisting with the eagerness that one would expect. These complaints are followed by cries urging the government to take the necessary steps to pass a bill demanding compulsory military training, so that all can do their duty as the present critical times demand.</p>
   <p>And what are the Poles doing now? many will ask. Are they enlisting voluntarily? Are they ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in defense of our adopted country and the lofty humanitarian ideals of which President Wilson is the champion?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0586.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is difficult to answer these questions clearly and definitely, because we lack statistics showing how many Poles have already enlisted in Uncle Sam's army. From what we can gather from the activity of the small number of recruiting bureaus stationed in the Chicago Polish neighborhoods, we can definitely state that Poles are enlisting in the army and want to do their duty as befits citizens of this country and sons of Poland, which is now returning to life.</p>
   <p>Even if the number of volunteers is not as great as the size of our population would indicate, we do have an excuse.</p>
   <p>Our fiery and eager young men are waiting for the final answer to the request made by the Alliance of Polish Falcons at its special convention at Pittsburgh, where, at the suggestion of our Ignace Paderewski, it was decided to ask the government to permit us to raise a 100,000 strong <pb facs="5423968_4_0587.jpg" n="3"/>army of Poles, which would place itself as a unit under the command and leadership of the government in exchange for the privilege of bearing the name of Kosciusko Army.</p>
   <p>This request, according to the information available at present, has not yet been formally granted. We can assume that the obstacles are so great that it will be difficult for the government of the United States to grant this request. We can deduce that the government will not break its rules for the Poles when it does not do so for other nationalities. However, these suppositions are not a formal settlement of the matter.</p>
   <p>That is why we are waiting for the formal solution of the matter. If the request of the Poles is granted, our young men--we believe this firmly--would hasten by the thousands to enlist in the ranks of the Kosciusko Army, which would consist in the first place of our Falcons and our military societies. If <pb facs="5423968_4_0588.jpg" n="4"/>Washington is unable to grant our request, these young men who are awaiting the call from the Alliance of Polish Falcons, and for this reason have not yet enlisted, will willingly enlist in the regular army.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we are doing and must do our duty. We know that at the last moment important conferences are being held in Chicago between our leaders and Ignace Paderewski. He suggested this plan and possesses all data and necessary information. It is possible that in the next few days we will know what we should do. We are therefore waiting patiently for the decision, hoping that it may come soon. Time is pressing, and we do not want our young men, who are impatient to get to work, to be classed among those called "slackers" and to be spoken of with contempt, because they earnestly desire to give their services to this country and do their duty.</p>
