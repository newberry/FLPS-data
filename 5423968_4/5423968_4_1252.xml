   <p>Yesterday with song and patriotic demonstrations, Polish women from all parts of this city opened the first home and offices of the Polish Women's National Alliance of America, recently purchased by the organization at 572 N. Ashland Ave.</p>
   <p>Leading Polish nationalists, both men and women, made speeches and united Polish choirs of Chicago sang. The Women's Alliance consists of one-hundred different societies throughout the United States, and the establishment of the home in this city makes Chicago the chief headquarters of the organization.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Neuman, president of the organization, made the opening address. Mrs. Fabianski, secretary; Mrs. L. Kadow, treasurer; and Mrs. S. Szeszychi, vice-president, were the other speakers. M. B. Steczynski, president of the Polish National Alliance, on behalf of the nationalists, congratulated the women upon their success in securing their own home.</p>
   <p>The home of the women's organization is a three story brick building. It will contain offices, reading-rooms, library, and assembly halls for the Polish women.</p>

   <p>During the dedicatory exercises, Mrs. Anna Neuman, president, said, "The Polish women following the footsteps of their mothers across the sea, will encourage the men in their work for education and the uplifting of the Polish people here. We will carry on our work to help the young people and will lead in every good cause for the benefit of this country and for Poland. United as we are at this time, we hope to be a powerful influence for good among our people. We will extend the scope of our organization so that the homes will become more numerous and our work most effective."</p>
