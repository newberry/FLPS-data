   <p>Tomorrow we will celebrate the 135th anniversary of this Nation. Independence is a sacred word, especially to us Poles, who have lost our autonomy. We Poles should take part in this celebration not only in Chicago, but everywhere, to show our appreciation to this hospitable land which conquered its oppressors. All free and civilized countries could really celebrate July 4th as a holiday, because creating the great and independent Republic in North America was a great forward move in the people's battle for freedom.</p>
   <p>On this date, 135 years ago, a new member of the Family of Nations was born; although still in its infancy, it has outgrown the others, and with all its resources may become the real leader of the big family.</p>
   <p>The Constitution of the United States guarantees every race and nationality the right of social and political freedom. All nations should be proud of this youngest brother, and should discard their ancient forms of government and adopt the principles of the newest offspring in our circle, the great United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1125.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We Poles should be especially proud, because of the part we took in the fight for the independence.</p>
   <p>Everybody familiar with history will admit that without the aid of France, the Revolutionary War would have been a failure. France decided to send a strong Fleet and Corps of good soldiers to America, after the English Army under the command of Bourgoyne was smashed.</p>
   <p>It was Kosciuszko who defeated the British Regiments and crowned the American Revolutionary War with success.</p>
   <p>We Poles, as citizens of this great Domain should cherish our love and our highest esteem for the Land of our Choice. We pledge our loyalty, our unselfish and honest services for its defense when the need arises, because the United States guarantees to protect our rights as loyal citizens of this great Country.</p>
