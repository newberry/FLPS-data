   <p>Poland's hands have not been too feeble to rip the cloak of hypocrisy from the motives controlling the nations which beset her. The cruel policies of this was are left naked and without a moral attribute.</p>
   <p>Poland's case disposes of all pretences of humanity. It deposes all the self-styled champions of humanity. It reduces all to a common level, where they struggle for one end, power, by one means, force. Poland starving, can be relieved out of the store houses of non-belligerent nations, if permission to carry the food to the Poles can be obtained. The Poles as a people are being wiped out with means much more cruel than those used when Poland as a nation was annihilated.</p>
   <p>In all the correspondence, which has passed between the chairman of the American commission and the British and German authorities, only one thing is stated in a direct unambiguous way. The Poles may be fed if the military <pb facs="5423968_4_0724.jpg" n="2"/>purpose of the belligerents be not affected in the slightest degree.</p>
   <p>If a military advantage, however slight, must be surrendered [by the Allies] the Poles may starve. For Great Britain, as conspicuously as for any nation involved in the war, a military need is paramount. The Polish people may become extinct through starvation. That consideration, however, cannot be taken into account if some military advantage may be taken from the enemy thereby.</p>
   <p>Sir Edward Grey has stipulated to Mr. Hoover of the American commission that supplies will be permitted to go from the United States to Poland only if the German and Austrian governments prohibit the export of all foodstuffs from Russian Poland; if a guarantee be given that the native <pb facs="5423968_4_0725.jpg" n="3"/>stocks of food will not be drawn on for the maintenance of the occupying arries; if the German and Austrian governments will undertake to supply and adequate action and other necessary articles, and if the American commission be given a froe hand in the distribution of supphies.</p>
   <p>It certainly is right to do and that Gany and Austria, which have exported foodstuffs from Poland, give guarantees that country shall not be strioped further; but what Sir and Grey way mean by stipulating that the Germans shall furnish and adequate rati<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>n is almost inconceivable that he means that, as a condition precedent to permitting relief from the United States to reach the Poles, the Germans must also contribute to their aid from a store which the British. hope so to diminish by blockade, that hunger will be known in every German commaunity.</p>
   <p>That Machiavellian cruelty would agree with the popular German estimate <pb facs="5423968_4_0726.jpg" n="4"/>of Sir Edward Grey's character but not with ours. However, whether ambigous or explicit, these are the conditions under which eager rescuer in American may help a starving people, and except under those conditions that help may not be giver.</p>
   <p>This <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> war revealed in all its horror. Germany took food out of Poland; the British will not allow the Americans to replace it. Military necessity is a Moloch. It sacrificed Belgium; it sacrifices Poland. It will now doom to starvation innocents in France, in Serbia, in Belgium, in Poland, even as they were sacrificed in walled cities when Assyrians or Tartars waited for emaciated victims to choose between the sword and the final tortures of hunger.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0727.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The horror may be embellished with rhetoric, but it cannot hide behind sentiment any longer. The war is being so prosecuted by the participants in it that people caught in its whirl are dying like animals, unable even to get bark from the trees or roots from under the ground in order to stave off starvation.</p>
   <p>They could be rescued, but military necessity will not allow them to be. As for Poland, whose sons must fight each other and whose children may starve, Paderewski said in poignant sorrow, "Poland fell because it had no army to keep the enemy from its borders."</p>
   <p>A nation is defended by the power of its citizens, not by the humanitarianism of its neighbors. There is no humaneness in war. A small nation finds no help save as its welfare meets the interests of the great nations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0728.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The great nations of Europe are fighting for themselves, for the retention of what power they have, for the extension of that power.</p>
   <p>The illusion that these nations are fightin<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> for humanity is being dispelled by every starving Polish child.</p>
