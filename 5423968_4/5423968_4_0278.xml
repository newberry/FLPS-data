   <p>Chicago gave proof yesterday that the Polish Army question is not being neglected here. More than a hundred and sixty volunteers to the Polish Army departed yesterday for the training camp at Niagara-on-the-Lake. Despite the fact that it is such a small group, the enthusiasm of these men will make up for several hundred who join the army under compulsion. Every one of them goes with the vow on his lips to avenge himself on the Germans for the wrongs done our country for hundreds of years, on an enemy who is not only an enemy of Poland but of everything that is not German, an enemy of the whole world.</p>
   <p>At Center II</p>
   <p>The volunteers from every community gathered at the offices of Recruiting Center II, whither they were led by their local citizens' committees. The <pb facs="5423968_4_0279.jpg" n="2"/>group from Hawthorne was most numerous, as usual. They arrived at the gathering place with their citizens' committee and friends in eighteen automobiles.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: List of members of Hawthorne (Cicero) Citizens' Committee has been omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>There were also several recruits from Milwaukee, towns in Nebraska, and other places. As usual, a great throng of people gathered in front of the recruiting station to give the volunteers a send-off.</p>
   <p>Ceremony in Church</p>
   <p>After the roll was called and a photograph taken, the procession started. The American flag was carried by Miss Stephanie Bauer, appropriately dressed, the French flag by Miss Valentina Gralek in French costume, and the Polish flag by Miss Constance A. Swiatkowski, in Polish costume. The procession marched to St. Josephat's Church with the Kipkowski Brothers' Band at the head.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0280.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Solemn High Mass was celebrated in church by the local pastor, Reverend Francis Ostrowski, assisted by the Reverends Joseph Schenke and Francis Tyrcha. The sermon, delivered by the Reverend Tyrcha, was so heartfelt that it brought tears to many eyes. It is unfortunate that we cannot give the sermon in its entirety. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the Reverend Ostrowski distributed medallions among the volunteers, at the same time giving them his benediction. While medallions were being distributed, the Kipkowski Brothers' Band played "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland).</p>
   <p>Farewell Banquet at Parish Hall</p>
   <p>From church, the procession marched to the parish hall, where a generous banquet awaited the volunteers and invited guests. The main table was occupied by the Reverends Ostrowski, Schenke, and Tyrcha, representatives of the press, and guests. Since so many volunteers had not been expected, there were not enough places for all of the guests and many of them had to wait until places were vacant. Before the banquet began, Reverend Ostrowski said a prayer, after which <pb facs="5423968_4_0281.jpg" n="4"/>the company ate heartily of the food prepared by the women of the local parish.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the banquet, Father Ostrowski delivered a short, sincere address in which he bade farewell to the volunteers in behalf of the clergy and parish of St. Josephat. Before the Company arose from the tables, he said another prayer. The Kipkowski Brothers' Band played throughout the course of the banquet.</p>
   <p>Parade in Loop</p>
   <p>After the banquet was over, the volunteers formed ranks to receive their expense money from Recruiting Officer A. Wolski, and the lunches that were prepared by the women of the parish. The procession then moved to the streetcars that were chartered for this occasion. To the music of the band and the cheers of the surrounding throng, they left for the Loop, where they again formed ranks for a parade through the principal streets to the railroad station in Dearborn Street. At 4:40 P. M., the volunteers boarded the train, and amid cheers, tears, and farewells, to the strains of band music, they left for Niagara-on-the-lake; from <pb facs="5423968_4_0282.jpg" n="5"/>where, after adequate training, they will go to France to join the Polish Army.....to avenge themselves upon the Germans for wrongs done to Poland for hundreds of years. It should be added here that the veterans of the Spanish-American War, John Szukala and Z. Wisniewski, participated in the parade as standard-bearers.</p>
   <p>During the parade through the Loop, American spectators saw by the posters that these were volunteers leaving for the training camp and they cheered for our boys and for the Polish Army. Great enthusiasm could be seen among the Americans who, upon finding out that these were volunteers, had not words enough to praise the Poles. Among the many Americans present at the railroad station was Carl Bronson, representative of the Los Angeles Evening Herald, who was actually unable to express the effect this farewell had upon him. He was most impressed by the volunteers who, as he said, are real patriots and are going to fight because they understand the significance of the present war and the duty of every man. As the train started, Bronson shook hands with many of the volunteers, wishing them victory and most of all, to "get the Kaiser". In his conversation <pb facs="5423968_4_0283.jpg" n="6"/>with W. Grabowski, representative of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, Bronson said that he had heard very much about the farewells given Polish volunteers in Chicago, and that the reason why he had come to Chicago was to be present at so significant a moment. His impressions on this occasion, he said, would be useful to him in the history he is going to write. Our volunteers made such an impression on him that he could not find words enough to praise them or to describe the effect.</p>
   <p>During the farewells, there were both despairing and pleasant moments. Among those present, we saw Mrs. Rozycki, wife of W. Rozycki, organizer for Center II, bidding good-by to her son. Young Rozycki, who is just barely eighteen, seeing the tears of his mother, who feared that she might never see him again, tried to cheer her up by smiling. There should be more such boys, for although their mothers are dear to them, their homeland should be dearer. A certain Anthony Klonowski, who lives at 2147 West 18th Street, said to his son with tears in his eyes "Good-by, my son, I am proud to see you leave as a volunteer to the Polish Army. I am not weeping for sorrow, but for joy that I raised such a son who will go to fight the Germans." We also noticed Mrs. Karwinski, of 2301 <pb facs="5423968_4_0284.jpg" n="7"/>West 22nd Street, and Mrs. Dabrowski, also of 22nd Street, who like many other mothers, sisters, and fiancees, had come to the station to embrace, perhaps for the last time, a dearest one who was leaving to fight against the base Prussians.</p>
   <p>It is well nigh impossible to describe the last moments of farewell. There was no lack of kisses, embraces, and mutual good wishes, but there was also no lack of tears even though the volunteers sought to cheer up those whom they were leaving behind by assuring them that they would return as victors, so that we might all go back to a free and independent Poland.</p>
   <p>May it be soon!</p>
