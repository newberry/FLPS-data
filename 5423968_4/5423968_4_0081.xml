   <p>The Chicago newspapers published a report that State Treasurer John F. Smulski, has returned to the State treasury $153,158.44; the accrued interest on money entrusted to his care for the past twenty-one months.</p>
   <p>It was the custom of former treasurers to pocket such sums, thereby depriving the State of this profit. The example demonstrates that an elected official can remain honest, even in public office. Governor Deneen, a personal friend of Mr. Smulski, has cleansed the State Department of greedy and cheating politicians, replacing them with efficient and conscientious men.</p>
   <p>The corruption practised by these former state officials, who divided the public funds among themselves, is not surprising. The money, however, has now been returned to the treasury. The Administration is grateful for its selection of honest men; and the gigantic vote given them at each election is a substantial proof of their integrity.</p>
