   <p>Anton Czarnecki is to leave for Europe in a few days where he will act as foreign correspondent of the Chicago Daily News.</p>
   <p>Mr. Czarnecki, who until recently has been the election commissioner, will become a member of the editorial department of the Chicago Daily News and the Associated Press. His knowledge of the Polish language will help a great deal in his work, because, though he is assigned to cover the war news on all fronts, he has instructions to give special attention to the occurrences of the day on the Polish front. Mr. Czarnecki, furnished with credentials of a newspaperman, is leaving for Washington to secure letters of introduction and identification issued by the Department of State, which are necessary and important to one who undertakes the very dangerous task of traveling in Europe during the time of war. Mr. Czarnecki will sail on Saturday, Nov. 27, from Hoboken, N. J., aboard the steamship "Ryndom" of the Holland American Line, sailing for Amsterdam.</p>
