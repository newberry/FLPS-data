   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Mr. Bernard Matz, the well-known Polish attorney, whose offices are located at 1135 West Chicago Avenue, was recently honored by Mr. Crowder, the assistant attorney general. Mr. Matz was made legal adviser of the draft exemption board. He will decide upon all doubtful legal questions which may arise in the interpretation of the new draft enactment. This distinction accorded a Polish barrister gratifies us exceedingly, since it gives public recognition to Mr. Matz's long and conscientious work in the legal profession.</p>
   <p>Mr. Matz is also a member of the military executive board in Mr. Max Kaczmarek's office, which is also located at 1135 West Chicago Avenue, and is an expert in that department of law. All doubtful questions in the answering or the draft questionnaires may be clarified either, by appearing personally before Mr. Matz at his place of business or by correspondence with him.</p>
