   <p>Our duties to this country are not limited to a single act of patriotism but include continous service the year around until the end of the war. The mere purchase of a Liberty bond does not close our whole series of duties, even after every last cent has been placed in Liberty bonds. We should aid the government in winning this war even to the extent of all our future earnings and all our future savings.</p>
   <p>The Liberty bond campaign will soon come to an end. There is no doubt that the Loan will be oversubscribed. But the government will continue to need more and more money, which it is trying to raise through the sale of war savings stamps.</p>
   <p>It is the desire of the government to sell these stamps regularly, every day <pb facs="5423968_4_0290.jpg" n="2"/>and every week of the year, for a regular, uninterrupted flow of money will prevent disturbance in financial conditions. Money for this purpose must come from present earnings, not from accumulated savings.</p>
   <p>For the above reasons, the government expects every man, woman, and child to obligate himself to save a small sum every week for the purchase of these stamps. The sum can be small, or it can be large, depending upon individual earnings, but it must be regular. It must be an actual sacrifice, a self-abnegation for the benefit of our country. If the people of America are not willing to sacrifice, but are merely willing to lend their surpluses, how can they expect victory of the American armed forces? And how will the war be financed after the surpluses are gone?</p>
   <p>Below a few suggestions are made, some of which have already been used with good results in increasing the purchase of war savings stamps.</p>
