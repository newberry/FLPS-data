   <p>The supporters of the New Tariff Act claim the following advantages:</p>
   <p>"It permits the reduction of customs duties to such countries as are ready for reciprocal concessions; it permits the importation of sugar from Hawaii, whereas sugar from other countries will be subject to duties; duties on soft wood have been reduced from two to one dollar; wool and hides, free of duty, are subject to taxation; it prevents the smuggling of material by rich tourists; playing cards will pay duties at the rate of twenty cents a pack; duties are imposed on the importation of Bibles; the antitrust order of Wilson will remain intact; it imposes a duty on cotton, therefore the plantations of the South will not pay a tax for hoops and cotton for packing, nor the farmer of the North for the sacks for grain; no additional duties have been imposed on tea or beer, however, the one on coal has been <pb facs="5423968_4_1025.jpg" n="2"/>in the interest of the miners; the duties have been so marked that they will enable the American miner to earn more."</p>
   <p>What is going to result from the last point remains to be seen. If the pay of the workers is going to increase, the Republicans will say that it is their doing. If the workers will earn less than at present, it will be the fault of competition between the manufacturers and bad times.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the New Tariff Act, revenues of the National Treasury will be increased by $250,000,000 annually.</p>
