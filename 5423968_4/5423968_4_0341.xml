   <p>St. Casimir's Parish is no longer to be listed among the "slacker" communities, but among those that are working for the Polish cause, desiring to help as much as possible in every way it can. In truth, St. Casimir's Parish is somewhat late in beginning this work because of certain misunderstandings, but at present all differences are settled, and knowing the capability of the people of that community we are convinced that they will make up for the delay by working twice as hard.</p>
   <p>On the initiative of the Reverend Albert Furman, pastor, and the more prominent citizens of this community, a meeting of parishioners was held with the purpose of organizing a Citizens' Committee. The Reverend Furman presided. In opening the meeting, he presented the reasons for holding it and explained that he would co-operate heartily in the good cause; as proof of his good-will, Father Furman <pb facs="5423968_4_0342.jpg" n="2"/>donated a hundred dollars to the Polish Army Fund. A lively discussion then arose, in which there was no enmity. After discussing the question of a national [Polish] tax as well as Polish Army matters, a citizens' committee was named, consisting of the Reverend Furman as honorary president; Mr. Sliwa as active president; Mr. Tenerowicz, vice-president; Mr. Opiela, financial secretary; Mr. Drzewicki, recording secretary; and Mr. Pijanowski, treasurer. All contributions should be sent to Mr. Pijanowski, whose address is 2242 Marshall Boulevard.</p>
   <p>All those present immediately taxed themselves to the sum of two dollars, five dollars and more per month, according to their individual means. A tax was decided on for all the members of St. Casimir's Parish, and twenty collectors were chosen to collect this tax from house to house once a month. The Citizens' Committee will aid the Polish Army by establishing a recruiting station for this community.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0343.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And so, thanks to the mutual understanding and especially to the general spirit of co-operation, St. Casimri's Parish is quickly getting down to work. We hope that, to the shame of the few remaining "slacker" communities in Chicago, it will become a leader in the work for Poland and its army.</p>
