   <p>Today is election day in Germany. The elections will decide a very important question, namely: Will Germany, and with it, all the other powers of Europe, continue to develop militaristically, or has the time for a change arrived? The question whether there will be peace or war in Europe rests entirely with Germany.</p>
   <p>Naturally enough, if Germany decides to reinforce its army, other nations, willing or not, will want to follow suit. What will follow? It is difficult to foresee with accuracy. It is certain that a European war would be a lesser evil than a whole series of revolutions of the people against governments that are heaping unheard-of burdens upon them as the price of militarism.</p>
   <p>And these burdens are indeed enormous. A well-known political journalist, <pb facs="5423968_4_0897.jpg" n="2"/>who writes under the pseudonym of Jacques St. Cere, has prepared a very interesting table showing the growth of European armies from the year 1869 to 1892. According to this table, European armies at full war strength in these years would be as follows: [Table omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>As we can see from the table, Europe had a total of 6,598,000 soldiers twenty-three years ago. Today it has more than three times as many--22,248,000. Such rapid growth in so short a time is astounding. Just as eloquent is the table which shows expenditures of nations for military purposes over the same period of time. [Table omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>The above table shows that the European nations spent 2228 million francs (443 million dollars) for military purposes in 1869, while in 1892, the same nations spent a total of 4069 million francs (813 million dollars) or twice as much--and this was not enough for some.</p>
   <p>Such a state of affairs cannot exist for long. The burden of taxes carried by the subjects of these governments is enormous; it cannot be increased <pb facs="5423968_4_0898.jpg" n="3"/>indefinitely, although each government seems to be engaged in an indefinite increase of its armies. Is there a way out? The only rational escape would be a general disarmament; which the Pope, with his usual sagacity, suggests. But the great powers have no intentions of disarming, and the smaller nations must keep their forces on a wartime footing for their own safety. In such a condition, there remains nothing to be done, perhaps, except a cutting of the overstrained strings with the sword. Such will be the consequences as shown by the figures given above, in spite of all assurances of peace by the statesmen. It is also a result of the growth of German militarism, the fate of which will be decided in today's elections.</p>
