   <p>A meeting of the Polish Social Workers Club was held on January 3, 1915 at the School of Civics and Philanthropy, 116 South Michigan Avenue. Election of officers and discussion of plans in connection with the Polish Day to be held at the Exposition of Health and Sanitation in the Chicago City Club were the order of the Day.</p>
   <p>The newly elected administration is composed of Miss E. Napieralska, president; Mr. T. Szmergalski, vice-president; Mr. F. D. Oglozinski, recording secretary; Mr. J. Jokaitis, financial secretary; and Mr. J. Skibinski, treasurer. S. Napieralski, E. Skorupa, and T. Sleszynski form the executive committee which completes the administration.</p>
   <p>The program committee is composed of Miss M. Paszkiewicz, Mrs. K. Janicki, Mrs. Josephine Franciszczak, Mrs. Wanda Dombrowski, and Mr. Thaddeus Sleszynski. This committee has been assigned the task of making arrangements for the <pb facs="5423968_4_1334.jpg" n="2"/>forthcoming Polish Day.</p>
   <p>By means of lectures, the Exposition of Health and Sanitation shows the efforts exerted by the Infant Welfare Society to reduce infant mortality and what the anti-tuberculosis movement has accomplished in its war against the white plague. Other topics discussed are the manner in which school hygiene reacts upon the future citizen; food inspection and how it protects everyone against spoiled, unclean, and adulterated food; the crusade against the sale of patent medicines and what it has accomplished; how to obtain sanitary conditions in a locality; and how the Public Health Department guards the city's health.</p>
   <p>Polish Day will be held on January 3, 1915, from 2:30 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. Dinner will be served at 6:30 P.M. to guests and members of the Club. After the dinner, there will be interesting speeches and discussions on the topic of hygiene and how to better health conditions in Polish localities.</p>
   <p>In order that Poles may attend in large numbers, the Club has sent out some <pb facs="5423968_4_1335.jpg" n="3"/>three hundred and fifty invitations. The Club apologizes if it has unwittingly omitted someone, and it hereby wishes to take this opportunity to extend its invitation to all those wishing to come to the Exposition. This Exposition is well worth a visit and admission is free. The cost of the dinner will be seventy-five cents per person. Please remember Polish Day on January 13 in the Chicago City Club, 315 Plymouth Court, near Jackson Boulevard.</p>
   <p>Miss E. Napieralski, president</p>
   <p>Mr. F. D. Oglozinski, recording secretary</p>
