   <p>A law, forbidding women employed in the factories, stores, offices, and also those engaged in agriculture as domestics, to work longer than ten hours a day was passed by the Illinois State Legislature. Indeed, this is a just law, because, up until this time, some women were forced to work fifteen hours a day for a very small renumeration. The new law has made women happy, but on the other hand it created a storm, which descended on the heads of the poor, innocent husbands. There are wives who sit in the rocking chair all day, attend all kinds of meetings or go out for walks, and yet, they demand a ten hour working day for slaving wives and mothers.</p>
   <p>Such ideas could originate only in the heads of idle women, who have time to talk about imaginary injustices. A practical woman, faithful wife, good mother, loving her home, will not have such claims, for a house is her kingdom, a little world which she governs. A man marrying a woman <pb facs="5423968_4_0971.jpg" n="2"/>assumes the responsibility of supporting her and the children which may come. He works hard in the factory in order to supply his family with the necessaries of life, sometimes denying himself many things. Honest husbands do that and their wives should not agitate for short hours, for a wife is not a servant or a slave of her husband by his companion and partner, with whom she is obliged to share his fate.</p>
   <p>A wife and a mother, as a mistress of the house, can not be compared with a shop-girl or a department-store girl, who is a slave of her boss and must work hard so many hours for starvation wages. The mistress of the house performs her duties with song on her lips; she cooks, washes and cleans the house, is her own boss and takes a rest whenever she feels that it is necessary. She does not wait for the whistle; she regulates her own hours.</p>
