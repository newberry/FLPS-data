   <p>A woman's duty is to make a happy home; and her work is the golden thread from which a happy family life is woven. Can every woman produce a fabric which will not tear in her hands like a cobweb? It is very essential that our women fit themselves for social life. They should be able to conduct their affairs energetically and systematically; but with poise; they should be patient and persevering; they should be conscious of the dignity becoming human beings; and of their rights and duties as women, wives, mothers and citizens. Their humble duties should not obscure the horizon of their activities, and their work should not be performed solely for personal gains.</p>
   <p>A woman who finds herself in difficult circumstances should stretch her imagination high and wide; she should try to embrace in her mind such important matters with which humanity is confronted. Let her visualize the difference between progress, and education and the happy future of our young generation here in America and that in Poland. A woman who in her younger days received a practical education may go through life with confidence. To be a man's companion, and the mother of his children, a women must be his equal; she needs, therefore, to be enlightened in the duties required or she will not be able to fill that high position of home - maker and mother.</p>
