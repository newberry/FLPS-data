<title level="a">IMPORTANT BILL BEFORE CONGRESS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Government Committee on Labor Problems introduced this week before Congress a very important bill relating to the labor cause. This Federal bill determines the amounts to be paid to workers for injuries received while at work.</p>
   <p>This bill states that every employer, without exception, is responsible for the death or disablement of any one of his employees; that it is his duty, in addition to providing medical care for those who are injured and paying the burial expenses of those who are killed, to pay a compensation, based on the earnings of the worker, to those incapable of further work as a result of an accident in a factory, a mine, a railroad, or any other place of employment. In case a worker is killed while at work the compensation should be paid to his widow and orphans, or other heirs.</p>
   <p>When, for instance, a worker loses a leg, an arm, or an eye, he is to receive half of his yearly earnings, but this compensation may be increased to cover his earnings for thirty or even seventy-two months, according to what the courts <pb facs="5423968_4_1346.jpg" n="2"/>may decide. Compensation is to be paid in monthly installments. When a worker is killed while at work, his legal heirs receive this compensation. This does not prevent, however, the suing of a particular firm for damages if, through its fault, a worker is injured or killed.</p>
   <p>This bill is designed to protect the worker and his family from poverty in the event the provider of the family meets with an accident while at work. Up to the present, in many cases, when a worker was disabled in a factory or a mine, his employer refused not only to pay any compensation but even to provide medical care. As a result, complete destitution was the lot of the victim of the capitalistic moloch. Even in cases where workers were disabled for life, the employers did not pay compensation.</p>
   <p>The rights of workers differ in different states. In some states it is mandatory for the employer to pay compensation to the injured worker and to provide medical care. But in the majority of the states such a law does not exist, and as a result, the laborer is deprived of all care and is forced, along with his family, <pb facs="5423968_4_1347.jpg" n="3"/>to beg for public charity.</p>
   <p>The Federal Government has come to the conclusion that this injustice to the workers cannot exist any longer and demands a Federal law, applicable in all the states, which will protect the workers against absolute poverty in the event that they should become the victims of misfortune while at work.</p>
   <p>Although this bill, even if it is passed by Congress, would not solve the problem of determining the amount of compensation to which a laborer injured while at work is entitled or, in the case of fatal accidents, the compensation to which his heirs are entitled, it would at any rate be the first step toward other appropriate protective laws for the care and protection of the knights of labor.</p>
   <p>When the employers are forced to pay for medical care, funeral expenses, and compensation, they will surely try to protect themselves by adopting safety measures and equipping their plants with devices to protect the workers from accidents. At present, the owners of factories, railroads, and mines pay little <pb facs="5423968_4_1348.jpg" n="4"/>attention to the need of equipping their plants with safety devices because they are not threatened by financial losses when a worker receives an injury or is killed. Nor are they very much afraid of compensation suits, since, having at their beck and call good lawyers and obliging courts, they rarely lose a case and thus rarely have to pay compensation. Usually the courts decree that the accident was the result of the worker's own negligence. But once the Federal Government gets after the employers and makes them pay compensation to the workers for every accident, the employers themselves will see to it that these accidents occur as infrequently as possible.</p>
   <p>It is to be desired, then, that all our larger Polish organizations exert pressure on the Congressmen from their districts so that the latter may energetically support this bill, the passage of which is of so great importance to us. This measure will benefit the Poles especially, inasmuch as the large majority of them are workers employed in the most dangerous occupations and places; hundreds of them are killed yearly or become cripples, condemned with their families to begging and poverty.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_1349.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Organizations of other nationalities and influential individuals are already working on their congressmen, asking them to push this bill through as quickly as possible. We Poles should not lag behind, since this is a matter which concerns our own welfare and human welfare in general.</p>
   <p>This bill has not yet come up for discussion, and it is not known when it will be deliberated upon, but we must agitate for it in advance, so that this very important labor measure is not indefinitely postponed. We expect our countrymen to take steps in this direction, because this is a matter concerning hundreds of thousands of our brother laborers.</p>
