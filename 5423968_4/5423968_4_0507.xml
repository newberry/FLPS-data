   <p>The Poles of Chicago celebrated a great occasion yesterday, a great triumph. Not only did we have the honor of receiving the Franco-Polish military mission, but we were witnesses of the homage paid to our national hero, Thaddeus Kosciusko, by the great Republic of France.</p>
   <p>As we had foreseen, thousands of people participated in this great event; thousands marched to Humboldt Park, to the monument of the hero of two worlds, that they might hear the words of the delegates of the Polish army in France, who have come to call us to arms and, as Lieutenant Gasiorowski said in his address, to bring us "a breeze from the fields of Poland," and hear the assurances of the French government as to the Polish cause and the future of our homeland.</p>
   <p>Even in the morning a great stir could be noticed in Polish neighborhoods. Buildings on the streets through which the parade was scheduled to pass were <pb facs="5423968_4_0508.jpg" n="2"/>decorated with American, French, and Polish flags, and small groups of people stood on the sidewalks, as if to assure themselves of a good place from which to view the parade and see the distinguished visitors.</p>
   <p>Punctually at nine o'clock in the morning, the administrations of all the participating Polish organizations gathered in front of St. Stanislaus High School, where the parade was formed which was to take the Polish visitors from France to St. Stanislaus Kostka Church for mass.</p>
   <p>The visitors, Lieutenant Waclaw Gasiorowski, Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski, descendent of a great Polish family, Sergeants Mazurek, Zechiecki, and Szaniawski, and (in civilian clothes) Stefan Rejer, organizer of Polish coal miners, first in Westphalia and later in northern France, accompanied by the members of the citizens' committee--M. Perlowski, president, Dr. Statkiewicz, secretary, and John Wedda, treasurer--soon arrived.</p>
   <p>At 9:15 the parade started for St. Stanislaus Kostka Church on Noble Street, led <pb facs="5423968_4_0509.jpg" n="3"/>by a platoon of Falcons and members of the Association of Military Societies. The church was filled to capacity, as could have been foreseen.</p>
   <p>Mass was celebrated by the Reverend Debinski, pastor of the church, and the sermon was delivered by the Reverend Rector W. Zapala.</p>
   <p>"Lord, return to us the freedom of our homeland," he began.</p>
   <p>Then he proceeded to describe how, a hundred years ago, one of the great heroes of our nation died, friendless and without a hand to help him. But that death, as the death of our nation, was death only in a political sense. "A great treasure remained within us, the great spirit, the Polish spirit that urges us to continue the struggle.....</p>
   <p>"Today we are greeting those who followed the call of their hearts and consciences and enlisted in the Polish Army. They have come to us from those who speak the same language, who are of the same faith as we. They have come to give us strength <pb facs="5423968_4_0510.jpg" n="4"/>and to urge us to continued effort."</p>
   <p>In continuing his sermon, the rector mentioned some of our great heroes such as Semenenko and Kajsiewicz, who lived and worked for Poland in France. Then, in the following words, he greeted the visitors from France:</p>
   <p>"We welcome the Polish Army here on this free soil, where we are permitted to pray in our churches in Polish, where we are permitted to speak in Polish, where our national growth is not impeded."</p>
   <p>The rector then gave a resume of the history of the Polish element in America, showing its development from the old times when, more than fifty years ago,the first Polish immigrants came to Texas, up to our present state of moral, spiritual, and material level.</p>
   <p>"Poland has always carried high the torch of enlightenment," he said, "and thanks to that force which we call 'spirit,' we are tearing off our chains today.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0511.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Grant us, O Lord, that we might live to see Poland free and independent. Let us turn our eyes to God and pray that we may see the moment for which our forefathers fought a hundred years ago.</p>
   <p>"Return to us the freedom of our homeland, O Lord!"</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the church services, the visitors were taken to the Washington monument in Washington Park. It should be mentioned here that the Polish delegation was joined in church by the official delegates of the French government, headed by Henry Franklin Bouillon. In addition to these, the French Consul-general, representatives of the French element in Chicago, and the editor of the Franco-American, M. Vertefeuille, attended the ceremony.</p>
   <p>The long procession of automobiles, escorted by motorcycle police, moved through the Polish neighborhood, then through the Loop to Michigan Avenue, through boulevards and parks, to stop at the monument of the great American hero, George Washington. There were about a hundred automobiles, and all were decorated with <pb facs="5423968_4_0512.jpg" n="6"/>American, Polish, and French flags.</p>
   <p>The ceremony at the monument of Washington was short. The French representative, Bouillon, placed a wreath upon the monument in behalf of France, and Lieutenant Gasiorowski did likewise in behalf of the Polish people. The platoon of Polish military society members and Falcons then fired a three-salvo salute. Both representatives--Bouillon and Gasiorowski--gave short addresses, explaining the reasons for laying wreaths upon the monument; following this, the procession returned to Polish Press Club, where lunch was served for the visitors from Europe, invited guests, and representatives of organizations. About thirty people were present, and during the course of the meal the conversation turned upon matters of a general nature and upon the present war and its probable consequences.</p>
   <p>Parade to Kosciusko Monument</p>
   <p>The principal ceremony, naturally, was the parade to the monument of Thaddeus Kosciusko. Punctually at 1:30 in the afternoon, participating organizations <pb facs="5423968_4_0513.jpg" n="7"/>and societies began to gather in front of the Polish National Alliance building and the immediate vicinity. We shall not enumerate the organizations and societies that participated. Suffice it to say that none was lacking. Under the capable direction of Marshal Kaszubowski, the procession was quickly formed, with the distinguished visitors from Europe and the representatives of Polish and French organizations at the head. Among the Frenchmen, we noticed Alphonse Campion, president of the French Welfare Society, Alphonse Bourdon, vice-president of the French Mutual Aid Association, Alfred Thiuierge, member and organizer of that organization, Editor Vertefeuille, and many others. During the course of the parade, members of the Women's Division of the Polish National Alliance, headed by Mrs. Mary Sakowski, member of the board of directors, took up a collection for Polish prisoners, distributing tags to those who contributed. Contributions poured in from all sides. At about 2:30, the parade started to move to the tunes of Przybylski's, Zalesk's and Nest 192, Polish Falcons' Alliance orchestras. An innumerable throng of people followed the parade. A large crowd went out on Division Street to see this rebirth of Polish spirit, this procession to the feet of our great national hero who fought for <pb facs="5423968_4_0514.jpg" n="8"/>freedom and the rights of nations, immortalizing the Polish name. The parade moved down Division Street to California Avenue, California Avenue to North Avenue, and North Avenue to the monument.</p>
   <p>Despite the rain that fell continuously throughout the afternoon, an estimated crowd of about ten thousand people participated. After the places on the platform were taken by the French and Polish visitors and by representatives of organizations and other guests, and the scouts and Falcons had formed their ranks surrounding the monument, a sea of heads could be seen around the platform as far as the eye could reach; the throng was so great that it was feared that the police would not be able to cope with the multitude that tried to press as close as possible in order to see the distinguished visitors and hear what they had to say.</p>
   <p>The exercises at the monument were opened by Michael Perlowski, president of the Citizens' Committee, who called upon J. F. Smulski to preside, and John Wedda to act as secretary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0515.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>In a short address, Smulski introduced the first speaker, the official representative of the great Republic of France, Henry Franklin Bouillon, who was greeted by the audience with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>[Address by Bouillon omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of Bouillon's address, the crowd burst into a tremendous storm of applause. The address had a strong effect upon the audience, and deep emotion was plainly visible on many faces.</p>
   <p>Following the French delegate's address, the orchestra and the Philaret Choir rendered "The Star-Spangled Banner." The next speaker was the chairman, John F. Smulski, who spoke in English as follows:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Deputy!</p>
   <p>"I am very sorry that, having arrived here only an hour ago, I have not had time <pb facs="5423968_4_0516.jpg" n="10"/>to prepare an address worthy of so significant a moment and of the distinguished presence of the representative and delegate sent to us from our historic friend of the past and natural ally of the future--France.</p>
   <p>"We greet you, Mr. Deputy, with all the sincerity of which we are capable, with all the enthusiasm inherent to our nature, with all the respect due your person, with all our love, and with all the admiration that for centuries we have held for the great French nation.</p>
   <p>"We thoroughly appreciate and are grateful for this evidence of friendship and the promise of aid that will regain us our country. We are proud that we shall again have the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder with the valiant sons of France, America, and their allies (sic), for the freedom of mankind.</p>
   <p>"We earnestly desire to prove that the spirit of our heroic forefathers continues to live in our hearts, and that we are worthy of those who, years ago, fought beside the French, the Italians, and the Americans for the rights of man, <pb facs="5423968_4_0517.jpg" n="11"/>and who died in defense of their beloved Poland.</p>
   <p>"We welcome your friendship and your aid, and fully comprehend the great duty that falls upon our nation, that the most important step toward the rebirth of our nation must be made by our own people. From the will of our people must a strong and virile Poland arise, that it might be a worthy ally of the great democracies of the world and fulfil its duty in the rehabilitation of mankind, in the restoration of culture and civilization, the rebuilding of humanitarian institutions and principles of charity.</p>
   <p>"Our task is to organize that will of our nation, for it exists and has existed without interruption since the partition. We have accomplished much more in this direction than our friends realize.</p>
   <p>"Without a government of our own, this organizing work was of necessity exhausting and slow, for communication and maintenance of unity between four parts of the Polish nation were difficult. Yet our work progressed. As proof of our <pb facs="5423968_4_0518.jpg" n="12"/>organizing ability, I ask you, Mr. Deputy, to look around you and see the masses of Polish people who have come here to greet you. These are the people who form our organizations, who came here at practically an eleventh-hour notice; they have come to give proof that the organized will and the desire for the rebirth of our nation lives within us, and that no persecution, torture, suppression, or disaster can crush it so long as a Polish heart beats upon this earth.</p>
   <p>"There are no difficulties that we cannot overcome, there are no obstacles we cannot surmount in the creation of that organization that is to be instrumental, that is to promote the good of our cause and is to the advantage of our friends and natural allies.</p>
   <p>"Repeating my assurance of our deep appreciation of your presence here, and of our gratitude to France for its aid, allow me to add that we have loyally supplied our quota of men to the army of our great Republic [the United States]; we have given more than our share, for I believe that I will not be wrong <pb facs="5423968_4_0519.jpg" n="13"/>if I say that the Polish volunteers in the American army outnumber the [Polish] drafted men. Despite this, our organization will spare no effort in supporting the movement begun in France. It is my hope that that support will exceed even our own expectations.</p>
   <p>"Those of us who are American citizens have maintained an unswerving loyalty to our great republic. We have tried to give, and I believe we have given, immeasurable proofs of our loyalty and our willingness to sacrifice. But our ties with and our love for the land of our fathers make us give more than what is required of us, and it is in this that the unshakable will of our Polish nation is best expressed, the will to possess a free and independent country of our own. That will must be recognized by the nations of the world as well as the necessity to create a free and independent Poland, in order to preserve peace in Europe and in the world.</p>
   <p>"Long live President Wilson and the United States of America!</p>
   <p>"Long live valiant and victorious France!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0520.jpg" n="14"/>
   <p>"Long live free and independent Poland!"</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Prince Stanislaus Poniatowski, descendent of an illustrious family.</p>
   <p>[Address by Poniatowski omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>When he had finished his address, a storm of applause arose that continued for a long time. The Polish people, gathered at the monument of the hero of two worlds, saw in this able young Polish warrior the promise of a rebirth of the nation. The forcefulness of Poniatowski's words was electrifying. Tears could be seen in many eyes and it was as if some great, secret love for Poland eddied in waves above the sea of heads.</p>
   <p>The orchestra and the Philaret Choir next rendered the song "Wolna Polska" [Free Poland], following which the chairman called upon Lieutenant Gasiorowski to speak.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0521.jpg" n="15"/>
   <p>[Address by Gasiorowski omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>After the long-continuing applause had died down, the Philaret Choir sang "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland], following which the secretary read the telegram dispatched to President Poincare of France. The text of the telegram was as follows:</p>
   <p>"In behalf of the 400,000 (sic) Poles of Chicago, gathered before the monument of Thaddeus Kosciusko this ninth day of September, 1917, in the presence of Henry Franklin Bouillon, representative of the French Government and parliament, and the Polish army delegation from France, we wish to express our deepest appreciation and gratitude for that historical act of justice [to Poland] by France and the other allied powers.</p>
   <p>"Regarding the Polish army in France as the cornerstone on which will arise a <pb facs="5423968_4_0522.jpg" n="16"/>free and independent Poland, we reaffirm our readiness for any sacrifice that might be required of us.</p>
   <p>"Long live the brotherhood of arms and democratic ideals of the United States, the Republic of France, and resurrected Poland!</p>
   <p>"Your name, Mr. President, and the name of our President Wilson will be imprinted in letters of gold in the pages of Polish history.</p>
   <p>(signed)</p>
   <p>"John F. Smulski,</p>
   <p>"John Wedda."</p>
   <p>After the telegram had been read, Bouillon again arose and said in a loud voice: "Once more in the name of France, I thank you and assure you that we shall not lay down our arms until we have won freedom for all, until Poland is free!"</p>
   <p>Thunderous applause was the throng's answer, and there seemed no end to the <pb facs="5423968_4_0523.jpg" n="17"/>cheers for France. When the cheers had subsided, the chairman introduced the members of the Polish army delegation: Szaniawski, Rejer, Mazurek, and Zechiecki, and these brave soldiers, each of whom has seen active service in the war and been wounded, were received with enthusiastic applause by the throng, and with cheers for the Polish army.</p>
   <p>The exercises were concluded with the singing of "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" [Poland Is Not Yet Lost] and "Boze Cos Polske."</p>
   <p>It should be added here that Bouillon, the representative of France, and Gasiorowski each placed a wreath upon the monument of Kosciusko, the first in the name of France and the second in the name of the Polish Army in France. The wreaths bore the following inscriptions:</p>
   <p>"With your leader's blessing in the struggle for a free, united, and independent Poland," and "1776--Washington, Lafayette, Kosciusko. 1917--the United States, France, Poland."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0524.jpg" n="18"/>
