   <p>The French senator and first-rate journalist Henry Berenger reviewed the Allies' reply to Wilson's peace note and came to the conclusion that this proclamation should be favorably received everywhere, because "it is in accord with our aim. And this aim--whether it be called the aim of this war which we did not want, or of the peace which we are seeking--is the return of a permanent equilibrium to Europe."</p>
   <p>The return of territories to invaded countries, punishment for the crimes committed against them, and guarantees for the future--these are the aims of the Allies, who will defend their rights, which are at the same time the rights of the whole world, until complete victory is attained.</p>
   <p>The return of the property of others, not annexations; corrections of in justices, not new thefts; guarantees in place of tyranny--these are their aims.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_4_0665.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Alsace and Lorraine for France, Trident and Trieste for Italy; all Rumanians in one Rumania; Belgium and Serbia returned to life; Poland reconstructed; for Russia an outlet to the Mediterranean through Constantinople and the Dardanelles--these are the Allied aims.</p>
   <p>England, which entered the war only to defend the right, demands for herself only reparations for her expenses and the return of economic freedom to Europe.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the purpose of this war is not conquest by might, but the restoration of justice.</p>
   <p>How could President Wilson not acknowledge the moderation and justice of this reply, which he himself requested? The Allies remind him that it was not they who tore apart the peace of Europe, that they bear no responsibility for it, but that all the blame falls on Austro-Germany, and that one cannot just wash away international differences with a sponge which is still <pb facs="5423968_4_0666.jpg" n="3"/>saturated with the blood of invaded peoples, and have peace. The whole world, together with Mr. Wilson, now knows how the Allies understand peace. And this is to be a real peace, because it will bring freedom to every people by bringing independence to all nations.</p>
   <p>A peace of this sort must become popular in the trenches, because it will be a proud, clear peace, as intelligent as it is humane. It will be worthy of those who have already given their lives for it, as well as of those who are still fighting for it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Capus, in Figaro declares that the war aims of the Allies must be gained in their entirety, since otherwise the Germans will remain an eternal threat to Europe, which again on the slightest pretext can become the arena of a new mass murder.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Gabriel Marsac of L'Evenement cried in the name of the Allies: "We do not want to destroy any nation, we do not want to attack anyone's <pb facs="5423968_4_0667.jpg" n="4"/>liberty, but be free, we resurrect, we bring justice and life, not subjugation and death, to all nations"--Mr. Maurice de Waleffe in Paris Midi made the just remark that in the Allies note to Wilson a grave mistake was made. Since there are so many Poles in the Unites, the point of the reconstruction of Poland should have been given greater emphasis</p>
   <p>Many French publications look upon the question of the recanstruction of Poland in accordance with the rights her people as an obvious matter, since official declarations on the part of the Allies had previously been made.</p>
   <p>"The Allies war aims and peace cenditiong"--waid Mr. Painoille in Excelsior--"were already known to the world through the public and official statements of the heads of the Allied governments, who concealed nothing, and who had no need, as the German Chancellor Rethmann-Hollweg did, to cloak themselves in mystery and reservations. The expiation of all the crimes committed by Germany, all the compensations which justice demands, and which are necessary to the return of European equilibring, are specifically listed. From <pb facs="5423968_4_0668.jpg" n="5"/>Belgium up to Poland, there are included all the countries which have been annexed against the will of their people--this means also[that] Alsace-Lorraine has been named. Everything which calls for justice is included in the Allied war aims, that is, the liberation of all subjected peoples. This is how the new map of Europe will look."</p>
   <p>Mr. Herbette states in Echo de Paris that the Allies desire world peace as ardently as President Wilson does, and together with him would like to form new rules of international life, in order to prevent future wars. Experience, however, has taught them that rules alone guarantee nothing, that they can disappoint, and that force is necessary in order to insure respect for law and right.</p>
   <p>"Whoever wants to hasten the coming of the future peace and give it unbreakable strength, let him first make a study of the ways and means by which our enemies could be taught sense. The true morality of nations, like that <pb facs="5423968_4_0669.jpg" n="6"/>of individuals, is based on effort. Nothing can be gained without effort, even when one lives on the other side of the Atlantic. To announce to the Allies peace without victory, to offer them treaties without canctions, would be the equivalent of preparing for new attacks."</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Demais asserts in Libre Parole: "Nations which are attacked in a cynical manner by enemies who are greedy and unscrupulous cannot lay down their arms before attaining the aims which they have set for themselves. There is not a single citizen of the belligerent nations who has not understood this long ago. Surely no one could be found in the great American republic who does not share our convictions and who would not applaud this decision of ours."</p>
   <p>Gustav Herve in Victoire again reiterates these aims:</p>
   <p>"These, Mr. Wilson, are our peace terms! Would the American people possibly want Alsace-Lorraine to remain under the Prussian yoke, and <pb facs="5423968_4_0670.jpg" n="7"/>Trieste to remain under the Austrian yoke? Do they desire that the Rumanians continue to be held prisoner by the Hungarians? Would they wish the continued subjection of the Czechs? Are they opposed to the reconstruction of Poland? Are they particularly interested in having the Turks arrange massacres of Christians in Armenia every ten years: No, certainly not!</p>
   <p>"Surely, they agree that our cause is a sacred one, that we are conducting a war for liberation.</p>
   <p>"In that case why the delay, why do they not take up arms in order to help justice, civilization and humanity."</p>
   <p>We remind you of this appeal made recently to Uncle Sam, at a very critical time for the States. They are now deliberating in Washington on whether it might not finally be necessary to take up arms against the Germans.</p>
