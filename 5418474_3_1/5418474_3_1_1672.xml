   <p>The fact that Tilden received a majority of 2000 votes, does not make Chicago by far a Democratic city....</p>
   <p>Heinrich Heine said once in his written confessions: In the company of Hegelians I have herded swine , but became terribly tired of them. In the same sense the Chicago German Republicans express themselves! "With the Irish Democrats we herded swine and-have enough of it". When in the year 1873 the Sunday fanatics stormed against the habits and lifelong customs enjoyed by Chicago's German and American population, living in peace and harmony, the Germans became obsessed with the idea of a union with the Irish Democrats as a means of defense. The act of Carl Schurz was still fresh in their memory, when in 1872 he and his liberals tried to bring about reform by uniting with the Democratic party. This example the Germans were bound to imitate. But the results of that union with the exception of attaining the main purpose: The abolishment of the Sunday restrictions of liberty--were not as blissful as to give thought to prolong or renew this tie....</p>
