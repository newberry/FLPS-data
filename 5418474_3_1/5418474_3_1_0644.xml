   <p>The Anarchists in Chicago have recovered from the fright which the execution of Fischer and his helpers had caused among them; and again they are at their infamous task of inciting the masses against our social order.</p>
   <p>During Mayor Harrison's administration these scoundrels were left alone, and the result was the catastrophe at Haymarket. However, the present Mayor, Mr. Roche, attacks these brutes very energetically and refuses them permission to assemble. The whole band of anarchists in now howling about this and demand their rights which the American law, that law which they are trying to over-throw, extends to them. Hardly three years have passed since they committed the crime at Haymarket and now these mad bastards start all over again. These same anarchists, who are attempting to overthrow the law and destroy its followers, call upon this same law for support against the police.</p>
   <p>If the anarchists expected that the press of this country would sympathize with their crying appeal for freedom of speech and free assembly, they were bitterly disappointed. Aside from a few German newspapers, for the most part organs of the anarchists, and the Standard, the paper of the half-crazy Henry <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0645.jpg" n="2"/>George, none of the other newspapers published the complaint respective to the police ordinance, forbidding the anarchists to assemble. It was considered as an absurdity, because how can they appeal to a law, which they want to abolish?</p>
   <p>The anarchists, to judge them by their speeches and publications, want to abolish the state, marriage, religion, property rights, and the law by force, fire, and murder. Therefore, they are greater enemies to society and human institutions than the ordinary robbers and murderers, because they preach mass destruction and mass murder. How much more justifiable would be the demand of ordinary criminals, supported by freedom of speech and right of free assemblage, to call meetings, where they can counsel about new crimes to be committed, and encourage each other without disturbance from the police department.</p>
   <p>It is questionable if anarchists and similar criminals have any civil rights which should be recognized by society. We assert that they have none, since they take their stand outside the law and are aiming to overthrow the law and human society. They have no rights; not even the original human rights of personal protection and personal liberty. The anarchists should be proclaimed as outlaws, and treated as wild animals, that must be destroyed in order to <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0646.jpg" n="3"/>safeguard the peace and well-being of the entire population.</p>
