   <p>If the Republicans of Cook County, can show that they are as clever in nominating their candidates, as the Democrats, then they can, whatever the fate of Hayes and Tilden, in Cook County might be, look for victory in the election of Cook County officials.</p>
   <p>That a great majority of Germans in Cook county, is determined to vote for Tilden, is a certainty. But, that four fifths of the same Germans, are inclined to vote in the state and county election for Republican candidates, if it is at all made possible to them, is also a certainty.</p>
   <p>"If it is at all made possible to them" means: if the Republicans can put up such candidates, that the German can cast his vote for them, without losing his self respect. To expect him to vote for men, who confronted him in the election battles of the last three years in bitter, spiteful hostility would simply mean to renounce his help. Those Germans, who have in self defense opposed their American allies in 1873, desire a sincere reconciliation, but they would not be able to recognize the existence of the same spirit on the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1682.jpg" n="2"/>American side, if men were put up as candidates whose significance principally, consisted in the aeal, with wihich they have called the Germans bummers and scalawags.</p>
   <p>It is hardly necessary to say, that this remark aims primarily at one much mentioned candidate for the sheriff's office. That the nomination for this office should fall to an American nobody will complain, if it is not one of those, who in particular offended the Germans. Because in this case not only many Tilden- Republicans, but also quite a few Hayes-Republicans, would rather vote for Kern.</p>
