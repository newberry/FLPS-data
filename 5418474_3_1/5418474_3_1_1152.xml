   <p>The Grand Jury which yesterday ended its activity has not made itself the tool of the malicious venom of the wretched slanderers of the Tribune, Times and Evening Journal, as these had confidently expected. But neither has it had the courage to boldly state of what no doubt all its members must be convinced. It has heard numerous witnesses about the "uprising" of January 15, and cannot have gained any other conviction that the three papers are guilty, if not before the law, at least before the moral consciousness of every honorable man, of a common crime: of the crime of having invented, with a turpitude and shamelessness unexampled even in America, an uprising that severly affected the credit of the city.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances the Grand Jury would have done its duty only if it had pilloried before public opinion the perpetrators of the infamous calumiations, that described Chicago as the place of a "Prussian uprising" and of "Communistic violence...."</p>
