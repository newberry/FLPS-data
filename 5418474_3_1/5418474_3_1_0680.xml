   <p>We cannot deny that after the exciting turmoil of 1886 there came a lull in the class wars which was practically a stand still.</p>
   <p>To the same degree as the working class lost through despair and disorganization on account of not having had enough understanding of solidarity, so capital gained and grew in its strength, for the destruction of organized labor.</p>
   <p>The Tribune wrote yesterday with great satisfaction that "there is no more danger from anarchists" and that the demonstration in Sheffield on the 5th of this month was only a sign of sympathy for the families of the accused anarchists and nothing else.</p>
   <p>We never had it in mind to fool ourselves about the present situation, or to paint it redder than it is, but if the Tribune thinks itself able to pass over on an existing fact by lying about it, that paper is only making a laughing stock of itself in the eyes of thousands of working men who continue in their struggle against suppression and slavery.</p>
   <p>It is true that the tactics of the revolutionary movement have changed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0681.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Formerly it relied upon the sanctity of the constitution of the country. Ways and means were openly discussed for maintaining the liberal spirit of the founders of the Republic; today this can be done only indirectly.</p>
   <p>Whether this method will be less effective remains to be seen; all indications promise the contrary. The last occurrences in Chicago prove that two of the mightiest labor organizations of the city have united to work hand in hand.</p>
   <p>This union between the trades assembly and the Central Labor Union has far reaching implications.</p>
   <p>On November 11th Chicago will march and this time it will not be German organizations alone who will remind the world of that terrible crime of our century, but also the English speaking working men will be in line.</p>
