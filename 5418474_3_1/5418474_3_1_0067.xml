<title level="a">[THE BRICKLAYERS' UNION]</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The attendance of members of the bricklayers union at the laying yesterday of the corner stone foundation of their meeting hall was remarkably large.</p>
   <p>It is known that the present time the bricklayers union is managed by Irishmen only, who do all arranging, ordering and collecting and disposing of the funds of the Union.</p>
   <p>This is the reason that this union, in accord with other labor organizations being run in the same manner, had a separate Democratic side show while the majority of the city's working class celebrated Labor Day.</p>
   <p>During the laying of the foundation stone the German members of the organization were in a large number present.</p>
   <p>After hearing Congressman Mason's speech about the country of equality, fraternity and liberty, and that a working man has the same rights as President Cleveland and all that nonsense about the rights to organize, the German laborers left for home.</p>
   <p>Frank Lawler intended to make a similar speech but gave up after noticing that <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0068.jpg" n="2"/>the assembly was on the way to dissolving.</p>
   <p>The picnic was attended by only a few hundred people, mostly men with about 150 women and 75 children, and the place looked therefore rather bare.</p>
   <p>Americans, Germans and Norwegians were not to be noticed among the crowd; it was an entirely Irish affair.</p>
   <p>If Mason and Lawler take it upon themselves to represent the union and if the Irish part alone decided what the union is to do, and if they carelessly manage the funds and credits of the members, then the fault lies with the German members, as they are strong enough to prevent a thing like that.</p>
   <p>In order to do this the German faction would not only have to pay the dues imposed upon them by the Irish faction but also attend the meetings and participate in business and resolutions of the union which they have irresponsibly neglected lately.</p>
