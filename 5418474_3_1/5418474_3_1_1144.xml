   <p>The death of Karl Marx was a great loss for the International Workers' Association, and will be mourned by it; but the European aristocracy has no reason to rejoice. People are mortal, but not ideas; and even though Karl Marx was the real creator and leader of the union of all workers of all countries, still the same reasons for its continuance remain in existence, as before his death. One may think about the principles of Karl Marx, as to the sharing of all in capital and profits, what one likes, one still will understand that his ideas do not belong to him alone but are a product of European conditions. His merit consisted only in bringing these ideas into a system and in organizing their adherents. There can be no question that the working classes of all Europe, especially in the industrialized countries, find themselves in very depressed conditions and that they work ceaselessly and energetically to improve these conditions. The situation over there is quite different from that prevailing here in our great free republic. Here everybody who looks for work has not one, but hundreds of chances to make his living; and he is not bound at any particular place. A quite enormous field is open to him. Over there, however, the change from one profession to another, or from one locality to another causes interminable difficulties in spite of all liberal reforms.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1145.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Here all workers can unite without restriction, to defend their interests in word or print. The press is at their service, and the legislatures listen to their complaints. On the European continent, however, the associations and the press stand under strict control. Here bosses and workers are not so strictly divided, because the transition from the latter to the former is so much easier. An understanding in the common interest is there-fore more feasible than over there.</p>
   <p>The greater chasm (between the classes) in Europe explains the endeavor to close it (the chasm) by lawful or violent means and explains the creation of the International Workers' Association which proclaims the solidarity of interest among all workers of all nations. For the United States this association is interesting enough, but of little practical meaning. But for Europe it has all the more meaning, so much that this meaning is going to furnish at the next time the topic of the day to England as well as France and Germany. It is far from sure that in all, that the International will take the place in the foreground but it is certain that it will play a role in all the social movements that impend.</p>
