   <p>Held its regular agitation meeting at Saxonia House last night. After the conclusion of routine work comrade Herrmann gave a weekly report with a short sketch of the latest capitalistic violence, Mr. Heinemann followed as main speaker of the evening taking for his subject "Nourishment and the Human body" this lecture was followed with extra ordinary interest; it was the first time that our Socialists studied and agitated on a subject of this kind. ...</p>
   <p>It was based on the old principle that only in a healthy body can develop a healthy mind. Among the numerous conditions considered for a healthy body are; cleanliness, good fresh air, exercise, good clothes etc. Our health depends on the kind of nourishment we take. ...

The most natural nourishment is mother's milk. It contains carbon and nitrogen in a 2 to 1 proportion as proven by chemists. Nitrogen is a muscle builder while carbon produces fat, in other words heat of the body. Children depending on mother's milk only, suffer from cold which proves, that the proportion of 2 to 1 of carbon is not present in sufficiency. We find this component in larger quantities in cereals, vegetables and fruits...</p>
