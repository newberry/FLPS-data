   <p>The German communists of Chicago assembled together and solemnly declared that "the present crisis is the result of reckless production"; that unless something is done about it, these things must be and overcome us like a summer's cloud every few years "to the entire ruin of the working classes"; and the said classes, "by studying national economy, have concluded that similar emergencies can only be prevented by reducing the hours of labor." And whereas the German communists of Chicago, by studying national economy, and listening attentively to harangues by such profound economists as Karl Klings, have reached the conclusion that these propositions are undeniably true, therefore they resolve that they will go in with might and main for the eight-hour system "in all branches of business, public and private."</p>
   <p>We have smashed the machine with statutory sledge-hammers, and now our German workingmen propose to mend it by laying on the sledge-hammer still more violently. If they have their way it will not need a prophet nor the son of a prophet to predict the consequences.</p>
