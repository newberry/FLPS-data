   <p>If, as several English-American newspapers insist, the "good days" are here again, or if they arrive later: - One thing of importance among others, will be achieved, the slow scattering and the disruption of communistic activities imported from Germany.</p>
   <p>Those people, the "Seventy-Three'ers" as we might call them in reference to the year of the great crash through which the American soil was prepared for the communistic swindler's seed, find themselves almost in the same condition as the "Forty-Eighters" were twenty-nine years ago. Also, they came over here to America, their heads filled with world messianic dreams, they looked down, with profound contempt on "Yankeedom sunk in crude materialism," as the "Seventy-Three'ers" look down on the "infamous bourgeoisie."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1077.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Also they wanted to uproot everything that exists here. "I am by principle against everything in existence," was the cry of citizen Sorge, in Cleveland in 1864. At that time all questions concerning the form of government, out-weighed any social problem. They had just come from the Germany of 1848, where it was expected to find every happiness for the people in the issuance of paper constitutions, - and in addition, the social question had its firm representatives. Of course, at that time the gospel of St. Fernandi and St. Marci was not discovered. Instead we had the Old Testament with the sainted books of Volnay, Cabet, Fourier, Owen, etc. The communistic and socialistic doctrine, therein laid down, on which today's German socialism has been built up, found among the "Forty-Eighters" enthusiastic and reckless representatives. All of today's German periodicals in the country combined will have hardly as many subscribers as Franz Arnold's Republic der Arbeiter (Laborers Republic) had at that time. Since in 1853-54, the socialistic <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1078.jpg" n="3"/>movement rose to a daily German newspaper (edited very well) in New York, the Reform, in which Mr. G. Kellner proudly spoke the often quoted words: "We are dangerous," and ordered the entire bourgeoisie before the bar of the century. Also, practical experiments in communism were not missing. Long before Schulze-Delitzsch introduced his trades unionism, at the time when La Salle still was Countess Hatzfeld's serf (devotee), socialistic German laborers created in New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere, trade unions and consumers associations, in which, under careful avoidance of any contacts with the disgraceful bourgeoisie, profit was promised only to the laborer. The possibility of losses was ignored.</p>
   <p>As times began to get better, and again as the "Forty-Eighters" learned to realize that America is not Germany; that here the imperative fundamentals are missing on which, was built up the world-reform plan in Europe, the socialistic papers shrank in circulation, or were taken over by <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1079.jpg" n="4"/>individual business men of a more broad minded nature. The leaders of the movement improved themselves in the English language, and accepted suitable positions, while trying to introduce as much as possible, the "Forty-Eighters" ideas which could be adapted to American conditions in the most practical manner. That these attempts were not unsuccessful the history of the Republican Party will tell you which without the driving elements of New England Puritanism on one side and the German "Forty-Eighters," on the other side, hardly would have progressed to the abolition of slavery.</p>
   <p>As soon as American business life will rise from its death-like stagnation experienced during the last five years, there will appear, again, the assimilated capacity of the American commonwealth, which means the ability to absorb the apparently obstructive elements and make them its own. By the thousands then, the "Seventy-Three'ers" socialists will become bourgeois almost without noticing it. But those, who refuse to learn and forget, will without advancing the cause which they represent, only degrade themselves to cursing scoundrels like those among the "Forty-Eighters" under Karl Heinzen.</p>
