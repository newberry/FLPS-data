   <p>The Germania (Lutheran ): Our readers are conversant with the history of the last campaign therefore we need not tell them that the result of the election was brought about through the votes of the German Protestants, who to a man stepped in and stood up for personal liberty and the liberty of conscience. Many of them found it anything but easy to cut loose from their old party for this election. But they can say, that they did not leave the Republican party, but it was the latter, that drove the German Protestants over into the Democratic camp by upholding the Bennett-quack business. And while the German Protestants this time were against the Bennett law and for the Democratic party, they are- it may just as well be stated here- better Republicans, better citizens of the Republic than those, who supported the thoroughly un-republican and new-fashioned school Legislature. In the fight which was forced upon them in so shameful a manner, the German Protestants desire to see maintained the liberal ideas and doctrines, which form the pillars of our Republic. But this victory in the election of April 1 is also a most wonderful victory of Germandom over narrow-hearted nativism. And that Germandom went into this fight tolerably well united may be partly ascribed to the attacks made for several month past by the English press of our city against it.</p>
