   <p>The Group "Liberty" (Freiheit) held an agitation meeting yesterday evening. Comrade Kalbitz presided.</p>
   <p>Comrade Fehling lectured about "The Crisis and the Workers" which met with great applause. Comrade Kalbitz gave a report of the General Committee; same was well received and approved. Comrade Fehling spoke again against the Reform swindle. A discussion about the friction among the worker's organs followed and general censure was expressed in regard to it. A committee was appointed to make arrangements to call a mass-meeting in the near future. The motion to subscribe to the "Truth" was accepted.</p>

   <p>Not less interesting were the songs - separately executed - "Huntsmen's Pleasure" and "The Last War" - After this began the play "The Nihilists", which was also excellent. The ensemble and the individual performances left nothing to be desired.</p>
   <p>Especially deserving of mention was Mr. Rodenberg, Mrs. Rodenberg and Mrs. Toldte. After the performance, dancing was indulged in. It was broad daylight when the last people left the hall.</p>
