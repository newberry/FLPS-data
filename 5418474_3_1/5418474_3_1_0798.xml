   <p>The meeting of the Northside Socialists busied itself yesterday with the Constitution of the United States. A comrade showed several paragraphs of the Constitution, where the worth of this famous act lies, and that through it all kinds of abuses in public life were condoned and partly brought to life.</p>
   <p>He proved that in the old constitution the right of possession was fully acknowledged in such a manner that there was not a word against direct slavery, which was later rectified by an addition to prevent the coarsest form of human exploitation without abolishing wage slavery. Today we find same in force. But it will perish, too, just like the last remnant of bondage, the subordination of the woman below the man. In the new, the free society, we will know only equal human beings. In conclusion we read a passage from Bebel's Book, the "Woman" in which the future free society is depicted, as she achieves the greatest pinnacle of culture, after being liberated from state and private ownership's lawless possession.</p>
