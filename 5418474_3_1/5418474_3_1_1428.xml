   <p>There is little doubt that Altgeld and his campaign managers are trying their best, to obtain as many anti-Harrison delegates as possible for the next convention, so that they can "bolt" against its resolutions. The ex-Governor knows very well, that he cannot win against his opponents in an open convention; he figures on 200 of the 700 delegates, and these will stick to him firmly and loyally, even after the convention. As we mentioned previously, in many wards, the recruiting drum of the John P. Altgeld legionaires is being pounded. Whoever desires to join, must promise only to vote for Delegates who are friendly to Altgeld, and follow the campaign-call: "Faithful to our leader, we follow to the ballot box!"</p>
   <p>The wards, which Altgeld can say with assurance, even today, that they are opposed to Harrison are the 6th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 19th, 25th, 26th, 30th, 32nd, 33th and 34th wards. Several of these, the 18th for instance, are even conceded by the city hall wing, but the latter feels absolutely no trepidation over an Altgeld boom. The Republicans give the Harrisonites considerably more headaches and one looks with <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1429.jpg" n="2"/>much interest toward the results of the conference which is scheduled today, between Congressman Lorimer, Henry L. Hertz, Ex-Sheriff Pease and other Republican party leaders. Most likely at this meeting the mayorality candidate will be selected and the date for the convention for nominations will be agreed upon. It is said that Judge Brentano or Zina R. Carter have the best chance to become the banner bearers of the G. O. P. in the impending tilt, to be selected for the mayor's office.</p>
