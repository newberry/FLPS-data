   <p>A deep rift now exists between the Governor and the State Legislature. The House has rejected the bill which would increase the sales tax to three per cent for a period of two years and which would extend the tax to include expenditures for gas and electricity.</p>
   <p>The Governor has apparently interpreted the action of the House of Representatives as a personal insult. As the result of this resentment be made a public statement which cannot be considered statesmanlike or shrewd. He explicitly attacked the Republican members of the House, and used expressions that went far beyond the bounds of what is considered suitable for parliamentary debate. He purposely overlooked the fact that numerous Democratic representatives also voted against the bill or--a thing that was perhaps even more surprising --refrained from voting. He put himself in the position of having the opposition reply that he had acted like a child who has been deprived of his <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0374.jpg" n="2"/>favorite toy and has flown into a rage in consequence.</p>
   <p>The Republicans are also justified in making the accusation that, in compliance with Chicago's wish, the settling of the relief question had been purposely postponed until after the city elections; that if this is not party politics, one might ask just what party politics is.</p>
   <p>One of the "rebellious" Democratic representatives has asserted that even the "regular" Democrats knew very well that the purpose of the bill was not to provide aid for the unemployed, but to fill the State treasury; that that was the only reason the "regulars" were now weeping crocodile tears; that on July 1 there would be a completely different story; that until then there would be enough money; and that it was difficult to see why the people should be burdened with an increase in the sales tax for two years, when great savings could be made by reorganizing the relief administration.</p>
   <p>Out of all this the question arises: How far is a State representative obligated to follow the orders of the Administration? He is supposed to <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0375.jpg" n="3"/>represent his constituents, who are against an increase in taxes. If he is stubborn [Translator's note: Literally, "If he plays the part of Ilsebill"], a little pressure is put on him. This is permitted by the Constitution.</p>
   <p>The second question is: What is the condition of the State treasury, if the Democratic rebels are correct? Where is the money that has come in, in excess of the amount required by the budget? Why did they drop from the sales tax law the clause providing that all revenues in excess of the amount formerly derived from the State real estate tax were to be used for the financing of relief? Why do these bills not take into account the basic changes brought about by the Federal relief laws? What might happen if the Federal Government really stopped providing funds because the State failed to pay its share?</p>
   <p>Instead of enacting useful laws, the Legislature acts as the arena for personal and partisan quarrels. The public looks on with folded arms. It may be entertaining, but it certainly is not dignified.</p>
