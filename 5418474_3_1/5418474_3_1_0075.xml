   <p>How long do the Knights of Labor intend to monkey around with their Powderly? Although it is a well known fact now that this man has sold and delivered the order - it seems that the K. of L. can't get rid of him.</p>
   <p>The news came out lately that he traded the so-called secret circulars to the capitalistic press before they reached their place of destination and still the order wants to start an investigation instead of firing him instantly.</p>
   <p>The intention seems to be to give him enough time so as to amass the rest of the fortune in order to indemnify him for his long loyal services.</p>
   <p>When will the working class ever get to reason and understand that <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0076.jpg" n="2"/>every centralization necessarily leads to corruption. Just give us the name of one prominent leader who did not enrich himself at the expense of the working class when he had the opportunity.</p>
   <p>The working men should and must organize but in no other way than on a federative basis and without any authority to their executives as Van Patten had, for instance, and not like Powderly, Arthur and others possess at present.</p>
   <p>These so-called executives are a center of corruption - and nothing else.</p>
