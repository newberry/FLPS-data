   <p>The meeting of Chicago's Socialist groups was held yesterday with Comrade Bluhm as Chairman. Comrade Schwab gave a report as to the activities of the Central Committee and the growth of the organization since its establishment. The second point of the order of the day!</p>
   <p>"Change of rules" caused some animated discussion. The proposal of Comrade Lange, to abolish contributions from different clubs to the Central Committee was not accepted. Comrade Grottkau's amendment that the clubs turn over to the Central Committee any surplus money left, after covering of expenses, failed to meet with approval. The participants in this debate were Comrades Winnen, Grottkau, Rau, Schwab, Livoni, Neff and others. Comrade Grottkau's proposal to retain the present manner of representation, which proved practical was accepted, as for the third point of the order of the day"The Spring election" was decided, to ask the Central Committee to publish a message to the effect that Chicago's Socialists consider it a disadvantage to take part in the elections.</p>

   <p>Comrade Schwab gave a report on the sale of pamphlets. It was decided to sell this literature at every club meeting in the future as the demand for it is growing. Comrade Grottkau's proposal to print agitation literature in English for distribution all through the country was accepted.</p>
