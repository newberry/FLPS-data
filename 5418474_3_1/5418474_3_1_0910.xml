   <p>Due to the announcements in the "Arbeiter-Zeitung", a crowd of about 2500 has gathered last night, at the Vorwarts Turnhalle, to greet and hear the delegates, sent by our German brothers from across the sea. Mr. Gustav Bartels opened the meeting and Doctor E. Schmidt, wildly acclaimed was elected chairman. Following is his address at which he was repeatedly interrupted, by thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>It is an extraordinary occasion, which led to this meeting to-day. They came to hear an agitator and fighter, for human freedom and progress, one of the outstanding fighters for Socialist ideals. This man is Mr. Fritzsche, a member of the German Parliament, who in spite of advanced age, and inconvenience of the long journey came, for the cause of the Socialist propaganda. Following he announced the speakers: Fritzsche, Parsons, Grottkau.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Bartels, Grottkau, Gloy, Dr. Schleyer, Essner, Soller, H. Stein and Heisler, were appointed vice presidents.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0911.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The appointed secretaries were: Spies, Meilbeck, P. Petersen, Kanneberg and Voigt. Dr. Schmidt then, introduced the next speaker, Mr. Fritzsche, who said: If he does not say everything, as it is expected, it has to be borne in mind, that after his return to Germany, he has to be responsible for every word uttered, and for the offense against the sovereign, or for an accusation of high treason. He would have to serve five years in the penitentiary.- The Socialists have proven, that they don't fear penitentiaries, but a man behind the prison walls can not agitate, and agitation is so necessary. He will defend the Socialist principles as he may, and not fear anything, upon his return to Germany.</p>
   <p>The treatment of Socialists in Germany is unjust, and the press suppresses everything, which spells freedom. The German Socialists demanded, the separation of the church from state, separation of church from school, and neither political nor religious superstition should be taught in schools. The Socialists are against a standing army, and for a direct legislature, by the people. All of these justifiable requests, were interpreted as criminal.</p>

   <p>The next speaker was Mr. Parsons, who said: "We do not give our support to the gentlemen from Germany, just because they are Germans, but because they are missionaries of Socialism and were pupils of Karl Marx and Lassalle. Fritzsche and Viereck have come just like Parnell and Davitt, to beg for material aid, to subdue the tyrants."</p>
   <p>After the departure of Dr. Schmidt Comrade Spies acting as chairman, read the decisions which have been published in the Fackel, and which have been unaminously accepted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grattkau who has been the last speaker of the evening was received with thunderous applause. He explained the absence of Mr. Viereck, who was still busy with Milwaukee's organizations. A collection was taken up, for the German Socialists, after which the meeting was adjourned.</p>
