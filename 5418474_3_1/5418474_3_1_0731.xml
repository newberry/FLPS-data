   <p>Never before to our knowledge was a funeral attended by several thousand people as was the case of Mrs. Neebe. Beside the two speakers George Schilling and Paul Grottkau who took their places on the platform were other prominent Socialists and also Nina Van Zandt and Miss Spies. Louis Zeller read a letter from Dr. Ernst Schmidt regretting his inability to be present, due to his own indisposition. The Schleswig-Holstein Singing Society then sang: "Aber alle Wipfeln ist Ruh", (Quiet is reigning above all tree tops). Thereafter Mr. George Schilling said in English: Little knew Mrs. Neebe when she visited her husband last Monday in prison, that she was approaching her last day on this earth. The cause of her death is attributed to heart ailment. When the report of the sentence of her husband reached her, she suffered a spell of unconsciousness. Since that day the anxiety for her husband undermined her health. Mrs. Neebe could never understand why her husband who was not guilty of any misdemeanor has been sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. Then Paul Grottkau stepped forward and expressed himself in an inciting language against the "ruling class" and the "capitalistic press", actually foaming from the mouth while speaking.</p>

   <p>coming revolution lies in our moral ideals. Meta and Oscar Neebe as well as others have been condemned therefore. What does it signify that people by the thousands have gathered on the street below, who never knew Metta in life? It is the awakened public conscience which with a thousand voices liberated Metta and her husband from the sentence passed upon them by the ruling class. Honor and lasting gratitude to Metta; but to the living we offer our energy, thus trying to prevent more tragedy and murders, committed by the reigning class.</p>
