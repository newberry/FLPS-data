   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the German Section of The"Socialist Labor Party" at Zepf's Hall, 54 West Lake Street was well attended. Comrade Kempke opened the meeting, and Comrade Jeffers was appointed as its chairman. First of all, a report was made about the decisions, accepted by the Main Section, at their last session, concerning the payment of election printing expenses, the costs connected with a Ball etc. and then a finance report, read by Mr. Franz. It has been resolved, and the "Arbeiter Zeitung" entrusted, with the execution of the order, to recommend the New English Paper of the Party. At the last meeting, Jacob Eulberg had been accused, as trying to harm the Party, and this was the next subject of the discussion. After a long debate, at which Eulbert admitted his guilt, although insisting that the "Section" has no right to pass a sentence upon him, he has been-by a majority of votes-excluded. He then, made his intention of an appeal to the Main "Section" known.-</p>

   <p>To keep up a good agitation, the agent of the "German Section" has been instructed, to get in touch with the agents of the other sections, and draw conclusions as to the manner of agitation to be resorted to. The delegates of the "Main Section" have been instructed to agitate in a body against the proposal of building a Hall and to request the Trustee's of the "Arbeiter Zeitung" to refrain from such publicity.</p>
