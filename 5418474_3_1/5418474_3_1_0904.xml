   <p>A meeting of Chicago's Socialists, was held yesterday afternoon at 54 West Lake street, at which William Blum presided, and August Spies acted as secretary. After the president explained, that the meeting was called for the purpose, of consulting and deciding on different propositions, concerning the national Socialistic Congress, which is to be held at the North-side Turnhalle, the 21st of this month; August Spies addressed the audience, and pointed out, that the congress is especially interested, in improving the present conditions, of the working classes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gustav Horig was the next speaker, describing the emancipation of the working classes, from capitalistic slavery, since the year 1848, up to the present day.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sloan submitted a number of decisions declaring, that the time has come, when we have to create a strong local Party Organization, under which banner, the opponents of the capitalistic Parties have to unite, for only then could we hope for success, as for instance, the Gas and Street-car monopolies, which should not be in the hands of private corporations, but at the expiration of their franchise in the year 1883, and thereafter, should be owned and operated by the city itself.</p>
   <p>Working toward this purpose, it seems necessary, to appoint delegates from both <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0905.jpg" n="2"/>factions of the Socialist Party, whose duty would be, to work out a suitable plan, of which they would give a detailed report to their respective organizations. This would also mean, harmonious cooperation at elections, in the future. After a lengthy debate, Sloan's suggestions were accepted, and proposed, to submit such, to the National Congress, for approval.</p>
   <p>George Schilling spoke then, on the principles and aims of Socialism, especially with regard to the revolutionary tactics of such.</p>
   <p>Spies in his short speech, condemned the English government in connection with Parnell's and other Irish land-agitators arrests, and after Dusey and others have also made a short speech, one of the most enthusiastic meetings was adjourned.</p>
