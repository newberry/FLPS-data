  <body>
   <p>A number of Germans were assembled last night at the Democratic Head quarters, to establish a German Tilden and Reform Organization for Cook County. Comrade Lieb opened the meeting and on his motion Dilger was elected chairman pro tem.</p>
   <p>As secretaries functioned Charles Drandorff and Henry Meyer.</p>
   <p>By a request a Committee of seven was appointed, to prepare an organization plan and to present it to the meeting. The committee consisted of Messrs. Arno Voss, Fr. Rolle, C Hirsch, F. Jensch, Dr. H. Buchner, F. Waterholter, and H. Freiberg.</p>
   <p>After a short absence the committee returned and reported the following plan of organization:</p>
   <p>The name of this organization shall be:" The German American Tilden and Reform Society of Cook County."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1686.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The purpose of this Society, is to unite the German-Americans of this Country to support the election of Samuel J. Tilden as President of the United States, in order to improve our political conditions.</p>
   <p>To arrive at this purpose, we call on all German Americans friendly to reform without regard of their party connections, to organize Tilden Reform Clubs in their wards and towns, and to notify the Central Committee of these new organizations.</p>
   <p>Any German-American having a right to vote can become a member of this club in his ward or town...</p>
