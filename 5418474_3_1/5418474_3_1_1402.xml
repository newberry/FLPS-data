   <p>Altgeld's "municipal ownership and Chicago party" platform intends to have a complete City-ticket; in all wards candidates for aldermen will be nominated. This procedure is to be postponed however, until the results of the Republican and Democratic convention are known, as it is desired to use this knowledge advantageously. So far, 150 petitions, which were circulated by the Altgeld headquarters have been returned; 12,000 signatures were affixed, and it is expected, that the 850 petitions which have as yet not been gathered, will produce at least 40,000 names in addition, so that a total of more than 50,000 signers will be obtained.</p>
   <p>The Ex-Governor is convinced about his victory. In regard to the mayorality battle, he declared yesterday: "Only benefits can accrue to me, if Harrison is also in the field, if I were compelled to fight alone against a Republican for the mayor's office, then I would have to fight alone against the money-power.</p>

   <p>All change which could be gathered from London to St. Francisco, would be used to bring about my defeat. Now it is different! The politicians will be all eyes, when the election is over, - to day they underestimate my strength! It would be a fight against windmills, if I would express my nomination-sentiments at the regular party convention. After all, the Cityhall faction does as it pleases-thanks to the control it exercises over the police and saloon element."</p>
