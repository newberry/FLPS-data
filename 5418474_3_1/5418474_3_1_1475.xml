   <p>"Fair play?!" Carter H. Harrison never lied more efficiently in his entire life! During this raging political battle which waxes with increasing acridness, one perceives his often repeated assertion that he favors the euphonious procedure known as "Fair play!"</p>
   <p>Is it honest, fair play, if he or his adjutants provide 150 bonafide toughs to break up a meeting, because, in their apprehension they surmised that this assembly would presumably espouse the Hesing mayoral nomination? Thus, it behooves him to simply pack the hall; he circumvents the free expression of the people and uses brutal force to prevent the materialization of a favorable action for his opponent.</p>
   <p>That was the Harrison action yesterday evening at the North Side Turner Hall, where the regular 24th Ward Democratic organization was in session. Carter <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1476.jpg" n="2"/>H. Harrison and "fair play?!" We cannot expect it from him, any more than from the devil that he bathe in holy water or use the sign of the cross! Carter H. Harrison never can nor will abandon his well known, customary tactics to a acquire by force what is not granted by bestowal. The history of former campaigns where Harrison was directly or indirectly interested, gives us ample data about his insidious methods.</p>
   <p>Harrison and his cohorts consider everything as permissible, if it only produces results! If their own henchmen do not suffice to pack and terrorize a meeting of Democratic voters, then recourse may be taken to some Republicans, among whom a good supply of mercenaries can always be secured. One can truly declare by reverting to facts, that during this last contested nomination in particular, nine-tenths of the favorable resolutions for Harrison have been brought about by the unholy work of political "fixers"!</p>
   <p>The 24th Ward is Washington Hesing's old ward, where he lived for 38 years. It should be evident that he has many personal friends and political adherents there. Obviously, Carter H. Harrison is quite aware of it and this <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1477.jpg" n="3"/>prompts him to resort to such gigantic efforts to prevent Hesing's friends from recording their declarations. Very expeditiously he dispatched a horde of West Side Harrisonians to the North Side Turner Hall to provoke, and promote a riot, to disperse the assembled by sheer force whereby the acceptance of favorable resolutions for Hesing are made impossible.</p>
   <p>In the large basement of the North Side Turner Hall more than 500 people had congregated last evening; about 350 were members of the regular Democratic 22nd Ward organization and the remainder, with a few exceptions, were Harrison men from West Side Wards. Well known Democrats from the 24th Ward whom we recognized, were: M. B. McAbee,.... 31 are listed.</p>
   <p>Mr. McAbee, president of the organization, opened the meeting and expressed his gratification for the large attendance. He laid particular stress on the importance of the approaching spring election. Our Democracy he said, has regained the State of Illinois and now we must liberate Chicago from the Republican rule. This can only be accomplished if we show unfaltering solidarity and we must all work for the goal in the name of Democracy.... (The <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1478.jpg" n="4"/>next paragraph lists routine business, bills, etc.)... A member of the organization offered a resolution to nominate Hesing as the Democratic candidate for mayor. This resolution is identical to the one which the Independent 24th Ward Democratic Club had announced on the previous evening and it was the signal for the tumultuous onslaught of the Harrisonians.</p>
   <p>Whistling, sibilant disapproval, howling and raving made the speaker's voice inaudible although he strained his vocal organs tremendously. But the Hesing contingents were not to be outdone: repeated "Hurrahs" for Hesing, set the walls a-trembling; hundreds of lusty throats out-screamed the Harrison clique. Time and again the Harrison man, Tom Lynch, who now had mounted a chair, encouraged them to incessant, raucous demonstrations resulting in indescribable disorder.</p>
   <p>A certain Tom Doyle stationed himself before the chairman's table; screaming and gesticulating furiously, he demanded the substitution of Harrison's name on the resolution. When it proved unavailing, he insisted on tabling the motion. An individual managed to squeeze through the mass of humanity and <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1479.jpg" n="5"/>shoved forward a Cregier nomination. Somewhere between 50 and 60 people were now crowded around the speaker, screeching in an ear splitting manner. His calls for order were futile. By chance he got hold of a cane which became a splintered gavel.</p>
   <p>A Mr. Fred Wetzel, probably German only by name, lost all semblance of decorum and actually attacked a Hesing constituent; instantly the latter's friends appeared and the flagrant fighter was unceremoniously repulsed. Rampant rowdyism had reached its crest; a general riot was averted only by the intercession of a few sensible men and the appearance of two blue-coats. As prospects for peace and definite acceptance of a candidate seemed remote, the meeting was adjourned until next Thursday amidst a threatened repetition of a similar action by the Harrison soldiery....</p>
