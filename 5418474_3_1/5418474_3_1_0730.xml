   <p>Mr. Hesing's long cherished jealousy could not be kept within bounds any longer which was shown in an article, published by this honorable gentleman today under the headline "Sympathy, etc." His servant Raster even went so far to besmear the memory of a decent woman to satisfy his craving for calumny. Mrs. Hesing, wife of the publisher of the largest German newspaper of the western hemisphere, died several months ago, and although she was known as a good Christian woman by whose testament many of our charitable societies were benefited, not many people were present at her funeral. Even the large circle of Mr. Hesing's capitalistic friends were represented only in a small number.</p>
   <p>Contrary to this, Mrs. Neebe's funeral was one of the most imposing ones we have ever seen. People who came to pay their last respect to this woman were no curiosity seekers, a fact which even Mr. Hesing's paper admits.</p>
