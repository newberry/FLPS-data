   <p>President Roosevelt has issued an executive order containing regulations for the employment of people in the emergency works planned by the government. As was emphasized in a report from Washington, the president issued these regulations in an effort to prevent people who are now receiving relief money from refusing to accept work, because of the fear that they could not later get back on the list of those receiving relief. Hidden in this statement is a grave accusation against the administration of relief funds.</p>
   <p>It has long been known that unemployed people have refused to accept work that was offered them only because they feared that, by accepting it, they would lose their status of unemployed. Among these people were many who were quite willing to work, and who would rather earn a living for themselves and their families by working than receive relief. But these persons knew that the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0366.jpg" n="2"/>work offered them would not be permanent, that during their period of employment they would be taken from the lists of those receiving relief, and that they would have a great deal of trouble in obtaining relief later.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances, one cannot blame those people for having preferred to refuse the work offered them. It is perhaps the first time that it is admitted in Washington that this situation exists. It goes to show that, in the distribution of relief money, there is much bureaucratic red tape, incompetence, and perhaps favoritism, and that this condition has created serious results.</p>
   <p>It is possible that the heads of these institutions may point out that certain unfortunate conditions cannot be avoided; this contention is, of course, justified. But this only shows that the entire method is fundamentally false. The relief problem concerns local authorities. This principle was formerly accepted the world over, and only under the pressure of radical elements did the authorities depart from it in various countries. But the evil results soon<pb facs="5418474_3_1_0367.jpg" n="3"/>began to show, and that is why Great Britain and Germany have begun to discontinue national relief in the last few years.</p>
   <p>It is high time that we made use of the experience of these countries; then many a mistake and many a blunder could be avoided. But there is little likelihood of that, for the President's executive order contains one additional provision which seems very plausible in theory, but will entail much hardship in practice. This provision is that only such persons as have received relief for at least one month, and have registered with the employment office of the federal government, will receive employment.</p>
   <p>One can easily understand that the government has the desire to reduce the number of persons receiving relief. But why should those be excluded from employment who managed to get along for years, and who never received relief because they were too proud to ask for it? The number of these persons is very great, and they should receive first consideration in the distribution of work. The President's order works out, in practice, in such a way as to<pb facs="5418474_3_1_0368.jpg" n="4"/>seem to reward the recipient of unemployment relief. Of course, the President did not intend that; but its repercussion will be felt all the same.</p>
