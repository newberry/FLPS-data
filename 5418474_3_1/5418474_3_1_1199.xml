  <body>
   <p>Judge Gentzel, who is of German descent, was born in 1875 in Chicago. His parents were Anton H. and Emily (Nommsen) Gentzel. He attended the Chicago public schools. Later he studied law at Lake Forest College and New York University. In 1900 he was admitted to the bar. Long before his election to the Municipal court, he occupied a prominent position in the Chicago courts with his general law practice. In 1920 he was elected to the Municipal Court, and in 1926 he was re-elected with a great majority. The Chicago Bar Association, well known for its considerate, fearless and deliberate appreciation of all judicial candidates, irrespective of the party to which they belong, praised the nomination of Judge Gentzel as candidate.</p>
   <p>While running in 1926 as candidate for re-election, after having served six years on the bar, the Chicago Bar association gave the following report about him.: "Judge Gentzel, as Judge of the Municipal Court, has set up an enviable record for the past six years. His punctuality of opening the court, and his <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1200.jpg" n="2"/>faithful attention and execution of judicial duties, are commendable. He is exceptionally well suited for this position, and worthy of recommendation.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the German element of Chicago should be well represented at the polling booth, and should help to elect Judge Gentzel as Judge of the Superior Court." Republicans, as well as Democrats should vote for Judge Gentzel.</p>
