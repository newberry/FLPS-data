   <p>Members of the Labor Party of the Second Ward held a well attended meeting last night which was opened by its President, Mr. John Gelder. The report of the last meeting was read and accepted, after which the Club's Secretary, Mr. J. W. Bailey, read the Constitution of the Club, which was also unanimously accepted...Mr. A. W. Herr, in his short speech, cautioned the meeting to abandon the old parties and show the nation that through freedom of voting, labor is determined also to take its part in politics. The President then introduced Philipp von Patten, who expressed his bitterness as to the present system of factory work. He said;</p>
   <p>"It seems that the machinery which was invented, does the contrary from what was expected, to ease the worker's life. Not machinery, but general education is the urgent need of labor. The worst enemy of labor is unemployment, which is created by the use of machinery. I am called a Communist, and yet I have <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1100.jpg" n="2"/>never refused to make an honest living by honest work....The eight hour working day plays a vital part in the question of unemployment ....People have to realize that in a Republic like ours, opportunity is given to everyone, through freedom of voting, to express his opinion and show his power...He warned against strikes which only make matters worse, but advocated peaceful deliberation by organizations which would adopt political action; that is, those who would make an attempt to elect representatives to our city administration as well as to the legislature, and who are members of the Labor Party.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cowdery spoke strongly in opposition to machinery. The abolition of it is the only salvation; thus labor would again be insured the earning of a livelihood. Mr. Schilling did not agree with that speaker's ideas. He said, machinery is of great benefit to the laborer and should stay here, but salvation can be found only through a shorter working day. He advocated organizing the Labor Party and introducing the eight hour work day.</p>
