   <p>and has accepted the stand of the Administration. As private industry is forced gradually to hire more people, relief work is to be decreased, until the depression is ended.</p>
   <p>Work relief is merely a substitute for direct relief, and is provided because we, like all other nations, experienced that the weaker characters are encouraged to remain idle and avoid work, if they are not asked to do something in return for the aid that is given to them. Work relief is not necessary under normal conditions, and could well be dispensed with. It has been introduced solely for the purpose of giving the unemployed, who want to work, opportunity to do so. Hence, the Government is not obligated to pay as much for work relief as private industry would normally pay for the same kind of work.</p>
   <p>We should not forget that the wages paid to unemployed for work relief do not come from any profits derived from the enterprise, as is the case in private industry, but from the pockets of the taxpayers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0159.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Congress has appropriated a very large, but a very definitely limited sum of money for work relief, and the Government is trying to give work to as many unemployed as the sum allotted for the purpose will permit. However, even the billions appropriated are not sufficient to provide work for all of the unemployed. It is estimated that three and one-half million will be put to work. If the Government paid all of them according to the scale prevailing in private industry, not nearly three and one-half million people could receive the benefits of work relief. And nobody has said that the majority of those who are willing to work and will have the opportunity to do so under the plan of the Government, are dissatisfied with the small wage offered. Certainly the most of them are happy that their period of unemployment has passed and, since they are confident that work relief is only temporary and that they will soon obtain a job in private industry and receive union wages, they are content with the small remuneration which the Government pays. No doubt there are some dissatisfied persons among them. They are to be found everywhere and the agitators of the radicals will see to it that the number of discontented relief workers is increased. Perhaps <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0160.jpg" n="4"/>this kind of political baiting is responsible for the relief workers' threat to strike. These agitators have an easy life. They are not relief workers. Their job is to create dissatisfaction. They do not lose anything through a strike, nor do they care if the people who strike suffer losses. They have no interest in the strikers. Their object is attained when they have succeeded in disturbing the business of the country and in preventing the return of normal business conditions.</p>
   <p>The strike which the relief workers threaten to call is a very foolish idea. Nobody is forcing a single one of the relief workers to do relief work. They have merely been offered an opportunity to earn money. If they do not wish to avail themselves of this opportunity--they need not. In that case, however, the state is relieved of its obligation to support them. President Roosevelt is right. Anybody who follows the suggestion of agitators is merely harming himself. While describing the "blessings" of communism, these agitators are very careful not to tell their prospective victims that the highly praised bolshevik government of Russia also pays only those who work, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0161.jpg" n="5"/>and not wages equivalent to those paid in America, but rather starvation wages, "too little to live, and too much to die". Those Russian workers would think that they were in paradise if they could change places with our people who are performing relief work. A family cannot live "high" on an income of twenty dollars a week, but that sum is sufficient to provide necessary food, etc., and there are many American families that are not on relief and would consider themselves fortunate if they had twenty dollars to spend every week. We are very much surprised that the president of the American Federation of Labor, generally looked upon as a very sensible and levelheaded man, who tries to avert any strike that is not justified, should support the claims of the misguided relief workers.</p>
