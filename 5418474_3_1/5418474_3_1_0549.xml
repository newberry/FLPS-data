   <p>The whole world fears Bolshevism. The whole world dreads it.</p>
   <p>It has good reason to. The Bolshevist idea is visibly gaining strength and ground in Europe. The Ukraine is under the rule of the anarchists and revolutionaries, according to most recent reports from Hungary. It is rumored that several Czech regiments have mutinied in the northern part of Hungary, and it is feared that the news about events in Hungary--the victory of the Bolsheviki--will inflame the new Czech state, "where," according to the statement of a reporter in Copenhagen, "Bolshevism put up a bolder front than anywhere outside of Russia." And in Poland, too, Bolshevism is strong.</p>
   <p>It is not known whether Bolshevism has found adherents and has spread in Italy. There is no information on the subject in the news which has come from Italy during <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0550.jpg" n="2"/>the past few weeks. Many consider this to be an evil omen--the lull before a storm. But one need not put much credence in this opinion, nor is it necessary to connect the large strikes and small mutinies of soldiers which occur here and there in England and France, nor the disturbances among the masses of the French and Dutch peoples with Bolshevism, in order to understand Europe's fear, which is evident from the statements of many of her statesmen and journalists.</p>
   <p>In the face of this situation and the general fear or knowledge that all Europe, including Western Europe, must become a prey to Bolshevism if the German people should adopt it, it is inconceivable that the same European governments and statesmen, who tremble before Bolshevism, should do their level best to drive the German people into the arms of Bolshevism by making demands which this people cannot meet.</p>
   <p>And so it is here. It is true, our situation is much different--what we call, and fear as, Bolshevism is, in its causes and nature, vastly different from <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0551.jpg" n="3"/>Russian Bolshevism--but the conduct of our officials or leaders over and against the danger is just as prudent as that of the Europeans. There was much talking and writing about Bolsheviki in America, and the average citizen concluded that "the woods must be full of them," although he saw not one. And then all those who demanded any more or less radical measures and changes in more or less radical language were called Bolsheviki. The result was that many to whom the Russian Bolsheviki and their aims were unknown found out that they themselves were Bolsheviki. This led them to think that Bolshevism was not bad at all and that, since they were already known under the name of Bolsheviki, they might as well adopt some of the nature and aims of the Bolsheviki--the old principle: "If I have the name, I might as well have the game."</p>
   <p>Thus Bolsheviki were made here, as the result of an attempt to justify the fear of Bolshevism. And more are being "produced" continually, by the creation of more and more cause for discontent; by the use of measures employed by autocrats of old, coercive and punitive laws, or by the demand that such <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0552.jpg" n="4"/>legislation be enacted that the "danger" might be combated; and by the forcing of all men and women to submit to the views and customs which these qualified patriots and reformers deem desirable and necessary for the education and governing of the people.</p>
   <p>But coercive and punitive laws for the purpose of regulating the views and customs of citizens are out of place in America, according to our Constitution; they are contrary to the principles of our Republic. They who demand, or force, or enact such laws, are the original and most dangerous fomenters of revolution--the fathers of American Bolshevism. They, like the soulless and ignorant grafters and usurers, create more and more Bolsheviki of the American kind, dissatisfied, indignant American citizens.</p>
   <p>Prohibitionists are among the foremost of these "noble people". Let's treat them to a thousand noes on April 1.</p>
