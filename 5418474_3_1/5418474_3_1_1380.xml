   <p>The coming election will see the United Societies for local self government at their post as the forefighters for liberal principles. As in the last election for the city council the association will do their utmost to support the election of liberal minded members for the council. All candidates will be thoroughly examined as regards their opinions and it will depend upon their attitude towards the principles of the organization, whether they will get the support of the associations united with the societies. At a meeting held yesterday the committee for political agitation resolved to ask all candidates for the city council their opinion about the principles of the organization as laid down in their constitution. It will depend upon their answer, if the organization will ask their members to vote for or against them or if they should keep a neutral position. The candidates will be asked to give their answer as soon as possible and the committee for political agitation will give their decision about them next Saturday. It was resolved to take an active part in the coming election and to give instructions to all members of the United Societies as to the candidates for <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1381.jpg" n="2"/>whom they should give their vote.</p>
