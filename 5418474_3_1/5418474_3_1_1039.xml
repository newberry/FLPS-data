   <p>The male chorus of St. Paul's Parish gave an entertainment and dance yesterday at Uhlich's Hall. Dr. G. A. Zimmermann, superintendent of German instruction, lectured on the development of socialism.</p>
   <p>After the speaker showed the general socialistic trend abroad and here, particularly in Chicago, he gave a very lucid historical exposition of socialism, commencing with a brief account of antiquity involving Lycurgus, Plato, and others, then Israel and the early Christian communities. He explained that the Socialists of today claim Christ as one of their members, because Christianity requires that there shall be no class distinction. As he approached the main phase of his topic, Dr. Zimmermann spoke of the French Revolution and the socialistic views prevailing at that period. The social systems of Baboeuf, Saint-Simon, and Fourier were explained in a brief manner. The French author Proudhon, the most prominent supporter and exponent of socialism, was virtually the pioneer of social democracy, according to the speaker. Louis Blanc, who tried to apply Proudhon's theories <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1040.jpg" n="2"/>in practice, was discussed in a thorough manner. In giving the German angle he expounded the ambitions of Lassalle, and of Karl Marx, and explained that social democracy in its final phase centers on the property question, just as the socialistic people's State declares: "It is the socialistic or communistic fight, the relentless war against possession, and furthermore the socialism of today is absolutely materialistic, depending upon a revolution for the realization of its program; and no one denies it. If the revolution is successful, then the unceasing socialistic fight, the permanent revolution, will replace Christianity--which fact may be proved by quotations from socialistic papers--and the 'religion of existence' will then function. The Free Press of Chemnitz, for instance, declared, 'Hereafter we intend we live as heathens!'"</p>
   <p>Finally the speaker considered the question whether socialism may spread and be successful in America, but he does not think that the movement will attain importance at present. Socialism is an imported issue, destined to eke out <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1041.jpg" n="3"/>an artificial existence here and to be kept alive only by its leaders; the conditions prevailing throughout America do not justify the movement. Of course, it appears that the movement [socialism] may attain success in New York and there, in fact, it has made a creditable showing. The speaker was, however, of the opinion that the present indications of a successful socialism are due to the Socialist policy of subscribing to certain principles, including abolition of unjust, deplorable conditions, which induced hundreds of workers and small merchants to vote the Socialist ticket at the last city election; but the name of the mayoral candidate was also a great factor.</p>
