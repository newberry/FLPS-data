   <p>Last Saturday the State Department in Washington informed the British Government that the Red Star liner "Kroonland," which was on her way from New York to Naples when she was captured at Gibraltar by British war vessels, should be released, and that the American Government expected prompt action on the matter. Yesterday, our State Department made the amazing discovery that the British Government had ordered the "Kroonland" to be taken to Gibraltar [harbor] and her case "tried" by a prize court. Her cargo of copper was removed and stored on British docks.</p>
   <p>The confiscation of the "Kroonland" (and two more copper steamers since) was ordered merely on the "suspicion" that the cargo might somehow fall into the hands of the "enemies," Germany or Austria Hungary. The "Kroonland" traveled under the American flag and was on her way to a neutral port, and there was <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1345.jpg" n="2"/>nothing in the ships' papers to indicate that her cargo was to be reshipped from Naples to either Germany or Austria-Hungary. But it seems that England wants to make doubly sure, and is determined to retain the boat and her cargo in spite of the protest of the United States.</p>
   <p>The United States cannot afford to let the matter rest. The Government will have to ascertain whether Great Britain was really within her rights in confiscating the cargo of a neutral ship bound for a neutral port just because she (England) expected the goods to fall ultimately into the hands of her enemies. If she has such a right, then our entire overseas trade would depend exclusively on England's grace. She would be in a position to cripple American commerce completely.</p>
   <p>It seems that Great Britain's latest actions are compelling the United States to take a determined stand regarding this British arrogance--to insist on a clear-cut definition of the rights of neutral nations and to demand that these rights be strictly respected. This would mean a sharp diplomatic campaign, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1346.jpg" n="3"/>and the Administration will need all possible support if it hopes to come out ahead.</p>
   <p>This latest arrogance of Great Britain and her disregard of America's protest show again how important it is to make sure in tomorrow's election that men are sent to Congress whom we know are not only Anti-British, but who also recognize England's impudence, perfidy, and wiliness. It is therefore necessary to have a successful American businessman and friend of the Germans, Mr. Sullivan, elected United States Senator, and to get Fred A. Britten and other reliable candidates into the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the present Democratic Administration will remain in office until March, 1917, and during this time--and the sooner the better--British insolence and arrogance towards the United States must be dealt with effectively. The present Democratic Administration must do it, if it is to be done at all, and for this reason it is necessary to elect a Congress friendly to the Administration and to send men to Washington who are not under British influence, but who <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1347.jpg" n="4"/>will strengthen the Administration in its determined stand.</p>
   <p>A Roger C. Sullivan will never humor the British. Neither will a Fred Britten or any other good German-American. A vote for Sullivan is a vote for American independence.</p>
