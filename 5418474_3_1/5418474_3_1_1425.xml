   <p>Some very well-known German citizens have called a massmeeting in Heinens Hall No. 519 Larrabee Street, which was exceedingly well attended. They nominated unanimously last night Mr. George G. May as an independent Democratic Candidate for alderman of the 21st ward. The meeting was an energetic protest against the previous candidate for alderman McGillen and if the enthusiasm shown for George May in yesterday's meeting is of a permanent nature, which it seems to be without doubt, the democratic machine will suffer a severe defeat on election day. The independent Democrats of the 21st ward could not have made a better choice. Mr.Anton H. May is the son of the well-known German Anton H. May and has the respect and esteem of the whole ward. Born in Chicago he has had a German education at the gymnasium in Bonna. Rhi in Germany and studied at Northwestern University. For 27 years he has lived in the ward. Mr.May is a member of the firm Schock and May, which has the agency of the "Danville Stove Co."and at 120 - 124 S. Clinton St. The nomination of Mr. May was heartily recommended by Mr. Sam Rindskoff, Leon Deutsch, Jacob Yondorf, Wm. Kucken and F.B. Meyer,. Mr. May personally appeared at the meeting and in a short speech he promised if elected to stand for the rights of the citizens in an honest and conscientious manner. The German-American Democratic Club of the 21st ward which is headed by Sam. Rindskoff, Kaspar J.Kraemer and WM.Mersell has resolved to use all its influence for the election of Mr. May.</p>
