   <p>The political battle of our city has developed far enough to show us that the final result will depend upon the zeal and persistence of the German American voting power. The Irish-English press is united to a man and opposed to the movement, which will remove that horde of political bushwhackers, and it is therefore very desirable in spite of the fact that the German political might is generally recognized, that no German should view this fight with indifference now that the war is scorching the fields. The Germans never had a more favorable opportunity to obtain a friendly alliance with the better elements from the other national groups, and never before were the rank and file of the Germans more united for a cause, namely, the protection of personal liberty, and opposition to Irish bureaucratic rule. The latter statement should not be construed as meaning that we consider all the Irish without exception, as belonging to that catagory of crooks who so impudently proclaim themselves to be the Democratic party. On the contrary, the majority of this nationality is now allied with the Germans, Americans, Bohemians, Scandinavians, Poles, etc., and fights against its own corrupt countrymen. One may be justified in asserting, that the fighters are led by the German-American banner, and if <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1548.jpg" n="2"/>the Germanic race continues to display the same active interest until election day, then the victory on April 7th will be inevitable.</p>
   <p>Therefore, Germans to the front! Show, that the people who could drive the French in pairs, are also able to tan the hide of the others!</p>
