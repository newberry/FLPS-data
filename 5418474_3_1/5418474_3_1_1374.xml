   <p>The regulation of all public utilizations by the State or national Government was recommended yesterday evening by the candidate for U. S. Senator, Roger C. Sullivan, in the Lincoln Turnverein, Diversey Boulevard near Sheffield Avenue, where more than 1,000 representative German citizens assembled to listen to true democratic doctrines. It must be admitted that very few followers of Dunne and Harrison were present. Otherwise it appeared that most of the Democratic factions were represented. The Germans of Chicago cannot be sold to one or the other faction or party. The German-American is the most independent citizen of the country, which was best proven by yesterday's demonstration of the Germans from across the Rhine of the north side. Messrs August Lueders, Paul Gerhart, Charles H. Kellermann, Henry M. Claussen, Joseph Hopp, Louis Sala, Bernard F. Weber, Felix von Joysow and Eugene Niederegger were solicitous for weeks about the success of the banquet, which should not be a gala affair, still it should prove that certain <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1375.jpg" n="2"/>politicians do not carry the German or their votes in their vest pockets, and cannot deliver candidates to any party.</p>
   <p>Sullivan's speech: "I dare say (began Mr. Sullivan) since my first arrival in Chicago many of my truest friends were Germans, and that they are still among my friends. I learned from them to respect German customs and my later travels in the fatherland convinced me that our German citizens, not only have the right, but also the duty to maintain and propagate these habits. Without the German spirit America would not have advanced in so short a time. It is to be doubted that, without German assistance, there would be an independent America at all. It was one of your people, Major-General von Steuben, a superior soldier, who has done as much for America as any of his contemporaries. He trained the raw recruits of General Washington and his example was followed for more than one hundred years. After him came Franz Siegel in the Civil War. Siegel, himself a revolutionary, knew how to obey and command. When Siegel received an order, there was no fear, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1376.jpg" n="3"/>that it would not be promptly executed. And like von Steuben and Siegel, many prominent Germans in our closer neighborhood proved, that they are worthy of their adopted country. Who does not know John P. Altgeld? I am proud that I have known him, could work with him and assist him. He strove and worked for ideals, which he considered to be right, to the last bitter end, and this must be acknowledged and possessed a German faithfulness to duty, in a word, ability.</p>
   <p>The way I see the matter, this ability also means courage and perseverance, virtues which the Germans have transplanted into the new American nation. This perseverance has made America big. President Wilson also follows this plan of knowledge, careful planning, sharp decision and perseverance.</p>
