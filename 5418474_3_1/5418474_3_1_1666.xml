   <p>Mr. Lorenz Brentano, the congressman from the North Side spoke in German, referring to the fall elections. At that time he said he gave his fellow-citizens the advice to vote the Republican ticket and is repeating this advice now, convinced that by doing so nobody will ever regret it. The reform lies with the Republican party as the official action of our President has shown. If the Germans and Americans had united last spring they would have brought about a city administration to be proud of. There was a time when association with members of the city administration was not regarded as honorable but that is not so any more. It is no longer a disgrace to be an alderman of Chicago. And now they are expected to replace these people who have been put to the proof and have saved the city from bankruptcy by new and untried officials. No sensible person can expect such a thing. Chicago is a Republican city. The Democratic majority at last fall's elections was due to the Germans who meanwhile have become tired of the Democrats and will certainly not turn their back again on their old <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1667.jpg" n="2"/>ally the Republican Party....Mayor Heath is a business man demanding and enjoying through his actions the highest esteem of the business world not to mention the great service he has rendered this city already. Our citizens shall breathe much easier after next Tuesday's election again, when the possibility to have the city administration put into the hands of the unscrupulous railroad man, Perry H. Smith, will be removed. States-Attorney Tuthill has been a loyal servant and would be a far better choice. He does not find it necessary to say anything about Caspar Butz who is well known and respected by everyone. Mr. Larrabee, the candidate for Treasurer, enjoyed for years the reputation of an honest man and deserves to be elected to the office he seeks. He endorses the whole Republican ticket....</p>
   <p>The Germans are enemies of temperance but they condemn over-indulgence also. They could not suffer to have a man whose liking for liquor is so great that under the influence of alcohol he even fell asleep under the eyes of the very people who had gathered to ratify his candidacy....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1668.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. William Vocke said in English that the people are not so much interested as to which party would be the victor - but they are concerned that honesty and good management would remain. He mentioned the year 1873 when the Germans felt the necessity to unite with the Irish. The Mayor and City Council elected then, did not justify the faith put in them.</p>
   <p>...It is in the interest of the taxpayer to elect Mr. Heath again, and this interest should be shared especially by the Germans who are comparatively the largest taxpayers....</p>
