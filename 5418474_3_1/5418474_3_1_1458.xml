   <p>There is great dissatisfaction among the democrats at the nominations for city offices made Tuesday. The German democrats are in revolt against the ticket.</p>
   <p>Not only has the Staats Zeitung expressed its determination to oppose Harrison, but the Abend Post, the evening German paper, which has always been democratic, is out against him also. The News, Herald, and Evening post vigorously oppose Carter. The only newspaper that supports him is his own - the Times.</p>
   <p>The business men are strongly against him. A young business man, a democrat of the South Side, said last evening, "I met one-hundred business men during the day and took the trouble to ask them about Carter. I did not find a man who will vote for him." Even some of those who helped to secure his nomination are lukewarm concerning him.</p>
   <p>The labor organizations are dead against him. Robert Swallow, a leader among the labor unionists, George Rohrbach, and others are greatly opposed to him. A. P. Russell of the Building Trades Council denounced his nomination yesterday as an insult to organized labor.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1459.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The North Side democrats are especially sore. They have no representation on the ticket and are kicking. Alderman Rothoff said yesterday, "The Germans have received no recognition. The whole North Side has been neglected. The ticket will be knocked out if the republicans have any sense."</p>
