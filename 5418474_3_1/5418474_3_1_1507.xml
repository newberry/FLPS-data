   <p>The Germans of the 5th senatorial district assembled last night in large numbers in Hoerber Hall, 710 Blue Island Ave., where a German Democratic meeting was announced. About 600 or 700 men were present, representing all trades and professions. They listened to the speakers with rapt attention, and were convinced of the importance of the next election, particularly in regard to the German-Americans in the United States.</p>
   <p>M. Schroeder introduced the first speaker of the evening, Conrad Krez, who is well-known in the United States, and in Germany as a poet, and who is, at the present, the prosecuting attorney of Milwaukee. He captured the hearts of the audience by storm, being a capable, sincere public lecturer. In a very humoristic, as well as pungent and drastic manner <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1508.jpg" n="2"/>he explained the significance of Germanism, pointing out what a great treasure the Germans have in their mother tongue, and how they should preserve and protect it. The speaker asserted that the demand to speak English only, in the United States, is not only unfair, but can not be justified historically nor constitutionally.</p>
   <p>The chief topic, of course, was the real issue of the day, which has deeply aroused the Germans in Illinois, and touches all their interests. The opponents, the speaker declared, have failed to give us an answer, stating in what respect the German schools in the United States are a reproach. Only that which is good is being taught in German schools; teaching children to honor father and mother. Who can deny that the home is the foundation of every form of government? If German children are to learn English well, they must master German first of all. Whoever is against instructions in German, is evidencing that he is afraid the United States might become germanized.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1509.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There is not a word in the constitution, that German shall not be spoken in America. Genuine American is the language of the Sioux, the Choctaws, etc., but English is just as much a foreign language as the German. English is nothing else but a Low-German dialect, mixed with French and Celtic words.</p>
   <p>The Anglo-Saxons went from Holstein to England, and from there to America. If an old Anglo-Saxon came here today, he would not understand his posterity, but he would understand his German tribesmen, who speak pure Anglo-Saxon even today.</p>
   <p>The German language has remained pure, as no other language in the world. If the Germans of Illinois would speak plainly at this election, the so-called Americans would certainly not forget the Germans.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1510.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Edward Law...has no other tendency and purpose than to abolish German from the United States. A law which aims to do this, is inhumanly unjust. The Germans would never attempt to forbid the Anglo-Americans the use of their language. They are trying to be just, as justice only can govern a country.</p>
   <p>The law grants freedom of speech and religious liberty; and the statues of the law can be taught in German, as well as in English, otherwise the decalogue would have to be learned in Hebrew.</p>
   <p>The Germans are loyal and law-abiding citizens. They want no revolution, but only recognition of their rights, and for these they are fighting in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Whoever is not willing to fight for it, is not worthy to be a citizen of this free country. The election will demonstrate that the Germans know how to secure and protect their rights. The time before the election is highly important. The citizens can inform themselves as to which party defends their just cause, and act accordingly.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1511.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Next the tariff question came up for discussion. Krez described how the Republicans are trying to scare the voters with the presumption that the Democrats want to introduce free-trade, in order to get them in the Republican fold. It is absolutely unthinkable, he said, to abolish tariff, because it is the best and safest method to acquire the necessary funds for the government. We will always have high tariffs in order to equalize the difference in European and American wages.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krez consummated his effective speech in appealing to the audience to fight for their rights as Germans, and therefore, to vote for the Democrats.</p>
   <p>Another speaker, Francis Hoffmann, reviewed the development of the school question, and also the growth of the independent German movement. As long as the Edward Law exists, he said, the Germans must and will act unitedly for its repeal. The Republicans have given sweet promises, but they can not be trusted. We must support the Democrats, because they have proven their honesty. J. P. Altgeld has taken a definite and honest stand in this matter, therefore the Germans should vote for Altgeld. His victory would remove the school question forever.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1512.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The Germans have apparently grasped the importance of this matter. This is evidenced by their activities in meetings. However, every German should disseminate propaganda individually, so that an overwhelming victory will be achieved....and the Edward Law forever abolished.</p>
