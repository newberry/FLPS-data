   <p>p. 4 - 5 The foreign communists have indulged in a two days' jamboree at the exposition building, and have had full license to enjoy the selves in their peculiar way. The crowd was a large one, and the Communists proper were undoubtedly reinforced by thousands of people who went there partly from curiosity and partly from sympathy. The rush was so great and the crowd so uncomfortable that the demagogues who lead the unthinking and excitable mob were not able to deliver the speeches which they had prepared, so that there was very little opportunity for talking. The motley multitude was left to crowd, and elbow, and entertain itself, and this it did, principally by swilling and smoking, and in witnessing the drills of the "Lehr Und Wehr Verein", the "Jagers" Verein", and other armed organizations who do not acknowledge allegiance to the militia laws of the state, and are not under any control except that of the demagogues who mislead them.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the time was spent in jubilating about the good time coming, when the state and city governments are to be crushed out, and the property of the citizens confiscated and divided among the "Socialist Sections"....</p>
