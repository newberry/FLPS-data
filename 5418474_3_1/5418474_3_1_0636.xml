  <body>
   <p>Since you refrained from publishing a correction of your report in last Sunday's issue [of the Tribune], and since you did not give any answer to our letter, we feel obliged to publish the letter in order to bring our complaint before a liberal-minded public:</p>
   <p>Mr. Editor: Your report in today's issue about our last night's meeting was entirely false and libelous. We request that you repeat the report, omitting all comments. The presence of your reporter revealed that he was the only one there noticeable for his dirtiness and his foul smell.</p>
   <p>All the others present, both those belonging to our Society--not a socialistic organization but one founded for the purpose of educating the masses on all scientific and economical questions--and those who were visitors were respect-able-looking men and women.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0637.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The topic of Mrs. Parson's and Professor Garside's speeches was "Personal Liberty". If your reporter should come again, we advise him to bring a bottle of eau-de-Cologne so as to spare us his bad smell.</p>
   <p>The members of our Society, and especially the undersigned committee, are always at your disposal, should you desire to call on them.</p>
   <p>The Committee of the Workingmen's Educational Society,</p>
   <p>Chicago, February 24, 1889.</p>
  </body>
