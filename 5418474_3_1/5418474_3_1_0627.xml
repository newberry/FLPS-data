   <p>On April 30, the Workingmen's Educational Society held a meeting in its club house, 450 S. Canal St. During this meeting, Comrades Kopfnagel and Weinbaum analyzed and explained the purpose of the centennial celebration to the audience. They discussed how the constitution, founded 100 years after the then created United States, and now considered so highly is in urgent need of a change, and also to what degree the guaranteed rights, ceded to the citizens of this country are actually warranted.</p>
   <p>Weinbaum cited Thomas Paine's well-known verse:</p>
   <p>"There ne'er will the sons of Columbus be slaves, As long as the earth bears plants and the sea rolls its waves."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0628.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He proved that the words of that liberty loving bard do not contain any truth today.</p>
   <p>At the present time a human being does not exist in the United States who is not a slave. The wealthy are slaves of their capital, the high officials are slaves of the politicians, the politicians are slaves of their own corruption, and we, the proletarians, the people, the only ones who have the right to rule this country, to promote the welfare of this country are slaves of all.</p>
   <p>While they, in spite of their slavery, still remain patricians, we remain the helots.</p>
   <p>If Washington or any one of those great men who risked everything <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0629.jpg" n="3"/>for liberty, would return to the earth, they themselves would demand a change of the existing, now antiquated form of government and would fight for it.</p>
