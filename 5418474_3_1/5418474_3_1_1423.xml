   <p>Hoebers large Hall at Blue Island Avenue was filled last night to the capacity, with enthusiastic German citizens, to pay their tribute to the Democratic candidate for Mayor, "Frank Wenter." The meeting was presided over by Mr. T. C. Diener and took place under the auspices of the Wenter Club of the Southwest side. Mr. Diener in his opening speech pointed out that the German American candidate for Mayor Wenter is the Mayor for the Germans of Chicago. All Germans can be proud of him. As first speaker, Mr. Jacob Ingenthron was presented, who sharply criticized the barter and boodle politics, used by the city council for the last twenty-fice years. Now is the chance for all Germans to show their appreciation for real reform. Not the slightest stain can be found in Wenter's life and his name has a pure sound. He cannot be compared with the ordinary politicians. Not only on account of his descent will the Germans vote for him but also because he would make a capable, conscientious mayor.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was Dr. Theo Rahfs who spoke in Plattdeutsch (Low German) <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1424.jpg" n="2"/>and demonstrated the excellent talents of the next Mayor Wenter and praised his qualification suited for this office. Mrs. Arnold Sturm appealed to all Germans for their cooperation and reminded them of their duty. They must not forget the merits gained by Wenter for the maintenance of German education in the public schools of Chicago and also his interests in gymnastics. Mr. John G. Schaar said that progress and liberty must be the real reform and such could only be expected if Wenter was elected. At that moment Mr. Wenter appeared, welcomed with stormy applause. He held a long speech demonstrating his program, which he would carry through to the letter, if elected. He admitted that his election would be due to the support of the Germans. Mr. H. Wm. Mangler as candidate for town clerk spoke a few words and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
