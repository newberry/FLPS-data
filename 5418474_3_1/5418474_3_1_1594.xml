   <p>The election will be held in four weeks, but both of our major political parties are as indifferent as if the event were in the distant future. Only the Socialists seem prepared; their platform and candidates have been announced.</p>
   <p>The program of the Socialists, as far as county matters are concerned, is just silly. The Socialists demand that all public work be performed by the county and not by contract, also that eight hours shall be considered a day's work, instead of ten hours. This means that the county must pay about one-half million dollars more per year than at present, and that taxes will have to be raised accordingly. Any nincompoop who has been here long enough ought to know that public work provides ample opportunities for large incomes and unrestricted squandering, when the work is under the direction of public officials. This should not be, and would not be, if our administration consisted only of <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1595.jpg" n="2"/>unselfish men. We readily admit this, but it does not change facts. And the word or classification "laborer" is no guarantee whatever against graft. This was amply shown during the recent investigations, when labor and contractors conspired to make as much money as possible during the construction of the Federal building by classifying loafing as labor.</p>
   <p>The demands of the Socialists (regardless of what may be said in favor of their theories) amount to only one thing: The taxpayers must pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more than formerly.</p>
   <p>The Socialist platform also advocates reforms in our public institutions. Splendid! Who would not agree with this--if one only knew just what is meant there-by? The county agent, so it is proclaimed in the platform, shall administer the office for the benefit of the poor, but not for the purpose of buying votes. Yes, yes! But did this happen? Were votes bought with the poor fund? When? Where? How? No information is given on that point.</p>
   <p>The expenditures of the county agent were formerly one-quarter million dollars, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1596.jpg" n="3"/>and dropped to ninety thousand dollars in three years. Would that be evidence that votes were bought? Votes are usually bought by spending money, not by saving!</p>
   <p>The county jail shall be used only for confining criminals. We are under the impression that persons under investigation are also kept there. Or, are these also criminals, according to the Socialists? This opinion coincides with barbaric beliefs prevailing two or three centuries ago--today we consider an accused person innocent until proved guilty by a jury.</p>
   <p>The care of criminals shall not be a source of revenue for party politicians. True enough! We subscribe to this! The question arises: Would the saving be greater by feeding criminals under the contract system, or by letting politicians do the job? Whoever is in doubt can see the county clerk and find out how the former administration fared when the contract system was not used.</p>
   <p>The poorhouse, according to the Socialist program, shall not continue as a <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1597.jpg" n="4"/>slaughterhouse for decrepit, overworked, exploited, helpless people, but shall be a haven of refuge. Very nice! We wonder if any of the people who applauded so loudly when this sentence was read at the local Socialist convention have ever seen the poorhouse and compared it with an English, German or French asylum? We are in doubt! Whatever may be said about graft and corruption, the inmates are vastly better off than the poor people abroad; in fact, hundreds of thousands of workers who labor twelve and even fourteen hours per day in Germany would be very happy indeed if they could have as good food, light, air, and shelter as the inmates of our poorhouse. Furthermore, the Socialists want only deserving poor people in that home. What would they do about the undeserving poor who, according to Socialistic views, came into such a state of disgrace through the prevailing system? Should this class be locked up in jails, although they committed no crime (unworthiness is not yet registered as a crime in our statutes), or in penetentiaries? Or, simpler yet, should we just kill them?</p>
   <p>Verily, our fat bourgeois has more humanitarian inclinations; they even provide <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1598.jpg" n="5"/>food, clothing, and shelter to the underserving--three and five times as much as Germany provides for the most eligible persons.</p>
   <p>Let this, then, suffice! Apparently the Socialists are interested only in pharases, in a boom for the Socialist cause.</p>
   <p>It reminds us of the old German proverb, "If it's in print, it must be so!" And in conformance with that belief, the Socialists use words and more words in an endeavor to start a boom. Our well-fed citizens agree with whatever appears to be sensible in the Socialist platform, particularly the paragraphs which advocate reforms in our administration. So do we! Wherever and whenever the Socialists do something to improve the existing order, we are definitely in favor of it, but they must not gum up the works.</p>
   <p>It does not make much difference how much nonsense might be contained in the platform--as far as the election is concerned--since none of the Socialists have any chance of being elected. Ernst Schmidt, because of his great popularity, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1599.jpg" n="6"/>was able to alienate about three or four thousand votes from the two major parties during the last election. The Socialists control about eight thousand votes, or one eighth of the total. The seven eighths will be divided between the Democrats and Republicans. Whoever can obtain four eighths (one half) of the total will win on November 4.</p>
   <p>Which of the two parties will win depends upon the candidates the Democrats or Republicans are going to select. The Republicans have a chance, and probably will win if suitable candidates are chosen. By that are meant men of character, not persons who are known as smart politicians. And character signifies men of attainment (not financial wizards) who have prestige, and are therefore able to impress even their political opponents. If the Republicans can find such men--and they are not to be found among the usual run of office seekers--then the Republicans can win. That is the only chance to eliminate the Irish Democrats.</p>
