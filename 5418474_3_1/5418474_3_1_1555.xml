   <p>The fault finding Freie Presse quotes some of the remarks of the Tribune about the large number of Irishmen sent to the new council and who have seized nearly all the chairmanships, and then with ignorance of history and chronology, the Freie Presse says, "that this result was due to the course of the Tribune and its Republican friends in estranging the Germans by running after prohibition and similar notions."</p>
   <p>It says, "The Tribune did not go astray after prohibition, but that it and the Journal are supporting the compulsory education bill, which it calls "an infamous measure"; although compulsory education is a German idea, copied from the fatherland."</p>
   <p>He must have been a keen observer, who noticed the influence of the compulsory education law, or of prohibition on the recent aldermanic elections. The first of these was not an issue in any manner, shape, or form. The second has not been an issue since 1873, when the Germans united with the Irish to repeal an old Democratic city ordinance forbidding the sale of liquor on Sundays. Since then, many of the Germans have clung to their Irish allies, serving them as hewers of wood and carriers of water.</p>
   <p>They have not been well paid in offices for their services; for the Irish office seekers prefer to keep the offices for themselves. Thus they did not put <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1556.jpg" n="2"/>a German on their West Town ticket, and yet elected their candidates by aid of the German votes. The Irish like offices and they hustle for them. They organize to get them, and with their perfect team work they, though only the third in strength of the great voting elements of the city, carry off most of the spoils. It was their superior ability in that line and not any recent German disaffection, which won them so many offices Apr. 1st.</p>
   <p>The Americans can stand it if the Germans can, but if the editor of the Freie Presse thinks that the Americans, in order to make sure of certain German votes, are going to resolve that the rum-hole is the best place from which to select aldermen, collectors, treasurers, legislators, etc., and that the rum-seller is the "noblest work of God", he is much mistaken.</p>
