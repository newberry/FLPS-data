   <p>About 300 of the chosen few who uphold the Socialist creed collected yesterday in the Plaisance about three blocks east of Cottage Grove Avenue. Posted on a tree at 59th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue were these inscriptions: "Socialists: If you will take the risk of finding the Socialists' spot without the aid of the committee go thus: About three blocks east of Cable, start a little to the south-east and good luck with you. Otherwise come back and wait for the committee."</p>
   <p>The "spot" was a well wooded knoll, suitable for the purpose to which it was put yesterday. The picnickers gathered in small crowds and discussed the questions of the day, all the speaking being done in German. About 2 o'clock a grocery wagon arrived with a load of beer, and the remainder of the day the picnickers spent in drinking together. As the sparkling beverage began to affect the merry crowd they became somewhat louder in the expression of their belief, and some leaders would collect knots of people around themselves and expound the law in loud German.</p>
   <p>The crowd disbanded after singing German songs and reciting reminiscenses of <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0622.jpg" n="2"/>the old country. The small attendance, it was claimed, was due to the fact that the organization was divided, the divisions spending the day in different places.</p>
