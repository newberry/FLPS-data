   <p>The gentlemen with their one hundred per cent patriotism and their elastic conscience are indebted to Hans Bonfield. It is he, who is responsible for the defeat of our narrow-minded fellow citizens and according to Judge Tuley - made Chicago the laughing stock of the whole country.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Citizens' Association will reward him with a night watchman's star of gold,because this gentleman likes such little presents. Judge Tuley stated that the utterances of a "nervous and excited policeman" do not amount to anything and should be disregarded.</p>
   <p>Nervous and excited means in good German: insane; and why should Chicago not be dominated by a gang of lunatics? Mr. Tuley did not issue an order of restraint, because both parties agreed beforehand to submit to the judge's decision. We therefore expect that the police will take a different course in the future and will rely on agents provocateurs.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0643.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some remarks, which the noble Knight made yesterday, justify our opinion and we want to make this observation right now. It is therefore up to the Arbeiter Bund to remove all these spies from its membership list, because this is the only way to meet Mr. Bonfield's treachery.</p>
