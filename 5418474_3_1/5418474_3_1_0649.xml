   <p>Master-in-Chancery Windes announced his decision the day before yesterday in the case of the laborers' association vs. Roche, Hubbard and Bonfield. We took the trouble to read the voluminous act from beginning to end, but have to confess that we still do not know the standpoint of Mr. Windes in regard to the controversy.</p>
   <p>We gained the impression, while reading the document, that it evaded the real issue. Mr. Windes does not intend to violate the constitution but at the same time he does not want to hurt Messrs. Roche, Hubbard and Bonfield too much. He states that in the United States we have the right of free assembly and of free speech, and that the police should not prevent such meetings, but should rather prosecute those who misuse free speech in accordance with the penal code.</p>
   <p>He declares further that the club heroes of this city were in the wrong when prohibiting the meetings of the laborers' association - but at the same time he refuses to recommend to the judge the issuance of an injunction. He thus says in short: "The members of the laborers' association are of course right and the police consequently wrong; but it is impossible to pass judgment <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0650.jpg" n="2"/>in favor of the one or the other."</p>
   <p>This is the impression which Mr. Windes' opinion gives, and we find the same thoughts expressed in the leading articles of certain English newspapers. The Herald, the most frequently abusive paper, says for instance: "Windes has to deal with mad dogs. They have no rights here. They would do well in leaving our city. Nobody cares for their feelings or their privileges. Chicago is giving its authorities carte blanche to make anarchism hated and unpopular."</p>
   <p>This statement is more explicit than the one Mr. Windes dared to make. Whoever is not convinced that we are living here in the best of worlds, whoever has the stupid belief that things here could still be improved, has no rights here. He is a mad dog and deserves to be killed as a mad dog.</p>
   <p>In order to achieve this, the policemen are given free rein to do absolutely anything. They are permitted to have their stools, throw bombs and later to hang innocent people for it.</p>
   <p>They furthermore are allowed to "find" bombs - as Bonfield is already doing <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0651.jpg" n="3"/>from time to time - and to invent lies about robbery, in order to make the "anarchists" more hated and unpopular. The more such robbery tales can be invented the better.</p>
   <p>For so much the sooner will these "obstinate foreigners" become odious, repulsive and abhorrent to the public at large.</p>
