   <p>was called, to get the Committee's report on the completion of the proposal for the next National convention of the Party Socialist Labor and to get their decision on it. Notwithstanding the importance of the meeting, the members appeared in a small number only, which was probably partly due, to the campaign meetings, which have already begun. First of all, a letter from Comrade H. Stahl had been read, in which he declined to accept the appointment as the Campaign Secretary, offered him by the "Local Central Committee." The letter was handed to the Organizer of the Main Section, Mr. Morgan, to be attended to. After this, Mr. Sievers in the name of the Committee, told of the Section's proposition to the next National Convention. As for the principles of the Party-Program, there was only one change proposed, Which deals with the proposed conception which has been indorsed in an Editorial of the "Arbeiter Zeitung" was not accepted, but after a lively debate, has been accepted in a shorter form, proposed by Mr. J. Franz. The point in question was, whether the Unions are to be considered as a necessity on a "Socialistic basis" only, or to be <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0991.jpg" n="2"/>considered for "its own sake."</p>
   <p>The next step of the meeting was, that the Committee proposed a change of the platform, whereby the political aims should be put before it. Then came the proposals of the Committee, read by Reviewer Sievers, which suggests a partial change of the present planks, and party in order to construct new ones.</p>
