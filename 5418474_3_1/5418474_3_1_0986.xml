   <p>Under his leadership, the debate on different points of the" order of the day" had begun, and following are The conclusions: It has been decided, to instruct the delegates to the Congress, to see to it, that there should be a lively participation of the Party at the National election; further, to have the Congress discuss the question, whether it would be possible for the" Socialist Labor Party" to elect their own presidential candidate. The delegates were also instructed, to work for the right of the Party, to keep the name, under which they are known. The attitude of the corresponding secretary of the National Executive Committee, Philipp Van Patten was submitted to a sharp criticism, and therefore, the delegates instructed, to use their influence, against his re-election.</p>
