   <p>....We are informed from reliable sources that the armed communist societies do not intend to follow the advice of Dennis K. Schmidt to resort to bloodshed under the red flag of liberty to defeat the [militia] law. They may have been desirous of resorting to violence, but probably changed their minds because of the Bohemian shooting affair. Now the communists want a court decision to show whether the law is constitutional or not.</p>
   <p>To attain that end, the communists intend to have a small number of men attend a drill at some out-of-the-way place, in defiance of the law; then someone will report the occurrence to the police, the latter will arrest the lieutenant who commands the small troop, the regular communist lawyer will go to the communist judge (McAllister) and institute habeas corpus proceedings to liberate the men on the ground that the law is unconstitutional. If McAllister decides that the militia law is not enforceable because it disregards the constitution--and this <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0995.jpg" n="2"/>is the verdict the communists expect--then the law would be inoperative until the state's attorney is confronted with another case, which must then be brought to the Supreme Court (since no appeals are made from habeas corpus decisions). With respect to the eventual outcome before the Supreme Court, no concern is expressed at present.</p>
   <p>If the intentions of the communists are honest and comply with the aforesaid, then one must admit they act much more prudently than they write or speak. Such a peaceful investigation of the constitutionality of the law is fully permissible, and has been resorted to in numerous instances to test other statutes. Of course, McAllister's election depended on the communists, and his verdict is by no means final; eventually the Supreme Court will have something to say in the matter. If that court upholds the militia law, then the communists must disband their armed forces, or those members who are citizens may swear allegiance to the flag and become incorporated with the state militia, where the communists may not fight for "liberty" but would have to defend the Constitution, law and order.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0996.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Furthermore, a test case can be provided in an easier manner. The communists need not tramp around in some out-of-the-way place, which is quite disagreeable during the present summer heat, since the law not only prohibits parading about with arms, but also makes it unlawful to belong to a military organization which is not authorized by the Governor. Therefore, it is only necessary to obtain a warrant for the arrest of any communist leader or member of the Lehr Und Wehrverein (Education and Defence Club) or the Jaegerverein (Hunter's Club) who does not deny his affiliation. The case would then continue according to the program, and it would eliminate the necessity of ten or twenty men spoiling their nicely starched white collars in the torrid temperature.</p>
