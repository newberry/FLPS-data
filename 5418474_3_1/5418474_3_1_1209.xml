   <p>Among the candidates on the Republican ticket there is one whose name awakens a favorable response in German circles. We refer to William C. Scherwat, who is running for the office of county clerk. Mr. Scherwat is of German descent, and he has never denied his German descent. He is still a comparatively young man; if, in spite of that fact, a large and powerful wing of the Republican organization put him up for the important office of county clerk, this is due chiefly to his frequently demonstrated efficiency, to his organizing ability, and to his tactful and friendly manner which make him especially qualified for this office. Mr. Scherwat has always taken a sympathetic and active part in the activities of the German-speaking element in Chicago. All German Republicans in the county should vote for him.</p>
   <p>John F. Devine, who seeks the nomination for county treasurer on the Republican <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1210.jpg" n="2"/>ticket, also deserves to be considered an old friend of the Chicago Germans. Devine is of Irish descent, as is well known, but he, too, has always fostered friendly relations with the Germans. He has held a number of important positions and proved himself well worthy of them all. Even his political adversaries and rivals admit that he has always been distinguished for his honesty and reliability. He, too, deserves the undivided support of the German Republicans.</p>
   <p>P. J. Carr, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the office of sheriff, is in the enviable position of having no competitor. Many voters may therefore be tempted to overlook him in the primaries. The German voters should not do that, however, for it is much to the honor of a candidate if he can draw a large number of votes. It is not only an honor, but it is also an advantage. This is why a cross should be placed opposite the name of Patrick Carr on election day. He deserves it.</p>
   <p>The Bar Association has for years followed the custom of announcing its preferences in the judicial elections. In most cases the judgment of the Bar <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1211.jpg" n="3"/>Association weighs heavily with the voters. For this reason the chances of Henry P. Heizer, who is running for the office of municipal judge, must be rather good. The Bar Association puts him high on the list of candidates, proof enough that he is respected by the members of his profession, and that they consider him well qualified for the office of judge. Mr. Heizer is of German descent and deserves the support of the German voters.</p>
