   <p>Since the eight-hour movement struck a snag-although the N. Y. Volkszeitung said it would be a world event of as much historical significance as Columbus' egg--we have heard no more about the proposed co-operative furniture factory. We hope the idea was not given up. It would be regrettable. If the workers become their own employers, that would provide the best opportunity for a proper understanding of the relationship between employer and employee. The workers would not then be the slaves of capitalists, nor would it be necessary to sweat blood to fatten further the well-nourished snobs; besides, the workers would not be robbed of the profits created by toil. The workers could keep the entire profits, and might even work six hours instead of eight, if that is deemed preferable.</p>
   <p>If the workers are convinced that, in our economic system, the capitalists obtain the lion's share of the profits whenever merchandise is sold--that <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0348.jpg" n="2"/>the workers are abused to attain this end, and are finally cheated out of a just reward--then we cannot see why the men hesitate a moment in trying out their plan [a co-operative furniture factory]. Surely, they are not going to admit that they themselves are incapable of managing a business, and that a boss is needed.</p>
   <p>All our large manufacturers, with very few exceptions, began as workers, and the times then were not as good as now. In former years, interest rates on borrowed capital were twice as high as today. What the capitalists did, of their own accord, should easily be accomplishable today by the combined efforts of fifty or one hundred capable workers.</p>
   <p>The workingmen can reach their goal, as long as they stick to it; that means, as long as they agree, and do not distrust each other, and as long as the better worker does not consider himself superior to his fellow workers and is satisfied to receive the same wage. The men can act unselfishly and work for the common good.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0349.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>These conditions depend upon the attitude of the men, provided they have enough character to suppress certain human traits, which might be summarised as follows: Ambition, the desire to earn, the sense of acquisition, the pride of accomplishment, and, unfortunately jealousy.</p>
   <p>Some of the idealists, who want to make the world a better place to live in, claim that these human traits were developed only in a capitalistic society, and therefore will dissappear when the environment changes; but there will only be a few who will be convinced by such assurances. At all events, since we still have that terrible capitalism with us, we also are confronted with human behavior in its present form, and must take cognizance of it.</p>
   <p>The best example came to our attention recently, at the council of the reformers, where some of the most respected agitators were shown to be nothing but crooks, where the workers proved that their leaders obtained spot cash to influence the workers. Since then, the socialists who made the exposures <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0350.jpg" n="4"/>have been banished from the ranks, on the grounds that they were agitators! Vice, therefore, triumphed over virtue, and cheating became the order of the day.</p>
   <p>If such things can happen, even among the supreme leaders of the socialists, then one must admit that the co-operative venture may face similar conditions. Even when only two or three men form a partnership, there is not always smooth sailing--and dissention, even dissolution, is not uncommon. A co-operative enterprise representing fifty or one hundred partners naturally faces still greater difficulties.</p>
   <p>Let us not see only the black side, but consider the brighter aspect. Supposing the co-operative plant functions, the men work harmoniously and are interested only in working for the good of all. Then, their example might be exceedingly important in pointing to the solution of the social question. If it is shown that the members of the co-operative concern earn just as much or more during eight hours of work than they earned in ten hours while working for others, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0351.jpg" n="5"/>then the example will be emulated everywhere, and employers will be forced to pay higher wages and agree to shorter working hours. And no strikes, threats or violence will be required to make employers amenable to the new order. All such measures will become superfluous, because employers will then compete for labor.</p>
   <p>But, if the co-operative venture is not successful, and the sale of goods requires a lowering of the present wage scale, then the workingmen will realize that the usurious gains of our capitalists (derived from the sweat of labor) were highly overestimated. The workers will then find that the profits of capitalists were fully justified, and were not obtained by mulcting the workers; that the fat citizen's income was derived from good management, capable judgment in considering marketing possibilities, prudent buying of raw material, proper observation of demand, and knowing the public's taste. The workers will then see that the savings effected by eliminating the manager of a concern will not suffice to raise wages.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0352.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>But regardless of the outcome, anyone wishing to make a true comparison between capital and labor would like to see the experiment tried. It would be a much better solution of the social question if the worker considers himself to be his own boss instead of a wage slave; and that also would abolish the two-class system in our social setup--two classes sworn to enmity until death.</p>
