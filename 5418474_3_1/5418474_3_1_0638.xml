  <body>
   <p>A large crowd filled the halls of the "Vorwarts Turnhalle" at West 12th Street, yesterday, About twenty clubs mostly singing and athletic had arranged a large concert and ball for the benefit of the families of the executed anarchists. The"Central Labor Union, "and the"Pioneer Aid and Support Association" cooperated, and the program was well arranged and carried out brilliantly. The audience, being estimated at 7,000 persons, refrained from all demonstration, and nothing betrayed the character of the gathering with the exception of a few red flowers and red bands, which some of the guests carried. The whole affair made upon the visitors the impression that it was a cheerful gathering and that all were enjoying the skillful performances of the singers, the musicians, and the athletes. Some of the numbers were rendered, indeed, with such marvelous skill that there was evidence of true understanding and commendable zeal on the part of the performers to created real enjoyment in the audience.</p>

   <p>Two hundred singers under the direction of Prof. O. W. Richter, gave "Swiss Heimweh" and other songs such as "United and Faithful", etc... The appointed speakers were the Messrs. R. Swallow (English) and J. Christensen(German). Mr. Swallow was not able to be present, and the socialist preacher, "Professor" Garside, served as a substitute. He let loose one of his well-known tirades, and Mr. Christensen pointed out the purpose of this gathering.</p>
   <p>One part of the program was carried on without a single disturbance. Even Garsides ' critical remarks against capitalism induced a temporary applause only, and although the waves of fanatical excitement went high at different times during the speech, all was soon back to mormal again, because of the happiness and cheerful attitude prevailing in the crowd.</p>
