   <p>Mr. Domes presided at yesterday's business meeting of the Northside Socialists. The proposition of the General Committee to loan $100.00 to the Arms Fund was approved. Three comrades were nominated to make a proposition to the General Committee in order to settle this matter. The election of officers resulted as follows: Secretary Rau, Finance Secretary Hermann, Librarian Hirschberger and Comptroller Reimdal. Edward Schnaubelt, Schrodter and Rau were elected to the General Committee. There are now 130 members in good standing. The officers reports were approved. A motion to visit the meeting of the Socialist Workmen's party Wednesday evening in their locality, 58 Clybourn Ave., was accepted, and the members were requested to appear there as early as possible. The order of the day referred to the participation in the election and Messrs. Vahlteich, Winneu and Steckelberg will be the speakers. A montion to celebrate the founding festival at the beginning of May, was carried and Comrades Pelling, Rau, R. Schnaubelt and Lange were designated to arrange the necessary steps.</p>
