   <p>At the bed of suffering, ailing society, many celebrated doctors from different lands of culture, found themselves together yesterday. Two eminent representatives of opposite churches, namely the Catholic Rector, Dr. McGlynn and the Methodist Bishop Fallows; famous Labor leaders as Samuel Gompers, president of the Federation of Labor, and Thomas Morgan, the English Socialist; world famous writers of the type of the witty, but one-sided Henry George; Kate Field, the lawyer Darrow - a so-called tame anarchist, - and still many other authorities and capacities; they all conferred together as to how the poor patient could be helped. The result was exactly the same, as if at the bedside of a bodily suffering patient a homeopathist, an allopathist, an eclectic, a nature doctor and a defender of Christian Science had met. As no agreement could be reached, the patient gets no medicine prescribed at all and he will have to wait till his imperturbable constitution gives him a lift.</p>
   <p>That the representatives of the different "schools" look at each other as quacks and feel sorry for each other about the ignorance shown, could be noticed clearly enough in their speeches. With a sovereign disdain that <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0592.jpg" n="2"/>gives one the consciousness of his scientific infallibility, the great George went over the diagnosis of the other doctors. According to his ideas the illness is caused solely by the private ownership of land and property and proposes therefore, to acquire all the land for the state, by the simple method of overtaxation, and to lease only the usufruct. This proposal does not go far enough for the socialist, because, in his opinion, the movable capital is the bacillus, that undermines the health of human society. Therefore he prescribes as remedy the acquisition of all means of labor and total abolition of wage labor. Over this naivete the anarchist doctor smiles again, who sees in the state itself the source of all evil, and promises to the patient a sure cure, if he agrees for himself, to unlimited personal liberty. But all these opinions together seem to be only Utopian dreams to the labor Union man. Ignoring the fact that also the farmers, the industrialists, the business men, the scholars and artisans are not altogether satisfied, he believes himself to be able to give the sickness a life by organizing all industrial wage-laborers. The protestant preacher holds insufficient all human means, and advises return to the Christian doctrines. The blue stockings <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0593.jpg" n="3"/>do not like it that the laborers squeeze together in the cities, while the farmer is short on "hands" and he has therefore worked out a beautiful plan for more equal distribution of labor through a federal labor office; finally all the doctors went home, each one felt offended that his diagnosis was not recognized as the only true one, and his recipe was not sent immediately to the drug store.</p>
   <p>If the pitiable patient would have to swallow all the medicines which are prescribed for him by the different authorities and capacities, he would become miserably ruined. It is his good fortune that he does not need to let himself be fed by force. As he is now convinced, that the learned doctors cannot help him, he will endure his pains in patience and intend to get well by his own will-power. And it will be only a short time when he will laugh about the great doctors who thought to give him up already.</p>
