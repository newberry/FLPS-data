   <p>A very well attended meeting of the German Section, was held yesterday at 45 North Clark Street, at which, chairman Gen.Emil Hannemann was presiding. - A committee of the Morgan faction made it's appearance, in order to contact the German Section, as to the creation of a joint committee for the reception arrangements, for the German Socialists Viereck and Fritzsche. - This proposition has not been accepted however, moreover, it has been decided to act independently, and do the utmost, to make those gentlemen's visit here, a success. With this in mind, the comrades Grottkau, Spies and Bartels were appointed for the committee, who have been entrusted with the extensive preparations for the reception of Messrs. Viereck and Fritzsche: Comrades A. Spies, Oscar Neebe, Gustav Horig and E. Hannemann were appointed delegates for the central committee.</p>
   <p>In view of the spring election, the Section has decided for a lively agitation in the 6th, 7th, 14th and 16th wards, and considering also the 5th and 15th ward, in which there are great possibilities for the election of the Socialist candidates.</p>
   <p>After a discussion of other business matters, the meeting adjourned.</p>
