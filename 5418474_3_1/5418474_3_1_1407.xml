   <p>The Executive-Committee of the German Democratic Club of the 22nd Ward, issued the following appeal:</p>
   <p>"To the German-Democrats of the 22nd Ward:-</p>
   <p>Against the will of the predominating majority of the Democratic citizens of our ward, through brutal force and cunning intrigues of people, who have been placed at the head, to act impartially in the interest of the Democratic majority, the man upon whom every citizen of this ward can look with pride and confidence, our present Alderman, A. W. Maltby, as regular candidate of the Democrats was eliminated from the ballot. The German-Democratic Club of 22nd Ward, which, as well as the regular Ward Club endorsed Maltby's candidacy, is not willing to stand such action, against the principles of true Democrats on the part of some despotic officials."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1408.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Germans of our Ward- and nine-tenths of its population are Germans-believe, that, if they desire a German for Alderman, that they are able to select him themselves, and do not need the help of other nationalities. We therefore call on all German Democrats, to give their votes on April 6th to the present independent Democratic candidate, Mr. Maltby, and through an overwhelming majority to prove, that the German was always against force and on the side of justice.</p>
