   <p>Next Tuesday will be election day, therefore, in conformity to our promises, it is time that we publish the black list of candidates who are not worthy of the voters confidence; their sole purpose is, to line their own and friend's pockets, or to adopt some measure which is detrimental to the majority. We begin with the list of City Officials. (Candidates.) In the 1st Ward; Cremer, Dem. of German Origin is preferable. 2nd, Ward, Ald. Vierling, Rep. (for re-election) is preferable. 3rd Ward is Republican its representative a friend of monopolies. An independent last minute candidate should be selected. The 4th Ward; Rep. candidate Hepburn, an agent for the South Side Streetcar Company and a friend of monopolies. Unfortunately, respectable citizens have no alternative. 5th Ward; Three German candidates; The independent, Schaar, deserves support and should be elected. 6th Ward. Burke, the prototype of a bad city father, a "Clanna-Gael", no one should support him. 7th Ward; 3 candidates: D. C. Deegan, Dem. although unknown, is preferable. 8th Ward; One as bad as the other. <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1558.jpg" n="2"/>9th Ward; Editor prefers a Rep. Nominee. 10th Ward; Mr. Schwerin (indep.) is given encomuims, 13th Ward, 14th Ward Dem. preferable. 15th Ward, a German lawyer, deserves support, Democrat.</p>
