   <p>The "eyes of the nation" are not focused on Chicago today. "The fate of the United States" remains undecided and the results of the next presidential election will not be influenced in the least by today's mayoral vote. Every-thing the stump speakers said during the last fortnight about the relation of local to national elections was sheer nonsense. Today's balloting is not a "world-shaking event".</p>
   <p>However, it is an election which concerns every taxpayer; it is serious enough to shatter our complacency since the matter affects our pocketbooks. The question is: Shall Chicago have an honest, economical, business-like administration during the next two years--a management which will provide the best service for the least amount of money--or are we to endure a repetition of the Colvin system which plundered the citizens to satiate a horde of voracious <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1620.jpg" n="2"/>Irish ward heelers, and to obtain the wherewithal to bring about a victory of the rebel Democratic party during the national election.</p>
   <p>If Harrison is elected, then undoubtedly, our municipal affairs will be managed mainly in the interests of the Democratic party; not because Harrison wants to, but because he has no alternative. He is not the type of man who will shirk his duties toward the organization, and, even if he wanted to, his efforts would be balked and would come to nothing. Anyone who votes for Harrison may rest assured that the "Hungry Irish" will owe him ardent thanks for his decision, and as usual the debt will remain unpaid.</p>
   <p>It is not a nice spectacle to see the Germans acting as cat's-paw for the Irish and pulling their chestnuts out of the fire. However, if a German-American Republican is willing to oblige the Irish in the above manner, then he should do so openly, not clandestively or circuitously; the latter applies when he votes for [Dr.] Ernst Schmidt [Translator's note: Socialist candidate for <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1621.jpg" n="3"/>mayor]. He is the candidate of a strange alliance, namely, the Socialists and our fellow citizens of Jewish faith.</p>
   <p>What will Bebel, Toelke, Hasenclever and the rest of the Socialist Jew-baiters in in Germany say to such a combination! The abnegation. of our Jewish fellow citizens is really touching when one realizes that they are supporting the snobs" and (at least, as far as printed matter goes) promises the gallows for them.. Its counterpart can only be found in Bayreuth where Jewish "enthusiasts" pay homage to the great anti-Semite, the mad composer, Wagner. How the Socialists will laugh tomorrow when they list as alliance members such gentlemen as Cohn, Kahn, and Meyers....and register them as communists! And that, of course, will be the procedure of the Socialists. Anyone who votes for Schmidt because he is a good man or a capable physician will now be labeled as a gory world revolutionist and destroyer of capitalism.</p>
   <p>No sensible person, not even Mr. Schmidt himself, believes that he can be <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1622.jpg" n="4"/>elected, and, obviously, every vote for him will benefit the Democratic candidate, Harrison.</p>
   <p>The voter who knows this and admits it objectively, will undoubtedly be more honest if he votes for Harrison directly, because today's election is not an "informal ballot," [words printed in English] whereby a "complimentary vote" is given a friend. Whoever regards it as such, may live to regret it bitterly.</p>
   <p>Item: The citizen who was satisfied with Heath's administration during the past three years and wants a continuation of the same--should vote for Wright today; anyone who wants a new edition of Colvin's methods and is willing to pay more taxes to feed a large number of Irishmen, should cast his ballot for Harrison or Schmidt.</p>
