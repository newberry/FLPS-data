   <p>For a long time there have been signs of a split in the Labor Party pertaining to its socialistic, communistic and more conservative elements. The Ultra-Socialists of the Party, mostly Germans, want the name of the Labor Party changed to Socialist Labor Party. The less radical elements of the Party do not agree with this and called a meeting yesterday at the City Hall after the session of the city council. This meeting was presided over by Mr. A. W. Herr, who introduced Mr. W. V. Barr as speaker of the day.</p>
   <p>Mr. Barr gave a short history of the Labor Party and explained why all achievements of the Labor Party should be accomplished with the exclusion of radical elements.</p>
   <p>Thereupon the meeting voted by a large majority to keep the old name "Labor Party" and set up the following aims as a new program:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1089.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1.The acceptation of an eight hour work day for any kind of work, except farm work.</p>
   <p>2.The elimination of convict work in any trade, and the use of convicts in public maintenance work only.</p>
   <p>3.The abolition of the conspiracy laws, which mark the worker a criminal, because he is trying to protect his only property, the job - while the capitalists are at liberty to raise the prices of food etc and to cut down the wages of labor.</p>
   <p>4.The recall of vagrancy laws, which make poverty a crime.</p>
   <p>5.The sanction of all laws by the nation's referendum before their ratification.</p>
   <p>6.The abolition of child labor under the age of fourteen in any industry or factory.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1090.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>7. The elimination of private street car companies and confiscation of their lines, as soon as they violate the concession rules, and the introduction of a three cent street car fare under city management.</p>
   <p>8. The purchase of all gas plants on a reasonably low estimation, or the construction of new city owned gas plants. The maximum of $1.50 per 1,000 feet for the consumers.</p>
   <p>9. The abolition of the contract system for all public work, direct payment and supervision of all pertaining labor through city employees and a time schedule of eight hours per day.</p>
   <p>10. The abrogation of all national banks and their replacement by Federal Banks, the notes of which always could be exchanged for currency in gold or silver.</p>
   <p>The program, as outlined above, was adopted through acclamation by the meeting, which then adjourned in an orderly fashion.</p>
