   <p>The Socialist Labor Party, had yesterday afternoon, a very large meeting at Chicago Avenue Hall, 17th Ward. Mr. Alfred Gould, the Socialist Alderman of the 17th Ward, introduced Mr. Eric Johnson as a speaker. He spoke in the Swedish language. He joined the "Worker's Party" and promised to vote for our candidates next election. Comrade Fred Korth was next speaker and spoke briefly in English, advising all members to follow their leaders in the new party. Mr. Warner was the next speaker. He complained that the "Workers" took too little interest in the work of the party and that the Republicans were working hand in hand, whenever it came to protecting the capitalist. He claimed that the old parties were grafters and always against the poor man.</p>
   <p>The Socialist is a hard working man and is willing to fight for his principles. The Labor Party wants better schools and better living conditions and will have it some day.</p>
