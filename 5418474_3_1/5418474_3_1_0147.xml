   <p>The Union Council meeting was held yesterday noon at 193 Washington Street. It was its semi-monthly session with about 25 delegates present. President Rodgers acted as chairman.</p>
   <p>Delegate Cain could not see why Chicago's workingman should not have the same privilege of getting some property at the lake front to build a large Union Hall, as our militia Regiments possess, for the purpose of shotting down discontented wage slaves. Delegate Murphy reported that in the name of the organization-committee, he has called a meeting for all Brewery employees, but, was not able to build up an organization, because none could master the English language and there was no German-speaking delegates who could have made himself comprehensible to both sides. At the conclusion of this, two Germans were assigned to the organizing committee and thereupon a second meeting of the Brewers was called. The delegates Bonnefot and Schmalbach were added to the committee.</p>
