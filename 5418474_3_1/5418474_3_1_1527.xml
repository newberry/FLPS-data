   <p>Nearly three weeks have passed since the recent local election. The Anglo-American press mentioned all kinds of reasons for the sudden political revolt, but not the true reason, the real cause, which was the resentment and abhorrence of the German-Americans against the rapidly spreading corruption in local politics and administration under the leadership of unscrupulous politicians. The real cause, which is so clearly in evidence, was not recognized by those organs of public opinions. Perhaps they did not care to do so, as not a word about it was mentioned in their columns. But why should the German and Bohemian population of the respective wards receive credit for their concerted action from journalists of the opposing nationalities? This would be too stupid.</p>
   <p>Whether the Anglo-Irish as Raster called the Anglo-Saxons like it or not, it is an established fact that almost one-third of Chicago's population is Germans or of German descent. Every change that has been made for the improvement of our local government can be traced to the German-American element of our population; therefore we may assert that this element represents the sound nucleus, or the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1528.jpg" n="2"/>political leaven, as it were, for the development of this metropolis. It is not mere flattery, but the simple and true restatement of an undeniable fact, that during the last quarter of a century no move toward real improvements, or in a progressive and liberal direction, no radical changes of old and rotten conditions has taken place, without the energetic and united actions of the German-Americans. It can not be denied that the average German-Americans justly deserve the reproach that they are indifferent towards public affairs, but they may offer as an excuse for their lack of activity in political meetings, etc., that they can not participate in the wild doings of the political Irish gang - not to be confused, of course, with the Irish population in general. However, the German American is fully aware of his duties as a citizen, notwithstanding his apparent indifference toward politics.</p>
   <p>The unique sense of justice has proven itself again at the recent election and those who were elected can, with few exceptions, give credit to the German-Americans. To do so would take little effort and would involve no expense, because the German-Americans demand no extra privileges, but only equality with all other citizens.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1529.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>They definitely ask for a decent liberal and economical administration of the city, and a just and even rate of tax-assessment of the different townships, as long as the absurdities of separate town administrations exist. There are too many lazy heads in the City Council for us to entertain hope for the immediate future as far as a decent and reasonable administration is concerned, but the nuisance of separate township administrations must be attacked immediately.</p>
   <p>It is indeed commendable of the Germans that they periodically and unitedly make a clean-sweep of public corruption, but it would be much more effective if they gave the public servants to understand that they are watched and that the taxpayers are the masters in these public affairs. It would be even better if the German-Americans would exert their powerful influence for the abolition of the prevalent abominable system of taxation and the seven-headed township administration within the City limits, as well as the double-headed county and city government. It seems to me that the many achievements the Germans in Chicago have effected in the field of local politics ought to be an adequate inducement and encourage them to fight for such far-reaching results.</p>
