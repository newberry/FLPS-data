   <p>The Illinois state association of the German-American National Bund has issued an urgent request to all its members in the state to vote for Henry W. Huttmann, of Chicago, Dr. J. T. Montgomery, of Charleston, and Robert R. Ward, of Benton. All three are candidates for the board of directors of the state university. In a circular letter, sent by the president, Fred Schmidt, and the secretary, Charles Christmann, to all local associations, it was pointed out that the state convention in Freeport has indorsed the candidacy of German-minded men for the directorship of the state university. For this reason, the executive committee recommended Messrs. Huttmann, Montgomery, and Ward. The members of the state association would, therefore, be honor-bound to rally to the support of the three candidates seeking this honorary office. Every local association should, therefore, do its utmost in campaigning for the three candidates, among German circles and otherwise.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1357.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The executive committee of the state association has this to say about the three candidates:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Huttmann is well known and highly respected in German circles. For many years he was a member of the board of education, and has gained a reputation as a promoter of German-language instruction and German-style gymnastics in Chicago's public schools. German-Americans will have a representative in the state university who will do honor to the German element of this state. The other two candidates, we are reliably told, are favorably inclined toward the German element and German ideals. Therefore, they deserve our unanimous support."</p>
   <p>MASS MEETING OF GERMAN DEMOCRATS</p>
   <p>An exceptionally well-attended mass meeting was held last night at Wickers' hall by the new German-American Democratic organization, in behalf of the Democratic candidates. The main speaker was Henry W. Huttmann, former member of the board of education and candidate for the board of directors of the state <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1358.jpg" n="3"/>university. Mr. Huttmann took the place of Professor Julius Goebel, of the University of Illinois who originally was scheduled to deliver a speech, but who unfortunately was detained. The speaker talked about the important role which German diligence, German ingenuity, and German integrity and honesty had played in the development of this country. Despite all attempts to deny them recognition for their achievements in this country, the Germans continue on their charted course, and gain the appreciation which is rightfully theirs.</p>
   <p>Henry Stuckart, candidate for the office of county treasurer, talked about the reforms which he would introduce, as, for instance, the establishment of branch tax collection offices in each ward, where the citizens could pay their taxes without much loss of time. Karl Haerting talked about the fight for the office of county judge, and pointed out that, years ago, the Republican candidate had defended the saloonkeepers in all the actions which State's Attorney Healy had brought against them.</p>
   <p>The new German-American Democratic organization has its headquarters in the Briggs House, and is working hard every day. Its plans for a German mass meeting <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1359.jpg" n="4"/>have been changed. It was decided to cancel the planned meeting in the Bush Temple, and to hold two other mass meetings instead. One of them will take place in Hoerber's Hall, Blue Island Avenue and 21st Street, on October 27, and the other one in the Social Turner Hall, Belmont Avenue and Paulina Street, on October 30.</p>
   <p>SULLIVAN NOT WANTED</p>
   <p>Joseph S. Martin, secretary of the Altgeld Memorial Society, declared in a letter, in which he invited Raymond Robins, progressive candidate for the United States Senate, to be the main speaker at a memorial celebration for the deceased governor [Altgeld], that the friends and followers of former Governor Altgeld did not approve the candidacy of Roger C. Sullivan for United States Senator. Martin declared that Altgeld's true friends would not be taken in by Sullivan's repeated claims of being a follower of the deceased, but that he [Martin] would support Robins.</p>
