   <p>The meeting of the German Section of the Socialist Labor Party, was held last evening, at Zepf's Halle, 54 West Lake Street at which Mr. Bohuing was elected Chairman. The order of the day called first, for a consultation of the view-point of the English Section, concerning the stand, taken by the Lehr and Wehr-verein, toward the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kempke undertook the explanation of such, and added, that the German Section wishes for a stronger Unity of Armed Organizations. After a prolonged debate, in which many of those present have taken part, Mr. Friedman proposed, that the delegates to the party-congress shall be instructed, to induce the Congress to decide, on promotion Armed Organizations within the Party. After a lengthy discussion, this proposal has been accepted. The next point to confer on was, the Independence of the German Section, or its representation at the Congress. Mr. Kempfe made it known, that the Main Section has called a meeting for to-morrow afternoon, in order to elect <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0982.jpg" n="2"/>delegates to the Congress, and to give them the necessary instructions. The English Section has proposed three delegates, whose interests are quite apart from those of the German Section, therefore it is of great importance, to elect delegates, who have the German-Sections' interests at heart.</p>
   <p>The English Section is not in favor of Armed Organizations, while the German Section likes to promote such, furthermore, the English Section is in favor of changing the name of the "Socialist Labor-Party", which is contrary to the wishes of the German Section. It has been finally decided, to submit the names of delegates chosen by the German Section, to the"Main Section" for acceptance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kempke gave then the report of the Executive*Finance Secretary, Mr. Ehmann, of Cincinnati. It has also been decided, to instruct the delegates, to get the party Congress interested in the Centralization of the Press, proposed by the "Milwaukee Section."</p>
   <p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>
