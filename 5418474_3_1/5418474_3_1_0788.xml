   <p>The Group "Bridgeport" held a well attended agitation meeting Wednesday evening. The order of the day was Comrade Kiessling's lecture: "Why was it impossible so far, to shake off the yoke?" The speaker asserted that Religion, largely without distinction, was the means through which the capitalists were enabled to uphold this system. The speaker was loudly applauded by the audience.</p>

A proposition was made that the decision of the General Committee to assist the arms fund, should be approved. The following resolution was submitted and accepted: "In consideration of the Cincinnati Riots, the Club "Bridgeport" declares that the Socialists had nothing to do with it and that the people will save its strength for the proper opportunity, instead of serving as tools of its enemies, the Capitalists.</p>
