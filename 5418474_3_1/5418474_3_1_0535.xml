   <p>The thoughtful citizen who takes an interest in our political life is often assailed by misgivings and doubts as to whether or not we are on the right road, whether or not a representative democracy, as we know it in this country, is the ideal form of government.</p>
   <p>People often answer this question with a shrug of the shoulders, and not infrequently with a vigorous "no". Many have already expressed the opinion that a democratic form of government is theoretically a very fine thing indeed, and that it is very promising but not very practical. They assert that democracy is an ideal which cannot be realized anywhere in the world. That the democratic republic is a failure is an oft repeated assertion.</p>
   <p>Such statements have always been common whenever public interest was aroused by any great political scandal, or whenever the result of an election was very <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0536.jpg" n="2"/>disappointing. Such opinions are also expressed whenever the public has displayed very little interest in an important election, and whenever only a small percentage of eligible voters have appeared at the polls. These dissenting voices have been heard whenever unnecessarily long ballots have made intelligent voting impossible, and whenever it seemed apparent that organizations consisting of fanatic minorities led by selfish and partisan-minded professional politicians had forced their candidates and their issues upon the masses. Similar statements [questioning the efficacy of the democratic process] have become louder and more frequent whenever resolutions have been adopted or the demand made that the right to vote be extended, although only relatively few eligible voters had been making use of their franchise; or that the number of issues be increased, although the ballots were already much too long, and contained too many issues.</p>
   <p>The unfavorable attitude toward our democratic form of government and the way in which it operates was intensified and became condemnatory when, as often happened, citizens were asked to decide purely administrative matters (whether <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0537.jpg" n="3"/>to pave streets, or whether police stations were to be erected), but were not given an opportunity to express their desires in regard to the most important questions; when they were not consulted about war and peace, or about things pertaining to their life or way of living.</p>
   <p>The doubt, the displeasure, the unfavorable judgment, and the sneering remarks which are often uttered can be understood, but they are not reasonable. And the deduction that the democratic form of government is a failure is wrong. It is also wrong to say that the democratic ideal is good but that the people are not yet ready for it, or that there is little hope that they will attain the necessary maturity in the near future, or that in this respect they seem to have been retrogressing instead of progressing.</p>
   <p>The older ones among us must know from experience that this is wrong. They must remember the election days of the seventies and eighties; and if they compare those election days with these of the present time the comparison must raise their hopes high and must strengthen their faith in a better future.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0538.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Today, after an unusually spirited and bitter campaign, men and women are marching to the polls to cast their ballots. Hundreds of thousands will vote. And these hundreds of thousands of citizens have decidedly diverse opinions concerning the relative value or worthlessness of the various candidates, but they are as quiet, as peaceful, and as good-natured, as if they were going to a picnic. They are neighbors and friends, one and all, and viewing them gives rise to the happy and inspiring thoughts that we are all equal and that we all have the same interests. We are working together to solve the important matter of self-government; the greater our number, the easier will be the solution and the more satisfactory and favorable the result.</p>
   <p>The democratic republic is not a failure. Although it is not a complete success, the people have the power to make it successful. That will happen when all our citizens vote regularly. If the effort to persuade the great majority of citizens to vote succeeds, the good cause will be victorious. For experiences teaches that in the last analysis, the people will always do the right thing.</p>
   <p>The greater the percentage of citizens who participate in the elections, the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0539.jpg" n="5"/>greater will be the certainty of a good result. Since a great many will vote today, we may look forward to the results with more confidence than we have known in previous elections.</p>
