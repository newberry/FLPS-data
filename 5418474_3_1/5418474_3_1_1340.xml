   <p>A statement signed by some Protestant clergymen, has been widely circulated, asking all Germans to vote for Roger Sullivan, candidate for United States Senator, because of his friendship for the German element. It is also claimed that Raymond Robins was associated with strongly anti-German elements. The circular asks all German Protestant clergymen to use their influence in their congregations and Vereine on behalf of Mr. Sullivan.</p>
   <p>The contents of this circular have no foundation in fact. The circular is an insult to thousands of intelligent German voters in the State of Illinois. Under the camouflage of an appeal to race prejudices, it seeks to conceal the real issues of the present political struggle.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Raymond Robins, wife of the candidate whom the letter attacks, is not only a German Protestant woman, but has belonged all her life to the same <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1341.jpg" n="2"/>Lutheran faith which those political pastors claim to represent.</p>
   <p>Mr. Robins' sole interest in the gigantic struggle now raging in Europe is that of a man who feels a profound compassion for the suffering millions over there. He is much too high-minded to be influenced by prejudices of any kind. There is not the slightest reason for the deliberate statement of untruth that Mr. Robins was a German-baiter.</p>
   <p>The statement, signed by Pastor Hattendorf and his colleagues, which was published in the papers, has no foundation in fact. It is nothing but an attempt to confuse the voters of this state, and to arouse their prejudice. Promises made by Chicago politicians to support welfare organizations in which these clergymen are interested are responsible for the appeal.</p>
   <p>The people of Illinois are waging a desperate struggle against corrupt political machines. All sections which stand for a genuine government of the people and <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1342.jpg" n="3"/>for the welfare of the community are fighting today against the corrupt forces, in both parties, of which Mr. Sullivan is the head. Civic organizations, labor unions, clergymen of all denominations--in short, all progressive citizens of this state--have banded together to foil the political career of a man who has grown wealthy through corruption and graft, and who has obtained the nomination for a high office by fraud.</p>
   <p>This is not just another political fight. It is powerful moral revolt against corruption and chiseling in our state. For this reason, the movement has found the wholehearted support of all liberty-loving clergymen.</p>
   <p>As German-American citizens of the State of Illinois, we protest against this deliberate attempt to hide the real issues of the campaign behind the smoke screen of an appeal to prejudices. Raymond Robins is our friend as well as yours. He represents humanitarianism, justice, equality, and all those principles which our [German] race has always held dear. We are asking the German-American citizens of this state to join this movement wholeheartedly, the sole <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1343.jpg" n="4"/>objective of which is to destroy the corrupt political machines of the two old parties in our state.</p>
   <p>A vote for Robins is a vote for honesty and integrity. A vote for Roger Sullivan is a vote for corrupt politicians.</p>
