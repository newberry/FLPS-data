   <p>As the enormous population in Chicago approves the verdict of the jury in the anarchist trial, so the whole country praises it. Not only the editorials of the press particularily the German - American newspapers, but also the most reliable reports about the public opinion prove this.</p>
   <p>We can say that never before an extremely important decision in this country has found such a general and undivided approval like this Chicago verdict. It is the voice of the people expressing itself for the complete destinction of anarchism, which has no respect for civil and moral laws, and in every way is contrary to the institution and of the Republic.</p>
   <p>How often have the anarchists been named in this newspaper and in many other German - American newspapers that it would have that result, if they did not discontinue their fanatical agitation! How often has the truth been told to them, that America favors to a large extent freedom of the speech and press, but woe to you if you ever attempt to transfer your mad murder talk and shocking agitation from words, spoken or written, into action! Then you will find out with terror that the lenient American people will not stand for any playing, but will smash you with a veritable, terrible force.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0751.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Thus it happened, because those unhappy, misled humans and their reckless leaders did not want it different! According to the whining of a few communistic newspapers, the verdict of the Chicago jury was given under the influence of the Bourgeoisie and the brutal ruling class.</p>
   <p>The state's attorney, Brinnell is no tool or representation of the Bourgeoisie. On account of his proven honesty and justice towards high and low, he was elected state's attorney by a great majority of the people of Cook County, particularily the working class, while the other candidates on the Democratic ticket were beaten. Never, since he has been in office has he served the monopoly or any other money powers. In his final speech during the trial, he pointed out what an enormous difference there is between a peaceable labor movement and murderous and incendiary anarchiam, and between educated, well meaning Socialists and destructive anarchists.</p>
   <p>Of the twelve jurymen, eleven have to work hard for a living. Then is no Bourgeois or tool of monopoly among them. Only one, the musical - supply dealer, Reed belongs to the well - to - do clan. It was not the money-bag that spoke thru the mouths of the twelve jurymen, but the spirit of the American people which was outraged by the crimes of the anarchists and the abominable <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0752.jpg" n="3"/>doctrines from which these crimes sprang. Of course, there have been surprises and unexpected incidents during the trial.For instance, the remark of an English-American newspaper, which called the 20th of August, 1886, on which the Chicago anarchists were sentenced, the greatest day in American History since April 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered to General Grant. To compare the American civil war with a few anarchists was just as much out of place as the remark of a defending lawyer comparing the defendants, Most and Parsons, with Jesus.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune even went so far as to publish an appeal to collect $1,000 for each of the twelve jurymen. Such a suggestion is an insult against the twelve men, who spoke their"Guilty" verdict from a feeling of responsibility and duty, and not for money.</p>
