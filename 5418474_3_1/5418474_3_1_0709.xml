   <p>Capitalistic newspapers last week stated the fact with great satisfaction that anarchism and the entire revolutionary movement of the working class is dead - stone dead.</p>
   <p>In Chicago it is founded chiefly on the belief that the Alarm an anarchistic weekly published in English and edited by Lum went out of existence.</p>
   <p>The Staats - Zeitung as the representative of our local moneyed man's pride rejoices over the discontinuance of this paper and shows its delight in an article containing the following passages:</p>
   <p>"On this occasion it may be mentioned that radicalism as such is ever losing more and more ground among radicals. The English anarchist paper in Chicago, the Alarm which was formerly perpetrated by Albert R. Parsons and since his execution by another fanatic named Dyer D. Lumhas ceased publication for reasons, lack of money and subscribers.</p>
   <p>In its dying edition this badly printed bill proposed all kinds of powerless <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0710.jpg" n="2"/>deeds of violence to the working class. After the execution of the anarchists in Chicago the cry of anarchist the whole world over was: 'From the graves of the executed martyrs there will arise in America an anarchism with unprecedented force and power.' But just the contrary is the case."</p>
   <p>But this terrible reminder and warning did not fail, to make an impression. How comfortable the bourgeois fattened on the labor of others, the women and children, slaves the whole wretched rabble which expects its salvation from the continuance of this miserable state of affairs, must have felt at this wise defeat of a former prison inmate.</p>
   <p>Now they will try to tighten the screws more and more and will expect no resistance. But how do they err who seized the earth and everything up on it and intend to keep their spoil for all times with the aid of violence and laws created by themselves.</p>
   <p>Anarchism - that striving after supreme happiness, which will have no other class ruling or exploiting another one, the striving after a social structure where every individual can develop freely according to his abilities - is not extinguished; on the contrary, it has itself never before been more on the horizon then right now.</p>
