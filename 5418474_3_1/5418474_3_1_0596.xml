   <p>A large number of English-American newspapers and some German-American ones display an insane exasperation over Altgeld's executive clemency to Neebe, Schwab and Fielden. (Explanation: Haymarket riot: Translator.) They completely pass over in silence Governor Altgeld's denunciation and definite condemnation of anarchism; his threat of relentless prosecution whenever this doctrine should assert itself and become an actuality.</p>
   <p>Altgeld's explanation limits itself to a criticism of the court proceedings of our Chicago legal machinery at the time anarchism was on trial. That the governor was able to prove that the Supreme Court of Illinois had made a serious blunder, even his worst enemy can not deny.</p>
   <p>One of the arguments which the court rejected, was the proven evidence submitted by the defense attorneys that several jurors admitted being prejudiced against the defendants. This evidence, in a trial for life, was ignored by the court. At a later period Altgeld used the same argument in a similar instance; during the Cronin murder investigation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0597.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Sensible German-American newspaper writers, among them the extremely conservative and anti-union propagandist, Carl Daenzer of the Anzeiger Des Westens, (Western Announcer,) are definitely opposed to this groundless raving against Altgeld. They reproached him, "because he expressed his ideas improperly"; but they prove nevertheless, that the wielder of the executive power of clemency is privileged to criticize the courts severely, that this power must not be throttled, otherwise its value would be diminished, perhaps even disappear altogether, and thus be unavailable for important emergencies...</p>
   <p>And now comes the bigoted little preacher, of the Grace Methodist Church, "Dr." M. L. Gates, from Jersey City Heights, N. J., uttering a doleful hoot to the accompaniment of three A's: "Illinois stands discredited with the threefold A" - thus shrieked Gates from his pulpit, concerning our peaceful prairie province.</p>
   <p>The three great A's - the shame of Illinois, they are synonymous - Altgeld, Aliens and Anarchists! The liar and vilifier from New Jersey confuses a handful of Chicago anarchists with the large number of immigrants from Europe, and throws them into the melting pot - which conforms to his <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0598.jpg" n="3"/>understanding of aliens.</p>
   <p>He is unaware that a tremendous majority of these arrivals, including the willing workers, are a well behaved and peaceful people. Even among men who have taken no active part in the turbulent Altgeld criticism, the Governor's unconcealed rancor towards the silver haired Judge Gary was openly censured. There is a partial explanation for this acidity; it is attributable to Judge Gary's indiscreet article, published in the April edition of the Century magazine, this year. It is a virulent document about anarchism and the trial.</p>
   <p>Condemnation of Altgeld, however, will not promote the personal and judicial honor of Gary. As an antithesis one must note, with what wonderful equanimity and justice the St. Louis Tageblatt, (Daily paper,) a Socialistic publication,which is exceedingly friendly towards Altgeld's action, treats the Gary affair in its columns.</p>
   <p>Adolph Hepner, its editor, whose writings we quote in part, says: "Gary was not big enough for his task; he could not conduct a trial of such far-reaching magnitude; a leader of such an important political investigation must have some of an actor's talent, i. e., he must be able to mask his feelings, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0599.jpg" n="4"/>so that he may appear impartial, regardless of his mind's reactions to the varied proofs and court exhibits. Gary, a simple, old bourgeois, did not have this faculty, this modern showmanship.</p>
   <p>"His conduct indicated, from the very beginning of the proceedings, that he was dominated by the impression which the 'bombing' left on his mind. And he was kept under its grewsome influence up to the end, like millions of other people.... He acted, fully convinced that the conviction of the men would be a good deed...</p>
   <p>"The psychological effect created by the voluminous translations from the Arbeiter Zeitung, (Labor-Paper,) the reports of military, secret anarchistic organizations, the samples of Lingg's bombs, the blood-drenched clothing and other gory police equipment from dead officers -  all that upset the old man's mental poise, fired his feverish imagination which now perceived the potential perils that threatened society.</p>
   <p>"It resolved itself into a fixed idea, a monomaniacal conviction of a 'murderous conspiracy' embracing all the individual anarchists.... These ideas overwhelmed him.... Altgeld may thank God on his knees, that circumstances were kind and prevented him from being a judge in this instance....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0600.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"But he never would have consented to a jury consisting exclusively of clerks with no proper representation from the laboring class... in conformity with the legal phrase, 'In coram paribus'..." (To be judged by our equals. Translator.)</p>
