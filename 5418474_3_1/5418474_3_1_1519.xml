   <p>The position of member of the democratic national campaign committee has its serious drawbacks. Wednesday that organization had to listen to an interminable address from Mr. Washington Hesing of this city. It might as well be understood now as later that he never can be elected mayor, if it is his intention to make speeches and send in messages to the council of the length of that one. He must take a Gideon oath to limit his eloquence to a few thousand word doses.</p>
   <p>His speech simply was an appeal to the committee to establish branch quarters in this city and spend a great deal of the campaign funds among the bums here on an assurance from Mr. W. Hesing that the democracy could get the votes of 20,000 out of the 35,000 Republican German Lutherans of Illinois, if they were met in the right spirit, and if German literature - meaning thereby, the Staats Zeitung - were distributed freely among them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hesing did not explain to the committee what he meant by the "right spirit", but he took it for granted that its members knew. Those Republican German Lutherans, however, whose votes Mr. Hesing, a Roman Catholic, have been twice tendered to free trade, Cleveland may be interested to know what he meant by <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1520.jpg" n="2"/>the right spirit.</p>
   <p>The "spirits" which animate the entire Democratic party with the exception of a few straddlebugs, and which Mr. Hesing calls the "right" spirit, are the spirit of free trade and the spirit of spoils. The first spirit means the entire abolition of protection; the repeal of all duties on the cheap labor products of the European countries; the obtaining of the revenue at present derived from them, from duties levied on tea, coffee, sugar, and similar articles; and the forcing down of the wages paid in this country, until they are as low as those which the German citizens of the United States got before they came to this country.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hesing thinks that if the Democrats will only approach these Republican Lutherans who have been protectionists all their lives in a free trade spirit, the latter will drop their Republican ballots, accept Democratic free trade ones, and march to the polls shouting hosannas for Cleveland, Perhaps he is a little over-sanguine and is counting his chickens - not merely before they are hatched, but before the eggs are laid.</p>
