  <body>
   <p>Our judicial elections in the County are a rather congenial affair. The Party bosses select the candidates and the members of the organization vote for them.</p>
   <p>Of course, in adapting this method of procedure, the common voter has nothing to say. Not even the rivalry between the two parties is noticeable anymore. The party leaders, prior to the nomination, agree on certain candidates before hand and in this manner the independent candidate has no chance whatever.</p>
   <p>It must be emphasized that this mighty undemocratic method, nevertheless, has proven highly efficacious in actual practice. It has given the County excellent and capable judges. And this cannot be said of our public officials in general, that is, that contingent which was elected in general elections.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1188.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the coming election twenty-two judges are on the ticket; twenty for the Superior Court and two for the Circuit Court.</p>
   <p>Even in this instance the Republican and Democratic leaders had intended to resort to a fusion ticket. However, they could not agree and so the plan did not materialize. As a result, the Democrats united with the Deneen group.</p>
   <p>The Republican judges, the Snow-Barrett group, concluded then that it was impossible to oppose such a powerful faction. Therefore, they found it expedient to ask the Democrats for a nook on the Democratic ticket and this request was granted.</p>
   <p>The ticket now, although being a Democratic ballot, is after all a fusion affair.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1189.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In order to have at least a few candidates in its own corner, the Snow-Barrett group of the Republicans offered three candidates for the Superior Court and two for the Circuit Court.</p>
   <p>Former Attorney General Brundage saw a chance therein to bring his name before the public. Therefore, he organized the so-called People's ticket with eleven candidates for the Superior Court. Besides that, there are four different tickets in the political field but it is not worth while to consider them in detail.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost recommends its readers to vote the Democratic ticket in its entirety.</p>
   <p>Of the twenty candidates on the ticket, seventeen are already in office and have been satisfactory, and there is no reason why they should not be re-elected. Quite to the contrary, it has always been the custom of <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1190.jpg" n="4"/>our people to re-elect good judges and there is no reason why we should deviate from this principle now.</p>
   <p>Of course, J. Brundage expresses his ire about the fusion ticket. He claims that the public is prevented thereby from selecting its own candidates. Brundage can hardly expect his expressions to be taken seriously.</p>
   <p>After all, heretofore he never objected to the fusion system, and the suspicion naturally arises that he only fights for the commonweal because he expects to derive political benefits therefrom.</p>
   <p>For the Circuit Court the Abendpost recommends Daniel P. Trude and Edgar A. Jonas, the former a Democrat, the latter a Republican.</p>
   <p>Trude does not require a recommendation; he has been a judge for years and <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1191.jpg" n="5"/>is well and favorably known.</p>
   <p>The same can be applied to Judge Jonas. He is now in the City Court, but he has done such good work there that he deserves a promotion to a higher court. To that we must add that he is of German descent and that he has always shown active interest in German affairs.</p>
   <p>In the Thirty-eighth Ward, a substitute must be found for Alderman Max Adamowski, deceased. And here we have three candidates, John J. Kaleth, a son-in-law of Adamowski, Frank H. Landmesser, and Michael F. Walsh.</p>
   <p>Kaleth and Landmesser have the support of large political organizations, and Walsh is considered as not having a chance.</p>
   <p>Landmesser is supported by Recorder Clayton F. Smith. He is of German extraction and the Abendpost recommends that its readers give him preference.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1192.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Usually, popular participation in judicial elections is rather weak. Although we have seven tickets in this election and Brundage and Cermak have helped to make it a lively campaign, we may even expect little interest in this affair.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost, nevertheless, recommends that its readers should not let themselves be influenced. Let the Germans appear in full numbers.</p>
