   <p>What we have announced and advocated in this paper several weeks ago, has become a reality. Promenent men of social standing are now requesting clubs, societies, unions, and the like to appoint a member each, who in turn should organize a general committee for the purpose of having petitions signed by as many people as possible in all walks of life. These petitions requesting a pardon for Neebe, Schwab, and Fielden will be sent to the governor.</p>
   <p>Decoration Day is very appropriate to appeal to the people to do everything in their power, to induce the governor not to postpone a pardon for these men much longer.</p>
   <p>What is Chicago's tragedy of May 4, 1886 compared with the four years of lasting tragic civil war and its streams of blood? Did not the victorious republic have the power to punish the instigators of that awful rebellion most severely? Did it not, on the contrary, extend mercy and magnanimity to the most guilty? This attitude, indeed, resulted in that in a comparatively short time hatred was displaced by a sense of indissoluble fraternalism.</p>
   <p>It is high time that the state of Illinois consider the clemency of the Federal <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0607.jpg" n="2"/>Government towards the instigators of the national rebellion, whose motives were not by any means superior to those possessed by the fanatics of 1886.</p>
   <p>It is not definitely proven that Oscar Neebe had anything to do with the affairs of that day, May 4th. In regard to Michael Schwab and S. Fielden there were extenuating circumstances from the beginning. All three of them have suffered immensely.</p>
   <p>Even monarchs in Europe extend pardon in similar cases after a number of years. The military republic of France, not at all comparative to the true republicanism of the United States, has pardoned social revolutionists, who were far worse and more obstinate than those three men ever have been.</p>
   <p>To pardon these men, as recommended by us, would contribute materially to moderate the sharp edges of the bitterly resented social contrast not only in Illinois, but in the whole country.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians of Chicago sympathize with the Germans in this matter. Therefore, they are making all efforts, even among the most conservative circles, for the pardon of the anarchist Hronek, who is likewise in Joliet.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0608.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As far as the anarchism of Chicago is concerned, the most severe and pitiless sense of legal justice ought to be appeased through the executions, which took place, and the imprisonment. To finally conclude the latter would indeed be very desirable since many outstanding exploiters remain unpunished in this country.</p>
