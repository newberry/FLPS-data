   <p>Early yesterday morning every German baker in Chicago belonging to either the National Association No. 49 or to the local Union No. 1, received a post card. It gave notice that a meeting of the Bakers' Union would be held this afternoon at Grief's Hall, 54 W. Lake St.; that business of importance would come up; and that every member was earnestly requested to be present.</p>
   <p>At the meeting this afternoon at four o'clock, the bakers, it is believed, will declare a strike; and a committee of one will probably be appointed to wait on the employers and notify them that before the men can return to work, a new scale must be signed.</p>
   <p>The two unions number about 1,200 men, Germans. That they have the upper hand in the proposed strike was demonstrated by an interview with one of the largest bakers in the city. He said:</p>
   <p>"What can the employers do who are working none but union men? There are not enough bakers in the city to supply the demand, particularly in the Vienna bread bakeries. An Irishman or a Scotchman doesn't know how to make that class of wares. None but Germans and Frenchmen understand the work. I suppose I shall <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0227.jpg" n="2"/>have to accede, for a time at least, to any demands they may make or else close up shop."</p>
   <p>The men are divided as to what they will demand, though all are agreed on shorter hours and larger pay. Some want eight hours and some nine, with from twelve to fourteen hours' pay, taking the present wages as a basis.</p>
   <p>"We haven't enough bakers in Chicago to meet the demand," said Mr. Heissler to a Tribune reporter yesterday, "and I expect we will have to come to terms with them in case they strike, or else close up."</p>
