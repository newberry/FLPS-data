   <p>Many Chicago Germans lament today because they ignored our advice and voted for the Democrat Harrison instead of Wright, the Republican candidate for mayor, and this also applies to those who wasted their votes by supporting the Socialists--a procedure which only split up the Republicans and helped elect Harrison.</p>
   <p>We also said, in the editorial columns, that the Germans would fare badly under Harrison's administration, and that prediction is being fully realized. Never before were the Germans so completely disregarded, as far as city jobs are concerned, as under Harrison's rule, yet he was elected chiefly by the German vote. His ruthless conduct now attracts particular attention, since he has discharged the city's most outstanding German official, Fire Marshal Benner.</p>
   <p>We would be very narrow-minded, however, if we would judge the mayor's outrageous act only from the standpoint of nationality. But in this particular <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1601.jpg" n="2"/>instance the mayor's traits--to which we called attention before the election--assert themselves; the case establishes his unreliability and slipperiness. While Harrison tried to make himself popular among the labor element, and even with the communists, he intended to use Benner as a tool to lower salaries in the fire department. Harrison did not like to do the disagreable work himself, and so selected Benner. And, because the latter showed justifiable indignation, the mayor, obsessed with pride and lust for power, discharged Benner.</p>
   <p>The treatment meted out to the fire marshal must dismay all workers who helped Harrison into office, since they now perceive the man's treachery; the reduction of salaries is a blow to useful and deserving city employees.</p>
   <p>The mayor's action against Benner takes on an even more outrageous aspect: A man who never tinkered with city work before, and who even admitted, prior to his election, that he knows practically nothing about city affairs, now dismisses a man whose ability had become proverbial--an official upon whose efficiency has depended the safety of every home in Chicago. Everyone knows that repetitions of <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1602.jpg" n="3"/>the city's holocausts of 1871 and 1873 have been prevented only by the thorough organization and equipment of our present fire department--the work of Benner. To remove this tested and tried leader of the newly organized fire department represents an assault on the life and property of citizens and their families, the poor as well as the rich. Even if, after Benner's removal, no conflagration should break out, the mayor's act will have repercussions which affect all of us, because insurance companies will revise their rates upward. Our fire insurance rates have decreased annually, thanks to the confidence these corporations have had in Brenner's ability.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that popular opinion will succeed in countermanding the order for Benner's dismissal, and will force his reinstatement. When that is realized, credit will accrue to the people who have voiced their demands, and not to our mayor.</p>
   <p>But the fact remains that the mayor tried, for no adequate reason, to deprive Chicago of its ablest protector.</p>
