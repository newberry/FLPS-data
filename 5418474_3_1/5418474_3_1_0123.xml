   <p>"Our stores were bombed forty times. The union charged us three thousand dollars for halting the strike. The police, the States Attorney, and the United States District Attorney refused to act. That is why we appealed to a man who was able to protect us--A1 Capone".</p>
   <p>Thus Morris Becker briefly and clearly described the terrorism which prevailed in the chemical cleaning industry of this city for many years. Becker made these statements during the trial of Dr. Benjamin M. Squires and seventeen other persons who are accused of conspiracy to obtain control of the whole industry by violence.</p>
   <p>In reality Becker's statements revealed nothing new to the public. It has <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0124.jpg" n="2"/>long been generally known that the cleaning industry, in conjunction with an employers' organization, has waged a merciless war against the Becker Company, because this firm has charged lower prices than the organized companies. And for years the press has regularly reported deaths and destruction of property by bombs, the favorite weapons used in this fight.</p>
   <p>It is a disgraceful fact that Becker was finally forced to engage A1 Capone, whom he knew as a neighbor, for protection. The attacks ceased when A1 Capone espoused the cause of Becker. Thus Chicago's worst criminal became the protector of a perfectly legitimate business enterprise. And why? This question was also fully answered by Becker: "Because the authorities, whose duty it is to protect citizens, did nothing."</p>
   <p>So the law of the jungle ruled in this industry for many years. The firms engaged in the cleaning business were forced to charge exhorbitant prices <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0125.jpg" n="3"/>for their services, because they had to make large payments to the union racketeers who in turn pledged themselves to ruin competitors who charged lower prices. As a result, the entire industry was finally discredited; more and more people sent their cleaning work to other cities; and the local firms incurred great losses.</p>
   <p>In order to avoid any wrong conceptions, we point out that these events transpired during the previous administration. States Attorney Courtney deserves credit for his honest and forceful endeavors to drive out the racketeers, to call the guilty to account, and thus to restore the good name of Chicago.</p>
