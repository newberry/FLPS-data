   <p>Because of the many attempts, some sly, others obvious, to sow discord in the ranks of the German-American voters and thus to defeat a uniform vote, the Board of Directors of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buergerbund (German-American Citizens' Alliance) has made the following statements:</p>
   <p>"1. The Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buergerbund is not a party organization; therefore it will never endorse a party; it will only endorse individual men whom it regards as capable of filling their respective offices, irrespective of their party affiliation.</p>
   <p>"2. In a meeting of delegates which was held on March 17 a ballot was taken to endorse Thompson (Thompson, 65 votes; [Robert] Sweitzer, 8 votes; Collins, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1235.jpg" n="2"/>6 votes; Fitzpatrick, 1 vote; and Hoyne, 1 vote). Thereupon the seventy-six, delegates, who represented citizens' alliances as well as more than fifty-five hundred voters, declared themselves unanimously in favor of Thompson.</p>
   <p>"The reasons for this action are:</p>
   <p>"a) During the troubled wartimes Chicago was the only city in which societies of German-Americans were not molested by mobs and were able to conduct their meetings undisturbed. This was due to the fearless action of Mayor Thompson who intervened in behalf of peaceful citizens. At that time where were the others who now affectionately assure us of their friendship?</p>
   <p>"b) Thanks to its Mayor, Chicago is the only city in the Union in which a German theater may still be found.</p>
   <p>"c) When those champions of the people were driven from Minneapolis, Saint Paul, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1236.jpg" n="3"/>Omaha, and even from Milwaukee because the mayors of these cities were too cowardly to offer their protection, Chicago was the only place in which the persecuted could find refuge and could conduct their meetings in peace. Thompson was the only one who defended the Constitution of the United States (First Amendment) even against the Governor.</p>
   <p>"We therefore contend that every law-abiding American citizen of German descent is honor-bound to vote for Thompson on election day, not because he is 'pro-German' as his opponents assert, but because in every respect he is a true American who insisted upon obedience to the law and to the Constitution.</p>
   <p>"If we should neglect this duty we would be ungrateful, indeed, and we would certainly be guilty of the accusation which our opponents often make, that we are not interested in politics except when beer is an issue. Thompson's opponents are using the Sunday Closing Law to obtain our votes. But they admit that Thompson was duty-bound to enforce the ordinance. Shall we Americans of German descent, who proudly call ourselves law-abiding citizens, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1237.jpg" n="4"/>reject a man because he, as a public official, was obliged to enforce the law?</p>
   <p>"'You may know a man's character by his enemies'. That is an old proverb. And who are Thompson's worst enemies? First of all the large English newspapers: the Chicago Tribune, and the Chicago Daily News; and it is not necessary that we inform our German fellow citizens on the character of these publications. Then there are the trust magnates (gas, traction, etc.), the archenemies of the 'common' taxpayer.</p>
   <p>"The banner of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buergerbund bears the inscriptions, 'War Against the Autocracy of Nativism,' and 'War Against the Autocracy of Capitalism'. Thompson's foes are our foes. His battle is our battle. That is why the Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buergerbund indorses him.</p>
   <p>"We therefore appeal to all our members and to all Americans of German origin who are not blinded by the 'beer jug,' by partisanship, or by the inclination <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1238.jpg" n="5"/>to grumble. We ask their support for the man who did not hide himself in the hour of peril as certain others did, but who showed himself to be a one-hundred-per-cent American, a defender of the law and of the Constitution.</p>
   <p>"Let us forget all the party differences which now separate us; let us honor with a unanimous German-American vote the man who so fearlessly fought for the rights of citizens against their most powerful enemies--nativism and capitalism.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Ferdinand Walther,</p>
   <p>President of Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buergerbund."</p>
