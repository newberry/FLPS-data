   <p>Last night at 58 Clybourne Avenue, a large Socialist meeting was held, Chas. Frank was voted leader of the meeting and H. Pabst, Secretary. First, a business meeting was held and after that the work of the day was taken up. The first speaker, A. R. Parsons, was introduced to the audience. He mentioned with sorrow, that any man could look upon the old parties only with disgust. In a very clear, way he explained every plank in the platform. He criticized to-day, the Societie's various activities and warned the worker's parties to be careful and strong so as to prevent a revolution.</p>
   <p>Alderman Chr. Meyer, was the last of the speakers. He was glad to be able to tell the audience, that the situation looked very promising, as he just came from another meeting and the feeling there was very high and everybody happy. With great hopes for the future, and telling everybody he hoped we were the winners, and that we would show them all that our work is fair and honest.</p>
