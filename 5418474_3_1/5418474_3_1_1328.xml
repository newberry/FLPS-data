   <p>In a serious hour, we confidently appeal to you to give your votes on February 23, 1915 to</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison for Mayor</p>
   <p>and to induce your family members and friends to do likewise.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison is honest. Not even his worst enemies dare deny that.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison has labored ceaselessly for the progress of our city, which today has the admiration of the world. This, too, is admitted.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison has introduced progressive methods in the various administrative branches, which save the city hundreds of thousands of dollars annually.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1329.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Water, telephone, gas and electric light rates have been reduced. Harbor improvements, a Union Station, bathing beaches, hospital construction, the widening of Twelfth Street and Michigan Boulevard and other enterprises important for Chicago's future development have been successfully started. Nobody denies that.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison has treated the Germans not only fairly, but with special sympathy, and in questions of personal freedom he has always acted according to his principles. We Germans know this and appreciate it. Are we now, as citizens and Germans, to become guilty of gross ingratitude? Never! Harrison's opponent, for lack of any plausible argument which would speak in his favor, has resorted to a cheap demagogic trick. He poses as a German. It has been proven irrefutably that he has no right whatever to call himself such.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison is honest, educated and experienced. Carter H. Harrison is and always has been independent.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1330.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>His opponent is and has been the tool of the Ogden gas magnates, Roger C. Sullivan, John P. Hopkins, and others. German men and women! Be true to yourselves! Stay on the right track! Vote for the interest of your city and its future! Dubious experiments are dangerous and expensive for the taxpayer.</p>
   <p>Vote for Carter H. Harrison</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Central Organization of the German-American Democrats of Cook County.</p>
   <p>Theodore G. Behrens, president. Adolph D. Weiner, secretary. David M. Pfaelzer, treasurer. Franz Christmann, clerk.</p>
   <p>Vice-Presidents:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1331.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Fritz Goetz, Frank X. Brandecker, Rudolph Seifert, Emil Eitel, Ernst J. Kruetgen, Emil Demme, Oscar F. Mayer, Wilhelm Schmidt.</p>
   <p>Publicity Committee:</p>
   <p>Robert J. Eitel, chairman; Charles Christmann, Nicholas Michels, Henry von Meeteren, Max Wild, Leopold Neumann.</p>
   <p>Committee for Meetings:</p>
   <p>Nicholas Michels, chairman; David M. Pfaelzer, Leopold Grand, Ferdinand Lemke, Peter L. Hoffmann.</p>
   <p>Campaign Committee:</p>
   <p>[Follows one-half page full of names in small print].</p>
   <p>And thousands more.</p>
