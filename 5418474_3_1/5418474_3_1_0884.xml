   <p>An indignation meeting was held last night at Nutzhorn's Hall at which Michael Schwab was elected president. In the absence of Mr. F. A. Stauber, Comrade August Spies was the speaker of the evening. He related in English the well-known story of Gibbs, Walsh, Malone and Mc Grath and contended that the acquittal of those scoundrels in the election fraud case was a crime which was even greater than the crime committed. Judge Gardner declared through this action, that in the future any crook can impose onto the voters a representative of his own liking and like character.</p>
   <p>States Attorney L. L. Mills is as guilty as Gardner for he has postponed the case until he was successful in bringing it into Judge Gardner's Court whose unscrupulousness and dishonesty was known to him. The speaker considers Gardner's decision a death blow to the fundamental principles of the government of a Republican State.</p>

It was also resolved to consider Judge Gardner as unable to pass judgment in the sense of the law after he has committed such an enormous crime against the freedom of the people. Therefore, we ask his removal from office and prison for his deed. It is decided that the hanging of these scoundrels which is effected today on their effigies only, shall, in proper time, when, the people awake to protect themselves against corruption become bitter reality.</p>

   <p>Presently the crowd fastened wire between telegraph posts from which the effigies of these four criminals were dangling in the light to the accompaniment of the cheering of the crowd.</p>
