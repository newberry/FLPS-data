   <p>Neither Democratic Socialism nor State Socialism will destroy the structure of any civilized country, as long as private ownership does not undermine its own existence by increasing misuse of its power. Such a misuse of power is making its appearance particularly in countries with a democratic constitution, which is giving to the business ambition of individuals and corporations an unlimited field of activity without the well needed legal control. The subsequent lack of adequate regulation laws always will tempt dishonesty and money greed, to exploit the masses of the people on a large sclae.</p>
   <p>Even if this shameless exploitation sometimes leads to unexpected public scandals, there always will be needy judges, who, impressed by the power of these scoundrel magnates, and their bribing generosity, will side in with the wealthy culprits. As long as the legislators, stirred up by some monstrous movement of public indignation, does not create the necessary severe corporation laws, capitalism will degenerate, increasingly and lead to the doom of human Society, which has learned too long from the large money interest losses, to disregard and evade the laws of our constitution.</p>
