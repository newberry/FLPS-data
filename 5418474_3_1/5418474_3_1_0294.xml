<title level="a">TANNERS' STRIKE</title>
</bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Edward Engel and Company discharged Georg Conrad, one of their tanners, several days ago; work was slack and the man was a troublemaker. Conrad's fellow workers, however, objected to the dismissal, and demanded that the man be put back on the pay roll and, to make matters more impressive, went on strike forthwith. Although only ten men are on strike, their action puts more than twenty-five men out of work. The firm was unwilling to let the men dictate to the management as to who shall or shall not be hired, particularly when a man was discharged who, during periods of drunkenness, made trouble. Therefore Engel and Company abide by their decision regardless of the loss involved.</p>
   <p>The affair attracted the attention of other tanning companies, whose officials met yesterday at the Engel office at 201 Lake Street. The following companies were represented. Grey, Clark, and Company; Edward Engel and Company; <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0295.jpg" n="2"/>Marcus Weil; L. Pfeifer; Louis and George Eitel; R. Populorum; Thos. Hammond, of Walker; Oakley and Company; and James Sharp.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy discussion, the assembly decided that Engel and Company should not give in under any circumstances, but that a peaceful solution of the problem would be desirable; hence, it was resolved to send the following letter to the Tanners' Union:</p>
   <p>"Tanners and the Tawers' Union: We, tanners and tawers of Chicago, consider your strike at Edward Engels and Company to be unjustified, and feel that such action on your part will be a source of endless arguments between employers and employees. We therefore request that you modify your demands or submit the matter to arbitration.</p>
   <p>"We hope that your union will be successful, and that we may be able to work harmoniously together, since we have mutual interests, and that strikes which <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0296.jpg" n="3"/>are detrimental to both parties may be avoided.</p>
   <p>"We dispatch this letter in accordance with the resolution passed by the tanners and tawers at the office of Grey, Clark, and Company, 200 Lake Street." [Translator's Note: A different address is given elsewhere in this article.]</p>
   <p>This note will be given to the workers at their meeting, Monday evening, at the Odd Fellows' hall, on Milwaukee Avenue near Chicago Avenue.</p>
