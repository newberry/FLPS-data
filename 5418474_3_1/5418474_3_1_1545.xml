   <p>The German-American Republican Club held a large meeting at Orpheus Hall, on La Salle St., last evening. Col. Jacob Gross presided. A committee consisting of Franz Amberg, Frederick Decker, Theodore Arnold, Anton Hottinger, and Henry Jansen reported the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>Whereas, in this crisis of our municipal history, the most important in our annals, we are called upon to make selection for Mayor; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, such candidate, if elected, will prepare for the reception in this city of our kinsmen and countrymen and all the liberal-minded people of the old and new worlds, who will come here in 1893 to participate in the World's Columbian Exposition;</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we believe the Hon. Hempstead Washburne, our City Attorney for two terms, is such a man - courageous, capable, of good antecedents, of historic ancestry and liberal education, acquired in one of the universities of the fatherland.</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we tender him our hearty, unanimous, united, and energetic support; and that we pledge ourselves to work earnestly to secure his election and the election of his associates on the Republican city ticket.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1546.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The resolutions were greeted with prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>Franz Amberg made a strong address in favor of the Republican candidate for Mayor.</p>
