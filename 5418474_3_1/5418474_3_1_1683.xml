   <p>The Democratic County Convention happily came to an and yesterday. The candidates nominated by the first district for the County Council are, as one may willingly admit, men commanding respect and capable in their sphere. They are Mr. Henry J. Lenzen, a wine merchant, whose business is across from the criminal court building; Ex-Alderman William Fitzgerald, hardware store owner; James Bradley, a very respectable grocer, of Irish descent, but born over here, and George J. Hoffman, a cigar dealer from Milwaukee Avenue, a Scandinavian.</p>
   <p>Against these gentlemen, as individuals and as business people, there is nothing to be objected, but, if together they will strengthen the ticket much is another question. It seems to us that if the Democrats really hoped for victory they should not have left so completely out of consideration a very important element in their party; we mean the old Democrats of American extraction, and altogether, the American element. No party can exist in America that shows itself intolerant against one or the other element in the population. But that has been done by the convention. Only one American is on the ticket and he can not be regarded as a representative of the old traditional American population. Had they given them one, or, better still, two representatives on the county ticket, the latter would have been very strong, and the Republicans would have been hard put to it, to <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1684.jpg" n="2"/>nominate one of equal quality.</p>
