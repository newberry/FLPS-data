   <p>The meeting of German citizens, which was called for yesterday afternoon in the interest of the candidacy of Mr. Frank Wenter and which was held at Haendel's Hall, 40 Randolph Street was well attended. Besides Mr wener himself, Mr. Harry Rubens and general Lieb were introduced as speakers. Mr. George L. Pfeiffer acted as Chairman. The following declaration, proposed by Mr. Eugen Niederegger was made at the meeting by the voters.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Frank Wenter during the last 15 years as a member of the Board of the Sanitary District of Chicago and during 4 years as president of this board has managed his office with extraordinary capability, unimpeachable honesty and unwavering fidelity in the interests of the taxpayers of the district. He has represented the citizens of the districts and as a prominent representative of the German element of the population the great number of German-American voters with the greatest honor. He has been nominated as president and member of the Board <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1390.jpg" n="2"/>of health. It is therefore resolved by the German-American voters assembled here in Haendels Hall without consideration of other party views, that we indorse him for the office for which he has been nominated by the democratic party and that we undertake individuality and collectively to support him for his election to the best of our ability.</p>
