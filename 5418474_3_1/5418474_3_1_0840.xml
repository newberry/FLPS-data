   <p>The Socialist Club, Forward (Vorwarts) held two days ago its regular agitation meeting under the chairmanship of Comrade Neudeck... Comrade Grattkau made a speech at the request of some conrades on the question: "What role will the German Socialists play in the Coming American Revolution?"</p>
   <p>The speaker treated this question in detail, but made it clear, quite at the start, that there could be no question of so small a fraction of the population as the German Socialists represent in this country, playing any special role in the nightly drama of revolution.</p>
   <p>The German Socialists must play their main role before the outbreak of the revolution, by spreading knowledge of the present social system among the people and by pointing out where we are by necessity drifting. As a special task of present-day Socialists it was possible to speak only as long as the rest of the people are not Socialistic. From the moment when the mass of the people understand what the Socialists want, that is-presumably-at the moment, when the people rise to fight-at that moment <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0841.jpg" n="2"/>the role, or the special task of the earlier Socialists ceases to exist. The man, who today, acquaints himself with Socialism, extinguishes by that the special role of the Socialists of yesterday.</p>
   <p>During the great Revolution, when a great people starts spontaneous action (and the outlines of Socialism are easy to understand) the German Socialists won't exert any apparent influence on the great universal movement.</p>
   <p>The period of influence is the time before the reprising, that is; the present. It would be amazingly arrogant, if the German Socialists would imagine that, living in the midst of a great people, they could, or should want, to lay down strange laws. This would be an insult to the intelligence of the natives.</p>
   <p>The speaker then gave a long series of reasons, why necessarily and naturally the Americans, themselves would take in hand the new regulation of things, after the violent and victorious uprising against the exploiters. This speech was followed by a lively debate in which the comrades, Pabst, Neebe, Hunaneck, Hermann and Grottkau participated.</p>
