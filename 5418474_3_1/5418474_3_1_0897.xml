   <p>Without doubt many readers of the Arbeiter Zeitung still remember the quarrel the German Socialists of Chicago and the Arbeiter Zeitung had in 1878 with the National Executive of the Socialist Labor Party about the right or wrong of arming worker's organizations. It was in the summer of 1878, at the occasion of the first big party picnic, that the Education and Defence Society of Chicago then with a membership of 600, the Irish Labor Guard, and the Bohemian Sharpshooters wanted to march with their arms at the head of the parade. Then Mr. Van Patten, Secretary of the National Executive of the Socialist - Labor Party, dispatched a telegram to the Central committee of Chicago of the Socialist Labor Party, which in short said that the participation of armed organizations under any circumstances should be stopped.</p>
   <p>The evening prior to the picnic a secret section meeting was held regarding this telegram. The greater part of the United English members voted against armed organization, but the Germans who formed a tenfold majority in the party, voted for participation of armed organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0898.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The picnic and the procession was held. At the head the Education and Defence Society marched in full strength and also the other armed organizations. The armed societies were received with great orations all over the city, especially by the working class. Even the capitalist newspaper admitted that 30,000 or more were at the picnic.</p>
   <p>Everything went along in an exemplary manner and a brotherly spirit. The exploiters suddenly acquired a boundless respect for the Socialists. But this success did not prevent the National Executive of Detroit under the leadership of Mr. Van Patten from fighting and digging uninterruptedly against the armed organizations of the proletariat. In official notices, orders, resolutions and through instructions to the party press and the agitators, high pressure was used against arming the people which finally resulted in splitting Chicago's Socialist movement. Elsewhere where armed organization, which regarded themselves as belonging to the socialist parties were still weak, they were successfully kept down by the furious agitation of the nation executive. Later as we know the same national executive and the same party secretary started the agitation for collaboration with the greenback advocates in the presidential election.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0899.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Also in this question the majority of Chicago's Socialists decided for the more radical tendency, which refuses all compromises with the parties of the exploiters. In the meantime the Presidential election was long since over, and the National Congress of the Socialist - Labor Party held in New York. At this congress Mr. Philipp van Patten insisted, that it was not the compromise with the greenbackers that had created the split in the Socialist-Labor Party in this country, but that it was brought about through the debated question of armed organizations. The congress had unpleasant discussions regarding the compromise question and because its defenders and proposers could not admit that through them the decline of the party organization had been created the quiet was blamed on the armed and their defenders.</p>
   <p>But the Party Congress gave an explanation that in the future all compromises with other parties should be avoided. It was so admitted, however reluctantly, that the compromise had been harmful and that the opposition had really been right. However, they still were reproached through forming and defending armed organizations said to have harmed the party. Still,after a two years' discussion one must admit that the compromise policy was bad and is in future to be avoided, so one comes, after four years' consideration, even though slowly and reluctantly, but according to the law of logic, to the realization, that the arming of the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0900.jpg" n="4"/>proletarians is something justified, or at least harmless.</p>
   <p>Under the chairmanship of the party secretary, Philipp van Patten, a strongly attended meeting was held at the Germania assembly rooms, where Mr. S. Schewitch, the editor of the New Yorker Volkszeitung, said: He wished to keep the discussion on American soil, for here the question simply was: Is an armed organization of the workers inside or outside the party desirable or not? (So no longer is the question of arming to be outlawed, altogether but only if it should be done inside or outside the party organization.)</p>
   <p>He who wishes to form an armed organization outside the party should do so without indulging in empty talk.</p>
   <p>Well that is exactly what the Chicagoans had done. The armed organizations did stand outside the Party. They had organized themselves without silly talk and served only the cause of the party, but even in spite of this the national executive didn't stop to aattacks. Now we are satisfied, because in the last New York meeting, evidently they finally admitted that the Chicagoans and the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0901.jpg" n="5"/>Arbeiter Zeitung were as right in the question of arming the people as they had been in that of the compromise.</p>
