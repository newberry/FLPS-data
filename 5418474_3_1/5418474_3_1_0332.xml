   <p>Though the worker earns here at present, on the whole, a little more than in other cities of the Union, yet his situation here is rather less favorable, and that mainly due to the usurious height of house rent. Therefore, the demand of workers for higher wages is very understandable. We are convinced that the overwhelming majority of the workers will restrain their demands to the boundaries of the possible. From the beginning on, we have opposed the attitude of Chief of Police Kennedy, who insinuated, last winter, that the summer would see labor uprisings in consequence of strikes, and that an armed resistance of the authorities should be prepared. We are utterly opposed to the savage accusations of some monopolists and monopolistic papers directed against the desire of the workers for higher wages. On the other hand we are of the opinion that the strike, especially under prevailing circumstances, is the least likely means of reaching the desired end.</p>

   <p>It would be far better to direct moral indignation against the usurers who make life hard for the worker, instead of directing it against intended strikes. And because for the time being there is no hope for the elimination of that usury, the factory owners should, wherever possible, yield to sensible and moderate demands of workers.</p>
