   <p>In our Republic, people are more concerned over the business of Europeans than over their own. To assume the role of a wise though unwonted counsellor seems to be a unique character trait of a nation which believes herself to be farther advanced politically and ethically than others. The only reason we can see is that perhaps they are not directly involved themselves. Roosevelt made Russia and Japan conclude their peace in America. The war, with Germany and Austria-Hungary on one side and the Allies on the other, was hardly a week old when President Wilson offered his services as a mediator. This was in conformity with the wish of the American people, but none of the belligerents involved had asked for it, and nobody could imagine what good a mediation at such an early date could possibly do. We would not say that the [American] Government tried to interfere, but it is undoubtedly true that the [American] people are butting in on the affairs of the belligerent powers. Over here <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0576.jpg" n="2"/>there seems to be a tendency to reshape the map of Europe according to the desires of the American people, and already we can discern preparations for preliminary peace negotiations. The American, if he chooses to think at all, assumes the role of a bigoted preacher, and his sermons are meant for the Germans.</p>
   <p>The North American Republic wants to have a few words to say at the peace conference. Theoretically, there are no objections to that, providing this service would be confined to the role of an honest and sincere negotiator. We do not question the good intentions of this Government in offering the belligerent parties in Europe the unselfish services of a good friend. Neither can we doubt that President Wilson intends to send impartial delegates to his "peace congress." Unfortunately, however, we must earnestly question whether the President will be able at the present time to find such delegates. Public opinion in this country is at the moment so poisoned and prejudiced against Germany and her Ally--at least in the East--that Americans of German and Austro-Hungarian descent realize the impossibility of an impartial judgment on the part of the Americans.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0577.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After the German immigrants had worked and labored unceasingly to bring about a relationship of mutual understanding between Germany and the United States, after hundreds and thousands of them had made bloody sacrifices for the preservation of this Union, they now have to make the discovery that they are hated. Educated Americans, it is true, will say: "We have nothing against the Germans," but they don't forget to add that "the Kaiser must be downed". This is a poor excuse which, even if it was valid, would show nothing but their ignorance of the German people and the structure of the Reich Government. That alibi is just as valid as if we were to say: "The American people are alright, but the Presidents they have elected should have been hanged." Since we know that the [American] people elect their Presidents, such a statement would be the gravest insult imaginable. If the German people are satisfied with their Kaiser, the rest of the world is ill advised to make a distinction between him and his people. If the German people prefer a monarchy to the republican form of government, there are probably reasons for it, and the tactless [American] attempts to convert them [the German people] are regarded as an uncalled for interference; after all, the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0578.jpg" n="4"/>German people did not shape their form of government the day before yesterday, but have had it for a long time.</p>
   <p>He who wants to play the role of counsellor must be above any suspicion. The [American] public, thanks to the [anti-German] propaganda of the American press, cannot fulfill this requirement. Bryan's peace proposals have the same value as England's former suggestions for disarmaments. International politics are probably guided by some code of ethics, but in the final analysis only the self-interest of each nation really counts. Treaties of any kind become worthless the moment vital interests of a signatory nation dictate differently. At the outbreak of the war, Germany was faced with precisely this situation. Like a civilized person, she asked her neighbor [Belgium] for permission to go across his lot, with all damages to be paid. Not only that, but Germany offered an additional payment for any eventual loss in prestige her little neighbor would suffer. Belgium refused. But Germany saw her very existence threatened and acted as anyone would if faced with a pressing danger. Americans did not take this into consideration. They judged and condemned Germany on <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0579.jpg" n="5"/>superficial evidence, and this discriminatory attitude makes them unfit to arbitrate now. In this peace conference, justice will decide, justice as the Germans always have interpreted it. The United States will be considered too.</p>
   <p>The beautiful explanations, which Mr. Charles C. Hyde, professor of international law at Northwestern University, made to a distinguished audience in the City Club, will be appreciated by every German, but the poison of [anti-German] propaganda has already done its work, and we have no antidote for it at the present time. The German born or German-American citizen will later remember this. It will influence his future political attitude. These kicks in the pants will neither be forgotten nor forgiven.</p>
