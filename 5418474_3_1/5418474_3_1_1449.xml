<title level="a">THE GERMANS ARE TIRED OF IRISH RULE IN THE FIFTH AND SIXTH WARD.</title></bibl>

   <p>It appears that the better citizens and, above all, the German population have finally agreed to unite in the 5th ward where such men as Pat. Wall, Dan Corkery, and others of similar type, have, until now, wielded the sceptor. The poeple of this district, who were insulted in an unheard of manner by the Irish ward bosses at the recent primary election, are now realizing the outrage committed against them and have decided to unite against the mutual enemy.</p>
   <p>It was in the 5th ward that Washington Hesing was told, before the primary election, that he would not get a single delegate for the convention even if he should provide each voter with a gun. Against such methods only a strong and united protest by all the law-abiding <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1450.jpg" n="2"/>citizens can be effective. The meeting held yesterday in the Liberty Hall, Union Avenue and 31st Street, gave sufficient evidence that the people are becoming alarmed. The Germans had come in large numbers, because they especially had been insulted. If they would only prove their real strength and everyone vote on April 4th, then the Irish autocrats would soon find out that they are through.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. John Koelzer, introduced Washington Hesing as the first speaker of the evening. Cheers from all sides greeted him. He explained that a similar condition had forced the citizens in 1873 to rely on yourselves. Today the slogan is: "Down with the Gang!" The will of the people will decide in favor of justice and right. The prevailing corruption of the local Democratic Party has brought about a unification of the law-abiding citizens irrespective of party <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1451.jpg" n="3"/>affiliations. At this time it is not a question of personal liberty, or of school problems, but of the honest management of our money. Of the 8,000 votes in the 5th ward, the Germans have nearly one-fourth as 1,859 voters are registered. Therefore, the Germans are entitled to the election of their candidate for alderman, J. Krebs, who deserves the full confidence of all the voters.</p>
   <p>The speaker then proceeded to review the different candidates. He emphasized Allerton's liberal viewpoints, and stated that he was well known, particularly in this district, and, therefore, well respected. Hesing's speech, accepted with enthusiastic applause, was supplemented by eloquent appeals from A. C. Oldenburg, John Schaefer, and John Hepburn, the alderman of the 4th ward.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1452.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A similar meeting was held in the Germania Hall, corner 34th Street and Halsted Avenue. The citizens of the 6th ward, who are facing similar problems as those of the 5th ward, also realize that only the end of the Irish rule can bring about political independence and prosperity. Mr. Hesing and the other speakers have explained the situation to the audience very clearly.</p>
   <p>That Mr. Hesing and the others had hit the nail on the head was evidenced by the large attendance, and by the profuse applause.</p>
