   <p>The Baker's Meeting which was held at Steinmueller's Halle, 45 North Clark Street, was very well attended. The extreme heat, which prevailed yesterday, could not effect the animated spirit of the audience. Mr. Brandholz opened the meeting, after which the appointment of officers took place.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gustav Eschenbach was proposed for the presidency and elected by a large majority. Mr. John Metzkes was elected secretary and Mr. Chr. Schade treasurer. The next act was, the unanimous acceptance of the proposed constitution. After organizing the Union, by appointing all of its' officials, the agitation for a proposed establishment of a registry office, for procuring work, and a shorter working day, regulation of wages, and the objectionable boarding system by their bosses, have been the questions to be discussed.</p>
   <p>All of this, created an animated debate. It has been decided, to appoint a Labor strike Committee, at the next meeting. As for the agitation itself, it is important, that all the comrades join the Unions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0100.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The English Baker's Union, pledged its support, to the German Bakers. The speaker of the English Committee pointed out, that Chicago's Bakers, have received much higher wages formerly, and only through their German bosses, who require a 14-18 hours work day, and the pay, - Oh, ridiculously small, they all have to submit to such conditions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grottkau has been requested, to speak his opinion in this matter. He proposed, that the Bakers print a pamphlet and distribute it throughout Chicago, thus all the Bakers may learn the true conditions, and therefore find it necessary to join the Union. This proposition has been accepted. Many new members were enlisted.-</p>
