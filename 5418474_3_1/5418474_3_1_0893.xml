<title level="a">THE FOUNDING OF AN AGITATION CLUB.</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Last night's meeting at Nutzhorn's Hall on Milwaukee Avenue was attended by about fifty persons. The founding of an agitation section of the Socialist Labor Party on the Northwest Side similar to those already operating on the North, South, and Southwest Side came up for discussion.</p>
   <p>William Blum was elected chairman and August Spies secretary.</p>
   <p>Comrades Grottkau and Spies explained the nature of the meeting and pointed out the advantages gained by the Party through these agitation clubs. They also explained, that no organization heretofore could be established due to some disturbing elements, whose elimination was of great importance. To attend these meetings with the sole purpose of disturbing and disorganizing them as a well known Jesuit and his pupil were doing who had no other interest in the movement, was an infamy that has to be ended for the sake and welfare of the Party.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0894.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued, with the final decision to expel the undesirables. After order was restored, the meeting continued with the task of organizing. The statutes of the northside clubs were adopted with only a few changes, after which the election of officials took place with the following results: Corresponding secretary: August Spies; Secretary of Finances: F. Waterstraat; Revisers: Schernig, Hanschke and Toldte; Delegates to the Central Committee: Linnemeyer and Stemmler.</p>
   <p>It is important that the laboring people shall be enlightened as to the economic maladjustment from which their suffering arises, that they learn of the injustice done to them, and that they thus can enter into a fight for the removal of these evils.</p>
   <p>This is the purpose, for which last night's organization club has been founded. The order of the day for the next meeting, to be held Thursday night, includes a Political Review by A. Spies, and "Workers Policies in contrast to the Policies of all other Parties," by Paul Grottkau.</p>
