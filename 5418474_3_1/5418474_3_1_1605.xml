   <p>A large number of citizens, enough to fill the small hall of the North Side Turnhalle, met yesterday evening to express their objections to several statements made about Judge Kaufmann of the police court during a meeting at the Clarendon Hotel last Thursday evening. At the Turnhalle meeting Democrats, Republicans, Germans, Irish and Americans were present.</p>
   <p>Frank Agnew opened the session. Assessor S. B. Chase was nominated chairman, Messrs. Francis A. Hoffmann Jr., K. G. Schmidt, F. B. Chase, Louis Schaffner, E. Hummel, Thomas O'Malley, ex-Alderman Sweeney, Alderman Barrett, and County Commissioner Lenzen were selected vice-presidents, and Messrs. Peter Hansborough and Fred Becker secretaries.</p>
   <p>On motion of Geo. Braham, the drafting of resolutions was entrusted to Messrs. K. G. Schmidt, ex-Alderman Sweeney, Louis Schaffner and Louis Nachmann. <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1606.jpg" n="2"/>While the committee withdrew to consider resolutions, a letter from E. S. Dreyer was read, in which he declared that he was not present at the meeting at the Clarendon Hotel, and that he knew nothing about his election as chairman of a committee which was to present objections to the mayor about Kaufmann's nomination until the day before yesterday, and that he [Dreyer] refused to accept the chairmanship. Mr. Freudenberg, a long-time employee of Mr. Dreyer, assured the assembly that Mr. Dreyer not only thinks highly of Judge Kaufmann, but also that he definitely favors his renomination.</p>
   <p>Hansborough read a copy of the police records which showed that the Reinsch family not only was convicted often, but that they asked for a change of venue to Judge Hammill's court whenever possible. The chairman remarked that he had called attention to the foregoing, because it was asserted at the Clarendon Hotel meeting that Judge Kaufmann was particularly lenient toward the Reinsch family, known to be a bunch of thieves.</p>
   <p>W. W. O'Brien spoke next, and emphasized that the people who had come to the <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1607.jpg" n="3"/>meeting were impartial, and then commented on Kaufmann's good character in simple but convincing words. The opponents of Kaufmann objected to him because of personal reasons, but had no evidence to present against the man, who has been well known for years. Judge Kaufmann was "O K" and one of the best men who ever administered police court affairs. The respectable element of the North Side demanded that Kaufmann continue as police court judge and he [O'Brien] had no doubts of the mayor's concurrence in the matter.</p>
   <p>The committee returned, and General Schaffner declared, that the following resolution had been drafted:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That Justice of the Peace H. A. Kaufmann's reputation and character have been defamed, and that the accusations are both untrue and disgraceful.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That these charges originated among persons whose motives are not based upon the interests of the people, but rather upon malevolence and vindictiveness.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1608.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Resolved, That we hereby declare these charges to be untrue and malicious, and we further declare Judge Kaufmann, in his capacity as judge as well as that of citizen, to be a man of unimpeachable character; that, as a resident of the city for more than twenty years, he enjoys the good will and confidence of all respectable, law-abiding citizens, regardless of party affiliation; and that we denounce the attacks made upon him as being attributable to pernicious motives.</p>
   <p>"We hereby express our implicit confidence in the honesty, integrity and ability of our respected fellow citizen, and assure him that the attacks made upon him do not detract in any manner from his reputation, as far as respectable citizens are concerned."</p>
   <p>The resolution was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>Attorney Trude gave a lengthy speech about one of Kaufmann's main opponents, Gottschalck, a young lawyer and suitable tool of the great reformer Larned, and, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1609.jpg" n="5"/>in speaking of the young man, he exposed him to be a climber rather than a man with honorable ambitions.</p>
   <p>General Schaffner also made a few favorable remarks about Kaufmann; later his motion to nominate a committee of fifteen to present the resolution to the mayor was accepted.</p>
   <p>The committee nominated to present the resolution asking that Kaufmann continue as justice of the peace, consisted of the following gentlemen: W. W. O'Brien, Chas. Denehy, H. Y. Lenzen, General Schaffner, Alderman Meyer, John Paul, Alderman Barrett, Patrick Loftus, George Braham, F. A. Hoffmann Jr., Joseph Schuster, K. G. Schmidt, William Meier, M. Sweeney, J. K. Miller, F. L. Chase and S. B. Chase.</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
