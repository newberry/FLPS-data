   <p>A commendable decision was arrived at by the Aurora Turner Society in answer to the defamation by its enemy, Meik. It is our pleasant duty to inform our readers of this decision by giving it space in today's issue of the paper. It reads as follows' "In consideration of the fact that certain people seem to take much pleasure in denouncing the Aurora Turner Society, which is nothing but a business move, trying thus to win members for a newly founded society, an act fully premeditated and unworthy of any man and considering: That this agitation is not confined to the members of the society alone, but has been carried to a large area of the north west side, and taking further into consideration, that the entire German press of Chicago has formed a plot against us, the article published in the Staats Zeitung was supplied by our enemies, and the Freie Presse spoke of us as the anarchistic band, although neither made the slightest attempt to investigate their low accusations, therefore, the Aurora Turner Society feels obliged to give the people of the northwest side an explanation. This is not an apology, because we are always ready to answer for our actions. Through the twenty-two years of its existence, this society has enjoyed the hearty support of the people of the northwest side and thus became one of the largest societies. Our reply to the accusation that the majority of the Turners favor socialism is, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0754.jpg" n="2"/>that our Federal Constitution and the constitution of the Society provides liberty for every member to attach himself to any political party he chooses. Therefore it is quite possible that the members of the A. T. S. are not divided in two groups only, Republicans and Democrats, but according to their view points belong to the socialist party as well. And we don't deny, either, that we are in full accord with every movement for the betterment of conditions of labor, for every one of us is a working man and it seems only natural, that we would push toward our goal. One of the main arguments is, that the society contributed $100.00 to the fund of the anarchists, thus putting seemingly the stamp of approval on their act. As is well known, August and Christ Spies have been for years members of the Society and it may be also known, that this Society is always ready to give financial support to any of its members if circumstances call for it. We were informed at a meeting five weeks ago, that Chicago capitalists are ready to employ the best known lawyers as aid to the attorney general, and are also trying to influence our prominent lawyers not to lend their services to the accused men. It should also be borne in mind that a fund for anarchists was not known five weeks ago. It was always our policy to give assistance to a member in distress.</p>
   <p>Would it be considered an honorable act of this society, if we had forsaken the accused men as so many others did who formerly considered it an honor to be their <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0755.jpg" n="3"/>friends? We did put the $100.00 at their disposal to hire defense attorneys, but we did not make any contributions to an anarchistic fund as was stated erroneously. Even the worst criminals are assured of some defense, and the brothers Spies, so far, have not been identified as such. The Aurora Turner Society made also known that it decidedly condemns the Haymarket Riots, which can only harm the labor question. This society has never had any dealings with the rest of the leaders of anarchy."</p>

   <p>star roles cannot be recognized from the telegraphic reports. They gave a cause by their meeting, but the brutal acts of violence, pillage and robbery were certainly committed by that mob with which the honest, striving to make a living by the way of labor, can see no pressing inducement to join. The nature of the matter makes it appear that the loafing and criminal classes take great advantage of such occasions. The real laborers, if they are not driven to despair by hunger and starvation, know well enough that a riot that stops all business is the worst medium by which to better their situation.</p>
