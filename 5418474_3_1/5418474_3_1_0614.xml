   <p>During the last few days the Anarchists of Chicago, those that still remain again manifested their absurdity and madness. At their so-called meetings in memory of the dead comrades many provoking and bloodthirsty remarks were made, but almost all of these by agitators from elsewhere.</p>
   <p>According to press reports from other cities these activities threaten to give Chicago a bad reputation. Even such newspapers which are friendly towards Chicago ask the question, "Can Chicago expect visitors to the World's Fair so long as agitation and threats against the existing order of society are tolerated in their midst?" The same question will soon reach our ears from the different countries in Europe.</p>
   <p>However, Chicago four or five years ago proved to the world, how it can deal with anarchists, as soon as they attempt to put their teachings into action. No visitor needs to be afraid of the anarchists here, for Chicago will know how to silence them.</p>
   <p>The weakness of the anarchists in such a large industrial city as Chicago is <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0615.jpg" n="2"/>evidence, when one considers the shrinking of their German newspaper which appeals to the workers in its desperate need. Where these anarchistical agitations can lead to if not stopped in time has been shown us by the happenings of May 4, 1886. If the local authorities prevent them from continuing their activities before the misguided men land in prison or upon the gallows, it would be considered a charitable action.</p>
   <p>Real Anarchists can be found in the United States almost without exception in its two largest cities, New York and Chicago. Among them there are also Anglo-Americans. One of their foremost pioneers was an Anglo-American, but they have lost him recently. His name is H. O. Pentecost, who was a prominent preacher years ago. He embraced socialism and atheism and finally left the pulpit and became a journalist and agitator for the most radical socialists, from whom he soon turned to become an anarchist condemning all social and governmental institutions.</p>
