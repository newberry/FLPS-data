   <p>The master workman of the National District Assembly, No. 216, K. of L., H. T. Skeffington is in Chicago at present to organize the shoemakers who are either not organized at all, or are split in various unions, into his own assembly.</p>
   <p>In his opinion the danger lies in the fact that shoe manufacturing is controlled by foreign working men in Chicago who are being opposed by native working men. In most factories the laborers are under the supervision of foremen who came from the same country as the laborers, and who regulate the shops according to their own ideas and in addition receive a commission from the owners.</p>
   <p>This procedure will last as long as foreign labor is kept out of the labor organizations or is treated with hostility.</p>
   <p>American labor should try to elevate foreign labor to its own standard instead of fighting and suppressing it.</p>
   <p>Although there is a lot of truth in Skeffington's words, in many trades and crafts it is just the American, the native working man, who competes <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0073.jpg" n="2"/>and who helps to depress wages if he cannot otherwise take advantage of his foreign fellow worker.</p>
   <p>This we find with the saddlers, for instance, and in the case of the C. B. &amp; 0. railroad.</p>
