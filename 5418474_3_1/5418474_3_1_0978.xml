   <p>The German Section of the Socialistic Workmen's Union held their regular business meeting, yesterday afternoon at 54 W. Lake Street. About 30 persons were present. With reference tothe amounts collected for deported Socialists, the existing committee has been instructed to communicate with authorized persons in New York and elsewhere as to where the money is meeded most urgently and to act accordingly. A reprimanded Socialist, who had must arrived in Chicago and was in great need, has received $8.00 from the Committee.</p>
   <p>The matter of a library was then discussed. A Committee has been elected, which should collect the books, index them and submit a plan at the next meeting for the formation of a library of Socialistic books accessible to everybody. The financial report read by the treasurer was very favorable. The selection of the officers was as follows:- Agent Gustav Bartels, Secretary: R. Dietzins, Financial Secretary; Kalina, Treasurer; Wm. Medow, auditors, H. Selle, Meritschke and Schmidt.</p>
