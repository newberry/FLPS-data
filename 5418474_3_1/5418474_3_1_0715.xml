   <p>A lengthy explanation by A. R. Parsons, one of the seven anarchists condemned to death, was sent by his wife to newspaper reporters with the request for publication. It says: "To the American people. Fellow citizens! The death sentence passed upon me on the grounds of murder is known to every one. The Criminal Court and the Supreme Court of Illinois convicted me as an accomplice in the murder of policeman Deegen, May 4th, 1886. As I am innocent of this crime, I choose this way to communicate with the world free of prejudice." Parsons then says that there is no proof of his participation, or of inciting speeches that resulted in the bomb throwing. The supreme court simply refers to an article written by him and published in the Alarm, December 6th, 1884, which reads: "A dynamite bomb handled the right way, will destroy a whole regiment," etc. In fact, these words are only a quotation from General Sheridan's annual report to congress. His speeches, with one exception only, were highly exaggerated, most of the stories made up by reporters' imaginations. Reporter English confessed, that he received orders to report only the most inciting utterances. Parsons insists further, that communion was preached by Jesus Christ and ends by saying: "I am not guilty and my guilt has not been proven. Therefore I appeal to you, who followed the trial carefully, to pronounce me either guilty or innocent of the crime. I do not ask for mercy but for justice, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0716.jpg" n="2"/>and therefore I could not accept a modification of the sentence. I do not speak for the other sentenced men, but as for myself I say, 'Give me liberty or give me death!'"</p>

   <p>The next speaker, Dr. Ernst Schmidt, said in German: "My friends! There is very little which I could add to the remarks of Mr. Sloan. I do want to say that it is a great satisfaction to see so many people assembled here in protest against the scandalous handling of the law. I assure you that during my thirty years as resident of Chicago not a single murderer with $500.00 in cash at his disposal was hanged. The law always found a way out for a scoundrel or an exploiter. Furthermore there wont be a change in these conditions, unless labor will come to the conclusion that laws are here for its suppression, with exclusive favoritism for the wealthy....Here is an illustration. In the year of 1870 Devine, a boiler-factory owner shot and killed one of his workers when he demanded of Devine his unpaid back wages....What did the intelligent jury do? It freed the murderer. This is a plain demonstration, that laws are made for the poor but not for the wealthy. Jacobson driven to desperation by his exploiter, and not having been familiar with the ways of this country, deemed, it best to plead guilty. This was more than welcome to the States Attorney, for he had to have a victim for whom he could not look among the wealthy....Finally I want to say, that if you proletarians learned to see <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0718.jpg" n="4"/>the wrongs done, as in the case of the poor and deserted "tramp" Jacobson, and so came to the conclusion that this is nothing else but a combat between wealth and destitution, then the poor and friendless "tramp" did not die in vain."</p>
   <p>Comrade August Spies read then the following unanimously accepted decisions:</p>
   <p>Resolved, this meeting is of the opinion, that if law and order demanded Jacobson's hanging, while wealthy murderers are freed, we don't wish to be considered as people complying with such law and order - and</p>
   <p>Resolved, that the brain of the dead Jacobson should be examined, and that it should be established, that according to the law of the rich, a judicial murder of an insane man has been committed, and this we demand to be proven beyond doubt....</p>
   <p>Comrade Spies said in German, that the main purpose of this meeting was to declare war upon the murderers of our class Comrade Jacobson....If the workers should ever realize that they are being cheated and should declare themselves <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0719.jpg" n="5"/>unwilling to submit to further robbery, they would be considered as law-breakers with the militia mowing them down mercilessly. We have to prepare for a day like that. Such happenings are not ordinary, and its character is of the type of a class combat...</p>
