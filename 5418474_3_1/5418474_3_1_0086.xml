  <body>
   <p>In Folz's Hall, there was held a workingmen's meeting with an attendance of 200 to 300 people, which was called by the Carpenters and Joiners Union to discuss the question of wages. Brother Ebert presided, instead of Paul Grottkau, who was prevented from appearing. Michael Schwab gave a lecture in which he stressed the necessity of the workingmen organizaing. McGinnis spoke after him calling attention to the fact that it is necessary to ask the contractors to pay $3.00 instead of $2.50 per day. All carpenters should insist that they get $3.00 per day. Zuierlein and Poch gave more information about the regulations of the Carpenters and Joiners' Union. After a considerable number of new members joined the union, Mr. Schombel of the Furniture Joiners Union announced that should they compel the carpenters to strike, no member of his union would work in the place of the strikers. Among others, one of the following speakers said that during the whole week there would be evening meetings in Seaman's Hall, 99 W. Randolph St., where matters pertaining to the carpenters will be discussed.</p>
