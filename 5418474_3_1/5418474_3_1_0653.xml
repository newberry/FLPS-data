   <p>Mr. Raster is mad again. He is running around like an old obstinate he-goat, looking for some one to devour. It it an amusing show, the more amusing as every body knows that his mad bleating is absolutely harmless. Although Mr. Raster has an ungodly snout when it is a matter of devouring something,he would object to losing even one tooth to fight an anarchist.</p>
   <p>To fight, he goes to his headquarters (saloon) on 5th Avenue and battles with some frankfurters and sauerkraut and a bottle of wine. Madly he asks did our ancestors buy this right with their blood: "to advocate with impunity in public meetings: murder, homicide, arson and the forceful overthrow of all national and social conditions"..</p>
   <p>We would like to know first who has ever advocated murder, manslaughter or arson? We are directing herewith this question to Mr. Raster and he owes us an answer. The writer of this article has attended more than a hundred meetings of workers during this year and heard only once an incitement to murder, manslaughter, and arson. That person evidently was one of Bonfield's spies....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0654.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We therefore declare that Mr. Raster and the rest of the capitalistic press simply lie.</p>
