   <p>The impending city elections and the often heard assertion that the Germans are not pleased with the present administration wishing Colvin back at the helm of the city caused us to interview several prominent Germans of the city. The information gathered seemingly favors Mr. Heath in preference to his Republican rival Mr. Wright although on the one important German question he entirely shares the opinion of Mr. Heath. He considers the Sunday bigotry as a thing of the past and also made the statement that a good city administration for Chicago could be obtained only through German participation. Mr. Henry Greenebaum the first one interviewed by our reporter said that he is well pleased with Heath's administration and would favor his re-election. Yes, I am pleased with the present city council, and too the majority of our aldermen are in the real sense of the word city fathers instead of city pillagers. Yes, I would be for the reelection of the majority of the members of the present city council. Mr. Louis Wahl was interviewed next and said: "I consider it dangerous to change horses in the middle of a stream. Yes, I give my support whole heartedly to Heath. The reasons? First: By taking the office of mayor he with the help of the city council saved our city from the brink of ruin; he brought about the betterment of conditions and the solvency of the city, thus the citizens did not fear to <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1676.jpg" n="2"/>draw the money from their saving or stocking banks in order to take it to the comptroller where honesty and capability was well known.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hirsch and Mr. Muhlke expressed themselves very favorably for Heath. Architect August Baner praises Heath and the members of the city council. General Hubert Dilger, Messrs. Charles Bergho, Louis Borlin, Julius Bauer, Gustav Ruprecht, J. Wm. Eschenburg and many others all of whom wish Heath's reelection.</p>
