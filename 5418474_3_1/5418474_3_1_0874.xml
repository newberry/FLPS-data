   <p>The Central Committee's Session at which comrade Bluhm presided was held last night. Representatives of different clubs gave their reports. Comrade Schwab called to attention the proposed selling of pamphlets and Comrade Spies asked for a loan of $20.00 for the purchase of literature in question. Mr. Schwab was entrusted with the management of this. The centralization for the sale of such was recommended. The South side club asked the management of the Socialist Publishing Society, to employ as newsboys only those who are members of one of the clubs.</p>
   <p>The newly established Bohemian Club sent two representatives, to ask the Central Committee to send a delegation to view their new club.</p>
   <p>A committee of Messrs. Spies, Livoni and Schwab was appointed to visit and report on the new club. Comrade Winnen proposed to abolish the paying of taxes by clubs separately. This will be discussed at the next meeting. Concerning the question of agitation literature several proposals were made and accepted. It was decided, to have the Communist manifesto and LaSalle's "Right and Power" and "About the Constitution" appear in English. The question what the connection of the "Lehr and Wehr Verein" to the Socialist party is, shall be discussed by each club.</p>
