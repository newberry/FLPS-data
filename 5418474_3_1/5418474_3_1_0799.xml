   <p>The Southside Socialists held their regular agitation meeting last Saturday. Comrade Stapke presided. There was a large attendance in spite of the unfavorable weather. Comrade Muller reported on the subject: "Is there a God?"</p>
   <p>The speaker, whose deductions were followed with great attention, received at the close of his lecture, the plaudits of the audience.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken up for the benefit of a sick comrade and also for the family Stellmacher, which totaled $11.60. Besides $5.00 was allowed from the treasury for the benefit of a comrade's family which was in great need. It was resolved to hold an evening entertainment in the near future, combined with bestowing names upon children. Two invitations were received to festivities by the groups "Town of Lake" and "Vorwarts" after which they adjourned.</p>
