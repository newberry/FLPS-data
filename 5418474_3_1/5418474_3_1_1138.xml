   <p>The members of the "International Society," celebrated, yesterday afternoon, in the Globe Theatre, the anniversay of the proclamation of the Paris Commune. Attendance was pretty large; there were even a few ladies present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zimpel opened the meeting (apparently in German), Mr. Traner in Swedish.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karl Klings made a long address: " A year ago," he said, "the greatest epoch of the history of the world opened; for the night of March 17th to March 18th, the first open fight between 'bourgeois' and worker broke out. So many lies have been spread about the Paris Commune, it is time to tell the truth." The next speaker was a Mr. Eger, who spoke in Swedish and whose elegant appearance did not seem to prove that a just share of fruits of his labor had been withheld from him. He gave a fiery address and was frequently interrupted by applause.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Traner Jr., spoke in English, admonishing every worker to educate himself for the struggle. "Even if we should not see the end, perhaps we shall <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1139.jpg" n="2"/>succeed in gaining for our children a better future," he said. Finally, Mr. Krause, spoke in German, and Mr. Charles Dilke, in English.</p>
