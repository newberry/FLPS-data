   <p>Held a meeting last night attended by distinguished citizens of the 15th, 16th, and 18th wards. Among whom were Justus Kilian, V. C. Turner, Theodor Karls, L. J. Kadisch, Wm. Lob, John H. Muhlke, Mich. Schweisthal and others.</p>
   <p>After the opening of the meeting, Mr. Stewart the President of the Citizens Society introduced Colonel Edmund Fussen who said, that as he understands the society meeting which turned its back on the party and forgot both, party hatred as well as party love. He wishes the Society all the luck in such a "departure". Many times he had supported this reform even when he know that obstacles confronted him; he is greatly pleased that there were no candidates on this platform who were seekers of public offices, but only those who were sought as candidates for these offices. They are not men whose ambition it was over a period of years, to occupy these offices for their own selfish advantage but men who were almost forced to consent to become candidates. He is glad that there are no professional politicians present, for this is any way not the right place for them to be and feel comfortable. It is high time that something was being done, because the country is in great danger of ruin and corruption piled upon corruption. ... He pointed out that the party system not only undermined the moral <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1670.jpg" n="2"/>sense of the people but has lowered the esteem of the United States in foreign countries. But I do believe that we are approaching a better era. He would be ridiculous and absurd to say, that the man for whom he did not vote at the last presidential election, did not commence the great work of reform. He acknowledges the good will of Mr. Hayes but it will take time to accomplish the task which he feels determined to do. ...</p>
   <p>The speaker then said, that there was no special accusation against either the Democratic or Republican candidates (Lengacher) but that he was just recently converted to saving and reform whereas Mr. Schweisthal the candidate chosen by the Citizens Society against his wish, is the man to be depended upon. But with regard to the reform movement we can not stop with city affairs; it has to be extended to governmental and national affairs. The undesirable conditions which prevailed, where due to the fact that professional politicians and not the people elected officials and legislators; if they were willing to perform this duty themselves, there is not the slightest doubt of success and we could live in hope that once again we could be proud of our Republic. ...</p>
   <p>Mr. Michael Schweisthal was asked to appear which he obligingly did and explained <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1671.jpg" n="3"/>that he consented to become a candidate upon one condition that is, that he would devote time to this office only, which he could spare away from his business, which is his and his family's livelihood. Also that he can not make any financial sacrifices in connection with the election. If he did, he would have to expect that the office he would hold would have to compensate him, which he as an honest man and wishing to remain so could not do.</p>
