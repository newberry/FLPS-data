   <p>The shirt is closer to us than the coat. Our industry is more important to America than to Germany. International political sentimentality must be relegated to the world benefactors; practical politics deals only in possibilities, and a statesman may as well shed his skin as be able to trespass beyond the confines of his nation's interests.</p>
   <p>The American shirt clings to our body more tenaciously than the German coat, the French blouse or the Russian jacket. Our statesmen can only serve Americanism and regard our connections with foreign powers in the light of American interests; just as Count Buelow, who endeavors to promote the German cause but at the same time tries to show all possible consideration to friendly neighboring countries.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0584.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When England, in her race for supremacy, excelled all other industrial and commercial nations by a margin of several decades, the Manchester school announced the destructive theory that free trade is the only feasible dogma for commerce.</p>
   <p>It is applicable only to the richest and most industrialized nation; all other countries who grovel over the tortuous path of development and lack capital, find it tantamount to suicide.</p>
   <p>The schools teachers and professors who discover such convincing solutions for everything on paper, were mostly apostles of free trade, and the English Cobden Club supplied ample funds to buy the press and other essential propaganda mediums in other countries.</p>
   <p>The United States was the first to show a disinclination to follow this precept. The Republicans became avowed proponents of a protective tariff and thereby fostered American industry.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0585.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This levy on imports reached its culmination with the McKinley Law in the year 1890 and the Dingley Statute in 1897. At present a gradual reduction of this tax may be expected, because most of our American enterprises have matured sufficiently and can risk competition in the world market without having to fear a debacle.</p>
   <p>The protective-duty principle has also found acclaim in other countries, and if one peruses the recent speech of the German chancellor and his commendations of the system, republican Americans must feel highly elated. Count Buelow said: "I consider it is the Governments obligation to balance its present economical inequalities and to support those who cannot help themselves through their own efforts. I shall always believe, that, if one member of a social body suffers, all others will be affected thereby; particularly, if such an important branch as agriculture shows unsoundness, the entire organism must become afflicted."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_0586.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Protection here, protection there. The state is the patron of the people. The eye of the state watches all our interests; the state's arm protects the weak, helps the needy, and defends the land and its people.</p>
   <p>This savors of socialism. Since Germany and Austria face a shortage of coal, one speaks quite unreservedly of governmental ownership of the coal deposits.</p>
   <p>Sensible socialism is propogated by paternalism, but the Schlaraffenland-communism finds no place there. Socialism manifests itself at first in the protective tariff schedules, and Germany is on the road to a social-constitutional monarchy, considering the concessions which are made in that direction. [Schlaraffenland, a mythical land, where baked squabs fly into the mouths of the indolent. Transl.]</p>
