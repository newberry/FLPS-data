   <p>At the request of many of our readers, we are publishing the speech of Dr. E. Schmidt, mayoral candidate, delivered at the Jaegerverein picnic on June 15. The friends of the speaker will thereby see how he adopted the methods of that loudmouthed agitator, Dennis Kearney; and how the Doctor unequivocally advocates murder and bloodshed--in the name of liberty, of course; the "liberty" which classifies every laborer not employed on a piece-work basis as "the people" and regards all other humans as crooks. His speech follows:</p>
   <p>"My friends! Vigilance is the price of liberty! In our time, when crooks have attained office and seek by dubious devices to rob the people of their last remnant of liberty, it is indeed inspiring to behold an assembly of men who are willing to do their share in defending our heritage. Your Verein subscribes to noble principles; therefore be undismayed in defending them! By persistence, you will reach the goal--the emancipation of the oppressed.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1004.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Liberty and equality are inscribed on your banner--and that brings terror to the ruling horde of crooks, that is the reason why they passed a law that you shall not become proficient in the use of arms. What a despicable act! The right to bear arms is guaranteed to every citizen by the Constitution. The administration has not the courage to deny it, but, in spite of the law of the land, the lawmakers of our State intend to use a militia law to keep you from becoming proficient in the use of arms. Isn't it all a contradiction? Are there two kinds of liberty, liberty "on paper" and real liberty? Liberty on paper is not freedom; the only true liberty is the right of action. This mock "paper" liberty is to be preserved as far as you are concerned, but the right to become proficient in arms is to be denied you in order to make it easier to subjugate and exploit you. That archcrook, Governor Cullom, signed the militia bill at the behest of the monopolists and exploiters, and a few days later vetoed the Truck bill, the only worth-while law passed by the legislature this year. But I hope to see the time when these traitors are called to an accounting, when the miserable shyster tricks of the crooks and <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1005.jpg" n="3"/>traitors are done away with. I have never been awe-struck by government seals or epaulets, and therefore the governor's seal and the swallow-tailed coats and tassels of the state militia which shall hereafter represent the power of this state cannot arouse my respect! My friends! As long as you remain as peaceful as you have been, no one has a right to deprive you of your arms, or prevent you from practicing with them to gain proficiency. I can therefore only regard as miserable crooks and scoundrels all those who drafted, voted for, and signed the militia bill, which is so inimical to the interests of the people. Be persistent in your efforts and in your organizational work, because some day when exploitation becomes too unbearable, you may have to use your arms in the defense of liberty.</p>
   <p>"We live in a time when the exploiting clique endeavors to have the poor man shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the state, while all the privileges and rights accrue to the preferred class. It must not always be thus! Equal obligations and equal rights--this is the motto on your flag, the banner <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1006.jpg" n="4"/>of humanitarianism and justice.</p>
   <p>"You have selected red as your color. Red is the color of love, the color of solidarity and liberty for all. Keep this flag unsullied as long as the spark of life is within you. Red is the color of blood. When you look upon your red flag, think of the unselfish men in Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland, and France who have spilled their blood for the cause of liberty. And if ever an attempt is made in this country to rob you of your liberty, think of your duty, which consists in defending freedom.</p>
   <p>"The red flag is the banner of the proletarians, it signifies the dawn of a new and just era, a better epoch which has neither exploiters nor subjugated classes, a period which has free and happy people only.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, protect your red flag with everything that is dear and sacred to you! Protect it with your lives! Remain true to the principles of socialism, <pb facs="5418474_3_1_1007.jpg" n="5"/>and you can rest assured that your cause, the cause of humanity which opposes corruption, will win!</p>
   <p>"But eternal vigilance is necessary; it is the price of liberty. Therefore, be always prepared. You have a precious possession. Defend it as befits men!"</p>
