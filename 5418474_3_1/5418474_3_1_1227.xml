   <p>Senator Kent E, Keller, one of the Democratic candidates for the nomination for the office of governor, enjoys the full support of the Chicago Teachers' Federation. In a circular sent out in his behalf by the well-known leader, Miss Margaret A. Haley, the Federation says:</p>
   <p>"On the occasion of the primaries, Democrats have the first opportunity in a long time to vote for a progressive Democrat. The man is Kent E. Keller of Jackson County, member of the State Senate during Dunne's governorship. Senator Keller's record shows that he is a friend of the people and an advocate of government by the people, and not by special interests".....</p>
   <p>"Kent E. Keller favors political independence and is supported by all progressive Democrats. Organized labor unanimously endorses his candidacy".....</p>

   <p>In an effort to make it easy for its readers, the Abendpost will, shortly before the election (perhaps on Saturday), publish a list of candidates who appear worthy of support by German-American voters. Those who agree with these recommendations should cut them out of the paper and take them to the polling place on Tuesday, April 8. We draw special attention to the need of making a cross opposite the name of each candidate for whom you wish to vote.</p>
