<title level="a">JUDICIAL ELECTIONS</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In November we will have judicial elections. Those who watch public life know the importance of these elections for the American working class.</p>
   <p>At every strike it has been shown that the judges are partisans of the opponents of the working class, that they misuse their power to obstruct the workers' struggle.</p>
   <p>These judges issued many injunctions in times of strikes, and forced the workers back to work under the same conditions for which they went on strike.</p>
   <p>For that reason it is most important to get on the bench judges who will judge rightly, according to facts but not out of sympathy or personal obligations. Only socialists who will favor justice can be judges of this kind.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0068.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From day to day the Socialist influence grows and we hope that Socialist candidates will win in many places.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the Republican and Democratic parties agreed this time to prevent a Socialist victory. Both parties decided to work together for incumbent judges without nominating new candidates.</p>
   <p>The judges are divided equally more or less between both parties at present, so neither party will feel a loss.</p>
   <p>Such an agreement was made between Republicans and Democrats in other places also.</p>
   <p>Neither the Democratic nor Republican judges will work against capitalistic interests, but if the judicial benches are occupied by Socialists, these same interests will not be granted unjust protection as is being done today. Also the workers will not suffer as they suffer today. That is known to Republicans and Democrats, for that reason they compromise <pb facs="5420779_2_0069.jpg" n="3"/>to make the election of Socialists, enemies of capital, impossible.</p>
   <p>As adherents of both capitalistic parties fight to make keep their partisans on judicial benches, so have workers to strive to elect Socialists.</p>
