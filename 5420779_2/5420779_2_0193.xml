  <body>
   <p>I want to say a few words to proletarian mothers, who, together with their husbands, bear the burden of injustice, some times more than men. Very often I heard the question: "What is the duty of a woman?"</p>
   <p>There are workers who think woman's place is just in the home. Many consider the woman as just a machine to produce children. Others would keep the woman, like the Turks did, under a veil.</p>
   <p>Our duty is, together with our husbands, to help in the great and noble struggle for the liberation of men of the working class and their families.</p>
   <p>We heard about the fight of the so called suffragettes, but this fight did not bring to proletarian women complete freedom.</p>
   <p>The workers' wives have no idea about women's political rights. They must wash dishes all day long in hotels, where high ladies conduct orgies and talk about "freedom for women." They are free, but we are not free, who <pb facs="5420779_2_0194.jpg" n="2"/>must work ten or more hours in damp basements. Working women perform heavy tasks. They, as mothers, must give to their children education. But to be competent for that they must be prepared for such a calling, Where will they find the necessary education? Through the workers' press and books.</p>
   <p>The proletarian movement is the only bearer of the idea against robbing men and women.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all women and mothers to join in the workingmen's movement and fight with their husbands for their rights and liberty.</p>
