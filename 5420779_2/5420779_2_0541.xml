   <p>The Central Educational Committee of our Chicago lodges agreed, at one of their recent meetings, to establish a school where our children could learn the Croatian language. This school is now open, and thus far twenty children have enrolled. The first semester began Wednesday, March 11. Classes are held every Wednesday from 4 to 6 P. M. in the Croatian Sokol hall, 1907 South Racine Avenue.</p>
   <p>Brother V. Slamar has donated the space for the schoolroom. Since George Kutuzovic, the instructor, is donating his services, the parents' sole expense consists in the cost of books for their children.</p>
   <p>We urge the parents who want their children to learn how to speak, read, and write Croatian to send them to this school. For further information, write to the secretary of the Central Educational Committee: Mr. D. Kruzic, 6233 South Honore Street, Chicago.</p>
