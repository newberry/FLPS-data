   <p>There is nothing nicer to see in a workingman's home than a book or newspaper. Especially is it useful if in a worker's home there is a library of good books, which a worker, after a day's hard work may choose to read. A book which will teach him how to lead the struggle against this unjust order of things, or entertain him in a useful way.</p>
   <p>A workingman's newspaper is the tool which makes the way clear for class consciousness for a final liberation of the masses, a book or library written for the worker's cause which will keep the mind class conscious.</p>
   <p>For that reason a Jugoslav worker's book store was established to help the workingmen and their families. This book store was established to furnish workingmen's families with books to strengthen our movement morally; which is of great importance.</p>
   <p>The workers will gather from books, knowledge so necessary in our struggle against capitalism and for our liberation.</p>
