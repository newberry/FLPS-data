   <p>Last week much was said on the West side of our city about things that happened in the Croatian Catholic church and school basement.</p>
   <p>Some newspapers described the sorry act (sodomy) and as lightning news spread to Croatian homes.</p>
   <p>I will not describe what happened, it is an ugly thing, but I ask: What would our Catholic priests say, headed by the editor of their paper NAsa Nada if something like that happened to one of our children attending public schools or if it happened in our orphanage?</p>
   <p>They would undoubtedly, as is their habit, accuse the non-Catholic upbringing of the children, and would jump on all our progressive people and institutions. The editor of Nasa Nada would in one draught drink a whole gallon of wine, happily sit down to write a beautiful "stuff" against educators and heathens. They would be blamed for everything, as this could only happen -- according to priests -- as a result of the upbringing by educators. (Jugoslav Educational Association in control of Croatian orphanages).</p>
   <p>I am sure that the educators will not blame Catholic teachings for this moronic act, they are not so mean or ignorant.</p>
   <p>The editor of Nasa Nada may say the word.</p>
   <p>J. C.</p>
