   <p>Comrades! All topics have been discussed, but the question about the rights of women and children is omitted.</p>
   <p>The question of the organization of our women and children must come up at our next convention, because it is one of the most important problems.</p>
   <p>When we see the way the bourgeois organizations work among their women and youth, we must conduct an agitation of a proletarian nature and win proletarian women and children to leave bourgeois institutions and join ours, and together fight those who want to keep us in darkness for their own interests.</p>
   <p>Until now very little attention has been paid to such agitation outside and more or less inside of our homes. Many married comrades who have belonged to our organization for years, have never attempted to make <pb facs="5420779_2_0188.jpg" n="2"/>the wives acquainted with the ideas which are theirs, and to induce them to join our ranks. This is a great mistake of our married comrades. It is their duty to bring their wives closer to our party.</p>
   <p>We must have more literature in our own language about the women question. It is true that it is hard to agitate among women who recently came from European villages imbued with religion, and who have never had a chance to mingle with the advanced masses of America. But that does not mean that with some effort we will not be able to bring these women to our side.</p>
   <p>With the introduction of machinery, and the greed for large profits, many male workers are thrown out of work. In their places are put women. It may be their wives, sisters or even daughters, who make the same product for lower wages. Thus we women become the competitors of our men in all lines of work. Our family life is getting worse each day.</p>
   <p>The question arises, will we working women obey the bourgeois class?</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0189.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Or will we join our men workers to learn how to extricate ourselves from this exploiting society and organize a society where all will be equal? To reach our goal we must work among working women and have them join us.</p>
   <p>If we get women interested in our movement, we will not meet difficulties with our youth, because youth is under the influence of mothers.</p>
   <p>For work among our youth we need suitable literature. Forward, with the organization of women's and youth's clubs.</p>
  </body>
