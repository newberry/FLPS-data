  <body>
   <p>The Croatian Fraternal Union is a national benevolent organization established by our Croatian immigrants. Paragraph four of its by-laws states explicitly that:</p>
   <p>"The Croatian Fraternal Union of America is exclusively a benevolent and fraternal organization, and as such, is based on democratic principles. There is no room in its ranks for party lines, or political and religious discussions. Its business is managed according to its by-laws, based on the State charter."</p>
   <p>Its purposes are as follows: (a) To mutually support its members in sickness and disability, and to pay to the heirs of the deceased members any insurance due, according to the by-laws adopted from time to time, at their conventions. (b) Through its ledger, to unite Croats and other Slavs, and their offsprings who are mentally and physically sound, and of legal age, according to our by-laws. (c) To uplift its members nationally, <pb facs="5420779_2_0614.jpg" n="2"/>spiritually, mentally and morally, urging them to become citizens of the United States, or of any country where Croatian Fraternal Union operates. (d) To care for and support children's homes, where orphans, whose parents were members of C.F.U., may find protection. (e) To spread among Croats and other Slavs in the United States and Canada the motto: "One for all, and all for one."</p>
   <p>We are in full accord with this noble purpose, and stand firm in defending Croatian Fraternal Union and its ideals, which must remain on this foundation upon which our pioneers placed it and have kept it since its inception. To be able to keep this noble organization on its foundation, it is necessary that the organization be kept in the hands of men who are capable and sincere, men who have national feeling, without which, one cannot successfully carry out the purpose of the Croatian Fraternal Union.</p>
