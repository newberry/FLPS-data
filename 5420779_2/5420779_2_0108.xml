<title level="a">MAYOR THOMPSON'S ACTIVITY</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Many times in our paper we criticized Mayor Thompson for failures in his administration of our city. No matter how much blame he deserves otherwise, in the question of this American war, he did not lose his reason and did not become excited about the war.</p>
   <p>If he were not rich and fully independent or if he were a socialist, they would call him a German hireling for sure, but because he is a capitalist, the bourgeois press is just shocked on account of his lack of patriotism.</p>
   <p>But of what does his lack of patriotism consist? That he sent a message to the people, telling them that there exists a hunger menace for America and any available fertile soil must be used.</p>
   <p>He is also against army conscription and says: "I am against conscription which will send our youth to European trenches. We will have hunger if Congress does not prohibit the export of grains. With hunger will come sickness."</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0109.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The mayor recalled his speech about war in 1915, when he demanded the prohibition of exports of provisions to any of the countries at war. Would America have done so, we would not be at war now.</p>
   <p>The Chicago militarists want to receive the French general, Joffre, in a great celebration. Thompson is cold in that matter. The press is against him, the patriotic organizations want him to resign; they say such a man is not fit to lead the administration.</p>
   <p>Mayor Thompson is not a socialist, but on the question of militarism he is with the Socialists, even if at present American Socialists are agents of German autocracy, according to the Chicago Daily News, then Mayor Thompson must be such an agent also.</p>
   <p>This is not much satisfaction for the Socialists but it shows the bourgeois press in its true light.</p>
