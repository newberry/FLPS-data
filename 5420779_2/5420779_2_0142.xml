   <p>Sunday, August 9th, the Jugoslav Socialist Branch No. 6 called a meeting against the European slaughter.</p>
   <p>The National Hall was crowded with listeners. The main speaker was Teodor Cvetkov, who during a prolonged talk brought out the cause of European entanglements.</p>
   <p>The causes are the capitalistic greed which needs commercial expansion and therefore wants to absorb foreign lands.</p>
   <p>The servants of capitalism are the different states with their military power. For the sake of a few, millions must suffer. Millions who do not want war, who want bread.</p>
   <p>The speaker pointed out historical facts which prove that this slaughter was bound, sooner or later, to come. The powers nurtured hate just waiting for the opportune moment for revenge. With vigor he assailed those patriotic <pb facs="5420779_2_0143.jpg" n="2"/>laudatory attempts to glorify different states or rulers. Because rulers are not for the people's good, they are for wars.</p>
   <p>After the talk of Mr. Cvetkov other speakers followed. The main thought of all was that all wars are of no advantage and murderous, and are unnecessary for the working people.</p>
   <p>The listeners protested against war by exclamations of "Down with War! Down with tyrants! Long live international brotherhood!"</p>
