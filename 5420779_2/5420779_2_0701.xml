   <p>The Croatian Women's Club, "Hrvatska Zena," Branch 1, was organized January 27, 1929. At the
    first meeting seven patriotic Croatian ladies came together to organize the first branch of
    "Hrvatska Zena" in the United States, following the call of the central office of the
    organization in their homeland, Croatia, at the city of Zagreb.</p>
   <p>To the committee were elected: Klara Skvorc, presldent; Agate Gjurak, vice-president; Rose
    Cesar, secretary, and Borislava Absac, treasurer.</p>
   <p>After its organization, by-laws for the club were drawn up and work started. The foundation of
    this work is to create sociability among Croatian women. To be interested in national and
    feminine activities, in humanitarian fields, in health preservation, enlightenment of the
    Croatian people, betterment of their economic life, and earning capabilities. Finally, to induce
    members of the club to become citizens of the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0703.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The club has to attend funerals of its members and decorate their graves on certain
    occasions.</p>
   <p>The first and most important duty of a Croatian woman must be to encourage patriotic feelings
    and charity toward the poor, not only in this country but also in the native homeland, which
    looks forward to our help with great expectations.</p>
   <p>At their second monthly meeting these patriotic Croatian women and mothers decided that, as a
    women's club, their first step must be to make a pilgrimage to the Children's Home of the
    Croatian Fraternal Union at Desplaines, Illinois, where they left presents of toys, books and
    candies for the children.</p>
   <p>The club "Hrvatska Zena" helped the central office at Zagreb to improve the graves of the
    Croatian martyrs who fell in the demonstrations <pb facs="5420779_2_0704.jpg" n="4"/>at Zagreb,
    twenty-seven in number, on December 5, 1918 and June 20, 1928. They were just common people, but
    by their death, as a sacrifice for their nation, they became great.</p>
   <p>Their everlasting memory was secured by erecting a single monument for all at the cemetery
    Mirogoj at Zagreb, Croatia. This monument was built with the modest help of the club "Hrvatska
    Zena" of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The club "Hrvatska Zena," Branch 1, gives help in money and supplies to poor families, makes
    donations to the Croatian church and school, to the Children's Home; makes visits to the sick
    and distressed and brings help whenever possible. During this unforgettable crisis many families
    received clothing, shoes and groceries from the club "Hrvatsa Zena."</p>
   <p>At Christmas and Easter the poor in Croatia are not forgotten. They receive at least a small
    amount of money. The club "Hrvatska Zena"</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0705.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>brought through its members theatrical performances of patriotic value to the stage, thus
    showing the patriotic feeling of its members for the Croatian homeland.</p>
   <p>The club "Hrvatska Zena" encourages its members to prefer their national Croatian
    embroideries, their colors and styles and work on them. Because of this at the International
    Exhibition of Embroideries held at the Hotel La Salle in Chicago, the exhibited articles of the
    club's members received first prizes.</p>
   <p>The club arranges picnics and excursions in summer; teas and musicales in winter. At the
    meetings refreshments are served. In conversation many forgotten Croatian words are brought to
    mind, and love and longing for the old native Croatian country is restored.</p>
   <p>The good example of the "Hrvatska Zena" branch one. of Chicago, was <pb
     facs="5420779_2_0706.jpg" n="6"/>followed by many Croatian settlements throughout the United
    States, where additional branches were established. Each branch is working independently
    according to the by-laws, but the leader for all is the pride of Croatia, the central office of
    the "Hrvatska Zena" at the Croatian capital, Zagreb, the center of Croatian culture.</p>
   <p>The work of the central office reflects the true character of the Croatian women.</p>
   <p>In connection with its fifth anniversary the Croatian women's club "Hrvatska Zena" Branch 1 of
    Chicago, called the first convention of all Croatian women's clubs' branches in America for the
    first of May, 1934. At that convention means will be found and ways adopted to (discover) what
    to do to secure a better future of all the branches of the Croatian women's clubs "Hrvatska
    Zena" throughout the United States.</p>
