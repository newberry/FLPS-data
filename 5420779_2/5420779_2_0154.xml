   <p>Here the ruling class talks much about great care given to children and their education. How little that is true. The fact is that we have no laws to prevent exploitation of children. Exploitation of children occurs here more often than in any other country.</p>
   <p>True, we have inspection of factories where children work, but they are sent home on days when the inspector will appear in the factory. The inspectors report that no children are working. The factory owners know when the inspector will show up. Very few of the states have laws covering child labor completely. In most of the states children 10 and 12 years of age are allowed to work in factories. The supreme court declares laws against child labor unconstitutional.</p>
   <p>The sequence of all that is that children are exploited not only <pb facs="5420779_2_0155.jpg" n="2"/>in factories but on farms and plantations. Special attention is paid to exploitation of children in agriculture by the Committee on Child Labor. The State of Kentucky, where there are very few foreigners, has very many illiterates because the children instead of going to school go to work on tobacco plantations. Children under 9 years work on tobacco plantations just as grown-ups, with even longer hours. The same happens on the farms. The committee says that child labor cannot be suppressed with laws, except by strict school laws.</p>
   <p>Besides small children, who are working on farms with their parents, there are children under 16 years of age who work as hired laborers. Unemployment did not decrease child labor; to the contrary, it increased it. Employers lay off workers and employ cheaper help: children. It is impossible to estimate how many children were obliged to go to work because the father was laid off.</p>
   <p>Children obtain work easier because their labor is cheaper. If there are many children employed in one industry, it means low wages for <pb facs="5420779_2_0156.jpg" n="3"/>the grown-ups. Children lower the wages of their parents. The lowered wages force parents to send children to work.</p>
   <p>In that way millions of children become factory workers, where their health is endangered for the benefit of the employer.</p>
   <p>At the same time millions of able workers walk the streets seeking work but in vain.</p>
