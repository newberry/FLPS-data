   <p>Desplaines, Ill. In the fall of 1929 Mr. H. C. Mcneal became the principal of our school. Since there were no athletic activities at our school at that time and the children lacked exercises, he decided to introduce the sport of basketball. He found it a very difficult job because the boys showed no interest in the sport.</p>
   <p>Some of the boys were even forced to play in order to get the sport started. After having a few games with other schools the boys became interested and were willing to play their best.</p>
   <p>By practicing every day after school was dismissed, the team developed into a stronger team.</p>
   <p>That same year they entered the Cook County tournament and took first place. They defeated teams that had played for years, while our team had played only for several months.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0660.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The next year we had a stronger team. With the cooperation of all the players in the years that followed, we won five Cook County tournaments in succession.</p>
   <p>In all the eight years of basketball we participated in thirteen tournaments and had succeeded in winning eleven first and two third places along with several sportsmanship trophies.</p>
   <p>This year our team entered one tournament and failed to win the first place trophy, but received third place.</p>
