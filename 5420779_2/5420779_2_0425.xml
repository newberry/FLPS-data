   <p>Comrades as you know and was informed through party channels, our Central Executive Committee decided that our official Labor Party organ, The Worker, should come out daily with the first issue on the 6th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.</p>
   <p>But to assure the existence of the Daily Worker, it is necessary to raise a sum of $100,000. To every Federation which is a component part of the Workers' Party a sum is prorated, according to the ability of members in the federation. Our federation was prorated to raise a sum of $5,000 towards the fund of the American Labor Party organ, the Daily Worker.</p>
   <p>Why do we need an English daily? Comrades, we must know that we live in the land where English is the official language and where the workers' movement is compelled to carry its revolutionary propaganda primarily in English language. So far English-speaking newspapers have not <pb facs="5420779_2_0426.jpg" n="2"/>sufficiently met the demands of the American working masses. Look around and you will see the Labor Party attacked from all sides; attacks are made against American Communists from all sides. A united front of reactionaries is evident on all fronts, beginning with the department of justice, the 'yellow' Socialists, all are against our movement. Facing this, what must we do? Our answer must be a daily in English. Almost daily the bourgeois press brings out cartoons reminding of West Virginia or Herrin, Ill., and in spite of hysteric reactionary campaigns, the masses, faced by exploitation and misery, ask: Who are these communists?</p>
   <p>This situation we must exploit not only to repel reactionary ideas, but to acquaint the working masses with our teachings, programs and tactics, and our participation in the struggle for shorter working time and better living conditions, with the ultimate establishment of a proletarian state.</p>
