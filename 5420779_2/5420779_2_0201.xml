   <p>Not long ago it was considered that only fools will defend rights of women. In the oldest times rarely anybody was able to think that a woman was a human being equal to her husband, or that she ought to have the same rights and duties in society.</p>
   <p>We find only in the works of the old philosopher Plato, women's rights clearly and openly proclaimed. In his ideal republic man and woman are made equal in everything.</p>
   <p>Christianity had to come to stifle Plato's great ideal of women. "The woman belongs to her man," is the principle of Christianity from its inception; so it is to this day. The Catholic clergy humiliated the female sex, proving with words and deeds that a woman is just a medium for the exploitation of body and soul.</p>
   <p>From the capitalistic viewpoint the position of women is not much <pb facs="5420779_2_0202.jpg" n="2"/>better. The hard work of women, misery, different laws which deprive her of rights, above all prostitution; all these things show that woman remains that lower being deprived of rights under capitalism, as she was in the barbarian times.</p>
   <p>While reactionaries and representatives of darkness preach that woman must be only wife, mother and slave, Social Democracy says: "Woman is a human being after all, and after that she is a wife and mother."</p>
   <p>Maternity is just a function of a being; matrimony just a happening in her life.</p>
   <p>To woman have to be opened the doors of life to give her all the rights and opportunity to fulfill her duties as citizens and full-fledged members of society. She is entitled to opportunities through which she may develop mentality, strong will and noble sentiments, just the same as is necessary for her brother.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0203.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Is a slave woman able to raise free and perfect citizens?</p>
   <p>Socialism is fighting for free men, for free womanhood, for free human society!</p>
