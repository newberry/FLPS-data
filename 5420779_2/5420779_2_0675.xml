   <p>The door of the children's home was solemnly opened Sunday, September 11, 1927. That day will remain marked in the history of the Croatian Brotherhood Union.</p>
   <p>From a humanitarian view that day ended a noble wish of many past conventions; rather, the wishes of the whole membership of the Croatian Brotherhood Union.</p>
   <p>The committee for dedication arranged a picnic for that day in Desplaines, Illinois, on the home grounds.</p>
   <p>There were many noted speakers representing the Croatian Brotherhood Union, the chief supporter of the orphanage.</p>
   <p>About one thousand persons were present, indeed too small a group considering the noble undertaking and in view of the fact that there are 20,000 members of the Croatian Brotherhood Union here in Chicago, not counting non-members of the union, but otherwise friends and supporters of the orphanage.</p>
   <p>Remarks were heard that the local management is to blame for not announcing the event in all the newspapers, so that all, or most members and sympathizers would know and turn out in numbers to satisfy interests of the home.</p>

   <p>The opening of the wooden door is not so important in itself, September 11, 1927 either. Most important must be the fact that this day we brothers and sisters opened our hearts wider in shaping the destiny and the future of those children. You mothers, whether members or not, noticed in raising your own children the cruelties and injustice of the present system. You should not be unconcerned in this work. You that know motherly love, place yourselves at the head of this noble work and see that it is successful.</p>
   <p>Shelter and food is not all that children need in raising them. You may, with your work and interest, at least in some measure, supply to the orphans what they lost: father and mother.</p>
   <p>It is not true that everything failed and is corrupted and that one can not succeed in that field. This field is wide and rich;all we need is work and more workers.</p>
