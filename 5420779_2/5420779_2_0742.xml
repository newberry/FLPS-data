   <p>A very unusual incident came before Chicago courts recently. John Los made a contract with Steve Labinovic to sell his own wife for the sum of $100.</p>
   <p>Both signed the contract and Labinovic paid down $25 in good faith. Mrs. Los, 23-year-old wife of John Los, told the judge that five years ago he returned from America and married her in the old country. When they came back to America he treated her as a slave. They have two children: a girl, four and a boy three years old.</p>
   <p>"John always tried to get rid of me," she told the judge. "When we were at Steve's house they made a bargain. For the sum of one hundred dollars I was to belong to Labinovic. This is the price of a good cow at home in Poland."</p>
   <p>The judge fined the men $100 apiece, and they will have to work it out in jail as they have no money for the fine.</p>
