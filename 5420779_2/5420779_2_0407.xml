  <body>
   <p>The greatest day in the history of the Jugoslav proletarians is coming. What nobody expected so soon is near realization.</p>
   <p>Radnik, the newspaper of the Jugoslav proletarians, a fighter in the struggle of the working class for victory, will appear daily in spite of innumerable enemies who prophesied its downfall.</p>
   <p>Through America, like pests, are traveling about forty Jugoslav reactionary newspapers, twelve of them dailies. All these papers are in the service of the darkest reaction, their proprietors, with little exception, are spies who, through their papers, spy on and denounce the Jugoslav workers in America. Only the workers did not have their own daily in spite of the fact that 90% of our immigrants belong to the working class. This fact proves the necessity for Radnik to become a daily paper.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0408.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The working class will do it. It will create a daily organ in spite of the opposition of the enemies of the working class.</p>
   <p>Nobody will remain idle; all will work for this proletarian bulwark, a proletarian daily paper, Radnik.</p>
   <p>Let us start to work. Let us show to the enemies of the Jugoslav workers in America that in two months on the next first of May, we will build a material foundation for a proletarian daily and double the number of its subscribers.</p>
   <p>Let us work indefatigably that on May first we may be greeted in red, flaming letters by our daily Radnik, enlarged, strengthened, as a courageous fighter of a class-conscious Jugoslav people in America.</p>
