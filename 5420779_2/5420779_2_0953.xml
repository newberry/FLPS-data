   <p>Dr. Starcevich was born in South Chicago of Croatian parents. His father was the leader of the Croatian settlement. First in all cultural and fraternal movements, he was one of the most popular businessmen in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>His son, Dr. Starcevich, graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in medicine and surgery, with which he serves his people admirably. He was elected chief medical director of the Croatian orphanage of Desplaines. He started the first Croatian radio hour, broadcasting from Hammond, Ind.</p>
   <p>In 1932 he was administrating relief for the Catholic charities to the Croatian parish of the Sacred Heart. He was in that capacity for three years, 1932, 1933 and part of 1934.</p>
