   <p>The management of Radnik received for publication a resolution issued by the Central Cultural Committee of the United Croatian Societies and other organizations of Chicago, protesting against those who are plotting against the consolidation of all Croatian unions in America. The resolution is addressed to all locals of the Croatian Union of Illinois. It reads:</p>
   <p>Honorable Brethren: Three years have passed since all the more advanced men and women, who are members of different Croatian unions, have been working for the consolidation of these unions into one great fraternal union, which will cover all Croatian benevolent societies.</p>
   <p>This work has resulted in the decision of the great majority of members of the National Croatian Union and of the Croatian Union of Illinois, to vote for the consolidation of both.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0646.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After the Croatian Union of Illinois voted with two-thirds of its votes for consolidation, which was, at the convention of the National Croatian Union, unanimously accepted, the consolidation in one great Croatian fraternal union seemed assured.</p>
   <p>But some of the enemies of the Croatian nation started court injunction proceedings against the accomplished consolidation. They based their claim on the assumption that the voting was illegal.</p>
   <p>After the convention at Cleveland of the Croatian Union of Illinois, the court released this injunction, and now there are no obstacles in the way of the consolidation of these unions. And yet, the supreme board of the Croatian Union of Illinois is hesitating, giving our enemies an opportunity to act against the consolidation of our unions.</p>
   <p>Taking all into consideration, the Central Cultural Committee of all Croatian societies in Chicago, at its regular meeting on August 21, 1924, <pb facs="5420779_2_0647.jpg" n="3"/>adopted a resolution requesting all locals of the Croatian Union of Illinois to insist with pressure on their supreme board to sign the contract for the consolidation of the Croatian Unions.</p>
   <p>For the Central Cultural Committee of Croatian Societies in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Ivan Vrbanac, President</p>
   <p>Dragutin Kruzic, Secretary.</p>
