</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A significant characteristic of capitalism is the fact that it uses for industrial production not only grown-up men and women but also minor children.</p>
   <p>Until ten years ago there was in America no child labor of any extent, but now millions of children under fourteen years work in factories, offices, on cotton plantations, etc.</p>
   <p>Child labor became a great evil to which even bourgeoisie parties pay attention. That explains the fact why many states introduced child-labor laws. In the first place we have to mention Pennsylvania, which adopted a law forbidding children less than fourteen years old to work in any industry.</p>
   <p>The State of Indiana also introduced such a law. In many other state legislatures laws were taken up with the purpose to limit child labor.</p>
   <p>But of what use are such laws if they are not obyed? The capitalists <pb facs="5420779_2_0171.jpg" n="2"/>favor child labor because it is cheap, therefore they always find a way to circumvent such laws and keep on employing thousands of children in their factories.</p>
   <p>The parents also know that work is dangerous for the health of their posterity, but hunger does not choose means and misery by itself drives parents to push their own children in the abyss of capitalistic exploitation.</p>
   <p>State authorities and police also know of breaking of these laws, but they do not interfere in any way or try to stop it.</p>
   <p>Usually, rich men are friends of all important state officials and for that reason they are not dealt with.</p>
   <p>Is there a bigger crime than to throw small undeveloped children in dark and dusty workshops to suck their blood and deprive them of health and life?</p>
   <p>If any other fact is not able to open our eyes, child labor is such a <pb facs="5420779_2_0172.jpg" n="3"/>crime, such immoral activity which must be noticed by any worker, and to influence his attitude toward the state the system of production, toward the whole form of society which is based on the bones of small children and exploitation of the working class.</p>
