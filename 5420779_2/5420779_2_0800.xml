   <p>The Croatian congress sends greetings and a message to Dr. Macek.</p>
   <p>The American press about the Croatian congress at Chicago, on November 30, 1935:</p>
   <p>Herald &amp; Examiner issue from Nov. 30, 1935.</p>
   <p>CROATS SEEKING FREEDOM</p>
   <p>Freedom for Croatia will be demanded through a manifesto from the heads of the world powers, it was announced by Capt. Antem. Dosen as some 200 delegates prepared for an extraordinary session here today. Croatians from Europe, South America and Canada will help draft the manifesto, the captain said.</p>
   <p>Chicago Tribune issue from Dec. 1, 1935.</p>
   <p>CROAT PATRIOTS SEEK FREEDOM FOR HOMELAND</p>
   <p>Five hundred members of the National Croatian Congress of Croatian Patriots, <pb facs="5420779_2_0801.jpg" n="2"/>in session at the Amalgamated Center, 333 S. Ashland Avenue, yesterday and today, approved a manifesto to the League of Nations asking that steps be taken to assist the Croatians in securing independence from the Jugoslavian kingdom.</p>
   <p>According to Capt. Ante Doshen (sic), secretary of the organization, the delegates attending are from all parts of the United States, Canada, Europe and South America.</p>
   <p>The manifesto asserted that "The state of Croatia has been guaranteed by President Woodrow Wilson in the peace treaty of 1918, the right to determine its own destiny, but that by false representations of the Serbian Regent Alexander it was incorporated into the so-called 'state of Jugoslavia.'"</p>
   <p>The Congress attributed the assassination of King Alexander Karagjorgjevic of Jugoslavia, in Marseilles, France, in October 1934, to the bitter resentment created by the unjust oppression of the Croats. The manifesto termed the king's slayer "a Macedonian patriot" but made no reference to the three Croats on trial in France for the killing.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Daily News issue from Dec. 3, 1935.</p>
   <p>MANIFESTO ASKS INDEPENDENCE FOR CROATIANS</p>
   <p>A manifesto demanding the independence of Croatia, addressed to the League of Nations and to the governments of countries throughout the world, was released today by officers of the Crotian National Representation for Independence of Croatia.</p>
   <p>The organization, represented by delegates from many sections of North America and South America, met on Saturday at Amalgamated Hall, Van Buren Street and Jackson Boulevard.</p>
   <p>Among the approved resolutions was a request to the French government to grant an impartial trial to those accused of complicity in the assassination of King Alexander of Jugoslavia in Marseilles.</p>
   <p>At the meeting Dr. J. F. Skafec of Akron, Ohio, was elected president. Ante <pb facs="5420779_2_0803.jpg" n="4"/>M. Dosen of Pittsburg, Pa., secretary, and Karlo Krmpotic, treasurer.</p>
   <p>U. S. Congressman, Hon. Sabath, greets the Croatian Congress. Besides the American press and many important personalities attending the Second Croatian National Congress was U. S. Congressman, Hon. Sabath, member of the Foreign Relations Committee of the House of Representatives. Congressman Sabath spoke on the Croatian question. He said that in 1917 and 1918 he implored President Wilson to grant to each nation and also to the Croatians their full independence. He hopes that our wishes will be realized. The injustice done to the Croatians must be righted and he will see to it. He was delighted to see such a big assembly of Croatians, a fact that shows that they are united. Congressman Sabath was applauded by the enthusiastic assembly.</p>
