   <p>The so-called "Friends of Peace" had a rally a few days ago where, after a long debate, they adopted a characteristic resolution for conservation of peace.</p>
   <p>A copy of this resolution was sent to President Wilson, whose attention was called to the spirit of some articles of the Constitution, where it is forbidden to the President to declare war without the consent of Congress.</p>
   <p>This resolution was the answer to the President on his declaration to Germany to take "strong" measures if American lives are manaced again.</p>
   <p>While all real American lovers of this country work with all their might for peace, our ultra-patriotic Jugoslavs, and our "Americans," send from a public meeting at Chicago greetings to President Wilson, thanking him for his "wise" administration and promising to fight shoulder to shoulder with <pb facs="5420779_2_0128.jpg" n="2"/>American soldiers, if this country ever enters into a war with Germany.</p>
   <p>This is what the Croatian Don Quixote, Ante Biankini, promises, who puts his fingers everywhere and without consent and approval of the people gives such absurd promises.</p>
   <p>Is it that our Croatians want to be greater Americans than Americans themselves? Really, will the fool Biankini be able to send a big army of Serbians and Croatians to the border of Mexico, or against Germany, in case President Wilson declares war?</p>
   <p>It is too bad that the Americans do not understand Croatian, to be able to read this foolishness and to laugh at Biankini's "heroes," ready to fight for Jugoslavia at the same time declaring the deepest feeling as a citizen for a capitalistic President like Wilson.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0129.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Do these people have no shame or are they such fools that no doctor in the world can cure them?</p>
