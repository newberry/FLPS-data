<title level="a">THE JUGOSLAV CHANCERY - A SPY'S CHANCERY</title>
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>For a few days there has existed the danger that war will be declared between America and Germany.</p>
   <p>As soon as the possibility of war appeared, up jumped enemies of the people to talk about liberty, rights, the honor of the flag, to make out of the American people that which the European felons made out of their people there.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslavs and their press request that everybody greet this coming war from the bottom of his heart. Who is weak hearted in accepting this war must be registered and reported to the Jugoslav chancery, or better, to the "spy chancery" and its manager, M. Marjanovich.</p>
   <p>These gentlemen should at least show an example to the people once, and <pb facs="5420779_2_0114.jpg" n="2"/>enlist as soldiers. Then they may scold other for not being loyal. But as long as they flee from Europe to avoid war and preach to working men to shoulder arms, they are just agents of misfortune.</p>
   <p>As long as they flee from war and on the other hand are willing to denounce their fellow men, they are nothing else but loathsome spies of the lowest order.</p>
