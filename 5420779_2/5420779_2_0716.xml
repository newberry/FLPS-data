   <p>The second convention to aid the Gastonia strike is called to meet Augst 31, 1929, at National Hall, 1800 S. Racine Avenue, at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>Brothers and sisters:</p>
   <p>Representatives of organizations and societies gathered at the first conference arranged by the temporary committee for the Gastonia strike aid, are coming before you with brotherly pleas to remind you of your duty toward fellow workers in the textile industry and to examine the situation of the strikers in Gastonia, and the danger confronting them from the bosses' side. Only we workers and friends of labor can save our brother workers from savage assault and brutality, and also make the strikers' struggle a successful one. The Gastonia strikers are facing their fate - this is the burning question of all the working class and their friends. They are facing heavy material losses, but they are determined to stick and to <pb facs="5420779_2_0717.jpg" n="2"/>depend upon our ever ready and unlimited help. Fifteen courageous workers will be burned to death in the electric chair, and many have been convicted and sentenced to long prison terms; only our solidarity and cooperative work can save them. They need our help at once. Can we allow our fellow workers in this fatal moment to suffer. Our answer must be no! It was with this thought that our first conference decided to call all Jugoslav workers to help their striking brothers in Gastonia. Elect your representatives and send them to this convention. Elect at least two from each lodge or club.</p>
   <p>For the Strikers Aid Committee.</p>
   <p>Ely Majetorovic, Secretary.</p>
