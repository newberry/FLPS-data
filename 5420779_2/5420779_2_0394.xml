   <p>The subscription quota for the last month, as announced in our Friday number, was not filled. Only a few more subscriptions were required, at least it looked that way Friday morning, when the paper went to press; however, before the end of the day subscriptions poured in and not only filled the quota, but far exceeded it.</p>
   <p>We received 705 new subscriptions.</p>
   <p>Comrades, think hard! Before we opened the campaign we received from 320 to 350 subscriptions monthly. During the first month of this campaign we raised it to 500 subscriptions and the second month it jumped from 500 to 705. This is a big gain. It shows the will power and creative dreams of our revolutionary movement. Can we during the last month of our campaign from June 15 to July the 15th reach the 800 mark?</p>
   <p>This really would be an achievement. One or two groups or sections are not enough to do all the work, every organization must work in unity.</p>
   <p>Now all together to the goal!</p>
