   <p>Last week the counting of votes given to candidates for state's attorney at last year's November election was finished. The result was:</p>
   <p>Hoyne, Democrat, lost 5,419 votes; Cunnea, Socialist, gained 3,909 votes. The recounting showed for Hoyne, 117,044 votes; for Cunnea, 111,441 votes. In November the official count showed, for Hoyne, 122,463; for Cunnea, 107,532.</p>
   <p>In proportion the change in favor of the Socialist candidate after the recounting was 10,000 votes. Even if the recounting did not show a majority for the Socialist candidate, the frauds perpetrated and discovered were of such volume that the election should be declared illegal according to reason and justice.</p>
   <p>At the official counting in November thousands of votes were changed in favor of Hoyne. In precincts where Cunnea received an absolute majority for some inexplicable reason voting tickets were lost. In Democratic precincts there were more tickets in the boxes than there were voters in the precinct.</p>
