   <p>To avoid to be accused that we assail unjustly the governing class or prominent patriots,we have to mention that these days in Congress debates are conducted on how to prohibit speculators selling provisions to the poor for prohibitive prices.</p>
   <p>Many representatives in Congress assailed speculators, especially those who stand up when the music starts the Star Spangled Banner or who adorn their automobiles with little flags, but raise the prices of all provisions in their stores.</p>
   <p>From these debates it can be seen that all kinds of speculators popped up to the surface and everyone is bent on grabbing as much as he can with no regard whatever whether the people have something to eat or not.</p>
   <p>The merchants of American flags found a good harvest selling these flags in the name of patriotism.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0158.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of course everybody must buy a flag. If he does not buy, he is a traitor. He does not love his country. The authorities must be informed about his disloyalty. Under such slogans trade with flags is conducted. The flag is the symbol of American liberty and democracy, say these worthy patriots. Now let us see what is their liberty and democracy, when it comes to showing their patriotism in the wages of their workers.</p>
   <p>On the East Side of New York women and children make these flags. What do they get in wages? An investigation proved that one mother with four small children works on these flags, her children help and often all work day and night.</p>
   <p>They receive three cents for a gross, that is, for 144 pieces. In that way they earn in one week two dollars.</p>
   <p>Another woman works on slightly larger flags, she is helped by two minor daughters. For thirty-six dozens of these flags she receives 73 cents.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0159.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>That is what these little flags, the symbols of liberty, mean to women dying of starvation. For the manufacturers they mean a handsome profit.</p>
   <p>The symbols of liberty should first secure a decent living for the American people and then we can undertake the liberation of other nations.</p>
