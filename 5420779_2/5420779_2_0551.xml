   <p>Important for every Jugoslav in Chicago, Throwing money away foolishly and playing with one's health cost our people plenty of money and much suffering. The quacks emptied many of our working men's pockets, and today are doing the same with their worthless medicines and treatments.</p>
   <p>Not only does the quacking cost our people lots of money but it also causes loss of time and suffering, at times even loss of health and life itself.</p>
   <p>This wrong kind of healing or exploitation by the charlatans costs our lodges and benevolent societies thousands of dollars. Croatian benevolent and educational lodge Bratstvo decided to conduct a few lectures this spring on this question, valuable not only to their own members but to all willing to come and profit by. The lectures will be free to all; no admission charged.</p>
   <p>The first of this lectures will be held Saturday, March 17, 1928 in National Hall, 1802 S. Racine avenue, 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>The speaker will be our well known lecturer Mr.G. Biankini, who gave many successful lectures sponsored by the Jugoslav Educational Association. Mr. Biankini will discuss the subject mentioned above: the Quackery. The Croatian lodge Bratstvo invites everybody. The lecture will be interesting and valuable to all.</p>
