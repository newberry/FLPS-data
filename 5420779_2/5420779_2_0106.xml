   <p>Some of the American capitalists who control the manufacture of ammunition reported to the government that though they are ready to give the government their product under the market price, it cannot be expected from them to deliver material for a price which would harm them.</p>
   <p>At the same time they reported they would not be able to give war material to the Allies for the same price as they will give to the American government.</p>
   <p>As it is seen, the American capitalists think for their own interest and quite seriously they say to the government this we can do, this we cannot do.</p>
   <p>They are willing to help the government but they are not prepared on account of the government, to sacrifice themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0107.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That is very fair. The government will be in accord with that because how could you destroy our ammunition manufacturers?</p>
   <p>To this we want to add, how it would be if the American workingmen reported to the government that they are willing to do everything for this country, but the government must not expect that the workers want to be destroyed in this war or that they will go to the battlefields just for the whim of a government?</p>
   <p>If they relent and say if we must perish defending this country, we will do so, but you cannot expect us to perish for the Allies.</p>
   <p>The government will undertake nothing against the capitalists for their ultimatum, because it thinks it is their business to quote prices, but to the workers it is not granted the right to decide about their own life. It would not be bad for the workers to think these things over.</p>
