   <p>Brethren, Workers! The whole of Europe stands before a terrible crisis. The mobilization of the armies has excited all friends and enemies of mankind.</p>
   <p>Brethren, Workers! The Jugoslav Socialist Federation taking all in account and standing on the principles of international socialism directs to you the following appeal:</p>
   <p>1) No one of you must go to Europe as a soldier to help those in power, and become a victim of capitalism. Meet with contempt any call of Austrian or Serbian oppressors to go to war for them.</p>
   <p>2) Do not give one cent for war purposes. But send money to your brother workers, who will survive this bloody tragedy, and to their widows, old parents and children.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0145.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3) Call public meetings in all towns and settlements. Protest against Austrian diplomacy, against the Habsburg dynasty against the barbarism of a World's war.</p>
   <p>4) Try, in these times of trial, not to fill your heart with hatred toward other nationalities and your brethren, the workingmen in other countries. You must know that the working class over the whole world has only one enemy-that is capitalism. That is the class of the rich everywhere.</p>
   <p>Brethren, Workers! We want to call your attention to the important fact that in Europe beside the hellish power, which leads people to perdition, there is another mighty force which represents the united working class of all the countries; that force is social democracy, which is composed of conscious and enlightened workers of all countries and all nationalities. It does not acknowledge borders, hatred between nationalities and fights all oppression and slavery.</p>
   <p>Comrades and brother workers! It is your duty to protest, to join in your protest and struggle the International Socialists who are clamoring:</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0146.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Down with the tyrants! Down with capitalistic slavery! Down with chauvinistic and bloody wars!</p>
   <p>Long live international peace! Long live the brotherhood of nations!</p>
   <p>First of August 1914, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Central Committee</p>
   <p>Jugoslav Socialist Federation</p>
