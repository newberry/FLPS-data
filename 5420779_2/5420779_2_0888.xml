   <p>Brothers and sisters! Struggle for existence forced us to leave our country of birth and emigrate into far and foreign lands. There was not enough bread in the beautiful country of our birth. Therefore we had to seek it elsewhere. Some of us came to America; others went to Germany, France, Australia, South America, etc.</p>
   <p>We did not look for beautiful landscapes and charming sights to enjoy beauties of nature but we went to find an opportunity to earn bread and other necessities of life. The worker loves the home if he has one. The country is dear to him if he can respectfully live there and enjoy the liberty. Therefore, the country of the workers is wherever he can make his living by work. Once he loses his job he has to look for another job and even another country.</p>
   <p>We don't preach animosity against any country in the world. We speak for solidarity and brotherhood among all nations of the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0889.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We observe that the industrialists of various countries are creating international trusts which is a natural consequence of the economic development of the society of today.</p>
   <p>The world which earlier built high walls and borders, today realizes, in spite of Fascist-Nationalist movement, that division artificially created interfered with healthy development of mankind.</p>
   <p>The same way that bosses are merging for their own benefit, the duty of workers is to be united and work his own security.</p>
   <p>We come from different parts of the old world, some of our old homes are under the regime of Italy, others under the Yugoslavian dictator.</p>
   <p>We don't hate our birth place but we don't want the agents of the regimes to spread hatred and slavery under disguise of "fatherland" or any other disguise.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0890.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Intelligent Jugoslav workers in America and in the old country have been in favor of a united Jugoslavia for a long time now. Not only Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, but Bulgaria, too. In fact, we want a Balkan federation and eventually the federation of the whole world.</p>
   <p>We are for democracy through the government of the people, for the rights of man, for the participation in government of workers of all lands on the broadest basis.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we condemn all tyrannical methods and terrorism. Dictatorship in Jugoslavia is not necessary, it does not help the masses. It takes away citizens' political rights who are oppressed and cannot complain nor organize for their defense.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav diplomats are spreading the propaganda in favor of the regime to gain control of our immigrant's soul and are using Mussolini's <pb facs="5420779_2_0891.jpg" n="4"/>tactics which the American Italians repudiated as well as the American public.</p>
   <p>With this we are informing our Jugoslav people that we have established here in Chicago the Jugoslav Workers' Council, which is composed of representatives of educational, political and fraternal societies, Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian; also intelligent and industrious individual Jugoslavs.</p>
   <p>This council is founded for the purpose of gaining the understanding and the closest possible cooperation of intellectually advanced Jugoslav workers in important questions, especially those of immediate interest to our people here or in the old country.</p>
   <p>Into their work program the council incorporated the following rules:</p>
   <p>Spreading the solidarity of the working people for the rights of man; support educational work among Jugoslav workers; repulse monarchist propaganda, and struggle against any reactionary action that sows discord among our people here.</p>
   <p>The task of the council will be to use all known intelligent and worthy <pb facs="5420779_2_0892.jpg" n="5"/>means to accomplish the purpose.</p>
   <p>Nobody can contradict that solidarity among workers was always necessary and more so today than ever before.</p>
   <p>We protest against the Jugoslav agents who entice our youth to go to Jugoslavia and serve in the army of the bloody regime.</p>
   <p>The representatives of our Jugoslav workers in Chicago at the meeting of March 28, requested that the Jugoslav Workers' Council notify not only the Jugoslav but the American as well through the American press about the action and the destructive work the representatives of the Jugoslav regime are engaged in.</p>
   <p>We are against the method known as Balkanske. We are for the union of the Jugoslav people; therefore our struggle is directed against all who under any disguise try to spoil our unity.</p>
   <p>We are for the Jugoslav federative republic and the democratic federation <pb facs="5420779_2_0893.jpg" n="6"/>of all Balkan states.</p>
   <p>If you are for organized action then participate in the Jugoslav Workers' Council in their noble and strenuous task.</p>
   <p>Accepted by first convention of the Jugoslav Workers' Council in Chicago, March 28, 1931.</p>

   <p>Ivan Jurinic, Secretary</p>
