   <p>For the first time in America the Jugoslav workers dramatic club, "Nada," will present the famous tragedy in Russian life "Ignis Sanat" by Leon Andreyer. The drama will be shown in following places:</p>
   <p>Gary, Indiana, Sunday, Sept. 19, National Croatian Hall, corner 23rd and Washington Streets, 7:30 P.M; Chicago, Illinois, Sunday, Sept. 24, C. S. P. S. Hall, corner 18th and May Streets, 3 P. M.: South Chicago, Illinois, Sunday Oct. 3, National Croatian Hall 9616-22 Commercial Ave. 7:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>Leonid Andrejev is considered the best writer of all Russian contemporary authors with the exception of Maxim Gorky. Although some think that he is deeper than Gorky, himself.</p>
   <p>"Ignis Sanat" (The Fire Heals) is his best known play. It caused a regular storm in many European theatres with its unusual ideals and absolute radicalism.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0328.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Sedition, moral, mental, and physical, which, resembling insanity, in this drama is in combat with stale conservatism and superstition is most powerful at the point where the drama comes to a shocking climax of deepest tragedy. This sedition is at the same time the chief subject and thought of the famous play. The drama, "Ignis Sanat", has not shown in any other language in America.</p>
   <p>Jugoslavians, in these three communities, are exceptionally fortunate to be the first ones to see this educational and touching play. The fact that the club, "Nada," will present the play is enough assurance that all will have a good time and profitable evening.</p>
   <p>All Jugoslavians in Chicago, South Chicago, and Gary should. see the play and experience its noble spiritual feeling.</p>
