  <body>
   <p>Chicago's Great West Side has witnessed many entertainments presented by the 'Yavor' (Maple Tree) Orchestra.</p>
   <p>Among the organizations which have secured the services of 'Yavor' is the Croatian Radio Club. "Yavor" has made concert and dance music a specialty. It has found the piano a very essential instrument for their particular interpretations, and with this added instrument they add movelty to their dance presentations.</p>
   <p>Miss Mary Misic, a former member of the girls' tamburitza orchestra, has joined the unit as soprano soloist.</p>
   <p>Recently the orchestra made a few recordings for the Columbia-Brunswick Recording Company. Reports state that the recordings have been a success.</p>
   <p>The immediate schedule of "Yavor" finds the band appearing three nights a week in one of the finest Bohemian wine gardens. Their calendar of <pb facs="5420779_2_0240.jpg" n="2"/>events also calls for picnics and other club socials.</p>
   <p>Popular band. Under the directorship of John Plasay, one of the famous "Zvonimir" players, the orchestra has become one of Chicago's popular string bands. As a result of disbanding "Zvonimir" in 1934, Mr. Plasay organized "Yavor" with a new and capable group of musicians. The orchestra now includes five tamburitza players and the orchestra may be reached through John Plasay, 1804 S. Ashland Avenue, Chicago.</p>
