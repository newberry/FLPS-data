   <p>The association for support of Croatian Orphanage is giving its annual entertainment Sunday, March 1st, 1925 in Czech-American Hall 1438 West 18th Street.</p>
   <p>We are inviting all lodges and individuals to come and enjoy the program the net proceeds of which will go to the Croatian Orphanage of America which is being built at present in Des Plaines, Illinois. The entertainment starts at 3 P.M. and the stage play at 7 P.M. With other rich program we will show on the stage, the play "Zrtva" in one act. Admission is 50 cents a person.</p>
   <p>Majority of Croatians and Jugoslavs know the energetic work of this association which as a rule gives one concert annually and it is desired that all our people, in Chicago and vicinity be with us that day.</p>
   <p>This year we have much larger hall, and we hoped to satisfy our guests with the new hall as well as with service.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
