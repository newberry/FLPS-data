</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The fact must not be denied that we, foreigners, do not feel in America as in a country which likes us. What counted before is not good any more. Many things were considered unimportant, but today if they concern foreigners they are a great evil.</p>
   <p>This we apply to illiterate foreigners. Before nobody cared if the immigrants were illiterate or not. The main thing for the immigrant was to have strong hands and to be able to work.</p>
   <p>Now, besides many things the foreigner is scorned for his illiteracy. We see and hear the capitalistic press crying today: "Out with the immigrants!" But we remember when these same papers clamored for admission of illiterate workers. Many companies advertised that their workers are not expected to speak English, they may work like at home.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0866.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Posters were distributed around the world to get workers for America. Now these same men who lured the foreigners to come to America as they were, complain about their illiteracy. And these illiterate workers, who worked 12 and 14 hours at the hardest tasks, are not good any more!</p>
   <p>How to understand this change?</p>
