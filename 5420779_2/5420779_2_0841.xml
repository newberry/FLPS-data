   <p>After forty years of settlement Chicago is still considered a new Croatian colony. It is hard to find an authentic record of the first Croatian who immigrated here, for no printed matter concerning the arrival of our pioneer travellers is available. We know that the first Croatian newspaper in Chicago, Zora, was edited by Jhon Kovacevic, but to secure a copy of it is impossible. Nobody cared to preserve it for future generations. A few of the early immigrants, still alive, remember others who came here twenty years before them or in the early Seventies. There were only a few of these and they were not segregated. Ten years later a few hundred were found where the loop is today. They had about fifteen saloons on State, Clark and Wabash Avenue. They called themselves Austrians and must have had some organization because they carried buttons inscribed with "Austrian". Their career in the loop ended during the panic of 1893, which impoverished them. In spite of their disagreements the Croats and so-called Austrians got together and organized a benevolent lodge. To satisfy both nationalities it was named "Slovenska Sloga". One side thought it would win the other to its belief. Neither of them succeeded. The Austrians as such disappeared and the Croatians remained until they died, but "Slovenska Sloga" still lives.</p>

   <p>In 1891 the Archer Avenue colony had a club "Strossmayer". There were only about fifteen members in it. It was organized by the more intelligent Croats for the purpose of exchanging ideas and views on life. A year later, however, they turned it into a benevolent lodge. That was the first Croatian lodge in America. It still exists. A year later more immigrants came to Chicago, settling on Eighteenth and Racine Avenue. These people founded a lodge "Crveni Kriz" (Red Cross). At the same time the first Croatian newspaper Hrvatska Zora (The Croatian Dawn) appeared and soon after another was issued on the South Side, named Chicago, and renamed later Chicago Sloboda.</p>
