</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Three days more and then the third Jugoslav Socialist congress will convene at Chicago. This congress will happen in the most bloody era of human history, when Europe is a great slaughter house; while America is anxiously waiting for the report of the first rifle to give to this hemisphere an opportunity to exchange production for destruction .... humanity for barbarism.</p>
   <p>It is easy to guess what answer the third Jugoslav congress has to give to the cries of the oppressed world. It is not hard to presume what standpoint this congress has to take against those conditions which make possible this great destruction of life in human society.</p>
   <p>The third Jugoslav Socialist congress has to point the way how to abolish the causes of this great slaughter as well as how to destroy the means of it.</p>
   <p>The governing classes of the world want to extend their exploitation. For this reason duties are laid upon the people to foster the plans of these classes.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0119.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These "duties" are considered sacred. Not to admit these duties is called unpatriotic or treason.</p>
   <p>To these "duties" belong all kinds of sacrifices which the governing class deems proper to request. On its wish you must give your life, property, leave your family, destroy everything and then the duty is done toward your "nation."</p>
   <p>All who participate in these things, we consider as victims or weak-minded beings, if not criminals.</p>
   <p>In other words, we are not able to admit "duties" of any kind which are the consequence of a long line of crimes.</p>
   <p>That fact is that Socialism received a hard blow and in the ranks of Socialists must not be tolerated men who today approve the crimes of their governments. These men betrayed Socialism, but we must take the stand against any war and remain true to our resolution.</p>
