   <p>The Jugoslav Cultural Federation of Chicago decided to arrange a series of lectures for all Jugoslav immigrants of Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>Representatives of Jugoslav political and cultural organizations were invited to deliver lectures. A few newspapers without regard to their point of view were also invited to express opinions. The purpose of this federation is to give our immigrants an opportunity to get acquainted with the different views of political and economic nature. We believe this to be the best course for cultural enlightenment and progress.</p>
   <p>The speakers will have full and unlimited freedom of speech to express their religious, anti-religious, political, economic or scientific views.</p>
   <p>After the lecture the floor will not be given to anyone individually, but everybody will have the right to question the lecturer for additional explanations of the topic. Most of the lectures will be given on Fridays, <pb facs="5420779_2_0567.jpg" n="2"/>others on Saturdays and additional lectures, if necessary, on other days.</p>
   <p>All lectures will be given in the quarters of the Jugoslav Cultural Federation at 1345 W. 18th St.</p>
   <p>We may reserve some of the lectures for men, others for women. That, however, will be announced in time.</p>
   <p>All Jugoslavs of Chicago and vicinity are invited to attend these lectures and to hear the different views on the most important questions of today, for the main purpose of making it possible to choose that road which will best conform with their lives and the improvement of humanity.</p>
   <p>Program of Lectures:</p>
   <p>Friday, October 22, "Our People in America," F. I. Lupis, editor, Croatian Herald; Friday, Oct. 29, "The Proletarian Party and Its Function in Capitalistic <pb facs="5420779_2_0568.jpg" n="3"/>Society," S. M.
