   <p>On Christmas, 1907, Radnicka Straza started its publication and enters now the third year.</p>
   <p>Through abysses and gorges, through tempest and storm, goes the fight of labor. For that reason it was accompanied with many fears for the establishing of a labor organ.</p>
   <p>Workers from Allegheny, Pa., Chicago, Ill., and some other places, started to collect, saving on their food. There was unemployment and great need among the workers, but penny by penny was collected to start the Radnicka Straza, (Workingmen's Guard).</p>
   <p>Great anxiety prevailed. Friends and comrades alike feared for her success. There was great misery and want among the workers. Hundreds of them wanted to help but they were penniless.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0482.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One more thing - at the time when the paper was started, many swindlers and adventurers cheated our Croatian people, who lost confidence in similar enterprises. Our paper was met with distrust at first. But to thousands of workers our organ is a welcomed friend today. To keep up the paper, much trouble and efforts were necessary. After a day's work in shops and factories, the comrades came to the office to work on the paper, late at night. They demonstrated to be able to yield the pen as well as the hammer. Not only their work, but also their earnings, they donated to keep up the paper. That was done by our workers all over the country, who did recognize the importance of a workingmen's press.</p>
   <p>There we are in the third year now. From a small crew, we number thousands at present. In the same manner, workers of other nationalities are rising. We are becoming more numerous; one day we will conquer the world.</p>
   <p>The Radnicka Straza will continue to fulfill its duty in the fight for the working class, with more force than ever. Its program will remain <pb facs="5420779_2_0483.jpg" n="3"/>the awakening of the working classes against all their oppressors and maltreaters.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this fight is Socialism. Socialism only is able to liberate humanity from misery, darkness, and slavery of body and spirit.</p>
   <p>No sacrifice is too big to be offered in this fight. For that reason it is the duty of all honest and sagacious men to participate in this struggle and sacrifice for their lives.</p>
