   <p>Croatian Orphans, the name of which was later changed to Corporation for the Building of a Croatian Orphan Home. In 1916 about 30 locals of both Croatian unions became members of this corporation. In 1918 both unions decided that their members be assessed two cents per month for the building of an orphanage. In 1921 this assessment was raised to five cents and in 1924 to ten cents per month for each member. At the end of 1925 the contribution of the National Croatian Union was $138,668.18, the Croatian Union of Illinois, $45,000, the Corporation for the Building of the Orphan Home, $23,146.70. In 1926 both unions merged into one Croatian Fraternal Union, which took the Croatian orphan home in its hands but changed the name of the institution to Children's Home of the Croatian Fraternal Union.</p>
   <p>This is a short history of the Children's Home, the foundation of which was laid by the locals of Chilcago. From a small begining the home developed into a shelter for 150 children; on 49 1/2 acres of ground, where ten buildings (including a school building) were erected. The value of the ground and buildings is about $250,000 today.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0653.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The home is under the supervision of the State of Illinois Department of Public Welfare, and is conducted under laws regulating children's homes. Many changes that were made in the last eight years were made at the request of the State Department. For instance, that the home must have a playground, its own nurse, dentist, etc. The state insists that the children have the best facilities for their mental and physical development. The supreme board as well as the committee in charge of the home try their best to give such facilities to the children, which sometimes is impossible, like keeping the place from being overcrowded. But for the most part the home deservers the certificate given each year by the state to homes which merit credit.</p>
   <p>Now the building of a swimming pool for the children on the grounds is in progress.</p>
   <p>Many things have to be completed in the future, mostly on the farm. It will be done because it was proved that the farm pays good returns to the children's home.</p>
