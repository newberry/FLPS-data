   <p>The Jugoslav dramatic club "Nada," true to its reputation, will play again as it did last year on several occasions. Next Sunday, November 7, "Nada" will present a dramatic play, "Bez Srece" (Unlucky). This is a national drama in three parts from Slavonian life.</p>
   <p>In connection with the play there will be a social and refreshments, followed by a dance. It will be held at C. S. P. S. Hall, 18th and May Street. The hall is open at 2:00 P. M., and the play starts exactly at 3:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>The public's attention is hereby called to be in the hall before 3:00 P. M., as the play is going to start on time.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Association is doing this purposely in order to gradually change an old habit of being late one or two hours form the <pb facs="5420779_2_0326.jpg" n="2"/>stated time. That works hardship on the players and the people who are prompt and on time, since they have to wait until others come.</p>
   <p>Our newspapers should devote some space to that effect, as well as our clubs and lodges that hold concerts and socials should insist on punctuality. Time is ripe that our people learn better order and respect somebody else's time, as is the custom with other people.</p>
