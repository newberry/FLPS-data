<title level="a">TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CROATIAN CHILDREN'S HOME</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>This year it will be ten years since the opening of our children's home, that is, the tenth anniversary since for the first time children of our deceased members were admitted under the roof of our Croatian Fraternal Union, whose members replaced their dead parents, whom fate took away from them.</p>
   <p>To mark this tenth anniversary in a solemn way, the Supreme Board decided, at its last meeting, on a celebration to be held on July 4th. The Supreme Board empowered two of its members, in company with the advisory board of the home, as well as the home's manager, to prepare a program of festivities for this occasion, which program has to be worthy of its purpose.</p>
   <p>The celebration will include all members of the Supreme Board and all the officials of our organization. It is expected that thousands of our <pb facs="5420779_2_0657.jpg" n="2"/>members from near and far will arrive for this celebration to honor by their presence the tenth anniversary of this noble institution.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that it was necessary as well as honorable for all of us to have such an institution, which is lauded and admired even by strangers.</p>
   <p>Each of our members, who had the opportunity to visit our children's home, to watch its work and the life of the orphans there; to see the amount of sacrifices which our organization offers just for the one purpose of taking decent care of our children in our children's home, such a member as an eye witness of all, will be more proud of being a member and participant in this our greatest national and fraternal institution, which endeavors with all might by noble acts to fulfill its purpose, to aid all who by fate are forced to appeal to generous hearts.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0658.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All former outings to the children's home were a complete success. They brought income, which was used for the needs of that home.</p>
   <p>Brethren and sisters came from all parts, to aid as much as possible the responsible purpose of the children's home.</p>
   <p>This year this outing is of a more important significance for each member, because as it was stated above, at the same time we will celebrate the tenth anniversary since the opening of the children's home with an excellent program, in which will participate not only members of the Supreme Board, but also all our singing societies and our children of the home. No doubt this program will satisfy everybody.</p>
   <p>Taking into account this very important celebration of our children's home, it is desired that all Croatian organizations participate in this celebration. This celebration will be more proof that we have been devoted to the principles and purposes of our organization from the beginning.</p>
