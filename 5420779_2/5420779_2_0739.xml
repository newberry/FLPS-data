   <p>From statistics of the year 1918 we learn that one out of eighteen American-born citizens is a criminal. Among the inhabitants of the United States who were born abroad one out of sixty-six is a criminal.</p>
   <p>If we were to count as a criminal any common law-breaker, the number of criminals among native-born Americans would be still larger. Indeed, if we watch the newspapers, we shall find that those who are most active in crime are Americans born here and not immigrants.</p>
   <p>If these facts were clear to Americans, they would renounce their hatred and contempt for "foreigners". From a purely scientific standpoint we are all foreigners, since our residence on earth is very short. Why then not try to live this short life in brotherhood and love? Why be divided into classes, nations, and races, besides creating an artificial division, expressed by the terms "American-born" and "foreigner"? This would not happen except for the <pb facs="5420779_2_0740.jpg" n="2"/>plutocrats, who wish to distract the attention of the people from misery and injustice by exaggerating the menace of the foreign-born.</p>
   <p>There is no good reason why Americans should despise foreigners. They also, or their forebears, were "foreigners" once. Besides, the foreigners have elevated this country to prosperity. Foreigners do the heavy work today. If they suddenly left for their native countries, there would be a crisis here.</p>
   <p>On the other hand the foreigners are the most peace-loving element in this country, more peaceful than the Americans themselves. This is shown by these statistics of crime.</p>
   <p>The situation in America is not promising. That is understood by the element in control, which fears revolt and resistance. [Those who compose this element] have many ways of explaining the situation, and they try to blame the socialists, the communists, and the "foreigners" for it, but the robbers on Wall Street are never blamed for anything.</p>
