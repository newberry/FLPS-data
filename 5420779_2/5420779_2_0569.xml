   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Association is sponsoring a public forum with a speaker who has recently graduated from the University of Chicago with great honors, Mr. Fran Preveden.</p>
   <p>The theme is "The Beginning of Languages, their Contribution to the Development of the Mind." The discussion is divided into the following parts: (1) Given problems and the way of their solution, (2) Historic and contemporary research of the language, (3) Prehistoric languages and their ancient engravings, (4) The groups of languages: Asiatic, Semitic, Ural-Asiatic, etc.; (5) The kinds of languages: a. Monofold and multifold, b. Inflective and Agglutinative, c. Synthetic and Analytic; (6) The changes of languages and their reasons, (7) Is language a gift of God? Can evolution explain the origin of the language? (8) The five known theories of the origin of language, (9) The origin of writing and its significance, and (10) Building of the human mind with the aid of the language.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0570.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are certain that Mr. Preveden will ably develop his theme, as he is the best informed Jugoslav on that subject in America.</p>
   <p>We are inviting not only the members of our club, but the sympathizers and all other Jugoslavs in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The admission is free and the lecture starts at 8 P. M. After the lecture there will be music, singing and other amusements.</p>
   <p>Committee for Education.</p>
