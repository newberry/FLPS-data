   <p>The Jugoslav Educational Association is sponsoring an entertainment with a play, Sunday, September 2 in C. S. P. S. Hall, 18th and May street.</p>
   <p>The dramatic club "Nada" will present a well-known play "Hasanaginica" the play in three acts depicting a life of a Mussulman family in Bosnia.</p>
   <p>"Hasan-aginioa" is classed among our best plays. It is the best achievement of our late poet and author Dr. Ogrizovic. This drama portrays, in an excellent manner, psychological effects, it is worked up to a sublime degree of emotion, and poetically, it leaves an indelible mark in the hearts of all who read it or see it performed on the stage.</p>
   <p>The admission tickets are on sale and there is a chance given to everybody to secure one and get a discount. The admission is $1.00,and in advance 75c.</p>
   <p>Notice is extended to all singing and musical clubs to kindly refrain from arranging their concerts on that day, October 2, as it would work financial hardship on all, and we wish to show this play to the largest audience possible Beginning at 3 P.M. Dance will follow after the play.</p>
