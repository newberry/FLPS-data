   <p>It is extremely bold when a man, who has not ten people behind him, dares to speak in the name of three nationalities and to promise that these nationalities, in case of an American war with Germany, will give their lives and properties.</p>
   <p>It is not a dream, it is the truth, that Dr. Biankini, in the capacity of president of some kind of Jugoslav committee, sent a telegram to President Wilson, promising him the greatest assistance in the name of the Serbians, Croatians, and Slovenes, in case of war.</p>
   <p>Dr. Biankini was not recognized by these three nationalities as their representative. The fact that some kind of congress at the Hotel La Salle elected him as its president does not matter for the Serbians, Croatians, and Slovenes. Dr. Biankini is not entitled to talk in their names.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0135.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We do not know that Dr. Biankini, has called a public meeting of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes; that he received their consent to send any foolish telegrams.</p>
   <p>Because he did not call a meeting he speaks in the name of the people without the people's permission.</p>
   <p>Today there is not one Jugoslav in Chicago who will not say, "Let Biankini be a hero on his own account, but be must not talk in the name of others."</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav working men in America are not fools any more to follow gentlemen-adventurers through fire and water.</p>
   <p>Biankini's own paper calls him a "far-seeing statesman," but the people, to say it mildly, does not trust Dr. Biankini.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0136.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If it were admitted that Dr. Biankini is a leader of the Jugoslavs, then in the name of the Jugoslav people he should demand peace and not offer men and their properties to be destroyed, though nobody asks for it.</p>
   <p>If Dr. Biankini wanted to wage war on the Germans, why did he not remain in Europe and become a Russian or a Serbian general?</p>
   <p>We hope the people themselves will tell Dr. Biankini what they think about his demagogy.</p>
