   <p>The question concerning the future of Radnicka Straza is of great importance. Our movement faces great difficulties in the party as well as in our federation.</p>
   <p>There is great need to create a background for our press, the only press which in this country gives food for thought to our Jugoslav people.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to strengthen the opposition against the yellow press, which writes in favor of this slaughter and against our own Radnicka Straza.</p>
   <p>Our paper is a torch of liberty, not only for Socialists and its readers, but also for all those who, for some reason, hate or are against war.</p>
   <p>To be able to resist all persecutions against us, either by authorities or attacks by our Jugoslav patriots, we must form a league with the purpose of collecting as much material as possible for our militant press or official organ.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0451.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The plan is very simple. Each member, reader or sympathizer who approves the articles in the Radnicka Straza, particularly against war and capitalism, will have to donate one day's wages.</p>
   <p>Such a voluntary donation not only would secure continuation of our organ but in case of its stoppage by authorities would allow the issue of another paper.</p>
   <p>Our press must not perish as long as we are here who read it and find it to be necessary for our Croatian people.</p>
   <p>The working conditions are favorable today. Each member is able to answer our call for contribution. We have over 1,000 members in the federation. If each gives, say, three dollars, we will have a considerable sum of money. The Socialist press in our greatest weapon, which gives us new thoughts, new force and will for work.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0452.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Comrades! We have to work together to accumulate material support for our official organ. It is not hard to give one day's pay for that purpose.z</p>
   <p>We may miss that money but we will have new and fresh thoughts, which only a sane Socialist press is able to bring to us.</p>
