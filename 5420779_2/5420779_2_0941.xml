   <p>In Croatian and Serbian newspapers all over America announcements are made about the organization of a Croatian league.</p>
   <p>The sponsors, either persons or associations, declare as the purpose of the league the liberation of the Croatian people, the national autonomy, the union of Serbians and Croatians. All that without a clear definition or explation.</p>
   <p>Honorary committees are designated, badges issued and collection of money is ordered.</p>
   <p>Threats are issued to defame the national character of every person who will not heed this call or open his or her pocket.</p>
   <p>All proclamations are full of bombastic phrases, show ignorance of real conditions and are phantastic and imperfect. It is promised to the people that their demands will be taken before a peace conference of which nothing is known, <pb facs="5420779_2_0942.jpg" n="2"/>when and where it will take place; about what it will deliberate, and with what possible consequences.</p>
   <p>The criminal laxity which builds air castles on such foundations is characteristic of these ridiculous actions which make a laughing stock of our honor and national name, and will have deplorable consequences if the misguided people join this theoretical league, where Austrian spies will note the names of those who will be more exposed through their actions.</p>
   <p>The Jugoslav Socialist Federation having in mind its international standing according to that the standard of liberty, independence and equality of all and each nation, does not forget its duties in the present serious times.</p>
   <p>For that reason we reject to play with national destiny and protest energetically against the exploitation of our working classes extracting money from the said classes.</p>
   <p>The central committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation reminds all its members and sane-thinking Jugoslavs not to help any action with their <pb facs="5420779_2_0943.jpg" n="3"/>signatures when action is basically wrong and which will not bear any good results. On the contrary such action will only show our people's lack of maturity and seriousness.</p>
   <p>The central committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation in America appeals to our people to remain calm, because that is the main prerequisite for success. If future events in Europe show that there is any chance for liberty and democratic institutions, according to socialist standards, this committee will not remain inactive. We decided now to follow the developments and collect material which may be of use in the future.</p>
   <p>The committee considers this as its duty toward the Internationale, which may possibly need information in case it has to proclaim its claims for new conditions for peace and new state of affairs.</p>
   <p>The central committee of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation in fulfilling its duties protests against misuseof the national name for experiments which are harmful, regardless whether they have their source in ignorance, heedlessness or bad intentions.</p>
