<title level="a">FIGHT AGAINST REGISTRATION OF IMMIGRANTS; PROCLAMATION OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR DEFENSE OF IMMIGRANTS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>With the opening of Congress in December, the capitalist employers will undertake the registration, fingerprinting and photographing of immigrants in this country. This was foreshadowed by the news received from Washington at the close of the last session of Congress.</p>
   <p>The demand to treat immigrants as criminals are treated has been repeated in Congress for the last three years. The first attempt was made in 1923, then in 1924, and again in the last session of Congress.</p>
   <p>That the bills introduced did not become laws was the result of the united front of the workers's being against it.</p>
   <p>What does this law against immigrants mean? There is only one answer. The capitalist employers, who dominate the government of the United States, want, by introduction of severe laws against immigrants who are mostly workers, to intimidate them and make them refrain from demanding higher <pb facs="5420779_2_0760.jpg" n="2"/>wages and better working conditions through their trade unions, also to prohibit their participation in strikes. The capitalists want to hold the big stick over the heads of workers who dare to fight for the betterment of their living conditions.</p>
   <p>The disadvantages will work not only against immigrants but also against American workers as well. If the capitalist employers are able to force the immigrants to work for lower wages and under bad conditions, and create a lower working class of immigrants, they will be able to do the same thing to American workers. The fight against registration is not only a fight of the foreign-born, but also of American-born workers.</p>
   <p>At the last session of Congress many bills were introduced which advocated registration of immigrants-workers. The Answella bill asked for registration at the department of justice each year.</p>
   <p>Another bill demands deportation of immigrants who are not citizens of the United States of America, or do not declare an intention to become citizens. Those immigrants who do not register must be deported.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0761.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>According to Holliday's bill, any person punished with one year's imprisonment for any crime, has to be deported. According to that law, workers sentenced to a year in prison for participating in strikes, picketing or for not obeying injunctions in the interest of the working class, must be deported after expiration of their prison term.</p>
   <p>The purpose of all bills introduced is to make of the immigrants victims at the mercy of capitalistic employers under the threat of deportation in case they resist exploitation.</p>
   <p>We must mobilize for the fight in the coming Congress session.</p>
   <p>Immigrants as well as American-born workers were saved when those bills failed to pass because of the vehement protests of their organizations. Now looms the danger that the bills will be introduced and accepted before there is a possibility of organizing protests.</p>
   <p>The national committee for the protection of immigrants, organized from delegates of different organizations, numbering half a million workers <pb facs="5420779_2_0762.jpg" n="4"/>from trade unions and benevolent societies, at a conference in Washington, invited all those who in the past had protested against introducing the bills to organize their forces for a renewed fight.</p>
   <p>The fight was successful for three sessions of Congress. It may be successful again if the work of protesting the bills is started immediately.</p>
   <p>Face the new Congress with more vigorous protests against those bills. In all places organize councils of immigrants for protection.</p>
   <p>National Committee for the Protection of Foreign Workers.</p>
