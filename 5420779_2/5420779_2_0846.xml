   <p>Washington, D. C. - The American Civil Liberties Union sent a protest to the Secretary of State about new methods in deportation of Communists.</p>
   <p>This organization was able to secure information that the American government uses falsified passports to deport unwanted, undesirable Russian workers.</p>
   <p>The Soviet government issued an order prohibiting entrance of deported persons into its union. That was done because of the hysteria shown by American authorities, who deported hundreds of foreigners.</p>
   <p>According to the decision of the Russian government, the United States cannot deport any person to that country. For that reason other methods were used. A few Russian workers were deported to Switzerland provided with false passports, where they were stranded without funds.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0847.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Liberties Union sent a protest to our government, asking it to refrain from such deportation of workers.</p>
   <p>These facts show what the laws and liberty of this "free country" are worth. It is the duty of all workers to protest against such unlawful deportation of foreigners, because there is a possibility and danger that all of us will be dealt with in the same way.</p>
   <p>The Labor Party of America led a campaign from the start against reactionary government. Workers must join its ranks for the defence of their own interests.</p>
