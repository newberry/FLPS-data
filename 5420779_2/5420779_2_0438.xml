   <p>The Post Office released No. 19 of Znanje, also two of the seized numbers 17 and 18.</p>
   <p>In none of the seized numbers was anything contrary to the existing laws. But our enemies are after us constantly. They interpret and explain wrongly the writings of our paper and this trouble with the Post Office causes us financial losses and disappoints our readers.</p>
   <p>We hope that our friends and readers will understand our position in this matter, and will not ask us questions which, on account of the censorship, we are not able to answer if we do not want to endanger the mere existence of our paper.</p>
   <p>Znanje, (Knowledge), is necessary for the Jugoslav workingman in America. It is necessary in so far as we are forbidden at present to treat political questions. It is necessary as a purely scientific paper, which will point out the bad prospects of life, criticizing all evils of capitalism and instructing workingmen to think independently as reasoning beings, as <pb facs="5420779_2_0439.jpg" n="2"/>followers of a clear doctrine, as enemies of any social crime.</p>
   <p>We are too weak to continue this work if we are not helped by friends and readers. That is the reason why we appeal to all our Jugoslav workers, who need good mental nourishment, to work for the extension of our paper.</p>
   <p>Znanje today has about 6,500 subscribers. If it were not for these persecutions we would have from 8,000 to 10,000 subscribers.</p>
   <p>Comrades! Workers! Do not despair and lose strength; work for your paper steadily, without interruption.</p>
   <p>If accidentally you do not get some of the numbers, do not blame the editor or management. Comprehend the situation as it is, just continue to work for the paper as if nothing happened. The numbers seized by the Post Office will arrive later on. If they do not arrive at all, be content with those which are released.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0440.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We will take the necessary steps to assure a regular edition, but you must use all your power to give Znanje its daily bread, a necessity of all Jugoslav (Croatian and Serbian) workers in this country.</p>
