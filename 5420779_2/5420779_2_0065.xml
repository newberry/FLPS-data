   <p>On several occasions we wrote of collective support and the need of action in our party work which would make our election campaign more successful this year. We emphasized the necessity and we reiterate again that you circulate petitions and collect necessary signatures in time so that the party may go on ballot. We urge and again repeat that everyone may, or ought to participate, women members and sympathizers are especially indispensable in this work. There should be a contest.</p>
   <p>We also mentioned how capitalist parties invest millions, yes, tens of millions of dollars in their corrupt propaganda to get more votes and foollthe masses in this country. The official report is given by the Republican and Democratic parties that they have about $20,000,000 at their disposal for election purposes. However, there is much more, which their leaders deny.</p>
   <p>The Workers (Communist) Party decided to raise one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0066.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That is a small amount when compared with the capitalists' millions.</p>
   <p>But the Workers Party does not intend to handle millions, it is content with much less, since it has an upright program and a tactical way of working However, the party needs at least enough to be able to present its program to the public, which is flooded with the capitalist press, literature, movies and false speeches. We must, if we want to overcome this foggy darkness, and keep out of these entangling nets, have at least $100,000 which will enable us to go ahead with our work. To you we pass this question: Did you ever think seriously of this? If not, think and act now. If you did, do it again, more seriously; don't procrastinate until it is too late.</p>
