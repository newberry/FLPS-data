   <p>The campaign for new membership of the Croatian Fraternal Union is progressing. It started three months ago. As it is known, this campaign for new members will last for three months more, to the end of August.</p>
   <p>There are no reports on how far this campaign succeeded to make possible a conclusion for the final success. It seems the start was exceedingly good, but the work should be continued.</p>
   <p>The members of the Croatian Fraternal Union have reasons to work for the enlargement of their organization. They have in it their personal benefits in case of sickness and accident, and besides there are benefits for their friends and relatives.</p>
   <p>The campaign gives to the members some prizes, and many of the members will be spurred to more activity in the hope of winning a prize.</p>
   <p>Besides, we must think for the future of our organization. If the <pb facs="5420779_2_0594.jpg" n="2"/>membership declines instead of growing, there is no doubt the organization will become weak and will not be able to fulfill its numerous duties.</p>
   <p>At present there is no fear for the organization's existence, though it is a fact that in these days our people are not immigrating to the United States. There are from ten to a hundred thousand of our people who have not joined the Croatian Fraternal Union. Many of them must do it, of course, if they are not too advanced in age and if they are able to pay their dues as members.</p>
   <p>There are our youths, from where we can have thousands of members, for the junior department will in due time become a strong unit of the organization.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the Croatian Fraternal Union has published a booklet containing many statements about the organization. This booklet explains how the Croatian Fraternal Union became the oldest and biggest benevolent organization among the Croats.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0595.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It was established in 1894. For 43 years it acted helpfully among our people. Its ranks are distributed all over the United States and Canada. The organization has 83,000 members at present. The treasury has more than $8,000,000.</p>
   <p>The Aim of the Organization:</p>
   <p>The Croatian Fraternal Union was established for Croatian immigrants. For that reason its official language is Croatian. Ten years ago the children of our immigrants and members of the Croatian Fraternal Union began to establish Croatian-speaking branches. We have eighty such branches at present. By that an opportunity is given to those who were born here of Croatian parents to join such lodges where the official language is English.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of the Union is to unite the Croatians and other Slavs of good Character, who are sound both mentally and physically, to benefit and assist them nationally, socially, mentally and morally.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0596.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Any Slav between 16 and 50 years of age may join the C. F. U. if his character is good. The new applicant does not pay any registration fee.</p>
   <p>In the junior department it is possible to insure children of Slavic parents from 30 days old to 16 years. The members can be insured only for a death benefit if they do not care for accident and sick benefits.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Croatian Fraternal Union must spur on each member to encourage the campaign for 20,000 new members. The campaign is in full progress now.</p>
