   <p>The Jugoslav people are surely happy! They will not slave for a stranger any more. They will not be obliged to travel over strange lands, but they will peacefully and nicely live in their own country, which is united at last.</p>
   <p>On the Island of Corfu the Serbian government held a meeting with the delegates of the Committee at London. A new state was created under the name "Kingdom of the Croats, Serbs and Slovenes." As it is reported, that will be constitutional democratic and parliamentarian monarchy.</p>
   <p>We must say that we were surprised to hear about the creation of this new state.</p>
   <p>Mr. Marjanovich, member and delegate of the London Committee, said once that the people should have their say about the establishment of a new state.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0917.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Not only has the new state received a title and king as ruler, but in thirteen articles all is said about the organization of the state.</p>
   <p>In its proclamation the government mentions noble France, the great American Republic, and new, democratic Russia as its great defenders and friends. But it is surprising that this new Jugoslav state did not follow in the steps of these noble, free and democratic states and adopt a republican form of government, instead of choosing a monarchy.</p>
   <p>That shows that the main thing considered was King Peter and his dynasty.</p>
