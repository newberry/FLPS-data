   <p>Members of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation, branch No. 6, at Chicago, Illinois, accepted at their special meeting of members on April the 7th, the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"The Jugoslav Socialist Federation, branch No. 6, calls on the central committee of the federation to suspend a decision in which it was ordered to conduct a polemic about national defense and national army in the federation's organ Radnicka Straza.</p>
   <p>"This request is based on the following reasons: (1) In the program of the American Socialist party there is not mentioned militarism. Accordingly nothing about national defense or a national army which expressions were brought up by the European Socialists as a counterbalance against state militarism.</p>
   <p>"Because in the program of the American Socialist party, of which we are members, nothing is said about said national defense, this branch considers a discussion of this question superfluous and not necessary. The more so as this <pb facs="5420779_2_0121.jpg" n="2"/>branch considers it a duty to fight budding militarism in the United States. To advocate or to favor any kind of national defense or national army in a country where there is obligatory military service, this branch considers reactionary and not worthy of true socialistic action.</p>
   <p>"(2) In August 1915 the Socialist party proclaimed its anti-war manifesto and peace program, which contains among others the following demands: An international federation, a United States of the World, and disarmament.</p>
   <p>"This program of a United States of the World excludes the possibility of a national defense or national army. The more so as complete disarmament is requested.</p>
   <p>"(3) In the by-laws and rules of the American Socialist party it is said clearly: "A member who is against political action or advocates crimes, sabotage or other acts of violence with the purpose of liberating the working class, has to be excluded from the party."</p>
   <p>"Under political action has to be understood participation at elections, in legislative matters and administrative work."</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0122.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All above this puts an end to claims of advocates of national defense, that working men in their struggle against the governing classes have to use violence and arms.</p>
   <p>From these reasons this branch considers a discussion through the organ Radnicka Straza, over these questions, not pertinent and also damaging to our work in the American Socialist party.</p>
   <p>This branch requests the central committee to revoke its decision about such a discussion, to allow this, our resolution, to be published, with a plea to other branches to support it.</p>
   <p>In case the committee does not grant our request it may notify us as soon as possible, so we will be able to influence other branches to revoke the decision.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0123.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is our conviction that members of the Jugoslav Socialist Federation are not willing to fall into this trap of militarism, that they not only will rise against the discussion of these question in the columns of Radnicka Straza, but that they will condemn all those who try to bring confusion into the ranks of the American Socialist party.</p>

   <p>Alex Dubravac, President of Meeting</p>
