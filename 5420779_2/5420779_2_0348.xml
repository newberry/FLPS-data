   <p>A great national celebration was the entertainment which was given by two societies, which belong to the Croatian workingmen's Educational and Political Association of America.</p>
   <p>That were:the Singing Society "Sloga" and string Orchestra "Sloboda."</p>
   <p>The entertainment given was a great success.</p>
   <p>The great hall was packed with working people from all over Chicago. There came also people from Milwaukee. Also a great number of local tradesmen and merchants. All of them anticipated a great time, and they certainly did have one.</p>
   <p>The main thing is that our people start to understand the movement of the Croatian Workingmen's Political and Educational Association.</p>
   <p>The moral and material success was great. The clear income was $110.00 which sums will be used for educational purposes entirely; to strengthen the singing and String Orchestra Chorus, and for a school for lliterates and the ordering of book and newspapers for a reading room.</p>
   <p>The artistic, or better, the educational and cultural side and influence of the production is hard to explain. The program, rich and beautiful, was put thru with the greatest precision. The visitors were elated. Many came to the conclusion that the socialist workers are bearers of culture and progress. The music of "Sloga" satisfied just as the singing of "Sloboda." Three other <pb facs="5420779_2_0349.jpg" n="2"/>singing societies cooperated; the Slovenian "Orel," and "Slovan" as well as the German "Westseite Damenchor."</p>
   <p>From other nationalities there were: Slovenians, Serbians, Czechs and Slovaks. All of them were pleased.</p>
   <p>The high point of the entertainment was the theatrical performance "Kcerka Rada" (The Workers' Daughter). In the play was portrayed the avidity and dissipation of the capitalistic classes, the struggle, pain and sufferings of the working classes. Many were moved to tears.</p>
   <p>After the program followed a dance, which lasted till 3 A. M.</p>
   <p>In all, the complete program was a glorious triumph of the working class. During the productions there was order and quiet. Our Croatian Educational and Political Association justly can be proud of their singing society and string orchestra.</p>
