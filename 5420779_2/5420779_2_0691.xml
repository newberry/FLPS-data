   <p>At the end of February the Association for the Education of Croatian Orphans held its annual meeting. From the report which we received it is seen that the work is progressing and that the purpose of the association is to give refuge and education to any Croatian orphan.</p>
   <p>The association takes care of thirty-nine Croatian and four Slovenian children who are sheltered at the Czech Orphan Home at Lisle, Ill., not far from Chicago.</p>
   <p>According to the report of the manager of this orphans' home, the monthly cost per child is $11.74. That means that the association is very hard pressed to meet its obligations. It was decided at the meeting to name confidants for the association with the duty to collect contributions from private persons and societies. The children have their own Croatian teacher and are progressing fine.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0692.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The meeting decided to order the printing of a Croatian school reader for the second, third and fourth grades.</p>
   <p>From the statement of the financial secretary, at the end of 1916 a total of $1,085.76 was received, expended $387.91, balance, $697.85.</p>
   <p>This association has fifty one societies, 138 private persons and the National Croatian Union as members.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this association is a noble one that is shown by the resolution adopted at the meeting to give the children a healthy and real education. For that reason the association deserves support from all.</p>
