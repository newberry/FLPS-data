   <p>In number 248 of Hrvatska Zastava Dr. Biankini declared that my writings about their Jugoslavia reveal me as a psychopathic case. That is about all they can say in their own defense.</p>
   <p>One of us two is surely out of his head. For that reason I propose a psychopathic examination. If Dr. Biankini is so sure of his brains, why not accept my challenge?</p>
   <p>Through ten issues of Radnicka Straza I brought out the facts which show that Messrs. Biankini and Company are either fools or in the pay of some government. Because I am convinced of the truth of that statement, I will not revoke it until these gentlemen furnish proof to the contrary.</p>
   <p>They are a bunch of unprincipled cattle, who have never regarded the people's interests but only their own. For their own profit they have divided our <pb facs="5420779_2_0923.jpg" n="2"/>people not only into nations but also into provinces, tribes, and factions. They have created in the people hate and dissension.</p>
   <p>Last year, in our issue number forty, we condemned German militarism. We predicted that the Kaiser's barbaric attempts would cause the ruin of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey.</p>
   <p>But we cannot commend this war or the imperialistic aims of the allies. In principle we are against any war politics. Even less can we approve of the foolishness, the lies, the chauvinistic hate, the robbery, and the antinational politics created and conducted by our Jugoslav dollar patriots in America.</p>
   <p>Dr. Biankini holds fast to his statement that this is a war between the German and the Slavic races. For that reason he accuses me of being a friend of the Teuto-Magyars. That is an infamous slander, considering the sacrifices which my family made for Serbia and Jugoslavia.</p>
   <pb facs="5420779_2_0924.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Today, looking back at the graves of my beloved family, before I may speak as a Serbian or a Jugoslav, I must ask permission of Biankini and his dogs--of men who till yesterday licked the plates of Austro-Hungarian consuls in America and by their spying kept alive the darkest reactionary policies of the Austro-Hungarian oligarchy!</p>
   <p>Today King Peter, his ministers, his generals, and the rest of the bourgeoisie have pushed Serbia to the verge of ruin. The whole Slavic South is a shambles, the country resounds with the groans of the dying, spilled blood cries to heaven, and Dr. Biankini and his dogs at banquets and in parades praise the Allies all over America!</p>
   <p>"Forward, sons of Serbia! If you must die, you will die gloriously! Do not fear, sons of Serbia! Other allies will grant us liberty. Long live Jugoslavia! Long live King Peter and Czar Nicholas!"</p>
   <p>I must hold my tongue--I must approve of any or all their misdeeds--I must <pb facs="5420779_2_0925.jpg" n="4"/>condone their lies--I must assist in their blunders if I want Biankini and Company to consider me an honest Serbian, or still better, a good Jugoslav! Is not that the irony of fate?</p>
   <p>Down with you!</p>
   <p>I fight for the life and the progress, not for the death and the ruin of my people!</p>
   <p>B. R. Savic.</p>
