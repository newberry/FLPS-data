  <body>
   <p>The nineteenth session, held Friday, June 25 spent most of its time in reading resolutions of pleas and complaints by the committee of the third Croatian Fraternal Union's convention.</p>
   <p>In connection with the decision of the complaints committee, the judgment was upheld against president Gazdic and secretary Jonic, the whole supreme executive board with the editor of Zajednicar.</p>
   <p>Following that, uneasiness was evident among the majority of the delegates, and especially in the audience, which was quieted down after the committee was ordered to reconsider and show necessary proofs of such a general accusstion.</p>
   <p>At Saturday's session, the convention voted lack of confidence in president Gazdic and treasurer Jonic because they received decorations <pb facs="5420779_2_0604.jpg" n="2"/>from the king of Jugoslavia. Although they returned the same decorations under the pressure of indignant members. The votes cast against president Gazdic and treasurer Jonic numbered 241 - with only 8 favorable.</p>
