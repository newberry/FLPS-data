   <p>The Central Committee of the Croatian Peasant Party called an open mass meeting which was held on March 16, 1930, and was well attended in spite of obstructionists whose intention it was to break up the meeting, but they did not succeed.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were adopted unanimously and sent to the League of Nations in Geneva, Sw.:</p>
   <p>Sir Eric Drummond</p>
   <p>League of Nations</p>
   <p>Geneva, Switzerland</p>
   <p>The Croatians of the City of South Chicago, Illinois, assembled at an open mass meeting, are extending to Your Excellency their most cordial greetings and wish to submit to the High Council and Assembly of the League of Nations a plea that the Croatian nation be made the restitution of an independent Croatian state, within the boundaries of its undisputed national and <pb facs="5420779_2_0896.jpg" n="2"/>political territory on the basis of self-determination to safeguard world peace.</p>
   <p>In the interest of humanity and the safeguarding right of the subdued peace loving Croatian nation, we demand immediate release of Dr. Matchek, leader of the Croats, who was unjustly accused and sent to the Belgrade prison.</p>
   <p>We specially claim an international investigation of police atrocities and control over dictatorial proceedings of law by which masses of innocent Croats were tortured and killed in prisons.</p>
   <p>L. Matanic, Chairman.</p>
