   <p>The oldest Croatian newspaper printed in America, Hrvatska, owned and edited by Mr. Matt Soyat for 23 years, has changed ownership and is now owned by Vjekoslav Meler, who will be its future editor and publisher.</p>
   <p>Up to the present time Hrvatska was printed in Calumet, Mich., where it will continue to have its office in the future, but it will be edited and managed from Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The purpose and the aim of the paper were expressed on its masthead: "The Weekly is dedicated to the political, economic and social culture of Croatians and Slovenians in America." Hrvatska is issued every Friday. Yearly subscription $3. Hrvatska, 1827 Blue Island Ave., Chicago. Address of publisher of Hrvatska: 313 6th St., Calumet, Mich.</p>
