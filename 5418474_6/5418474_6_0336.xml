   <p>Senator Carl Schurz will be glad to know that at least in the First Federal Revenue District of Illinois the reforms of the service has been inaugurated in quite an effective way by the removal of his brother-in-law Jussen from his office.</p>
   <p>Some seaks age we published a chart, showing that while under Jussen $100 of assessed taxes only $94 had been levied, under his successor this ratio has risen to $99.39 of each $200. Since then, a further improvement has taken place...</p>
   <p>These numbers are herewith respectfully offered to General Carl Schurz. As his unpartiality cannot be doubted they will enable him to say in his future speeches a few kindly words in favor of that civil service reform which evidently can be attained under the present system. As long as only the relationship to a distinguished statesman does not prevent the removal of an official. (Footnote-The Illinois Staats Zeitung, reprints this, like many other pieces <pb facs="5418474_6_0337.jpg" n="2"/>from various newspapers criticizing Schurz, without a word of comment (except occasionally underscoring disparagements). It is not clear if the Staats Zeitung extends its fued with the No. 1 German-American of the time to his brother-in-law, or if possibly Jussen, attracted this antagonism to the celebrated husband of his sister.)</p>
