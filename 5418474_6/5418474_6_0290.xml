   <p>The Inter-Ocean, in defending the retroactive pension payments, expresses the proper attitude. Instead of resorting to Logan's stentorian hurrahs for the Nation's defenders, to whom we are eternally indebted for the fact that the limitless pockets of people can never harbor enough money for adequate tips to our soldiers, this paper appeals to the impecunious civilians and asks: "Is not twenty-five or fifty million dollars a nice sum? Would it not infuse life into our shanties, if such a sum were to suddenly circulate in small trade channels? Would not all businesses prosper when several hundred thousand pensioners spend so and so many millions of dollars? After all, these veterans will not keep the money which came as an unexpected windfall; sooner or later the sum will be used to acquire more or less useful articles; this would bring money into circulation and revive trade. In short, more <pb facs="5418474_6_0291.jpg" n="2"/>money becomes available, and times will be better."</p>
   <p>Well, such blunt candidness in justifying the raid on the Treasury is preferable to Logan's exclamations. Now we have no sentimental whining about a "debt of gratitude" or the "duty and honor of the Nation toward its defenders, the upholders of liberty"; instead the sober opinion prevails. The United States has money, lots of it, or at least good credit; business, however, is in the doldrums and to improve it we must steer a few dozen millions in to trade currents. This might be accomplished by a war, with Mexico for instance; but as such a war is not in the offing at the moment, other means must be devised to put more money into circulation. For this purpose, the rotten swindle about "gratitude", the Nation's debt to its veterans, is just as suitable as any other. The main problem, regardless of pretext, about giving money to the people so that coin will roll about, still remains. This will be accomplished with the pension law, and it is beneficial; the and justifies the means.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0292.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Considered in this cynical manner, the pension law, in the main, is only a form of "state help" (as the Socialists desire it) for the improvement of economic conditions. What the paper dullards tried to attain in an awkward manner--since they overlooked the fact that the mere printing of additional money would not provide the essential circulation--will now be accomplished by more capable means, for twenty-five, fifty, or more millions of dollars are to be distributed gratuitously to individuals. Hell and its cohorts would have to conspire against us, if money so lavishly scattered would fail to achieve its purpose!</p>
   <p>Verily, nothing deregatory can be said about such logical reasoning. The average man to whom the good Lord suddenly gives a few hundred or a thousand dollars will be inclined to "squander" them promptly. Another question is: What will he do when the money is gone? In nine eases out of ten the recipient finds that suddenly acquired, unearned money will prove a curse rather than a blessing. Such windfallen money increases tremendously the yearning for luxury and inversely, and in an equal measure, destroys latent ambitions <pb facs="5418474_6_0293.jpg" n="4"/>for honest endeavor as well as the tendency to conserve one's possessions. An example of this on a gigantic scale is provided by Germany's cursed "billions of blessings". [Translator's note: This is a direct reference to the five billion francs, the indemnity which France paid to Germany, subsequent to the Franco-German War of 1870-71.] To a lesser degree we also observed how, during wartime, thousands of people obtained wealth effortlessly and dissipated it.</p>
   <p>The enactment of the retroactive pension law will produce similar results. A nice sum will reach the people, but at what price: At the cost of awakening that macronosia, the morbid greed for further fortunate gains and additional pillaging of the National Treasury on the strength of new miserable pretexts; in short, at the expense of a repeated, thoroughly confusing differentiation between rightful earnings and swindle, as well as new myalgic convulsions of the Country's economic life and national credit.</p>
   <p>And that is too high a price to pay, merely for giving a "nice sum of money" to the people.</p>
