   <p>The death of Heinrich Schneider, the well-known contractor from Chicago, has been reported in dispatches from Miami, Florida. Bonn, on the Rhein, was the place of his birth. He was born there in 1863, but came to this country as an immigrant nineteen years later. He selected Baltimore as his home, but Chicago seemed to call him. Finally, he settled in Norwood Park, a hamlet, which was incorporated in Chicago many years later.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schneider served this city more than forty years as a builder and contractor. Many of the city's constructions are a credit to his memory. Numerous buildings which were an ornamental addition to the World's Fair of 1893, were erected by that acknowledged talent.....Although his health was failing, his death came unexpectedly.</p>
