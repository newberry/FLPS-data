   <p>John L. Schneller, an old Turner (Gymnast) who died yesterday at his home, 615 N. Wells Street, will be burried tomorrow. He was 76 years old. Schneller, who was well known in Turner Circles and always took an active part in all German activities, is counted as one of the German pioneers. Born in Germany, he came to Chicago in 1871 where he was given employment as a baker, in which trade he was considered an expert. In later years he conducted the Olympia Hotel, 615 N. Wells Street, which was a meeting place of Germans of the lower North Side.</p>
   <p>One son, Melchior, and a daughter, Mrs. Mary Schafer, survive him. In addition to the Turgemeinde, the deceased belonged to a number of German societies.</p>
