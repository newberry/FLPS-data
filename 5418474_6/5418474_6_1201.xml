   <p>What Chicago German does not know the name of John Buehler Sr., the founder of this firm in which he has been the ruling spirit for more than a quarter of a century, a man who has shown his ability in public offices, and in private enterprise. He represents a solid banking business as well as a successful real estate company. His speculations brought him a large share of the profits, which were derived from the rapid rise of land values of the city. During the last years Mr. Buehler has obtained additional assistance from two capable and energetic gentlemen, his son, J. W. Buehler, and his son-in-law, Otto Peuser. The end of the recent fiscal year shows excellent results, proof of the effectiveness of the new combination.

In banking circles hard times have been experienced, reliable firms perished, others were partially shipwrecked, so that the crisis left its noticeable imprint even up to the present day. But Mr. Buehler's establishment knew no "retrogression", every year its boundary was enlarged and under its present able leadership, the new firm faces a still greater future. We mentioned that Mr. Buehler's</p>
