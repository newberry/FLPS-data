   <p>During the last few days a series of important transactions have been completed which involve nearly the entire Township of Bloom. A tract of 3,000 acres has been sold to a German syndicate; a number of manufacturing corporations have been formed for the development of this land; important railroad concessions have been secured from the three railroads centering at Bloom, and all the preliminary arrangements made for the removal of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois railroad shops and yards from Danville to a point within twenty-six miles of Chicago.</p>
   <p>James E. McElroy and Company, have sold the entire holding purchased by the Bloom syndicate last summer. The contract of sale calls for 3,400 acres at $260 an acre, or at an aggregate price of $884,000.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1187.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The purchaser is Albert T. Otto of Stuttgart, Germany. Mr. Otto is a member of a Stuttgart banking firm and is well known as a German promoter. He buys in the interest of a syndicate composed of Chicago as well as foreign capitalists....</p>
