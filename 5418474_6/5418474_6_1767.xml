   <p>According to information from her relatives, Mrs. Amalia Kussner Condert died in Montreux, where she has lived during the past few years. Mrs. Condert achieved great fame as a miniature painter during the Nineties. Born in Greencastle, Indiana, as the daughter of the prominent German musician Lorenz Kussner, she moved with her family to Chicago, where they lived on Cedar Street until the death of her father.</p>
   <p>The deceased received her education at the St. Mary of the Woods Academy.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Ogden Armour, a society leader, was the first to pose for her in a portrait. She was followed by other leaders of society in the East, as well as by the Czarina of Russia, in 1899. Others to pose for Mrs. Condert were Cecil Rhodes and King George VII, at that time the Prince of Wales.</p>
