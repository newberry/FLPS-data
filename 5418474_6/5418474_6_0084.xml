   <p>One of the greatest drawbacks of the democratic government system - very well, the greatest and one that cannot be denied by its most enthusiastic followers and admirers - is this: that it is so very hard in the republic to carry out pure economic reforms of national importance as soon as they signify a deviation from the customary and the traditional. In absolute monarchies, reform is ordered from above and the people must yield; it forms its judgement afterwards. In constitutional monarchies the government cannot act without the representative of the people, but also here its influence is strong enough to carry out the reform before the great majority of the people know what it is all about. In the pure democracy the people must first be instructed, the majority must become educated to the reform before any change can be undertaken.</p>
   <p>America learned much from Europe and especially Germany, and still has much to learn. But in no field is this so essential as in forest economy. This is for us German-Americans a particular satisfaction.</p>
