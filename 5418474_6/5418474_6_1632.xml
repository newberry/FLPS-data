<title level="a">CONCERT BY GERMANIA MANNERCHOR.</title></bibl>

   <p>A concert was given by the Germania Mannerchor at Germania Hall, Germania Place and North Clark Street last night. The feature of the evening was the appearance of Mrs. Werbke Burckard, prima donna of the Grand Opera at Cologne, who is making a six month tour of America. She arrived in Chicago yesterday.</p>
   <p>An elaborate program was rendered. There were many pleasant features, but the chief surprise came in an announcement during an intermission. Following the execution of a symphony composed by Prof. Henry Schoenefeld, director of the Mannerchor Orchestra, S. Wittemeyer stepped to the front of the stage and announced that their director had been most signally honored. In response to a request from Mrs. J.M. Thurber, the leading promoter of a prize competition of compositions by musicians of American birth before the National Conservatory of Music, Prof. Schoenefled had gone to New York and directed the execution of a symphony he had submitted. Mr. Wittemeyer's announcement that Prof. Schoenefeld had been awarded, the first prize of $500 for his symphony was greeted by a storm of applause.</p>

   <p>Many leading musicians and patrons of music were in attendance. The concert was followed by a full dress ball under the direction of S. Wittemeyer and Max Peters, Committee of Arrangements. Bronson Howard, it is understood, has said that he will prosecute William Horace Brown for defamation of character for the charge that he got his ideas for "Aristocracy" from Brown's "Coins and Coronets."</p>
