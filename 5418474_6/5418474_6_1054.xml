  <body>
   <p>The funeral of the former vice-president and manager of the trust department of the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company, Leon L. Loehr, will take place tomorrow afternoon in the family home, 415 South Park Avenue, where he died yesterday of a sudden heart attack. He was sixty-nine years old.</p>
   <p>Loehr was born in Bloomington, Illinois, and engaged in the practice of law. In 1900 he became manager of the trust department of the old Merchants Loan and Trust Company, and was later taken over in the same capacity by the Illinois Bank and Trust Company, when this bank, after its merger with the Illinois Trust and Savings Bank, combined with the Illinois Merchants Trust Company to form the largest bank in the Middle West.</p>
   <p>In 1931 Mr. Loehr retired, and after that time went on extensive trips. He is survived by his widow, two sisters, Mrs. George L. Knapp and Mrs. Laban A. Arnold, and a brother, Karl Loehr, who resides in River Forest.</p>
