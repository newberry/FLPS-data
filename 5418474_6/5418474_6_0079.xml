   <p>For the first time an American legislative body dared to introduce a law stipulating Workers insurance, whereby employers are held responsible for accidents to workers during working hours. This happened in the State of New York. What in this respect has been planned in the State of Illinois and the City of Chicago by the Liability Committee is nothing worthwhile. If a worker signs a certain form of a contract with his employer, renouncing his right to sue him for damages in case of an accident, then the employer is held liable to pay to such worker, or his heirs, a certain amount stipulated by that law. The worker is certain of this indemnity; it must be paid to him without further controversy in accordance with contract, and it is not necessary for him to carry on an expensive lawsuit. All this is well as far as it goes, but it is not going far enough. If, for any reason, the contract is not signed, everything remains as before. When the worker and the employer both are willing to sign, such a contract, no special law is necessary to enforce such a signature. When they are not willing to sign, either one or both of them, so they can not be forced to do so inspite of the special law. Such a lawiis useless basically.</p>

   <p>There should be no "if" in such cases. If the worker meets with an accident during his working hours and it is not caused by his own intentional misconduct, then he should be legally entitled to the indemnity without any further "ifs." Industry and commerce must replace its wornout and damaged machinery, why should they not be compelled to be responsible for workers in their respective places? Can such liability be placed upon the employer? Is such a procedure legitimate and constitutional? This is the chief question, which will determine everything else. If this question is once legally decided upon in the affirmative then it will be comparatively easy to introduce reform measures. Our deplorable, neglected and, compared with European countries, antiquated laws, for the protection of workers must be changed; their constitutionality affirmed and everything else would be a matter of time.</p>
   <p>But again and again, even until recently all such laws have been declared unconstitutional.</p>
