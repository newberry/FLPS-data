   <p>Max L. Teich, at present manager of the Jefferson Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, and co-owner of the well-known Hotel Atlantic, the old Kaiserhof, was born in 1873 in the principality of Greiz, Western Saxony, in southern Germany.</p>
   <p>After completing his primary school education, Teich attended the commercial school of Dresden, Saxony and subsequently became a bookkeeper in various mercantile houses in Dresden, Berlin, and Hamburg.</p>
   <p>He came to the United States in 1892 and settled in Chicago, Illinois. For eleven years he served as assistant manager of the Bismarck Hotel, until he and Carl Roessler were asked to take charge of the Congress Hotel.</p>
   <p>In 1902, Teich and Roessler opened the Atlantic Hotel; their untiring efforts <pb facs="5418474_6_1072.jpg" n="2"/>succeeded in making the institution very popular. When their business interests finally required expansion, Roessler and Teich bought the Jefferson Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri. The orginal building was greatly enlarged and newly appointed. Teich was put in charge of the flourishing enterprise.</p>
   <p>Teich married in 1896 and has two children, Fredrick and-Elizabeth. He is an active member of several clubs, among them the German Club. He is also a Freemason and is affiliated with the Art Institute and the Chicago Historical Society.</p>
