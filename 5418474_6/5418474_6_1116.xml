   <p>John F. Jelke, wealthy manufacturer of margarine who was sentenced in 1914 to two years imprisonment and fined $10,000, will have to serve only sixty days; for, according to a report from Washington, President Wilson mercifully shortened the time of punishment. Jelke had been sentenced because he had taught his dealers how to evade the tax on colored margarine. Francis Lowry, who had been convicted and sentenced with Jelke, also benefited by the President's clemency. Lowry's sentence was for one year and was changed to thirty days. He was fined $2,500.</p>
   <p>The local Federal court will determine at which penal institution the two men must serve their time. They have Attorney James H. Wilson, who was attorney for the Government when their case was prosecuted, and other officials who were connected with the case, to thank for the reduction of their punishment. The intercessors had asked the President to cancel the <pb facs="5418474_6_1117.jpg" n="2"/>entire prison sentence, but he was content with shortening it.</p>
   <p>According to the request for mercy, Jelke and Lowry had damaged their own case by failing to take the witness stand. The President's attention was called to the fact that they themselves did not secretly color margarine, but had merely encouraged "moonshiners" to do the "dirty work".</p>
