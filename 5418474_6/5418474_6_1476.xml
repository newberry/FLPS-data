   <p>Henry Hantke was born in Chicago. During his childhood he moved to Germany with his parents, and was reared in Hannover. He was still in his twenties when he returned to America. This makes him a real German-American who is familiar with both countries. Despite his youth he reveals a philosophical attitude--a resigned manner which may have been brought about through the fact that although his feet are in America, his heart is in Germany.</p>
   <p>Hantke is opposed to the art of the academic school. He attended the Art Institute for two semesters before he freed himself from all academic learning. This does not mean that he scorns theory. On the contrary, he is avid for information in theory, and does a great deal of reading on the literature of art. But he cannot be persuaded into malpractice. This he regards as his primary possession, he guards it carefully, as a rare gift. As much he has seen of the paintings of others, and as many pictures as may have thrilled <pb facs="5418474_6_1477.jpg" n="2"/>him or provoked him to criticism, not one particle of the work of others has been included in his own, regardless of the period to which they may have belonged. Just as it was his inner drive which prompted him to express his thoughts and emotions in pictures--no one ever persuaded him to become a painter--his form of expression is his own property.</p>
   <p>Hantke is a landscape artist. Whenever he receives an impression he elaborates on it, slowly, gradually, working it into a picture. His landscapes look very little like true landscapes. They are more like dream landscapes--groups of houses, trees, streets, hills, etc., shaped into form by a basic idea. It is not surprising therefore, that here and there the houses seem askew, and the thoroughfares crooked. It is thus that the painter wants it to be, it is thus that the lines borrowed from reality subordinate themselves to the picture and its meaning. In this manner Hantke's pictures are endowed with a touch of the metaphysical. They are not images of earthly originals, but purely ideal creations of a painter who seeks to grasp and solve in his pictures the higher meaning of all nature. Hantke is still young, but he takes his art <pb facs="5418474_6_1478.jpg" n="3"/>seriously. He is a sincere seeker, one who is determined to travel a road of his own, one who is never satisfied with himself. If his kind of artist were ever to stop seeking all art creation would lose its proper value and be reduced to the level of the work of artisans.</p>
   <p>The question of technique in painting is explained by Hantke in few words: It is unessential; every painter acquires the technique that suits him best. He did the same, and in doing so he did not even become linked with any of the more traditional methods of paintings; he changed and will continue changing.</p>
   <p>Color in his pictures is very important to him. Lines, for him, are of secondary value only. The combination of colors dominates the picture; it provides support, while the lines and the drawing are merely necessary mechanics. In keeping with the painter's resigned attitude, as mentioned previously, his pictures are obscure but serious, at times they even impress us as tragic. This, however, may be mitigated with the passing of time.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1479.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Hantke has often been represented in Chicago exhibitions at the Art Institute; likewise in the exhibitions of the No-Jury Society. This Spring he held an exhibition at the Little Gallery. There are also pictures of his at Increase Robinson, in Springfield, and were also shown in Michigan. As member of the Chicago Society of Artists he was represented at the annual exhibition of that society at the Knoedler Gallery. It will be of interest to every friend of art to follow the future development of this young artist.</p>
