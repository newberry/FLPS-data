   <p>Congressman William B. Wilson of Pennsylvania has offered to Congress a bill for the introduction of an old age pension, which is said to have been examined and accepted at the last annual convention at Toronto of the American Federation of Labor. The title of the proposition is original, "Organization of an Army Corps", which means the Old Home Guard of the United States of America. Any individual of either sex at the age of 65 years, is eligible. They must have lived in the States for 25 years and must have been a citizen for 15 years. Their property must not exceed $1,500, and their yearly income $240. Applications must be made to the Secretary of War and an annual compensation of $120 will be paid. No services are required. The whole proposition sounds like a bad and silly joke. It may be Mr. Wilson's excuse, that Congress by act of the Constitution is not empowered to grant any old age pensions, but may well organize Army Corps of any description.</p>

   <p>The question of old age pensions and the taking care of the unfortunates after a life's work is a question of time, and has to be solved sooner or later, but the question is too important to be solved by political trickery. It cannot be solved by evasion of the Constitution. If the latter stands in the way, the American public must find a way to amend the Constitution. A thorough investigation of the subject will have to be made. Public opinion will have be consulted; a discussion of all details of the Bill will have to precede its acceptance. We are sure that the results will be quite different from the present proposition offered by the Pennsylvania congressman. An old age pension should not be a dole. It is an insult to those who have served an industrial life to be classed together with the professional loafer.</p>

   <p>The American workman is entitled to a just recognition of his work and to be helped if he can't work any more. The self-respect of the individual has to be recognized, and an old age pension should be on a similar footing as in Germany. A difference should be made between the honest worker and a lazy sponger, who lives all his life at the cost of his neighbors.</p>
