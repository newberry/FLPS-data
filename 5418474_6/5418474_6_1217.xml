   <p>Newspaper publishers will undoubtedly be interested in John Simons' establishment, 88 Fifth Avenue (Times Building), where no less than 112 daily and weekly newspapers are printed, in part. The so-called patent insides of newspapers have been brought to such a high state of perfection by Mr. Simons that he successfully eliminated competition and the demand grew to such proportions that he frequently found it necessary to enlarge his establishment. Mr. Simons is not only very circumspect in the selection of reading material, but he uses the best of typographical equipment and makes prompt deliveries. His two steam-driven Potter printing presses are in operation day and night and twenty type setters are constantly at work. Highly experienced editors select articles of news value.</p>
   <p>John Simons' success in his chosen field is fully on a par with the greatest English firms and represents one of the German accomplishments in Chicago,</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1218.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>and his achievement is particularly gratifying to the Germans since Mr. Simons has eliminated all competition.</p>
