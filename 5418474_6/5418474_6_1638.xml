   <p>That the well known Music Director John Meinken knows how to sustain the public's favor, has been proven in yesterday's Concert and the large number of people present at Walsh's Hall, were fully convinced that Mr. Meinken was not only a tall, but also a great musician. He arranged a splendid program, which was brilliantly executed by the orchestra, consisting of 30 pieces. The vertures to "William Tell" and "Freischutz" (The Poacher) also the "Wedding March" by Mendelson, were the climax of the program.</p>
   <p>The greatest applause was given to the artists when they produced the grand military "Potpourri", Germany's memories of the War years 1870-71. After the concert,several hours were spent, dancing.</p>
