<title level="a">THE CONCERT BY THE CHICAGO ORCHESTRA</title></bibl>

   <p>The outstanding composition, rendered at last Saturday's concert by the Chicago Orchestra, was the "Rob Roy" overture by Hector Berlioz, composed in 1831. It was in 1833 that this work was first introduced to the Paris audiences.</p>
   <p>The composition was unfavorably received by the famous musical authority and critic, Mr. Fetis, who later became director of the Imperial Conservatory of Brussels. Berlioz, deeply hurt, withdrew his composition, indicating that he himself had destroyed the manuscript. But years after his death, the manuscript was found among his compositions, which when he died, had been placed in the archives of the Paris Conservatory. There it lay hidden for years. Some time ago, Charles Malherbe and Felix Weingartner revised the score.</p>
   <p>In this new form, the overture of "Rob Roy" was played last year in the <pb facs="5418474_6_1600.jpg" n="2"/>Crystal Palace in London, and another performance followed immediately, in Berlin.</p>
   <p>It was impossible for us, who heard the rendition of the composition Saturday night, to determine what prompted Fetis to criticize this work so severely. As a matter of fact, the overture was received by our concert audience with great enthusiasm. The rendition of it by the Chicago Orchestra was perfect in every detail. There are no words which could properly describe the brilliant playing of the English horn, by that great artist, Mr. Hesselbach. Saint Saens' A-moll concerto for violon-cello was the second number on the program. Regrettable is the fact that the concert audiences do not often get the opportunity to hear the soloist, Mr. Brueckner. He is an exquisite artist and a member of the orchestra; an accomplished master, he expresses musical understanding excellently through the medium of the strings, rendering the most difficult passages beautifully. Mr. Brueckner was rewarded by thunderous applause. He next offered "Kol Nidre," by Max Bruch, a <pb facs="5418474_6_1601.jpg" n="3"/>request number. Following this was Glazunow's "Sixth Symphony, Opus 58" played for the first time here. This is a composition of great beauty.....</p>
   <p>The Genoveva overture by Schumann and scenes from Orpheus by Gluck, did not find and especially appreciative audience. The concert came to a close with the playing of the prelude to the "Meistersinger."</p>
