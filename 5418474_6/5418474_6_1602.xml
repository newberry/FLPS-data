   <p>p. 5 - In Carl Sehnert who succumbed to a heart attack yesterday, Chicago has lost a man who, as a pioneer in German music, has been well known. Carl Sehnert was born in Ebeleben, Thuringia, in 1825. In his youth he already exhibited an extraordinary talent for music and soon enjoyed an excellent reputation among the best of musicians.</p>
   <p>He had a thorough theoretical education in music and was known as an excellent flutist. In the year 1849, during the time of the Baden revolution, he joined the army in Coblenz as oboe player and participated in the attack upon the Friedrich Hecker insurgents. It was a curious incident that later, as a resident of the United States,he joined the regiment of the same Hecker whom he once helped to drive out of Baden, and who was now fighting the rebels.</p>
   <p>Carl Sehnert came to America in the year 1851, choosing New York as his domicile. But it was not for long, because Messrs. Julius Dyhrenfurth, George Schneider, Thomas B. Bryan, and many other music lovers, induced him to come to Chicago, where he joined the "Tremont House Orchestra" under the leadership of Mr. Dyhrenfurth....</p>

   <p>When, in 1854, the "Freie Sangerbund" was founded, Sehnert became its manager. With the proceeds of a benefit concert, given in his honor in March, 1855, Sehnert laid the foundation for his real estate speculations. In 1869 he forsook art and his musical career to devote his time to real estate operations. Sehnert was also a member of the "Great Western Band," with which he joined Hecker's regiment, in the revolutionary war against the rebel forces.</p>
   <p>He was especially proud of one episode in his life. It was in the year 1855, during the regime of Mayor Boone, when the Know-Nothings felt highly important. To annoy and vex the German element was their daily program. One day, those one hundred percent Americans arranged for a parade, and hired Sehnert's orchestra for that occasion. Little they thought of the predicament they thus brought upon themselves.</p>
   <p>When Sehnert found out who it was that had engaged the services of his orchestra, he emphatically refused his assistance. Grateful and joyous over that patriotic exhibition, the German people hailed him, and he was carried away on the shoulders of a group of enthusiasts.</p>
