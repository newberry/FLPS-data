   <p>Authoritative warning to parents is issued repeatedly regarding the unwholesome practice of too heavy a task of seeking gainful employment on the part of our growing youth. Never before was the warning so intensive as it is at the present, because never before were children called upon to contribute toward the family income. The practice of encouraging children to seek employment is a special feature of parents of this country. In most families, persuasion is not necessary, since the inborn instinct is already developed in a boy when he is scarcely able to stand upon his feet.</p>
   <p>He too, like the average person, has developed an appreciation for money. Then came the long summer vacation which is putting a great strain on mothers in general.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0070.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Employment for those youngsters is preferable to loitering on streets--in her opinion--possibly in bad company. And now, inspired by the War "to do his bit"--a praiseworthy attitude indeed--it has increased this tendency still more.</p>
   <p>However, no objection could be raised against this ambition under the present circumstances, provided that other interests of this growing generation are not entirely eliminated. Parents, educators, and communities as well, must be on the alert, and prevent such eventualities. Work must not be hard, neither must working hours be too long. It would be well to bear in mind that these are the years of growth and preparation for the youth's future duties. The battle for existence becomes more acute from one year to another. Therefore, it stands to reason that only those who are in possession of robust health, fortified by a reasonable quantity of knowledge will be able to emerge <pb facs="5418474_6_0071.jpg" n="3"/>victoriously. Both must be acquired before maturity. Physical or mental overwork may result in disaster..... Overwork and its bad consequences seldom appear immediately, but when it does show up, the damage done is sometimes irreparable.</p>
   <p>Many parents are utterly devoid of understanding. Thus, for instance, many a mother insists that her offspring keep busy all day long--which is the height of nonsense. It is common knowledge that normal development requires freedom of will and freedom of movement. Everyone knows from his own experience the difference of sentiment toward work when performed of one's own free will and when performed under pressure. Adults very seldom dwell upon business matters during hours of recreation. They feel the urge for a diversion of thoughts in contrast to their task.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0072.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>How about children who have no occupation, but are inspired by their elders' hunger for some liberal divertisement suited to their strength? Youngsters will probably use up their surplus energy in some form of play, which is, after all, as beneficial as sleep, or as nourishing as food.</p>
   <p>In recalling the past, one envisions the glorious time spent at play with one's companions. It is, therefore, folly to begrudge the youngsters the most natural desire--play. Youngsters deprived of childhood life develop into serious, materialistic, yes, very frequently into embittered, ill-tempered persons, generally calling no one their friend. It cannot be perceived that any mother wishes her children such a lot. If children must work, ample time for play should be provided, even at the risk of a decreased family income.</p>
