   <p>It is now ten years ago, that the German Government adopted an Insurance law, which made sick and accident benefits, also the old age pension legal. In order to guarantee the functions and obligations of this tremendous insurance-system, the necessary funds have to be supplied in equal shares by the Government, Employers and Employees.</p>
   <p>The value of these equal shares is represented by stamps, which are pasted every week or every month on work cards, and which this way are giving at the same time continuous time record of the employees.</p>
   <p>During the last ten years, 437,500,000 mark have been paid in, to keep this card-system with its threefold-effective benefits going. Commerce and industry have been kicking viciously at the beginning about the financial burdens of this government-insurance law. But the German people itself, which has been fighting for the said law through its labor-leaders ceaselessly and successfully, is proud to-day of the achievement, which has proved to be a blessing for the safe existence and home-life of the German workers</p>
