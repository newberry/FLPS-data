   <p>Chicagoans were reminded once before of certain inconveniences, one of which made itself quite noticeable during the recent heat wave. However justified public complaints may have been during the past years, the difficulties are nevertheless not easily dealt with. One of the outstanding grievances is our water supply, and since it is a menace to public health, it would behoove our city administration to take more interest toward the elimination of that evil, Chicago's water is scarcely drinkable during summer months, and for no plausible reason. Lake Michigan should supply us with clear, cool water during summer, as well as during the winter, but from past experiences we know it is not so.</p>
   <p>A thorough investigation of this condition and the solution thereof is a task for experts. One thing is certain; namely, that officials in charge of the Chicago water department deserve, indeed, no compliments for the <pb facs="5418474_6_0881.jpg" n="2"/>quality of water available to Chicagoans. Of course, there is a counter argument whereby the fault is laid to the public who is reckless in its consumption. Should the decrease of the quality of our water supply be due to the quantity used, the remedy is not difficult, since the installment of new water meters has been already proposed. But the fault most probably lies with the administrative system itself, in which case, two possible factors must be considered: either the crib is too close to the shore, or the pipes are not adequate. Every one knows that Chicago's drinking water is anything but palatable during the summer months, and other seasons as well. This, however, may originate at the waterworks where preventatives are used to safeguard sanitation.</p>
   <p>Chicago and her many suburbs border for miles on the shores of Lake Michigan, and diverse polution reaches the Lake directly and indirectly. The general assumption is that water filters itself within a short distance from the shore, thereby resuming its purity as if filtered.</p>
   <p>This theory may be basically correct, but there is no rule without an <pb facs="5418474_6_0882.jpg" n="3"/>exception. Our drinking water is so cloudy at times that its use becomes objectionable. If a storm agitates the water at its intake so much so that the water drawn leaves slimy deposits on the rim of a vessel or a glass, it appears plausible that this unappetizing waste from the shores reaches the point of intake. This indicates only one thing; namely, that the crib is not in the right location, and should be moved further toward the middle of the Lake. If the opinion of experts remains still unchanged, thus considering the crib far enough from the shore, then there remains only one other cause for the periodical distasteful water supply, and that is the inadequate pipe system. This last mentioned possibility of water pollution contains less glory than the possibility of the crib being too close to the shore.</p>
   <p>The annual expenditures of our city administration is enormous. Street cleaning, safeguarding the health of its citizens, their homes and places of business, as well as physical welfare--through the medium of the Health Department--are included in this expenditure. It would be nothing more <pb facs="5418474_6_0883.jpg" n="4"/>than fair to supply Chicagoans with palatable drinking water. Other cities have it. Why then should Chicago--one of the largest cities in the world--not afford to have good water supply, especially, since we possess in Lake Michigan--also one of the largest lakes in the world--an inexhaustible pure water reservoir.</p>
