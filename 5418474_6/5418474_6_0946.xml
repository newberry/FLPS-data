   <p>Professor James Hatfield, founder and director of the German Department of the Northwestern University, was last night a guest of honor at a banquet held at the Georgian Hotel, Evanston, to celebrate his 70th birthday.</p>
   <p>The professor was presented by the German Department with a portrait of himself, which had been painted by the German artist Johannes Walleer, and which will later find a lasting abode in the library of the University.</p>
   <p>The University librarian, Theo Koch, presided at the banquet. Speeches were made by the rector of the University, Dr. Scott, and by Professors Hihhard, Holdate, and Curme. Professor Curme has been for almost 36 years a co-worker of Professor <pb facs="5418474_6_0947.jpg" n="2"/>Hatfield in the faculty of the German Department.</p>
   <p>The board of directors of the University presented Professor Hatfield with a memorandum in which his endeavors and merits as a pedagogue are expressed in a fitting manner. Among those participating in the banquet were Mr. Schueller, the German Consul; Mr. M. Girten, the Austiran Consul-General; Dr. Otto Schmidt; Frederick Stock, conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra; and Professor Aaron, director of the German Department of the University of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Professor Hatfield founded the German Department of the Northwestern University forty two years ago, and has been its director ever since.</p>
