  <body>
   <p>The German industry on the North Side makes more progress constantly. Few of our readers probably know that the north side is the distribution center for a part of the expensive musical instruments, which are offered in the pompous stores of the city at extravagant prices. The watchmaker, F. Wild, a German staying at 190 N Clark Street, is the man into whose hands come all the magnificent musical instruments which are sold to the west through New York importers. He examines and tunes them and puts them into the condition in which they were before the long trip. Mr. Wild, who has an extensive musical knowledge, worked for a long time in St. Croix, Swizerland, and he is the only one in Chicago who understands how to repair instruments, of which a single one often costs $2,000.00. Over 300 of these expensive instruments have been repaired in his store, since his short stay in Chicago. Had sickness not kept him away from his business he undoubtedly would have his own workshop, where he could make his own instruments. We hope that he soon will be able do this.</p>
