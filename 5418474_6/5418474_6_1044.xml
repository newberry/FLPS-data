   <p>A meeting yesterday at the house of the German Society elected Mr. Schutt ita chairman; Mr. Roos, secretary. Mr. Heilmann, who really had brought together the meeting, made a speech in which he explained by an analysis of the aims and purposes of the North American Teachers' Association (the speaker was not a Chicagoan but editor of the paper of this association) what should be the basis of a teachers' or school society. He pointed particularly to three points of the program of the Teachers' Association: 1. Cultivation of the German language, art and literature - 2. Introduction of progressive methods into the American schools - 3. Safeguarding the interests of the German-American teachers.</p>
   <p>What he said about the German-American teachers was particularly worthy of note. He said many of them who have taught in German schools in America for years, are German but not German-American teachers. They are acquainted neither with the language, nor with the history of this country. The German-American school is very different from the German school. To point out only one difference - the relationship to government and religion is quite different <pb facs="5418474_6_1045.jpg" n="2"/>from Germany, and as it exercises a determining influence on the educational system, the teacher who does not know it is hardly fully qualified for his profession. The speaker then turned to the public schools, - the growth and flourishing of which must be dear to the heart of the German-American teacher, too. It is especially to be desired that the military discipline in those schools be completely abolished, and that a purely rational ethical doctrine be introduced.</p>
   <p>Of course, the speaker finally said, he could not expect that everybody would immediately subscribe to these fundamental principles, but one thing could and should be done - the creation of a society that should work in the direction of these principles.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hansen urged that the society should give itself a broader field to work on by admitting not only teachers, but friends of the school and of public education. In this sense, he moved that the new society should take the name of "German School Society of Chicago."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1046.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The meeting appointed a committee that will prepare the nomination of permanent officials and work out a constitution. We repeat that one of the essential conditions of success is the election of good officials, that one should not name to a committee people who have already done so much dirty work that to do any clean piece of work has become to them a rank impossibility. (Footnote: The Staats Zeitung here is undoubtedly pointing to some pet aversion among the prominent Germans or German teachers).</p>
   <p>Among those present we saw Dr. Chronik, Julius Rosenthal, Dr. Hansen, Lindau, Schaffranek, and others.</p>
