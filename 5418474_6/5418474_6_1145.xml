   <p>Due to the steady growth of our business established in the year 1855 and out of consideration for our customers, we have reconstructed this institution into a State Bank &amp; Trust Company, to be henceforth known as the "Greenebaum Sons Bank &amp; Trust Company." This bank has fully complied with the legal banking requirements of Illinois. The bank has a capital of $1,500,000 .

We extend a cordial invitation to our customers to take advantage of the facilities offered by our new bank department.

Legitimate business and banking methods will be pursued in the future as they have been in the past.</p>
