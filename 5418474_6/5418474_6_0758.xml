   <p>The Illinois Staats-Zeitung has made it its task to procure the opinions of women on the Suffrage Movement and to publish them in its paper. Our reporter had occasion to interview yesterday the following ladies:-</p>
   <p>Mrs. B. Baumann, 5320 Indiana Avenue: "In the next generation, America will be a Republic of women and I cannot see why it should not be that way. That women are suited for reigning has been proved by more than one, and many a man became great and famous only through his wife. The men owe their preeminence only to their greater bodily strength, and the less this becomes a deciding factor the more they will be pushed to the background. Therefore, it will be a natural movement that they retire from the Government. In the fight for existence, man will be forced to work harder znd harder to feed his wife and children. His entire activity will concentrate more on the physical and woman will be found at the University and at the Lecture Hall, for education will be turned over to women by that time. Thus will be executed by itself what I have prophesied for the next generation and about which we now smile. As I said before, the dominion of man is only a remaant of <pb facs="5418474_6_0759.jpg" n="2"/>barbarism. The farther back we go, the more easy man has made it for himself at the cost of his wife. With very few exceptions, women were up to this day only slaves, degraded toys of man. That this must be changed is clear to everyone, and it has already changed, but not enough."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Abe Pfaeltzer, 5017 Grand Boulevard expresses the following opinion: "In my opinion it would have been more sad if the women had not received the privilege of voting. The question whether we should vote is solved. In this short period the women have proved sufficiently that their talents are just as great as those of men. Women-suffrage is yet still in its infancy and on account of this I do not believe it wise that they should apply for public offices. Women Suffrage brings material into the house for entertainment between man and children. We talk about things at home now about which we never spoke before. Women are also better able to manage their household after they hear the opinions of all the able, wise women."</p>
   <p>A highly educated, very prominent German housewife and mother, who does not want her name to be mentioned, expressed herself as follows: "I feel sorry for the <pb facs="5418474_6_0760.jpg" n="3"/>woman of today! Whence did we come? We go backward, slowly but surely. The way of the woman led astray with the hour when Dunne signed the suffrage bill. The woman loses everything she had gained. The married life goes backward; obligations do not exist any more and this they call higher civilization! Marriage must be childless for the wife cannot be mother any more, and when children arrive in spite of this they become neglected and our public institutions receive new inmates. Then comes the expense question. "The eye of the Lord feeds the horses!" But how will it look when the wife is never at home, if she must leave everything go or leave everything in charge of servants? The result will be disunion, and quarreling with her husband. He goes to the saloon etc. There is no more home, the marriage ends in divorce. When I see a woman stand at the platform and hear her babble her nonsense my mind comes to a standstill. Either she is no woman or she is a liar. A man is a born idler. If the woman is now doing everything that he has since done he will not get excited about it. He will sit down and smoke his pipe. But the woman will get closer and closer to the rank to which the Indian woman belonged, and I do not need to be a prophet to prophesy that in fifty years there will be not more Americans than we now have Indians, for they will die out.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0761.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>What good is a discussion here or an explanation? It is an attempt to swim against the current; and for telling the truth people have already been hanged. If I am told, 'the woman is the equal of the man,' I say "No, emphatically No". The woman is of an entirely different construction than the man. It is the destiny of the woman to create the home and the woman is for the home what the sun is for the Spring. The man's destination is to go out, to produce, to create, to dispute, to fight. There is something in a woman which can be called intuition and this the man does not possess. In this the man should subordinate himself to the woman. This intuition refers to education perhaps school etc and here the judgement of a woman is more dependable than that of a man. But when it comes to politics, it is not any more intuition, but opinion."</p>
   <p>Mrs. George Vosbrick, member of the School Board and President of the Democratic Women's League declares: "I believe in the right of voting for women. I believe that the woman after she received the right to vote must possess the right completely. I absolutely do not agree with the women who want to obtain <pb facs="5418474_6_0762.jpg" n="5"/>the offices held by men, because women are new in politics and therefore without experience. I am convinced that the woman entitled to vote will accomplish many good reforms in the home, in the school and in labor conditions. Because the woman is the best housekeeper she will also bring to order the political household. The man should be glad for the assistance of the woman, because the man has no eye for details and just those details play a great part in attaining perfection."</p>
