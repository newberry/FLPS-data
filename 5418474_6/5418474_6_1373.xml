  <body>
   <p>One of the co-founders of the Bankrupt State Savings Institution is Georg Schneider, whose name alone was sufficient to give the Germans faith in this bank, even after Mr. Schneider withdrew his own capital ($95,000.00) from the bank, seven years ago.</p>
   <p>People with small savings were hit very hard. This bank was in difficulties several years ago and it was the Illinois Staats Zeitung which gave the warning then, but other banks came to its rescue and thus it was able to continue, and anybody who would question its solvency was considered an evil-doer. It was Georg Schneider and the newspaper, which depends on his reports on banks, who knew the truth about it. But he kept silent and the people kept faith in the bank.</p>
