   <p>A new business has been founded in the midst of one of our most populous wards, and is bound to give an impetus to trade in that locality. We refer to Franz Walther's brewery, which started operations recently. The establishment is situated at the corner of Paulina and Augusta Streets, in close proximity to the 14th ward's great business artery, Milwaukee Avenue. The inhabitants of that district may indeed be proud of that attainment. Mr. Walther's product is comparable with the best output of any brewery. Mr. Walther has ample experience; he was a brewmaster in some of our largest local breweries for years, and this experience enables him to create the finest product which can be concocted from the highest grade of malt and barley. That he does just that is shown by the great popularity which his beer already enjoys wherever it is on tap. Go, for instance, to J. Geneser's, corner Chicago and Milwaukee Avenues, or to C. Mueller's on Canal Street, near Madison Street, where the beer is available--always fresh, and served at the proper temperature--and convince yourself.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1327.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The brewery has the most modern equipment, and while it is not as large as some of the other establishments in our city, Mr. Walther has proved that he is a master in his profession and, considering the auspicious beginning of his new venture, he will soon be forced to expand his plant.</p>
