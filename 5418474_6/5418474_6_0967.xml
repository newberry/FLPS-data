   <p>In the "Crystal" room of the Hotel Sherman a large number of Aesculapian disciples (medical students) assembled with their ladies to attend a banquet and ball of the "Medical Society" of Chocago. The room was filled with many of the most prominent German physicians of Chicago, and, the ladies in their brilliant dresses formed a charming contrast with the black tail coats of the serious minded saviors of suffering humanity. The first part of the festival was devoted to music and the solo numbers were mostly executed by the wives of the physicians present. A beautiful duet from the opera, "Der Freischutz", opened the program, sung by Mrs. (Dr.) Holinger and Mrs. (Dr.) Strauch, who with their beautiful voices and splendid execution, enthused the audience. They were accompanied on the piano in a very effective manner by Mrs. (Dr.) Abele. Just as excellent were the piano recitals, of Miss F. Hamish, who played a "Hungarian Etude" and "Valse Fantasie". Mrs. (Dr.) Welcker received also great applause with the songs: "Sylvia", slumber song, and "My Fancy". She possesses a strong well trained voice with a forceful delivery.</p>
