   <p>Discrimination against American hogs by various European governments has been on the daily order for more than a year. Notwithstanding this fact, Mr. Blaine, of the Department of Foreign Relations, did not undertake to correct this outrage. ... Propaganda against trichina-afflicted hogs raised in this country is the simplest way to curb the competition faced by European packers. This is the opinion of our consuls abroad. False impressions have been made in order to achieve that distinction. The American hog market has been boycotted because of trichinosis. However, it is almost beyond doubt that the diseased animals are a product of Germany and France.</p>
   <p>Our Department of Foreign Affairs has ordered an investigation of conditions of hogs and slaughter-houses in the western part of the country, including Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Mr. Michael Scanlan is in charge of the investigation. The investigation disclosed that the so-called <pb facs="5418474_6_0896.jpg" n="2"/>hog cholera, causing so much controversy in Europe, is a condition of a light nature, found in young pigs only. Furthermore, seven to ten per cent of the afflicted animals succumb to the disease long before they reach the market stage. Mr. Scanlan reported further that the Chicago slaughter-houses only accept 100 per cent healthy hogs. Hogs that die as the result of Trichina are disposed of and only the fat, from which oils and other lubricants are prepared, is retained for use. It would be absurd to intimate that they could be used for food because the stench alone would tell the tale. Trichinosis has been almost conquered in the West, where large quantities of pork are consumed. Statistics show that of the 40,000 deaths which occurred in Chicago during a period of four years, only two were attributed to eating diseased pork. This is an official statement made by Mr. Scanlan, whose investigation of the hog question was thorough and to the satisfaction of all concerned. It is evident, however, that Mr. Blaine, in making the results of the investigation known in Europe,feels that he has performed his duty to the fullest extent. This attitude <pb facs="5418474_6_0897.jpg" n="3"/>indicates one thing; namely, that he does not attach much significance to the most important branch of industry in this country. His is a plain case of kindhearted naivete, to say the least.</p>
   <p>The European opponents of the import of American pork do not wish to be convinced of the healthy state of our hogs. If they were to accept the statement, it would open the market for our pork abroad, and this they try to prevent. Thus, it is in their interest to ignore the findings of our investigators, which were published by order of our Secretary of State. ...</p>
   <p>Although it may seem strange, nevertheless it is true that Mr. Blaine could have chosen a more successful course in dealing with this matter. It would have been much wiser if he had ordered a commission, composed of chemists, make an investigation of French and German adulterated wines detrimental to health. Also an investigation of yard goods and toys imported from those countries, for the poisonous substances contained in the dyes used in them, endanger the health <pb facs="5418474_6_0898.jpg" n="4"/>and even the life of the individual. "Such procedure would have accomplished much more in the interest of export of pork, than did the slaughter-house investigation conducted by Mr. Scanlan. Such a course would have produced the expected reaction, indicating America is well equipped to meet its opponents. Safeguarding the public health was the pretext from which our hog export suffered. The United States is in a position to fight back and it is determined to do so."</p>
   <p>It is the only course open to rehabilitate our hog export to Europe. Inasmuch as our State Department prefers to plead with Europe in behalf of the import of American pork rather than to insist upon justice, the present state of affairs will probably remain unchanged.</p>
