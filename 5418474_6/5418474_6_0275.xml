   <p>Christian Meyer, Socialist of Chicago, offered a bill in the Illinois legislature to repeal the present law which sanctions arrest and jail imprisonment not only of known loafers, but of all unfortunates found sleeping in sheds or under the bare sky. Ranney (Republican of Woodford County) made a motion to reject the bill.</p>
   <p>Meyer opened the debate. He said, in substance, that he did not consider it a crime to be poor and unemployed; that the present vagrancy law regarded the unfortunate unemployed class as a criminal element, and that therefore, in his opinion, the existing statute should be abolished.</p>
   <p>Crooker (Republican, La Salle County)....considered the existing law a necessity....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0276.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Trusdell (Democrat, Lee County) favored Meyer's bill and declared: "No legislature has a right to impose a jail sentence upon a poor man, merely because he is poor. If a person is destitute and cannot afford a bed, then he must sleep unsheltered, on the bare ground, with heaven serving as a blanket, and we should not accuse such a one of having thereby committed a crime."</p>
   <p>The first speaker's contention was upheld by Carl Ehrhardt (Socialist of Chicago), who proclaimed that the present law was an infamy.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The omitted paragraphs contain views of various representatives, non-Germans, from Illinois counties.]</p>
   <p>....Wentworth (Chicago Democrat) moved to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs. His motion was defeated, and Ranney's motion to reject Meyer's bill was carried by a large majority.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0277.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>[The editor's comment now follows:]</p>
   <p>It seems that a bill eliminating some of the objectionable features of the present law will probably be passed; only the repeal of the entire law was strenuously objected to by the majority of the House.</p>
