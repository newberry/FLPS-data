   <p>Thousands of Chicagoans, especially those of German decent, will receive the news of Nicholas Dreher's demise with sympathy that comes from the heart; the tired old man closed his eyes in eternal slumber at the Alexian Brothers Hospital. A life at once active and useful came to an end with his passing.</p>
   <p>He was born in 1844 in St. Wendel near Oberlinxweiler, a province of the Rhine. When he was four years old, his parents brought him to Chicago. The family started their journey on June 29, 1848, and three months later, after much tedious traveling, they alighted at the foot of Franklin Street from the trawler that brought them from Buffalo.</p>
   <p>At the corner of Harrison and Jefferson Streets, his parents built a modest home, and there the boy grew up. He first went to St. Peter's School, at the <pb facs="5418474_6_0964.jpg" n="2"/>corner of Washington and Wells Streets, then to the school of Reverend Weikampf, who founded it in 1853 under the name of the School of St. Francis. Later, he went to the Foster School, at that time in charge of George Spofford, and then to a more advanced school founded by the Jesuit Fathers. Since 1862 he has been a teacher in German-Catholic parochial schools. An idealistic outlook upon life led him to devote himself to this profession. That so many people strayed from the right path he attributed largely to ignorance and superficial faith, and so he wanted, so far as his strength permitted, to become a saver of souls.</p>
   <p>He was first put in charge of a parochial school in Blackpartridge, Illinois; then, in the same year, he was called to the newly founded branch school of the St. Joseph Parochial School, on Chicago Avenue and Carpenter Street. Two years later he was called to the St. Joseph main school as soon as it was built on Chicago Avenue and Cass Street. After a brief interlude of activity in Collegeville, Minnesota, he was put in charge of St. Peter's School, corner of Clark and Polk Streets, whose rector was Vicar-General Fisher. In 1870, he returned to St. Joseph's School, and, after the great fire, he received the <pb facs="5418474_6_0965.jpg" n="3"/>assignment to aid in founding a German-Catholic parish and school in Pekin, Illinois. He succeeded and came back to St. Peter's School. But as the new school building of the St. Joseph parish, corner Hill and Franklin Streets, was ready, he took over the advanced classes for boys. And here he was active until he celebrated his fiftieth anniversary as a teacher in May 1912. This gave the occasion to many, as they still remember, to offer him heartfelt honors. Since then he has enjoyed a quiet old age.</p>
   <p>Burial will take place....at 9:30 A.M.</p>
