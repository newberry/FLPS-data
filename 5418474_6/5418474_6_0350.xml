  <body>
   <p>The election of Mr. Joachim Kersten as president, and Mr. Leonhardt Lamberts as secretary, completed the organization of the meeting. Dr. Schmidt, the first speaker, offered much interesting information concerning the Missouri campaign, with which he is familiar from personal observation. He also spoke on the noble deeds of General Lyon and the shameful treatment which he received at the hands of the Government. Later we shall comment on Dr. Schmidt's revelations concerning Lyons and the Administration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Heinrich Greenbaum was the second speaker. This champion of "Douglas Democracy" proved that constitutional guarantees for slavery are no longer the issue in the present War, and that total abolition of slavery is now the bone of contention. Mr. Greenbaum offered logical reasons for his new political view and, since he dared to renounce the viewpoint <pb facs="5418474_6_0351.jpg" n="2"/>to which he had heretofore adhered, and proceeded to defend the platform of human rights, he was loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>The third speaker, Mr. Wilhelm Rapp, cited events which occured in the border slave states to prove that slavery is the fundamental cause of the War and that permanent harmony and peace cannot be restored until slavery has been abolished. He protested against President Lincoln's mutilation of Fremont's emancipation proclamation, but said that although this act was extremely objectionable he nevertheless urged everybody to support the Chief Executive in the fight against slavery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wentworth, the fourth man to address the assembly, made use of his inherent sense of humor and his brilliant gift of satire to defend the Pathfinder and his proclamation. In the course of his address Mr. Wentworth also referred to the bank issue, and of course numerous sharp blows were dealt to wildcat banks. "Long John" declared that he would soon arrange a meeting to discuss the bank situation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0352.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He was followed on the speakers' platform by Mr. Theodor Hielscher, who severely criticized the Administration for its many military and political blunders.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were proposed by Mr. Wilhelm Rapp and were unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>1) Resolved, That we are convinced that the slavery existing in the Southern States of the Union is the cause of the present war, and that peace and the Union cannot be restored unless this infamous institution is completely abolished.</p>
   <p>2) Resolved, That we heartily approve of General Fremont's proclamation of August 30, for we believe slavery will receive the death blow if the provisions of that proclamation are strictly enforced.</p>
   <p>3) Resolved, That we deeply regret and disapprove of President Lincoln's <pb facs="5418474_6_0353.jpg" n="4"/>mutilation of Fremont's proclamation, since the act of the Chief Executive tends to encourage rebellion and slavery.</p>
   <p>4) Resolved, That we support the administration in its battle against the Rebels as much as we can, but we request that the war be prosecuted with more vigor and less consideration.</p>
   <p>5) Resolved, That we ask our representatives in Congress to enact Fremont's proclamation and to make it applicable to all Rebels.</p>
   <p>Joachim Kersten, President,</p>
   <p>Leonhardt Lamberts, Secretaty.</p>
