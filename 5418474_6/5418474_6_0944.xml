  <body>
   <p>Dr. Berthold Laufer, curator of the Field Museum, and one of the most prominent anthropologists and ethnologists in the country, jumped or fell, early this morning, from an upper floor of the Chicago Beach Hotel, 1660 Hyde Park Boulevard, and struck the roof of a second-story veranda.</p>
   <p>Dr. Laufer's wife told the police that her husband had been ill for some time, and had not yet recovered from an operation, which he had had a month before. She believes that her husband became dizzy on the fire escape of the hotel, and fell.</p>
   <p>Dr. Laufer was born in Cologne, and was sixty years old. He studied at the Universities of Berlin and Leipzig and also completed the seminar for oriental languages in Berlin. He arrived in the United States in 1898, and ten years later came to Chicago, to take over a responsible position in the Field Museum.</p>
