   <p>Rudolph Weisenborn was born in Chicago, the son of German parents, and completed his art studies in Denver, Colorado. After five years of painting under Henry Reed and two more under Gene Manheim, he returned to Chicago in 1913, where he became known for his ideas and founded the No-Jury Society, of which he was the president for five years. Even to this day he is represented regularly at the No-Jury Society exhibitions. His paintings can also be found during exhibitions at the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>In 1928, at the great American Art show, he exhibited and abstract painting which was supposed to represent the Metropolis of Chicago. This painting does not follow any form or line, but is absolutely abstract in its execution. At that time it caused considerable sensation and Weisenborn was honorably mentioned by the No-Jury.</p>
   <p>His first exhibition was held several years ago, at Marshall Field's; the <pb facs="5418474_6_1766.jpg" n="2"/>second two years ago, at Chester Johnson's.</p>
   <p>In his teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts, he does not strive to create new Weisenborns; on the contrary, he does his best to develop the individual talents of his pupils and admonishes them to go their own way as early as possible. He himself has been studying all his life, as he smilingly remarked, meaning that he works unceasingly to improve himself. At the present time he spends much time over the several paintings which will represent the expression of the spirit of the ages. This is all he is willing to talk about, as he does not want to commit himself until the idea for the new work is completely ripe. Then brush and pallet will do the rest by themselves. That is the Rudolph Weisenborn way, a way free of all obligations in regard to art creations.</p>
