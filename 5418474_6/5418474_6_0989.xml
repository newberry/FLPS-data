   <p>In our neighboring city,Milwankee, there will be held from July 5 to 9th the annual convention of the "National Educational Association", with which a National German Teacher's day is going to be combined. On this occasion, the presidency of the German-American Teachers Association, issued the following appeal, to the members of the Union, and to all friends of German educational methods in the United States:" In accordance with the resolution, passed at the Teacher's Convention in Buffalo, the 27th annual meeting of the national German-American Teachers Union will be held in Milwaukee on the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th of July." At the same time and at the same place "The National Educational Association" held its meeting. The beautiful city on Lake Michigan, will, on the days mentioned, become the meeting place for thousands of teachers and friends of education from all parts of the country. Should this circumstance not be sufficient, to induce every member of the German-American Teacher's Union to attend the next meeting of the Teachers day? It ought to be our holy duty, to prove, that in the tree planted 27 years ago, there <pb facs="5418474_6_0990.jpg" n="2"/>is enough sap left to bring forth splendid fruit," Milwankee, will not deny its good name as a festival city this year. The names of the men, who as representatives of the German-American citizens of Milwaukee, signed the invitation, is a guarantee, that the visitors of the Teachers' Day will be offered a hearty hospitality.</p>
   <p>To the entire German-American Teachers' Society, to all who desire to cooperate for the maintenance and dissemination of the German language and a healthy, sensible education, this appeal is made to be present at the 27th Teachers' Day. No town, no school, where German is taught, should fail to be represented on this occasion.</p>
