  <body>
   <p>Unfortunately Mr. Charles Kellermann did not recover from the stroke which he suffered last Tuesday. The entire right side of his body was paralyzed, he lost his faculties of sight and speech, and his condition steadily became worse until death relieved him of his suffering.</p>
   <p>Kellermann, who was fifty-seven years old, was born in Chicago, and lived here his entire life. His parents were born in Germany, and he was reared in what at that time was a German neighborhood. He faithfully adhered to German traditions and took an active interest in the work of local German societies He was a member of the Liedertafel Vorwaerts (Progressive Choral Club), which made him an honorary member after he had served the organization as its president for many years. The society will render a vocal selection at his funeral.</p>
   <p>Kellermann was always a strong advocate of personal freedom. Therefore he <pb facs="5418474_6_1119.jpg" n="2"/>was very prominent in the Verbuendete Vereine Fuer Oertiliche Selbstregierung (Allied Societies For Local Self-Government), which elected him to their presidency several times. He was also a member of their election board for some time.</p>
   <p>The deceased was the proprietor of a foundry. He is survived by his wife, Anna, nee Schillo, two daughters, Ruth and Annette, one brother, and two sisters.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be held Wednesday afternoon from the late residence of the deceased, at 3153 Cambridge Avenue, and then at the Chapel of Graceland Cemetery, under the auspices of Welfare Lodge, A. F. &amp; A. M., at 3:30 P.M.</p>
