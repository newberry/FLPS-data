   <p>President Harrison pointed out in his recent message, in which he referred to the New Orlean's lynching, that something must be done to remedy, to a certain degree at least, the complete impotency of the United States to punish crimes which are committed in this country against citizens of other countries.</p>
   <p>The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, presided over by John Sherman and assisted by eminent men such as the Republican Davis of Minnesota, and the Democrat Butler of South Carolina, reported the recommendation of the following: "An offense or a crime against a subject of a foreign power or a citizen of an alien country, which is committed in one of the states or a territory of the Union and which violates the granted rights of such a citizen, shall be considered an offense or a crime against the United States. Such cases shall be prosecuted by a United States court, and the criminals punished in accordance with the regulations of the federal penal code. II.</p>
   <p>Of course, such a law does not positively warrant that such criminals will be adequately punished. The criminal courts of the United States are likewise courts of juries. Who believes that a number of jurors could have been found in Louisiana who would have found a single one of the criminals guilty of murdering the <pb facs="5418474_6_0166.jpg" n="2"/>Sicilians? But we will not discuss this case any longer.</p>
   <p>It must be conceded, however, that in such cases a federal court is more likely to punish the guilty than the criminal courts of the states. Besides not in all Federal Courts would a jury compare with a New Orleans group in their attitude towards the criminals.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the bill of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relation is a patch-work only. It does not remedy the defect, namely, that the Federal Government is powerless according to its consitution to force a state or a city to protect a citizen of another country in accordance with treaty agreements; nor can the government compel such states or cities to give an account of their treaty violations.</p>
   <p>As long as the Constitution contains this fault or defect concerning the protection of citizens of other countries, even the eloquence of the dialectician Blaine is not sufficient to cover up the disgraceful paradox.. It is a matter of fact that the federal government only and exclusively represents the whole territory of the United States before any foreign country, but on the other hand, the federal government cannot force any of the states to meet their responsibility toward foreign citizens. This situation is even more embarrassing to the United States, because <pb facs="5418474_6_0167.jpg" n="3"/>of its commendable demand of all foreign governments that they must adequately protect the United States citizens who may reside in their respective countries.</p>
   <p>Adequate protection for the American citizens at home and abroad - this can be read in the platforms of the American political parties - and it sounds magnificent! But it would indeed be more fitting if we added: and adquate protection for citizens of other countries in the United States, and by the United States.</p>
