   <p>But when the greatest victories I enjoy</p>
   <p>I miss the best part, and how it does annoy.</p>
   <p>Can it be? Is it the sweet youthful caress</p>
   <p>Of my former lamentable foolishness?</p>
   <p>At times it is very pleasant to contemplate "our bygone foolishness" of which Heine speaks and to do a little retrospection regarding the nonsense which is practiced by other young companions. The latter opportunity is now provided to the men of 1848 by the more recent socialistic gentry of '73, who now organize on American soil "ire and indignation meetings" about Germany's "sow hunt", and who demand that the United States protest against Bismarck's tyranny in the name of liberty, equality, humanity, and other delectable "itys and isms [sic]".</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0574.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>How that must appeal to you forty-eighters who almost thirty years ago (three deceniums says the typical German newspaper writer, who cannot bring to his pen the simple German "ten years"--even if he croaks) reveled about a similar nonsensical asininity: The intervention of the great American Republic in European affairs.</p>
   <p>Our present red '73ers are more modest, or to express it more bluntly, they do not appear quite as silly as certain crazy red '48ers did in the '50's.</p>
   <p>While the contingent of '48 during its convention in Wheeling even voiced demands that America should annex the United States of Europe (which referred only to Germany of course), the parties of '73 are already satisfied, if the United States government formally protests about the German abolition of human rights. Or, to use the more fluent expression with which Berlin public speakers are conversant: "If....," that, after all, is not a monstrous demand, not even from the standpoint of American popular rhetoric which values words (oaths and threats) more cheaply than blackberries were <pb facs="5418474_6_0575.jpg" n="3"/>valued at Falstaff's time in England. But even this little request will not be achieved. Their entire satisfaction will be--like that of the men of '48--that they can thoroughly....themselves to their heart's content; "that they have stung the crook abroad most forcibly"; and, that they live in a land where no minion of the law, no state's attorney harkens to their words whenever they express their disdain against the emperor or Bismark (a mutual disgust) or the burgeois in general, which provides six to twelve months at Ploetzensee or banishment to Perleberg. A protest by the United States government ought to appease them, and if the members of '73 have one fourth of the average intelligence, then they should be fully contented if the nation makes such presentations to Germany. More they (the men of '73) cannot achieve.</p>
   <p>In so far as the American-born citizens are concerned (and we have about forty million of them), the most that can be expected from that source will be a compassionate smile, which, translated into Goethe's language may be expressed as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0576.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They bring no peril,</p>
   <p>We are at peace--and content,</p>
   <p>But other aspects</p>
   <p>The future years will present.</p>
   <p>Even if the mask</p>
   <p>Acts absurdly at moments,</p>
   <p>It produces wine</p>
   <p>At last, after it ferments.</p>
   <p>That, then, as we said before, is the best reception they may expect. A less beneficial attitude is expressed in dozens of our leading American newspapers. These publications consider the socialist protestors not only as harmless "nuts", but as a public nuisance which, somehow, must be tolerated since we have both freedom of the press and speech. Still, it would have been better if these socialists had stayed at home.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0577.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>If there is anything that proves particularly obnoxious to an American, then it is the imputation that his interference in foreign affairs is required. The Yankee is no cosmopolitan prattler and does not care to be one. He is strictly nationalistic in sentiment, or to quote the words which Ludwig Eichrodt ascribes to his Luxemburger: "I am a thorough Luxemburger, was born that way". To form an opinion, be it intelligent or silly, about other nations and peoples is the American's incontestable prerogative, and he vents his views, even if insufficient information causes him to make lamentable blunders occasionally. But to involve himself in the affairs of others or to assume a theatrical pose--like a Frenchman resorting to enphonious phrases, in lieu of deeds, for some conculcated party in Europe--than an American will never do. He does not consider it his business to proclaim to the world the happy tidings of our republican form of government or to pester other nations about it; he is satisfied to let the example speak for itself. In that respect the American partakes of the nature of Goldsmith's country preacher of Wakefield, who made the homely declaration: "I always believed that a good man, who marries and raises a large <pb facs="5418474_6_0578.jpg" n="6"/>number of children, is more useful than the bachelor who babbles only about the increase in population".</p>
   <p>The American demonstrates how the wealthiest country known in history, and a still greater government, can exist and prosper on a foundation of unrestricted personal liberty, and he expects that other people will imitate that pattern if they like it--or else leave it alone. But, to help other nations to reach that lofty goal never enters an American's mind, because he believes every nation adopts that form of government which the majority prefers. He believes that no administration can endure, even if controlling a hundred thousand bayonets, when the majority really objects; and, that it is no American's business to help a power-seeking, oppressed minority which was suppressed by a majority. The Americans, therefore, have no intentions whatsoever of helping the socialists abroad, except to grant them a refuge in the United States when conditions become intolerable in Europe. The United States offers no asylum in Swiss style--where the duration of protection depends upon the good will of the Government--but, <pb facs="5418474_6_0579.jpg" n="7"/>a lasting shelter which every arrival may claim here as his unalienable right, a sanctuary which provides an almost unlimited amount of liberal laws which are more than those socialists would ever expect in Germany even in their wildest dreams, and which undoubtedly are more than these socialists would grant to their adversaries were they themselves in power. The United States is an American and not a nebulous world republic, and because it is, it can only offer refuge to the Germans of '73, just as it did a quarter century ago for the men of '48. And this is enough.</p>
   <p>In regard to the desired "intervention", it would amount only to "cheap words". Moreover, the fact that the German "sow hunt" is relentlessly criticized and condemmed in America can readily be read by the German autocrats, but they do not care. They would also greet a protest by the United States with derision, telling us to put our own house in order. Therefore, it is best to forget the protest.</p>
