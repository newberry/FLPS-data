   <p>The Sunday afternoon concert season started yesterday at the Northside Turnhall, under the leadership of Mr. A. Rosenbecker. The first concert was indeed a triumph for that excellent orchestra and our own capable conductor, Adolph Rosenbecker. During his long years of constant activity he has been able to maintain the orchestra's high standard, in spite of recurring changes which have been inevitable because of members leaving the organization.....</p>
   <p>In conformance with a long established custom, a lively, graceful march, Hugo Frey's "Swiss Boy," was selected as the opening number. Next came the overture "Raymond," by A. Thomas, which is a more intricate selection, but the orchestra performed it in a faultless manner.....</p>
   <p>The first part of the program was of a lighter character, a preparation for the <pb facs="5418474_6_1617.jpg" n="2"/>subsequent heavier overture, Rossini's, "William Tell." The fundamental power of this colossal creation would not grow trite even if one heard this masterpiece a hundred times,and as we become familiar with every bar, its effectiveness mounts in ever-increasing measure.....</p>
   <p>The audience was aroused to staggering heights of boundless emotion,.... glistening eyes gave mute evidence of its intrinsic appeal, and the musicians were rewarded for their efforts with an ovation.....</p>
   <p>....Arthur Laser...., of the former Thomas Orchestra, showed his great artistry by his delicacy and depth of tone.... the melodious qualities he attained; his.... gradations..... The true conception, genuine feeling, particular shading which this work required, were given in a masterly manner.....</p>
   <p>The great phantasy from Meyerbeer's "Prophet" completed the second portion.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1618.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The third and last part of the program was dedicated again to lighter musical selections.....</p>
   <p>Popular airs and the profound, sublime classics were thus combined to remove us from the everyday depths of humdrum life.....</p>
