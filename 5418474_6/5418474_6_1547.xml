   <p>Yesterday's concert in the North Side Turner Hall was again to the general taste, with the exception of McDowell's piano concerto in D Minor. The orchestra played splendidly, and the audience responded to every performance with loud applause. The attendance was very large, because the members of the German Club were present in great numbers, therefore the big hall was filled to capacity, even the gallery showing few empty seats.</p>
   <p>The orchestra reproduced "The Meister Singers of Nurnberg" preludium, and the Rienzi-Overture by Richard Wagner in a perfect manner. The partitur of the latter one, is meant for a large orchestra, but even a smaller one like the Philharmonic could do it justice, if it is conducted with such circumspection as was the case with Renk, who selected first class efficient musicians. A potpourri from Victor Herbert's "Fortune Teller", featured a xylophone solo by G. Schink.</p>
   <p>On the program were Fritz Renk, William Schwartz and Miss Lillian Magnuson as soloists. Renk is so well known as an artist on the violin; that it should be unnecessary to dwell on his mastery any more. Miss Magnuson is <pb facs="5418474_6_1548.jpg" n="2"/>a very talented pianist, who may look forward to a brilliant career. Renk played the "Romanza" by Wieniawski, and "Liebisleid" by Kreisler, and evoked stormy applause. Polesney, the orchestra's concertmaster took over the baton and proved that besides masterly handling of the violin, he also is capable of directing an orchestra. Miss Magnuson's performance was eagerly awaited, because she faced a hard task.</p>
   <p>Both of McDowell's piano concertos are modern in every respect; the piano parts are very difficult, and like the orchestra part, complicated. She played only the first part but displayed such a virtuosity, that it caused surprise. Her dexterity, which never forsook her, either in the octaves nor in the trills for both hands, made the public forget, that the composition did not possess great musical value. The difficult orchestra part, was splendidly performed under the direction of Mr. Schwickerat, so that the ensemble from beginning to end, fitted well together. William Schwartz was again on the program with several songs and arias. Especially successful were his Schubert serenade and an aria from Verdi's "Traviata".</p>
