<title level="a">EXHIBITION BY TWO GERMAN-AMERICAN PAINTERS.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In the Art Institute, there has been an exhibit of 26 paintings, by two Chicago artists, for the last three weeks, - the brothers Martin and George Baer. The Baer brothers are descended from a German-American family and finished their studies five years ago in Chicago. For further perfection, in the high school of European art, they stayed in Munich for one year, where they gained a great knowledge of technique and the views of impressionism, which exercised a great influence upon their development.</p>
   <p>From Munich they went to Paris, where at that time a group of art revolutionaries, under the leadership of the talented young Italian Modigliani, dominated. But, as always in the life of the artist, there came an epoch for the two young painters, when the impulse of self-expression, took a sudden categoric form.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1778.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Baer brothers decided upon a peculiar solution of this problem. Far from all culture, far from all pell-mell of the influences of the artistic and social world cities, they settled in a distant Arab village in the south of Algiers. In this village, named Laghonat, the brothers lived in a primitive hut for one year, their whole time devoted to work, and the study of the peculiar nature of the people. After several months the natives began to have confidence in them, and consented to being used as models and later as studies of posing.</p>
   <p>Now these 26 paintings are the fruit of one year's work, under such peculiar conditions. They were first exhibited in the Gallery Durand - Ruel in Paris, and there created a great sensation and general enthusiastic praise of the critics. From Paris the exhibit was brought to Chicago, the native city of the artists, and it is safe to say, that the ripe knowledge of the two painters, will also find recognition and understanding in large circles.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1779.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>From the paintings can be seen, that the influence of German impressionist direction, was deeper with the two artists, than they themselves were conscious of. Especially strong is the influence of the methods of one of the most modern of the impressionists, the painter Kokaschka, who came from the Vienna school and direction, and now dominates even Munich. But these impressions are far from hindering the German-American artists, and make them change their course. The works are the results of a willful strong knowledge, and an expression of self-conscious artistry.</p>
