   <p>In Room No. 4 of the Grand Pacific Hotel, a meeting of the brewers of Chicago and vicinity took place the day before yesterday. It was supposed that a uniform increase of beer prices here and in Milwaukee was being discussed, and that resolutions were to be made. But apparently nothing of the sort took place, according to the statements made to newspaper reporters by some of the participants. Nor did a committee of the Wirtsverein (Innkeepers' Association) which had contacted the brewers, know anything about it. The discussion was limited to matters pertaining to the Brewers' Congress, scheduled to convene in Buffalo, New York, in the near future. There was also talk about the re-establishment of a Brauerverein (Brewers' Association) for which the prospects looked promising. All discussions were entirely informal.</p>
   <p>Represented were: The Conrad Seipp Brewing Company, The Downer and Bemis Brewing Company, Fortune Brothers; Hoerber, Schmidt and Glade; Peter</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1242.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Schoenhofen and Keeley, all of Chicago; Best, Schlitz and Falk of Milwaukee; and Porter of Joliet.</p>
   <p>In talking to some of the brewers, it was learned that they are very much inclined to raise the price of beer and the reasons given were: the one-hundred-per-cent increase in the price of ice; the two- to three-hundred-per-cent increase for iron; the twenty-five- to thirty-per-cent increase in wages; the fifteen-per-cent increase for wood: and the increase in prices of hops between three and four hundred per cent. They claim that a barrel of regular beer, including taxes, delivery and other incidental expenditures, cost them seven dollars and fifty cents, and that better grade beers like Utah, Pilsener, Erlanger, etc., cost them as much as seven dollars and seventy-five cents. Thus, they claim that twenty-five or fifty cents profit a barrel was not enough to cover unavoidable losses incurred in this business, regardless of the care taken.</p>
