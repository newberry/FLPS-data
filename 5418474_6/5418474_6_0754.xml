   <p>A Mrs. Rosa Schwimmer from Hungary, who claims to represent the suffragettes [feminists, equal suffrage advocates] of seventeen nations, has been holding lectures here for some time, asking the women of America to put an immediate end to the World War. The lady seems to think, according to her arguments, that this can be done if all the neutral powers, headed by the United States and the American women, would send representatives to Europe, to ask the belligerents to conclude an armistice and then to deliberate "what should be done next in order to bring about peace". In this childish vein the lady spoke day before yesterday at the Unabhaengiger Deutsch-Amerikanischer Frauenklub [Independent German American Women's Club] which had invited a large number of German-American women to attend the meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0755.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The ladies patiently listened to the vague explanations of the speaker, although an anti-German undertone was clearly discernible. Then Mrs. Schwimmer began to censor the German-American women for contributing to the prolongation of the War by favoring victory for the German arms. Her contention was that German-American women should follow the example set by the British suffragettes, who protested England's entrance into the war. At this point a woman in the audience could restrain herself no longer. She interrupted the oratory of Mrs. Schwimmer by asking her just what the German-American women wore supposed to do for the establishment of peace, as long as the United States persisted in exporting war material. Mrs. Schwimmer did not reply to that, but continued with her tirade.</p>
   <p>Judging by the remarks that were heard at the end of the lecture it was evident that the woman who had taken the liberty of interrupting Mrs. Schwimmer had voiced the sentiment of the majority of the listeners. Yesterday the same woman told an Abendpost reporter of the incident:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0756.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I realized that, as an invited guest of the Club, I had committed a breech of etiquette, and I quietly submitted when the chairman called me to order; however, I would do the same thing again today. Regardless of the fact that Mrs. Schwimmer's address was replete with beautiful phrases and did not present one single workable plan as to how the women should go about stopping the bloody conflict, and regardless of the fact that her arguments had a somewhat anti-German tinge, a direct assault against the German-American women seemed to me too absurd and to fantastic to let it pass quietly. If Mrs. Schwimmer thinks that the methods she proposed can succeed, I'd be the last person in the world to rob her of this belief, which I do not share, but if she allows herself to be so indiscreet as to utter tactless and absolutely unjustified accusations against the German-American women, she must expect to meet with opposition. If Mrs. Schwimmer holds up the British suffragettes as shining examples after whom we should pattern ourselves, she should also remember, if she is logical, what success they have had with their anti-war crusade--precisely none. But Mrs. Schwimmer does not mention that at all, <pb facs="5418474_6_0757.jpg" n="4"/>and no sensible person would believe that one or one hundred protests by German-American women or all the women of America, for that matter, would have any other result. If Mrs. Schwimmer's allegation that she is also speaking on behalf of the German suffragettes is true, we certainly feel sorry for them."</p>
