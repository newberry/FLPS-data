  <body>
   <p>Negotiations between Doctor F. Biegfeld, president of the Chicago Musical College and Adolf Muehlmann, the world famous opera singer, came to a close When the latter signed a five year contract to join the institution as director, and function also as manager of the School of Opera.</p>
   <p>Mr. Muehlmann was born in Russia in 1866, Where he prepared for the ministry. However, he was an ardent admirer of the art of music, for which he finally deserted his above mentioned study when eighteen years of age. He arrived in Vienna penniless. This was the city of his destination. There he took up the study of music under most adverse conditions. Deprivation was his steady companion for the ensuing three years. At the end of this period, he gave his first concert in Rotterdam. Two years later, he responded to an invitation <pb facs="5418474_6_1580.jpg" n="2"/>from Breslau, winning the hearts of the public and the recognition of the critics and remained there six years. Prior to his triumphs in St. Petersburg, he was invited to fill an engagement at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, and also at the Royal Opera in Covent Garden, London. He remained a member of these two institutions for twelve years, at the end of which he retired only to take up teaching music in Berlin.</p>
