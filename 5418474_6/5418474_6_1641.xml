   <p>The Amberg Theater Company of New York gave last night its first guest performance with the Operetta "Der Zigeuner Baron" (The Gypsy Baron), which proved to be a remarkable success. There were no seats left, and many late comers had to leave again because of lack of room.</p>
   <p>The play itself showed the superior quality of the actors in regards to acting and singing. While Mr. Amberg himself is a capable sole-singer; every other member of his troupe is an artist with individually well developed talent and characteristics. The largest part of the applause falls on Mr. Streitmann, Mr. Friese and Miss Seebold. Mr. Streitmann is one of the best tenors, we have heard for a long time. Mr. Friese is a marvelous actor. Miss Seebold is combining a good singing voice with improved acting. Also Miss Bohner, Miss Englander, and Miss Koenig have to bementioned for their good singing. The applause became a hearty oration towards the end of the performance.</p>
