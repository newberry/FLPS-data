<title level="a">THREE GERMAN PAINTERS' EXHIBIT AT THE MIDLAND CLUB</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The German painters Otto Reimer Niebuhr, Fritz Becker, and Karl Wagner will arrange an exhibition of their work at the Midland Club on April 21, which will last for two weeks.</p>
   <p>All three artists have made themselves a good name already in Chicago. Niebuhr, who appeared before the public with an exhibition at the Kroch's Bookstore about a year ago, has great talent, especially in the field of landscape painting. His self portrait, which is also exhibited at the Midland Club, is considered a work of extraordinary value.</p>
   <p>Fritz Becker's principle strength lies in portrait painting. He is more of a temperate realist, who sees objects in the way they are. He knows how to give his portraits life; he knows how to mix colors, so that his portraits appear as reality itself.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1771.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Becker also exhibited an excellent self portrait. Other portraits represent a number of prominent German-Americans of Chicago; namely, Ernest Kruetgen, Walter W.L. Meyer, Mrs. Bertha Ott, etc.</p>
   <p>Karl Wagner of Munich, the third in the union, appears as a universalist. He paints portraits, landscapes, still-life, and others, which place him in the ranks of the best.</p>
   <p>Several excellent portraits of women will be exhibited, as well as several landscapes and an extraordinarily modernistic pastel of a violinist, and a number of excellent still-lives and several drawings.</p>
   <p>Wagner, who went through the best of schools in Munich, changes his style, and just for that reason is an excellent artist, because no matter how many pictures will be seen side by side, the impression will never prevail as is the case with other painters, that his paintings are too much alike.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1772.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Wagner's main strength lies undoubtedly in the detached copy of the real model. His compositions are real works of art, not evenly painted through all over, but entirely penetrating with a thorough impression.</p>
   <p>The exhibition, which is beginning Easter Monday, can be looked forward to with the greatest of interest.</p>
