   <p>To call the treatment to which the public was subjected last night in McCormick's Hall inconsiderate or to speak of Mrs. Pappenheim's conduct as artistic temperament, would put it very mildly. The manner in which she expressed her disapproval because her name and recent success did not draw a full house is so revolting that we are unable to find the right word to define such conduct.</p>
   <p>The attendance was probably so small on account of the terrific heat. Only 162 seats were occupied when the concert was supposed to begin. The few persons present had to suffer from the lack of ventilation and used their programs as fans. After the audience had waited and perspired for over 40 minutes, Mr. Balatka, the orchestra leader appeared to notify the public that Mrs. Pappenheim was not well and was thus unable to sing.</p>
   <p>The idea of wanting to deceive the public with such an excuse is absurd. Of course, Mrs. Pappenheim was not ill at all. She was completely dressed up and when she realized after 20 minutes that the auditorium would not be filled, she lost her temper. The management is not entirely responsible for this event.</p>
