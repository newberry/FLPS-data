   <p>Every reader of the Illinois Staats Zeitung and, therefore, every German of Chicago and vicinity knows the great real estate corporation of S. E. Gross, and recognizes its admirable, enterprising management and extensive transactions. No other real estate company has had as many German customers, or has brought such happiness to German families as has this firm because of its policy, to sell real estate on the most liberal terms. In order to fully comprehend the magnitude and surprising achievements of the firm, one must peruse a few figures. Last year, the company's sales in Grossdale reached the sum of $572,925.00, in Dauphin Park $444,376.00, in Avondale $250,794.00, on Ashland Avenue $135,685.00, in Humboldt Park $143,490.00, on Archer Avenue $118,115.00, on Madison Street $89,025.00, in Gross Park $68,115.00, in Brookdale $36,097.00 and in other subdivisions and towns $701,983.00. In order to take care of such a huge volume, its main office employs fifteen department superintendents, thirty five clerks, one hundred and eighty five salesmen and twenty advertisement writers. Particular stress must be laid to the fact, that the company sells mainly to Germans and thereby brings a good, tranquil class of people into a neighborhood; people who take pride in improving their homes from year to year; and this has resulted in beautification of all the city districts which Mr.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1200.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Gross has founded. Mr. Gross is the founder of sixteen towns and localities; he has plotted more than one hundred subdivisions; sold over thirty thousand building sites, and built seven thousand or more. Whenever he has planned a division, one finds suitable transportation with adequate connections to the city, by railroad, cable, or ordinary horse-car. Schools, churches, stores and other public buildings are also present when the first homes of a new district are available for occupancy. One factor which has had much to do in creating the phenominal success of the firm, may be found in the fact, that its methods enable anyone to own a home at the easiest conceivable installment rates, and that Mr. Gross during his entire business career, never has foreclosed a mortgage, also that he considers the interest of his customers above those of other representatives in the real estate field. He satisfies his clients and, in consideration of the friendly considerate treatment they have received, they reciprocate by trying to fulfill their part of the agreement.</p>
