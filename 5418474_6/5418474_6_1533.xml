  <body>
   <p>The well known musician died this morning after a prolonged illness. William Rothe, well known orchestra leader of Chicago, died this morning at the age of sixty-four years. His death means a heavy loss to German-Americans. The deceased was for more than thirty years active in the affairs of German-Americanism. Wm. Rothe, was widely known and highly esteemed among German-Americans of Chicago, and his summer concerts in the parks of the city, at the German day, and at many other festivals, were immensely enjoyed by the public. Wm. Rothe always was and remained a good German. For years he contributed and forwarded to his home town provisions and money - the net proceeds from his concerts.</p>
   <p>His last great wish was not fulfilled. He had planned the reintroduction of the formerly popular Sunday afternoon concerts, and together with is colleague, Martin Ballmann, arranged a concert for February the 17th, but death took the conductor's baton from his hands.</p>

   <p>Wm. Rothe was born on the 23rd of May, 1865 in Goslar, Germany, and was a son of the musical conductor Alvin Rothe. He was the oldest son of a widely ramified family of musicians. He attended Highschool in his home-town and established an orchestra of pupils. After finishing school he went to Holland where he joined the Holland League in Dutch-India and was a soldier for four years. After his return from the tropics he fulfilled his military obligations at Celle, Germany with an artillery regiment.</p>
   <p>In 1889 he immigrated to America. Wm. Rothe married in Brooklyn and then went to Philadelphia. He was active in the Spanish-American war as an artillerist in the Astor Division, New York. He fought in the battles around Havana and was selected as the trumpeter when the American Flag was hoisted on Morro Castle. He returned with the 2nd Illinois regiment and settled in 1898 in Chicago where he organized his own orchestra. In 1908 he founded the Lincoln Conservatory of Music, which he conducted until his death.</p>
