   <p>W. Schlueter gave a concert yesterday in the beautiful large hall of the Kretschmar building to introduce himself to the public. The concert was unique, inasmuch as the public became acquainted with two other young artists, besides Mr. Schluter. They will undoubtedly, soon attain splendid reputations here.</p>
   <p>The first number was played by the violinist, E. Schmidt, and his brilliant performance was enthusiastically applauded. According to the statements of his friends, the artist was a student of the great Joachim for three years. He will certainly become famous with his art...</p>
   <p>The audience also became acquainted with E. Harford, a great singer, who recently finished her studies in Leipzig, Germany. Her alto voice is exceedingly rich and well modulated and she masters it completely. She sings with deep emotion, and therefore, affects the hearers overwhelmingly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schlueter played from Gounod's Faust, and compositions from Schubert and Chopin. The performances of the Fidelia Quartets enriched the program, and <pb facs="5418474_6_1636.jpg" n="2"/>received well deserved applause...</p>
