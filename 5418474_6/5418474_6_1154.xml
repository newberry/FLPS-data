  <body>
   <p>Under the name of American Metal Ware Company, we are confronted by two Germans, Adolph Hartmann and Gustave Stieglitz, who for years have manufactured articles made of "nickel and brass" bars, and whose brass bedsteads are gradually displacing the wooden article. The company, which constantly seeks to improve its products in usefulness and design, is growing consistently. A number of friends were invited yesterday to see the new designs. These model brass beds are now available in quantity production. Their large factory is located at the corner of Huron and Sedgwick Streets.</p>
   <p>It is always gratifying for us to hear that we Chicagoans are ahead of others in some manufacturing branch, and doubly so if it is a German firm, where German sense of beauty, combined with American energy, succeeded in excelling others.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1155.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Their pleasing patterns are unequalled on the American market today, in beauty, workmanship, and solidity, and we feel sure that the firm will acquire other markets.</p>
