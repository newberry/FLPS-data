   <p>The first of the season's chamber concerts arranged by Mr. Adolf Liesegang, had been played last Monday evening, before a select and appreciative audience, in the dining room of Brand's Halle. Mr. Liesegang has entirely reorganized his string quartet. Replacing Mr. Rosenbecker, who played the first violin last year, is Mr. Carl Becker, who was a pupil of Joachim. Mr. Gustav Pringnitz is playing the second violin, which was in the hands of Mr. Kurth, Jr. last year. The viola is played by Mr. Allen, as last year, and Mr. Liesegang of course, plays the cello. In our opinion, the new artists, who compose the string quartet now are not surpassing the work, of the artists of last year. No doubt that Mr. Becker is a far better violinist than Mr. Rosenbecker, but his Forte lies in his solo and not in the quartet-play. The singing quality of the tunes, lets us detect in him his teacher, Joachim, but it stands out in harsh contrast to the tune-quality of the artists, and naturally interferes with the playing of the quartet to such an extent that either he, or the rest of the artists, have to make an attempt for better understanding, for only then, the rendition of the musical numbers can be <pb facs="5418474_6_1704.jpg" n="2"/>a success.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pringnitz can produce a lovely tune through expert handling of the bow, but it seems to remain inferior to Mr. Becker's playing, thus it has not been possible to produce a harmony of the quartet. Mr. Allen is an expert with the viola, for which he is well known, but he does not produce the sweetness of tunes, and furthermore, is not master of his bow sufficiently, to keep in step with the singing violin. Mr. Liesegang as cellist, performs always correctly, but his rendition in contrast to the first violin, was rather harsh and therefore, the tune rhythm could not be obtained. The program has been such, as to test the artist's proficiency.</p>
   <p>The melodious G--Dur, quartet by Mozart, with its delightful simplicity, demands more rhythm than any work of its kind, although the correct rendition, could not cover the lack of rhythm in tune quality. This G-- Dur Quartet is a part of Mozart and Vienna life, full of tranquility and lightpheartedness, of which these are only a few.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1705.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We could not say, that the rendition of this jewel of compositions" was satisfying. The second number on the program, presented Mr. Becker as soloist, and it was the most enjoyable one of the evening. He was able to demonstrate even to experts, that he is a musician of high accomplishments. Then came, "Grade's" novelettes, sentimental and charming. Schumann's quartet opus 47 demanded a great deal of all the participants.</p>
