   <p>The Senate is deliberating at present about the introduction of an income-tax law. While this debate is going on, some American newspapers, representing the large money-interests and corporations, are attacking viciously the published speech of Senator Mc Millin, who declared that during the last 100 years the bulk of taxes has been drawn from the consumers and producers and affected largely the poorer and middle classes of the people, while the wealthy are not taxed sufficiently.</p>
   <p>We are glad to say, that we give the opinion of all Germans and German-Americans regardless of party-lines, when we advocate herewith the sanction of a just income-tax. The Senate should ignore the mentioned newspapers, which are going even so far, to suggest, simply not to pay the proposed income tax, if adopted and accomplished by law.</p>
   <p>It is the wealth, which has so far enjoyed more the protection through laws than helpless poverty. We are not preaching class-justice and class-antagonism. But we do believe that, accumulated wealth should contribute its larger share of taxation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0135.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For this reason, we hope that the income-tax will become a Federal law, in the name of progress and for the Good of all.</p>
