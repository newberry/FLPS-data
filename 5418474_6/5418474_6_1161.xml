   <p>p.8 - The annual meeting of the West Chicago Inn-Keeper's Society was held recently at the old Vorwaerts Turner Hall. Most of the members were present and a lively interest was displayed in the discussion of business affairs. The meeting was opened by president Adolf Nagl, and immediately afterwards the reports were read.</p>
   <p>According to these, the past year was a very successful one for the society. The accounts show a surplus of $1,000, and the society has been increased by 50 new members.</p>
   <p>Those members who have been annoyed and persecuted by temperance fanatics, altogether 33 in number, were successfully defended by Mr. M. R. Harris, the attorney for the society.</p>
   <p>After the society's official business had been translated, the question of raising the price on beer was brought up. A prolonged debate ensued with no <pb facs="5418474_6_1162.jpg" n="2"/>definite results. It was rightly suggested, that in order to make a final decision, all the innkeepers, whether they were associated with any of the societies or not, should be consulted on this matter. Likewise, brewing companies should be considered and included.</p>
