   <p>p. 5 - The conjectures which have circulated so freely for some time, have become a reality. Theodore Thomas, the director of the Music Bureau is leaving. He sent in his resignation to Manager Davis yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>In his letter, Mr. Thomas mentions the exposition's sad financial plight and further declares that economy is a necessity. He says that the engagements of foreign and American artists were dropped from the program and that his original plans had been altered so much as to become non-existent. For the remainder of the season, music must be considered as a pleasure instead of an art; the scarcity of money requires it.</p>
   <p>He offered to help the directorate in an advisory capacity, gratuitously. <pb facs="5418474_6_1624.jpg" n="2"/>The directors regret losing such a capable man; but financially his departure is a gain. His monthly salary was $1,666. His administrative expenses, including the cost of the hall, amounted to $700,000, and if he had remained another three months, there would have been an additional expense of $400,000. These expenditures, obviously, are too great, as the income up to the present time has only been $100,000.</p>
