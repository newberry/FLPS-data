<title level="a">A BAD SYSTEM FOR WORKERS</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>It is an honor to the Industrial Commission of Congress that it appointed a committee to investigate the infamous system of sweat-shops, which have crept into the clothing industry of many large American cities. This system consists chiefly of an arrangement whereby the manufacturers and wholesalers turn the work over to a contractor, who hires and pays the workers and tries to make as much profit out of this as he possibly can.</p>
   <p>The investigation of late revealed that this system of exploitation prevails in Chicago also, especially in coat factories, and other clothing lines.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoar, a member of the committee, did not explain how the evil of sweat-shops can be remedied by a national law; however, the investigation instigated by him disclosed this serious evil, one that not only violates public health laws, but is an insult to justice and humanity.</p>
   <p>Local authorities also have the power to eliminate sweat-shop conditions. Already many unsanitary and health-destroying conditions in workshops have been abolished in Chicago, thanks to an efficient and friendly inspection of factories. It is <pb facs="5418474_6_0169.jpg" n="2"/>indeed a surprise, therefore, that this local commission has not taken any steps against sweat-shops where men, women, girls, and children are crowded together to work, and where unhealthy conditions prevail, and where quite frequently the air is infected with contagious disease germs.</p>
   <p>If our state laws and city ordinances had been enforced, such unsanitary conditions in factories and work-shops could not exist, because these regulations require that a certain minimum of air and working space must be provided for each worker; also how much water must be available, etc. Apparantly the Health Commissioners of Chicago have paid no attention to these laws and regulations, at least as far as these sweat-shops are concerned. Child-labor laws have likewise been neglected and have not been enforced.</p>
   <p>Sweat-shops are not an American system. The idea has been smuggled in from London and other large English cities. It was introduced in Chicago only a few years ago. However, according to statements made by workers and by the committee, employers have conceded that the sweat-shop system spread rapidly here, and that almost all manufacturers in the clothing line make use of contractors. The contractors, of course, reduce wages wherever they can.</p>
   <p>A law against this contract system would undoubtedly be declared unconstitutional <pb facs="5418474_6_0170.jpg" n="3"/>by the Supreme Court under the pretention that it is a violation of the principles of liberty. Under the same pretense the Anti-Truck Law of Pennsylvania and Illinois was declared unconstitutional.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, there are sufficient effective methods to remedy the sweat-shops evil. It would also be a duty for labor-unions to fight emphatically, and in orderly fashion, against this atrocious system and against such working conditions.</p>
