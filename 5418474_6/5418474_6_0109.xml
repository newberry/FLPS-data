   <p>The humanitarian foolishness in the County Jail is being carried too far.</p>
   <p>It would be infinitely more appropriate for Sheriff Magerstadt to concentrate upon the discipline among those committed to his care rather than to waste so much time planning amusements for these criminals. Of course, prisoners must have some diversion and humane treatment is one of the chief points that must be considered at all times. But Mr. Whitman, the director of the prison, indulges in too much pity for the evildoers: between twenty-five and thirty are accused of either murder or homicide, between fifty and seventy-five of predatory attacks, and about one hundred of robbery. The custom of serving the prisoners roast on national and church holidays, and the privilege of attending a special entertainment is above any criticism. However, a concert and a lecture every week is philanthropy carried to excess. Furthermore, <pb facs="5418474_6_0110.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Whitman requested the County Board Committee to provide the prison with a new piano. This request provoked a member of the committee, who then asked whether the inmates of the jail might not be served best by installing a bowling alley and a billiard room on each floor of the male section of the prison, while pianos as well as elegant and comfortable rocking chairs might be furnished the women's division. Recreation centers for comfort during summer months and ice skating rinks for winter sports for the benefit of the detained boys might also be installed in the corridors of the prison. To make the picture complete we would recommend the installation of a gymnasium, a concert hall, and a ballroom. Thus, these fine members of the human race--murderers, robbers, and burglars--could meet and dance with their equals, namely, women shoplifters and "lady" kleptomaniacs. The ballroom could, of course, be used for meeting purposes too. There they could indulge in free denunciation of the sheriff if meals were not pleasing to their plates or if the linens were not fine enough.</p>
   <p>Before us lies the information that Mr. Whitman has decided to appoint <pb facs="5418474_6_0111.jpg" n="3"/>a committee of prisoners for every department and for each floor who will convey to him the wishes and preferences of prisoners in the matter of lectures and entertainment. But we will go one step further. Our advice to Mr. Whitman is to propose to the County Council the use and the equipment of a dozen rooms merely for committee activities. Letters in which prisoners express their gratitude for a favored entertainment reach Mr. Whitman quite frequently. Since there is as yet no provision made for other than prison stationery for the prisoners' communications, Mr. Whitman had better take care of that too. Neither must he forget that every prisoner shows some partiality in regard to newspapers; therefore, it would behoove him to take care of that also. And how about books from the public library?</p>
