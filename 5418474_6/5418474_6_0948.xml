   <p>Attorney August F. W. Siebel was born in 1877, on the beautiful island of Rugen, Germany, the son of Friedrich and Caroline Siebel. At the early age of nine years he came to the United States, where, after finishing the Chicago public schools, he studied law and took his final examinations at Lake Forest College. In 1903 he was admitted to the bar and has since then lived in Chicago. In 1925 he was appointed assessor by Judge C. M. Foell. However, he is better known through his military activities. He took part in the Spanish-American war, and was stationed for some time at the Mexican border as captain. In the World War he commanded a company of the 132nd U. S. Infantry Regiment, but was later promoted as assessor to the Court Martial of the 33rd Division. He is a member of the American Legion and also belongs to the Veterans of the Spanish-American War.</p>
   <p>In 1916 he married Anna Michaelis of Chicago. He has two children, a daughter Patricia, and a son Arthur F. Siebel is a member of the Chicago Chamber of counselors. He was for quite some time president of the German Club. The Germania and Hamilton clubs and several lodges also numbered him among their members.</p>
