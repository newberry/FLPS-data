   <p>The committee which was appointed last Saturday to investigate unsanitary conditions prevailing at the North Wells Street School met at Colonel Louis Schaffner's home yesterday evening, and the gentlemen made the following report:</p>
   <p>"To the citizens of the 15th and 16th wards:</p>
   <p>"Your committee, chosen to inspect the building on North Wells Street which has been used as a school for the last eighteen months, herewith submits its report:</p>
   <p>"We find the afore-mentioned building unfit for school purposes, although we admit that, at the time, it was--and it still is--exceedingly difficult <pb facs="5418474_6_0900.jpg" n="2"/>to procure a more suitable place.</p>
   <p>"The committee found that the basement serves in lieu of a playground during recess. The floor boards are rotten, and foul odors emanate from there, permeating the entire promises.</p>
   <p>"We found that several of the classrooms were overheated, and that no ventilating system existed, which made it necessary to open the windows and expose the children to direct cold air currents, which is very deleterious to health.</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, we found insufficient toilets, and all were in very bad condition.</p>
   <p>"Other items: The saves trough, which should discharge rain water into a sewer, leads only to a cesspool in an adjoining lot, south of the school <pb facs="5418474_6_0901.jpg" n="3"/>building, and stirs up the putrid mixture whenever water enters the cesspool, so that foul vapors rise, which are very injurious to health.</p>
   <p>"We, therefore, recommend that existing conditions be remedied, and that the board of education be requested to make the following improvements:</p>
   <p>1) Remove the floor in the basement and replace it with a concrete floor.</p>
   <p>2) Advise the janitor to perform his duties properly, as to heating, and so forth.</p>
   <p>3) Install ventilators in the classrooms.</p>
   <p>4) Provide more toilets and, if possible, connect them with the sewers. <pb facs="5418474_6_0902.jpg" n="4"/>We believe this can be done by using the annex, a brick building. The toilets should be kept clean at all times.</p>
   <p>5) The rain pipe should lead directly into the sewer, and the entire sewer system of the building should be checked up.</p>
   <p>6) Keep the premises in good condition at all times, and watch contiguous property to make sure that no unsanitary practices prevail.</p>
   <p>"In submitting this report, we feel duty bound to add that Miss Babcock, the principal of the school, gave us all possible information, and that she readily answered all our questions. We ascertained, in contradiction to the alarming report, that only three pupils of the school have died of contagious diseases since September 1 of this year, instead of twenty-three, as asserted <pb facs="5418474_6_0903.jpg" n="5"/>at the last meeting, and that pupils are excluded if serious sickness prevails at their homes, and that they are not permitted to attend school again until they have a certificate from the board of health.</p>
   <p>"As a matter of fairness, we declare hereby that Miss Babcock's report coincides in every detail with the statement made by the board of health. Only seven children ranging from six to twelve years have died from scarlet fever, croup and dropsy [verbatim] since September 1 in the district between Eugenia and Division Streets.</p>
   <p>"And finally, your committee recommends that you urge the board of education to provide a new and suitable school building for this part of the city.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Joseph Louis, T. Karls, Jacob Becker, L. Schaffner."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0904.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The above report will be submitted today, at the meeting, 601 North Clark Street.</p>
