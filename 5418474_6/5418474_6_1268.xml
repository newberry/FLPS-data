   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers' Association) held its semiannual general meeting yesterday at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle. John Feldcamp, president of the Association, acted as chairman.</p>
   <p>The reports of the various committees were accepted. The outing committee and the committee on the brewers' conference will submit their reports next week. The committee on legal matters gave a detailed account of its activities.</p>
   <p>Philip Dieder, treasurer, showed....that there is $725.08 on hand.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldcamp then presented his report and expressed thanks, in the name of the Wirthsverein, for the efforts of the aldermen in abolishing the poolroom license. He spoke of certain associations which employ snoopers to make trouble for saloonkeepers, and showed that these attempts had proved unsuccessful. According to the report, the brewers are to blame for the existence of hundreds of disreputable <pb facs="5418474_6_1269.jpg" n="2"/>saloons and dives. If a tavernkeeper's license is revoked because the place is regarded as a public nuisance, the brewers are the first to see to it that that saloon is reopened, so that the brewers can sell more beer. Saloonkeepers whose licenses are revoked for good reasons should not be enabled to start anew. For this reason, the Wirthsverein should appoint a committee to investigate all closed saloons, and a list of all brewers who intercede for such questionable taverns should be compiled. It was also emphasized in the report that a distinction must be made between bona fide saloons and dives: "Only with the help of reputable saloonkeepers will it be possible to eradicate the evil. The prejudice shown by the people, and their low regard for saloonkeepers in general, are justified in many instances. We must unite and show a proper front against this type of saloon as well as the brewers."</p>
   <p>He continued: "The brewers don't care about the saloonkeepers' interests, as long as beer is sold; to attain this end, the brewers help any bum to open a saloon, pay the license and, if the sales are not satisfactory, another bum is put in charge. The better places--where the brewers receive cash and 'no favors asked'--are given no consideration whatsoever. But the tough joints <pb facs="5418474_6_1270.jpg" n="3"/>are supported by the brewers to keep up the sale of beer. The brewers should classify their customers, since there are two varieties: Those who pay promptly and always patronize the same brewery, and those from whom it is difficult to make collections; these latter are the chaps who make trouble for the brewers. The old reliable customers should be given preference so far as prices are concerned. The honest saloonkeepers should not be made the scapegoat, for the undesirable members of our calling."</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldcamp talked also about the problem of barrels--the question of contents--and expressed the gratitude of the Association for Peter Mueller's efforts in explaining the matter in a letter which appeared in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, entitled, "Saloonkeepers, Know Your Enemies!"</p>
   <p>"It is absolutely necessary that our local organization expand and cover the entire state, so that we may hold a regular convention of tavernkeepers, and that a committee be appointed to work out the details. The financial condition of the Association is excellent."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1271.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Finally, appreciation was expressed for the conscientious work of the various committees and officers of the Association, as well as for the strong support given by the German press.</p>
   <p>The finance committee was given a week to prepare its report.</p>
   <p>The election of officers proceeded with considerable difficulty, since most of the nominees declined. The following gentlemen were finally elected:</p>
   <p>President: P. Maas.</p>
   <p>Vice-president: Herman Langenhahn.</p>
   <p>Recording and corresponding secretary: Carl Bruder.</p>
   <p>Financial secretary: Adam Moerl.</p>
   <p>Treasurer; P. Dieder.</p>
   <p>Committee on legal matters: North side, Adolph Georg and P. Enders; South side: Bernhard Baum and Wilhelm Clemens; West side: Chas. F. Mueller, Jacob Gastel, and John Feldcamp.</p>
   <p>Trustee for eighteen months: Frank Schroth.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1272.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The assembly thanked the retiring officials for their work.</p>
   <p>The secretary's salary was increased from $2.50 to $5.00. Adjournment followed.</p>
