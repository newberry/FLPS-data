   <p>One of the German artists of Chicago, Mr. Richard W. Bock, has been honored by the acceptance of his group-design by the new library in Indianapolis. This beautiful work of art, skillfully executed, is now ready to be cast, and stands in the workshop of the sculptor, at 3240 N. Park Ave. The group consists of three figures which represent Science, Art, and Literature. It is distinguished by its symmetry and proportions, by the intelligent expression of the faces, and by the artistically beautiful arrangment of the allegorical figures. The figure in the middle has the form of a young man, about ten feet tall, standing on a stair. The head is well shaped, and the flash of the eyes reveals energy and independence. The uplifted right hand holds a torch and the left hand, a palm-leaf. The garment hangs loosely over the shoulders and is fastened with a belt around the hips. At the feet are a globe, a manuscript, and a laurel-wreath.</p>
   <p>At the right and on the left of the young man, literature and the Arts are allegorically represented as two seated women. The first stretches out her <pb facs="5418474_6_1788.jpg" n="2"/>right hand, holding a pen over a bust of Longfellow, and the left hand holds a few sheets of paper. The garment is laid in artistic folds over her head, and reaches to her feet, leaving the largest part of the body uncovered. The Arts are symbolized on the left side of Science in a similar manner, though in a different position than literature. The left hand holds a drawing board on the knee, and right hand, holds the stylus ready. In the background of the whole group is an owl with outstretched wings -- The symbol of wisdom.</p>
   <p>Eminent American sculptors, as, for instance, Mr. McMonnies, have termed this group a rare piece of art. It will undoubtedly, elicit the admiration of all lovers of art, when once completed. The artist, Mr. Bock, is not a stranger to our readers. He is the creator of the splendid sculptoral relief, which adorns the arch of the Schiller Building. He also furnished the design of a frieze for the Palace of Electricity, and another design for the Science of Mining Building at the World's Fair.</p>
