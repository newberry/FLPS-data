   <p>A European would be greatly surprised if he were told that Chicago, harboring half a million people, had no bathing facilities, although the city adjoins a large, beautiful lake; but if some one told him that along the miles of lake front, as far as the city limits, bathing was prohibited, then he would either not believe it or laugh at the anomaly. And yet this is a fact, to the everlasting disgrace of Chicago. Of course bathing is permitted if the bather wears a proper bathing suit. But how such a person may put on the suit or devest himself of his proper apparel without illegal exposure of his body punishable by a fine is not explained by the city ordinance, nor can the police department or the Mayor give a satisfactory explanation.</p>
   <p>To mitigate this evil, Alderman Meier of the Sixteenth Ward succeeded in the session of the city council on March 16 in commissioning the Director of Public <pb facs="5418474_6_0892.jpg" n="2"/>Works to erect a six-foot board fence seventy-five feet long at Buron Street and the lake, where bathers might find an opportunity to change their clothes or even to bathe without uncomfortable bathing suits. Since that time four months have elapsed, and neither Mr. Waller nor Mayor Harrison has done anything about that fence; they have forgotten all about it.</p>
   <p>It is a disgrace to our municipality that the work was not completed long ago, considering how necessary the installation was, and that such a board fence would cost but little. That public bathing places are an absolute necessity will probably not be denied by the Mayor or the Director of Public Works. But if they argue about it, then they can ascertain from the police that hundreds of people are bathing in the lake between Michigan and Indiana Streets, a stretch of shore line reserved for the purpose because there bathers cannot be seen by any one except those who make it their business to go there; and furthermore the Mayor will also find out that the police prevent hundreds of others from seeking the cool waters of the lake because they go beyond that narrow stretch of shore. Bathing is not confined merely to boys who want to go <pb facs="5418474_6_0893.jpg" n="3"/>swimming; one also encounters youths and men whose calloused hands and grimy faces give evidence that they come compelled by necessity, to cleanse themselves and to seek the invigorating water to gain strength for another day of toil.</p>
   <p>A glance at the daily police records would prove to the Mayor that many a laborer's irresistible longing for cleanliness and his ignorance of the law have resulted in arrest and a five-dollar fine. Blood money! Extortion practiced by a greedy city!</p>
   <p>Attention is constantly called to the fact that many diseases are caused by dirt; yet hundreds of thousands who lack such luxuries as a private bathroom or a bathtub and cannot pay twenty-five cents for the use of one because the money is needed for bread and meat are denied the privilege of seeking the immense natural bathing pool with which our city is blessed, so that a few prudish residents on the Avenue may not take offense. After all, these "Avenoodles" [Translator's Note: Verbatim, a word coined by the editor] need <pb facs="5418474_6_0894.jpg" n="4"/>not look in that direction, and they cannot see much unless they use spy-glasses.</p>
   <p>The tolerance of Chicago's masses is really wonderful, but the Commissioner of Public Works and the Mayor may make a fearful blunder if they rely too much on it and neglect even to build the fence at Huron Street which the city council ordered erected. However, this is by no means sufficient. At least half a dozen such famous should be constructed on the South Side and on the North Side, and a policeman should be stationed at every one of these locations to prevent theft and to act as life guard.</p>
   <p>Surely this is not an unreasonable demand, and money for such a purpose would be a thousand times more usefully spent than if it were put in Carter H. Harrison's "anti-scrip safe".</p>
