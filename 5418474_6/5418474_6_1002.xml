   <p>On account of the World's Fair taking place in 1893 in Chicago, thousands of German speaking technicians, artists, professors and others from all parts of the world will visit Chicago and other important places of America. The German-American Technical Association wishing to give these visitors all possible assistance, offers their locals in the various places in Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Lynn, Newark, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, St. Louis and Washington as meeting places and at the disposal of these visitors. The Chicago Club particularly should make all efforts to choose their locality for 1892 with consideration of the large number of scientific guests. As the greater part of the American technicians is working during the day at their special trade or business, measures should be taken that all possible visitors can also during daytime receive all the information, they are in need of. By speeches, reports about the progress in the different branches of the Technique, science and art, the interests of the visitors will be promoted as well as the social and business ones.</p>

   <p>Descendants of the great German Nation as representatives of science, art, technique and commerce, are distributes all over the world. In a country where all Nations and languages are presented, we shall acquire esteem and honor by making the German language as the universal tie of science representing visitors of the European countries. To make the necessary preparations, it will be desirable to have an idea how many visitors are expected and to know the position the various local organizations are taking on this plan.</p>
