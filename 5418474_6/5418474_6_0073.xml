   <p>The "Deutsche Wacht," a society organized for mutual benefit, held a protest meeting, at which two hundred persons agreed unanimously upon the following:</p>
   <p>"The society for mutual benefit, The "Deutsche Wacht" with its four hundred members, had joined the United Societies for local Home Rule in the endeavor to help other societies, and the citizens of Chicago as well, in the fight for the preservation of personal liberty and "Home Rule." Free men, with free choice of party or religion, have united in founding this organization. The German newspapers of the city have taken prominent part in the creation of this society. They engaged in unselfish agitation, reaching the masses far better than any society could possibly do. They urged individuals, whether or not they were members of any organization, to fight for the preservation of personal liberty. They <pb facs="5418474_6_0074.jpg" n="2"/>made an urgent plea to disregard party preferences and give support to those candidates who were defendants of these principles.</p>
   <p>Therefore we protest vigorously against the attempt to exclude the representatives of those newspapers as active members of the managing committee of the United Societies. Furthermore, we protest against any attempt of curtailing personal liberty, or conviction of their members, and thus disregard the principles for which the organization stands. The future success of the United Societies depends largely upon a non-partician policy of their officials. Neither party nor religion must determine their course, but the principles upon which the United Societies had been based, namely; personal liberty and "Home Rule."</p>
