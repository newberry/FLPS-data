   <p>The physicians of the discontinued German American Dispensary held a meeting on the 20th of last month for the purpose of reorganizing this institute. Dr. Schaller, presiding over the meeting, introduced Dr. Matthei, who explained how the Dispensary had to be closed for lack of interest on the part of the German population. The newly founded Society of German Physicians should have in every ward of the City one of the members of this society installed as ward physician to take care of needy German patients, recommended by the German Aid Society. The latter has declared its willingness to provide free of charge any needed quantity of drugs, medical and surgical instruments. This generous offer of the German Society will made it possible to begin at once with the formation of the new Society.</p>
   <p>Dr. I. Cohn thentook the chair and announced that the new Society will have a meeting every month, for which the date and location would be told in circular <pb facs="5418474_6_1037.jpg" n="2"/>letters, sent to all members and to the press. A constitution for the new Society will be read at the next meeting.</p>
