   <p>The Wirthsverein [Tavernowners' Association]held a special meeting yesterday. Charles Maas acted as chairman. Bernhard Baum functioned as secretary because Carl Bruder was absent on account of sickness in the latter's family.</p>
   <p>The committee which conferred with the brewers on the price question submitted the following report:</p>
   <p>"The committee met at Joseph Muehle's saloon. Mr. Langenhahn was elected chairman and Joseph Muehle secretary. Mr. Langenhahn explained the purpose of the conference and remarked that, at the last general meeting of the Wirthsverein, it had been decided to nominate a committee of five which should be empowered to take action in accordance with its decisions, that the names of the committee members should not be divulged, nor should the decisions, until the committee deemed it advisable.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1247.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Joseph Muehle proposed to obtain a charter, if necessary, in order to organize a co-operative brewery so that the tavernkeepers could procure good beer at the lowest possible price. Others declared that the Wirthsverein already had a charter, on the strength of which the association could embark in the brewery business. After a short debate on the question, it was decided to ask Attorney Rubens for advice.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Rubens explained to the committee that the present charter was insufficient and he offered to procure the necessary papers. We submit the document herewith.</p>
   <p>[Signed] "Herman Langenhahn,</p>
   <p>"Ph. Dieter,</p>
   <p>"Joseph Muehle."</p>
   <p>The committee's report was accepted, and the president of the association remarked that it appeared to him that the committee had deviated somewhat from <pb facs="5418474_6_1248.jpg" n="3"/>its instructions. No one had mentioned anything approximating the committee's proposal.</p>
   <p>Joseph Muehle and Langenhahn then declared that the committee had been authorized to seek the best methods to combat the brewers, and to act accordingly.</p>
   <p>The charter, signed by the Secretary of State, permitted Messrs. Langenhahn, Muehle, and Wassermann to sell bonds in order to finance a co-operative brewery. The document was submitted with the committee's afore-mentioned report, and was read to the assembly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Enders made a motion to accept the report and to advise the committee to continue its activities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brann said that he had read about the proposed increase in the price of beer, scheduled for next spring, but did not think that it would be of serious consequence. By that time the price may drop again. He believed the committee had <pb facs="5418474_6_1249.jpg" n="4"/>exceeded its instructions. He did not know just what the committee's intentions were, or whether the committee wanted to start a co-operative brewery among its own members. The committee should have consulted the association before embarking on such an expense.</p>
   <p>Muehle said, in defense, that the committee had acted in the best interests of the association. He had obtained evidence, and felt convinced that the brewers intended to raise the price of beer in the spring, and that, by applying for a charter for a co-operative brewery, he had chosen the means which would be most likely to make the brewers come to terms.</p>
   <p>Langenhahn spoke similarly, and Dieter added that an icehouse could be built, and that beer could be bought anywhere and stored for the benefit of the association; the charter would permit this.</p>
   <p>Mr. Georg made a motion that the filing fees ($5.50), should be paid by the Co-operative Brewing Company, and should not be made payable to the committee, <pb facs="5418474_6_1250.jpg" n="5"/>otherwise the association might become involved in greater responsibilities than the members care to assume.</p>
   <p>Enders's, and also Georg's, motions were accepted.</p>
   <p>Enders wanted to know what the saloonkeepers had to say about the mayor's proposal to issue special licenses permitting saloons to remain open all night, and added that it was strange to advocate extra licenses, when the tavernkeepers were already paying federal, city, and billiard and pool licenses, and finally Enders expressed his satisfaction that the German aldermen had voted against the proposed ordinance.</p>
   <p>Berger thought that the night license would have been a good thing, and that the mayor never would issue a permit unless he was certain that the applicant conducted his business in a proper manner.</p>
   <p>Baum wanted to make a test case. In his opinion, the temperance people <pb facs="5418474_6_1251.jpg" n="6"/>instigated the question and he [Baum] believed that, if the Federal Government gave a permit without any restrictions, then neither the state nor the city would have a right to specify at what particular time beer may be sold or consumed.</p>
   <p>Joseph Muehle said that it was a serious problem for the tavernkeepers, and he believed the mayor would revoke the licenses of all saloonkeepers whose places stayed open beyond midnight, just as he had threatened to do. As far as Muehle was concerned, he was willing to close at twelve o'clock, but not every saloonkeeper would be willing to tell respectable customers to leave at midnight.</p>
   <p>Baum made a motion to make a test case; the cost of the litigation could be paid by asking all interested citizens to contribute.</p>
   <p>Enders expressed the belief that the matter could be settled only through political pressure, by compelling the aldermen to revoke the ordinance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1252.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Muehle hoped that some prosperous tavernkeeper's license would be revoked, so that someone who had enough money could make a test case of it and fight it out. He was opposed to pass the collection basket to defray court costs, and did not believe that mere demands to rescind the ordinance [midnight closing of saloons] would be successful.</p>
   <p>Langenhahn also objected to "passing the hat," and asked that [Attorney] Rubens should estimate the costs, and, if not too high, the association should defray the expense.</p>
   <p>Enders said that a test case would not help, since Rubens had declared, some time ago, that saloons were not regarded as businesses of legal standing.</p>
   <p>Baum replied that this meant only that the city had a right to exercise control. It would be strange if a business were regarded as illegal, after the government recognized taverns and collected taxes thereon.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1253.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>The chairman remarked that he had heard that Mr. Rubens had found a point whereby the ordinance could be made inoperative by declaring it unconstitutional, and suggested that the committee on legal matters confer with the attorney about this phase before proceeding further in the matter. The assembly concurred.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Joseph Enders and Andreas Bartels were indignant about John Raber's conduct, because he gave Mayor Harrison $25 to enforce the midnight closing ordinance, and accused Raber of giving candy to little children so that they would buy beer from him.</p>
   <p>The assembly then attended to routine matters and adjourned. The next meeting will be held in two weeks, at Baum's Pavilion.</p>
   <p>A reporter of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung interviewed Harry Rubens, and asked on what grounds the closing ordinance could be declared unconstitutional. Mr. Rubens said that the city's new charter enabled the city council to pass an ordinance providing for the closing of saloons at any time, but, in drafting <pb facs="5418474_6_1254.jpg" n="9"/>the bill, it became unenforcible because of an oversight. Just what the error was, Mr. Rubens did not explain, but he hinted that the bill compelled saloonkeepers to close their places at midnight, but that the dispensing of drinks after that hour was not prohibited in the ordinance. However, Mr. Rubens admitted that little would be gained by declaring the statute void at this time, since the city council had the legal authority to enact even more drastic measures.</p>
