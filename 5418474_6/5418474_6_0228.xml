<title level="a">THE SOCIALIST PICNIC AT OGDEN'S GROVE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The socialist picnic ended yesterday afternoon amid pelting rain, accompanied by ear-splitting thunder and, according to rumors, the affair was a financial failure. The representatives of the "starving millions" had to be content with wearing their drenched Sunday clothes, which showed to great advantage the sinewy bodies of the healthy, "famished" workers. Some may have caught a cold from exposure, but more serious ailments can hardly be expected. The great festival showed that the workers of Chicago are beginning to be sensible again and, in observing occurrences in general, one realizes that the socialist festival at the Exposition building some time ago represented the highest attainment of this strange group living in our republic.</p>
   <p>If it had not been for the speeches, no one in that multitude would have surmised that this pleasure-seeking crowd was the victim of exploitation, or of merciless and greedy capitalism.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0229.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There were about five thousand people at Ogden's grove yesterday, among them the younger generation, which enjoys dancing and is incapable of drawing a line between socialism and pleasure. The managers of the festival, however, believe that receipts were large enough to net a few hundred dollars; but that is by no means definite, because a great many "dead beats" gained admission.</p>
   <p>As early as three o'clock, a general exodus became apparent, but the young couples continued dancing until about five o'clock--the time heaven opened its floodgates--and then everyone rushed home.</p>
   <p>While about five thousand people came to the picnic, it is highly improbable that more than three thousand were present at any given time, since many did not stay long. But the crowd seemed to enjoy itself in drinking beer, riding merry-go-rounds, target shooting and playing dice. The ushers were satisfied with the conduct of the crowd, and found no occasion to lend a hand to their blue-coated collegues [police]. Comrades McGuire, Grottkau, Johnson, <pb facs="5418474_6_0230.jpg" n="3"/>and Davoust gave speeches.</p>
   <p>Agitator McGuire</p>
   <p>McGuire spoke in English. He emphasized that the eight-hour movement and communism had nothing in common; that they were independent of each other. He said that any statement linking communism with socialism is scurrilous, and that there is a tremendous difference; any declaration to the contrary is simply untrue. The socialists are accused of being ignorant (and all that is implied thereby), but the cause is to be found in the ruling class. One demands culture of the socialists, but the means to acquire it are withheld. Youth is compelled to work at too early an age. The factories of New England furnish a glaring example of boys and girls who eke out an existence at a tender age. In ameliorating such conditions, a beginning is represented by the eight-hour movement, and the workers of Chicago were among the first who have tried to break the bonds of subjugation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0231.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Comrade Grottkau next appeared, well supplied with oratorical fireworks, and spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"In former years, humility and abstinence were praised; today, we speak of culture, humaneness and civilization. Both dogmas are false, and do not comply with the interests of the people. The proof is evident since, in spite of the country's almost inexhaustible resources, and its sparse population, we have millions of people suffering from starvation. An Asiatic spirit rules America; a few people are worth millions of dollars, and millions of other people endure the pangs of hunger. The liberty we have is the liberty to exploit the people, the subjugation of the poor by the wealthy; it is the kind of liberty that enables the rich class to monopolize it, and to prevent the downtrodden from obtaining freedom; and that is an Asiatic condition. We have here, in America, a few palaces, millions of miserable <pb facs="5418474_6_0232.jpg" n="5"/>hovels, a few educated people, millions who are ignorant; many churches, countless houses of ill-fame, idle shops, crowded jails and prisons, too many institutions of learning and pawnshops, and so forth.</p>
   <p>"The orbits of the stars have been computed; the origin and development of organic life has been ascertained; yet the working people are told the old story about the creation of the world in six days. Lies are proclaimed as truth, and truth is denounced as a lie. Man's fight for existence is more ruthless than that of any fish in the briny deep. The human sharks and octopuses are the real estate speculators, the railroad and trade monopolists, the speculators on the stock exchange, the corn robbers and the bandits who control the press, and so forth.</p>
   <p>"Socialism is the modern Winkelried which will provide an entering wedge for freedom. Long working hours prevent the people from acquiring knowledge, and serve to undermine mind and body. In abolishing long hours, we wipe out the <pb facs="5418474_6_0233.jpg" n="6"/>parasites who thrive on the work of others.</p>
   <p>"The revolutionists of a hundred years ago forgot the followers of the golden calf--and today millions of lives are sacrificed to insatiable greed. Remember, all gods are subordinate to the golden calf, and, so long as laws are administered by corrupt judges who enslave the people, socialism will not be at peace with society. Out motto should be: 'Peace to the hovels, and war to the palaces!' If every despondent man who commits suicide would first kill a millionnaire, then, within a year, we would have no more suicides, and no millionnaires."</p>
   <p>Comrade Johnson</p>
   <p>Comrade Johnson spoke in the Swedish language, and to judge from the acclaim given him, his speech must have been impressive.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0234.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>This Frenchman and communist spoke in his native tongue, eulogizing the heroes who, on October 6, 1789, marched to Versailles and gave the example which was emulated by the Parisian communists on March 22, 1871. While these long-departed benefactors of the people did not accomplish much, their efforts proved of lasting value to future generations, and the Parisian communists of eight years ago accomplished more. The speaker hoped that the movement in America would continue....</p>
   <p>It was fortunate that all the speakers had different audiences and spoke in different languages, otherwise some strange contradictions would have been presented. When it started to rain, the few remaining people sought shelter in the hall and under sheds. Patriotic songs (and beer) marked the end of the festival.</p>
