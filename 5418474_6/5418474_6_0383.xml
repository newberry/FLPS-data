   <p>Through a casual remark made at a conference with representatives of the press, President Roosevelt provided the Republicans with a campaign issue. By so doing, he helped them out of a great dilemma. The opponents of the President sharply attacked his financial and economic policy. They reproached him for not keeping his promise to reduce the costs of administration and to balance the budget. They also upbraided him severely because, under his administration, the national debt has been considerably increased. But they do not say a single word about what he used the money for. The fact that this money was used for the relief of the unemployed, or to provide them with work, is passed over in silence.</p>
   <p>There are good reasons for this. The Republicans do not know, themselves, how they could have avoided spending billions of dollars without starving out the unemployed. They also know that they would have little luck in a campaign with such arguments. If they should demand that relief to the unemployed and <pb facs="5418474_6_0384.jpg" n="2"/>the prevision for emergency works should stop, they would naturally estrange the millions of voters who are now receiving relief or were employed on emergency projects, and this, of course is not their intention. That is why they stick their heads into the sand, criticise the government severely for its huge expenditures, and pretend that they have no idea what the money was spent for.</p>
   <p>Thus the argument constitutes a highly dubious campaign issue. This is why they welcomed one of the President's utterances, during a conference with representatives of the press, which implied that the Constitution is no longer suitable to today's conditions. It is conceivable that Roosevelt should have made the remark following the decision over the N R A, which all but threw all the measures of the New Deal on the junk heap. But whether he is actually determined to use his influence in the direction of changing the Constitution is still very doubtful. Until now, however, he has given no hint of an intention of this sort.</p>
   <p>Yet it seems that the Republicans do not like to wait. They are ready to lead a crusade for the defense of the Constitution, even though it is not <pb facs="5418474_6_0385.jpg" n="3"/>threatened at all, and while they are at it they make it appear that changing the Constitution would be a heinous crime. They are forgetting completely that the Constitution has been changed before, that Constitutions of all countries are changed occasionally, and thus adapted to altered conditions. Until now, there have been twenty-one amendments to the Constitution. The first ten are called the Bill of Rights, and contain those principles which really belong in the Constitution proper, and which, to a certain extent constitute the basis of the country's entire political life. The other eleven, however, are real changes. Some of them fill out gaps, but are innovations of far-reaching effect. Over all these amendments, sharp debates were conducted, but even the most ardent opponents of these amendments did not call their advocates criminals, monsters, traitors, or enemies of the fatherland.</p>
   <p>The manner in which this issue is submitted to the public is a conscious distortion of facts. First of all, the Constitution is nothing holy or sublime, which may not be touched under any circumstances. There is a provision in the Constitution itself which expressly offers a method for the introduction of <pb facs="5418474_6_0386.jpg" n="4"/>changes, a method that has often been resorted to. Moreover, the motives of those people who strive for constitutional changes are not objectionable. It is therefore hardly to be expected that the Republicans will have any luck with an artificial issue that has been falsely represented. It seems that they want to continue their old policy of opportunism. They do not dare criticise the real mistakes and blunders of the Roosevelt administration, because they are afraid of losing votes.</p>
