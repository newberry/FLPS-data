   <p>An article from a newspaper published in Hannibal, Missouri was sent to us, and from it we infer that mob rule is gaining ground in regions near the boundaries of the free states. The article contains nothing less than a "list of Republicans, Black Republicans, and Abolitionists". It is evidently a proscription list, which is preceded by the following introduction:</p>
   <p>"Following is a list of the names of the men of this city and county who voted for Abraham Lincoln in the last presidential election. We have divided them into three classes, according to the information which we were able to obtain concerning them. All those whose names are marked by an asterisk we believe to be respectable, law-abiding citizens who would not be guilty of an act unworthy of a gentleman or a liberty-loving <pb facs="5418474_6_0361.jpg" n="2"/>citizen. Those whose names are marked with a double-bar cross are, in our opinion, still a step away from the abolitionists, while those whose names are marked with a single-bar cross are most certainly full-fledged abolitionists. The persons whose names bear no mark are not known to us."</p>
   <p>This infamous item lists the names of about two hundred men. Here are a few: J. W. Teichmann, J. M. Fritz, Albert Eisle. [Translator's note: The names of thirty-six other persons are given. With three exceptions they are all Germans. Among them are seven merchants, and alderman, and a doctor.] A Mr. W. C. Doane is listed with the remark: "This man says that a Negro would be justified in killing his master in order to gain freedom. He left the city this morning."</p>
   <p>Citizens of this Republic are thus denounced to the mob because they dared to exercise their constitutional rights. It is high time that the friends of liberty and the Constitution unite and prevent the despotism of slave-holders from making further headway. Will any German Democratic newspaper <pb facs="5418474_6_0362.jpg" n="3"/>be so shameless as to defend mob rule, and write about violations of the Constitution by the North, after being reliably informed of actions like the foregoing committed by the defenders of slavery?</p>
