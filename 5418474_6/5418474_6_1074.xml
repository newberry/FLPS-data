   <p>The developments in the stock market during the last few weeks have been veritable eye openers for many who refused to listen before. The craving for quick, effortless gain has been the ruination of hundreds of thousands throughout the land, tens of thousands in our own city. These people lost considerable sums, possibly all of their savings, the accumulation of years of painstaking effort.</p>
   <p>Will it be a lesson for the future? In conformity to general predictions and based on present experiences, a general reversion of public sentiment is noticeable. The people now favor real estate - "A change of sentiment"- does not the sense in these few words expose the entire nonsense to which <pb facs="5418474_6_1075.jpg" n="2"/>the general public had subscribed - in as far as their hard-earned money is concerned?</p>
   <p>Investment of capital should not be based on sentiment, tips, luck, or opinion. It must be ruled by science. This knowledge is not obtainable from "good friends," nor from neighbors or relatives. It is procurable only through experts and scientific analysis.</p>
   <p>Bonds, building and loan mortgages are secured by real estate. Obviously real estate must be the foundation of all other investments, and, therefore, the safest. This represents one phase of investment science. Chicago real estate is the most prolific, profit yielding investment we have today and it appears at present to be the best on earth for the next decade. Why - how so? The experts know it and this represents the second factor of investment science.</p>
   <p>Why is the public uninformed and why do people act only according to their <pb facs="5418474_6_1076.jpg" n="3"/>moods? Or rely on luck - for better or worse - following the suggestions of uninformed advisors or unscrupulous schemers? Either because no opportunity exists to ascertain the truth, or many are too indifferent to benefit from available information.</p>
   <p>Chicago faces a rise in real estate values unequalled in its history, thanks to the impending traction settlement, the opening of the "Lakes to the Gulf waterway," the immense increase in industries and population, and the World's Fair preparations scheduled for next spring. The experts are aware of this and the public ought to know it! Will the Germans participate in the greatest of possibilities that ever presented themselves in this or other American cities; profits that are realizable within the near future? Or will they stand aside and look on as others become financially independent in a few years? They can hear, read about it, and be instructed, aided by capable, honest, German guidance. This will prepare our German people for the great city development which is due in the immediate future. The German Real Estate Company of Chicago, known as The Greater Chicago Investment Company, <pb facs="5418474_6_1077.jpg" n="4"/>(not incorporated) offers to the Germans every possibility to study and investigate facts in their true light - without obligation. As a "reliable organization" it believes in exemplory management. As a member of the Real Estate Board of Chicago, it subscribes to the ethical laws of the National Real Estate Board of America; as a member of the Chicago Association of Commerce it enjoys incontestable and true information from the most reliable sources - Constant protection is given to its investors by insuring them in large companies, thereby providing money in case of sickness, accident, death, and even temporary unemployment. This guarantees protection to the investor.</p>
   <p>In serving the German public and in view of the impending rise in Chicago real estate values, the Greater Chicago Investment Company, (not incorporated) has arranged to give free instruction without obligation to participants. These lessons are given in German. The course comprises three lectures, one per week, during evening hours, also free participation in all investigations and inspection trips which the firm provides. Persons interested in this <pb facs="5418474_6_1078.jpg" n="5"/>course will kindly send their names and addresses, including a few lines, whereupon detailed information will be mailed. No molestation nor visiting agents!</p>
   <p>Announcement!</p>
