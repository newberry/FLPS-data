   <p>Our first mortgage gold bonds have at all times proved themselves the most stable of all investment values, including U.S. Government bonds. During good times and bad, also during and after the war, our gold bonds persistently kept their full value and could be sold directly at any time. Our first mortgage gold bonds are quite secure, they represent a first mortgage on improved property, land and buildings in selected locations in Chicago. The income from rents is in all cases quite sufficient to pay the interest on the principal. This is why our gold bonds are unsurpassed as capital investment. Because of our conscientious business transactions, we rejoice in the confidence of thousands of satisfied customers in all parts of America, and even abroad. Not one of them ever suffered a loss from our first mortgage gold bonds. This is the best proof, and affords the best assurance of reliability.</p>
   <p>We always have an abundant selection of 6Â½% and 7% first mortgage gold bonds <pb facs="5418474_6_1115.jpg" n="2"/>in denominations of $100, $500, and $1,000 on hand. Please turn to us for detailed description with illustrations. Please call or write (German or English).</p>
   <p>We have had thirty-nine years' experience in all branches of the banking business.</p>
