   <p>John Herting died at his residence, 332 North Market Street, yesterday evening after an illness of nearly four months. His demise will be greatly regretted by all who knew him, since there are few Chicago Germans who had more friends or enjoyed greater popularity.</p>
   <p>John Herting was born in the Rhenish Palatinate, Germany, in 1818 and came to Chicago with his family in the year 1848. He was diligent and frugal and became prosperous within a short time; he always helped others when the need arose.</p>
   <p>During the years 1868 and 1869 he was a member of the city council, representing the Fifteenth Ward. In 1871 he was a candidate on the so-called "fireproof ticket" and was elected county commissioner; he was re-elected two years later.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1876 Mr. Herting withdrew from public activities to manage his</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1215.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>extensive properties.</p>
   <p>He was one of the largest stockholders in the German Savings Bank and one of Henry Greenebaum's principal supporters in the latter's financial operations.</p>
   <p>At the time of the great fire he was a director of the Home Fire Insurance Company and lost heavily, besides incurring the destruction of his own property on the North Side.</p>
   <p>He was one of the oldest members of St. Joseph's parish and prominent in Catholic circles.</p>
   <p>He had been married more than thirty years. His wife died fourteen months ago, and he never fully recovered from the shock. About four months ago he became bedridden, and yesterday death relieved him after months of suffering.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1216.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He is deeply mourned by his son and his three stepsons, the Dieden brothers, who are all well to do. He left a fairly large fortune.</p>
   <p>John Herting's funeral is scheduled for next Monday at St. Joseph's Church.</p>
