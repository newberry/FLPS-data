  <body>
   <p>A man who was highly respected in all circles of the city, Henry Utpatel, passed away at his home, 1141 North Sacramento Ave. yesterday. He died, in all probability from the effects of a serious operation, which he underwent two years ago.</p>
   <p>The deceased was born in Chicago in 1870, attended the German Lutheran school, and acquired in his youth a manifold knowledge. Later he studied law. He practiced law with great success, almost up to his death, playing a prominent part in public affairs. He was four times elected Alderman of the old 15th Ward, the first time in 1908, and twice he was honored by being appointed a master in chancery, the first time by State's Attorney Crowe, the second time by Judge Steffens.</p>
   <p>Henry Utpatel was a very active member of the Evangelical Lutheran Concordia congregation, was the attorney of the Concordia Mutual League, belonged to the Hamilton Club and was an active member of the Ridgemoor Golf Club, also several other societies.</p>

   <p>He will be mourned by his widow, and a large circle of friends and acquaintances. The funeral will be held Monday afternoon at the Concordia cemetery, from the Evangelical Lutheran St. Johns church, Hoyne Ave. and Walton Pl.</p>
