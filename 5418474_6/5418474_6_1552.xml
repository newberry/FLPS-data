   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Philharmonic orchestra in the North Side Turner Hall, under the aegis of the Chicago Turner Society, was well attended. Besides the predominating German audience, many Anglo-Americans and representatives of other nationalities were present, which serves as the best proof that the popular Sunday afternoon concerts receive well deserved appreciation in wider circles all the time.</p>
   <p>The program contained a tasty selection of light, pleasant melodious music, which received general acclamation. After a stirring opening March of Sousa, "Semper Fidelis", Weber's romantic ever youthful "Euryanthe Overture" was played, positively the most musically valuable of the 12 numbers. Unanimous applause was given for cleverly arranged tunes from a number of modern operettas by Roberts, the rousing march "Espana" by Waldteufel and a hunting scene by Bucalosi. Mr. Howard Preston, as soloist sang four arias and ballads. Preston is not a newcomer, but an experienced concert singer, who not only enjoys an enviable reputation in Chicago, but also is known in the prominent circles of Europe.</p>

   <p>A striking proof of his understanding was given with the difficult aria "Vision Fair" from Masseuet's "Heriodode". During the latter part of the concert, he sang three beautiful songs, "All Saints", by Strauss, Kann's "The Victor" and Giblert's "Pirate Song". The conductor Fritz Renk, in conjuction with Franz Polesney performed Lange's often heard "grandmother" for two violins. The melodious, but otherwise not very outstanding composition of the well known composer met with great applause. Played by two artists on the violin, the piece sounded as if it had been clad in a new dress.</p>
