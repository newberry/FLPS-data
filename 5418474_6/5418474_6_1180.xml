   <p>Several American Newspapers lately have stressed the fact, that freed negroes are spreading all over the Southwest and have become successful farmers, particularly in Texas.</p>
   <p>According to the standpoint of these newspapers, the white settler has lost a lot of his ancesters' pioneering ambition and gradually became lazy.</p>
   <p>For the sake of the good name of our German Farmers, who are living in the Southwest, we must add a few words concerning their situation. The German Farmers in Texas are doing their utmost to produce and progress, as they are going along to develop their farms. Everywhere you can watch them tilling the soil-men and boys- while their women and girls are taking care of the garden, chickens and cows. Thus while they are growing crops for the market, they are raising their own food for the winter. In all their ways, the German Farmers of the Southwest are systematical, economical, industrious,-and prosper well.</p>
