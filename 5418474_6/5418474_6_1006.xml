   <p>The German teachers of Chicago had another meeting at the North Side Turner Hall, which fortunately, was very well attended. The chief topic discussed was the teacher's convention in Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>Again the assembly gave its approval to the idea of organizing a German teachers' club in Chicago. Dr. Zimmerman explained more fully how a similar club had existed ten years ago, but how it had been very difficult to keep it going, because of Chicago's vast expansion. He added, however, that he would gladly welcome the revival of such a club, - <pb facs="5418474_6_1007.jpg" n="2"/>that he is deeply convinced of its usefulness, and that the new organization will find in him a true friend. A committee was appointed to draw up statutes to be submitted at the next teacher's meeting in September.</p>
