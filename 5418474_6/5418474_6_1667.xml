   <p>Hardly arrived at the height of his marvelous, artistic career, Leopold Damrosch has been taken away from his family and from all Germans in America by a sudden death. The sad news, flashed to all parts of the United States, struck everywhere like a thunderbolt.</p>
   <p>The grief, caused by his death, can be lessened only by the comfort to know that his last days and weeks on earth have been filled with friendly impressions of life, - and that these impressions were not disturbed by any presentiments of fate.</p>
   <p>The report of his death came like a crushing blow to those, who not alone know him as a talented artist but also as a friendly, tender-feeling, broad-minded, sympathetic character.</p>
   <p>Will the deceased be survived by his great work - which has been to build a <pb facs="5418474_6_1668.jpg" n="2"/>home for German music on American soil?? Will he have a successor, who, by a combination of a profound musical knowledge and an amiable, noble character, can hold together the great enterprise?? For the moment, the program, worked out by Leopold Damrosch, is safeguarded in all its details and arrangements. The continuance of anything, created by Leopold Damrosch, would be the most expressive monument to the memory of his genius.</p>
