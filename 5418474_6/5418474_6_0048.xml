   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The capitalists and the lords of industry have decreed that the closed circle which is responsible for the continued high cost of living must be broken by a decrease in food prices; that the producers of food, the American farmers, must make the first sacrifice. To begin decreasing living expenses by lowering wages is out of the question because of the wide-spread dissatisfaction and general unrest in labor circles. Again, industry does not want to begin lowering the prices on its products as long as the cost of labor remains at its present high level. So the farmer must be the goat. And since farmers are not as well organized as are workers and employers, they will be able to offer less organized opposition to a "reconstruction" such as is described above.</p>
   <p>But it is just from this viewpoint that we must consider the marketing of farm produce today, because so many people in our country are simply demanding <pb facs="5418474_6_0049.jpg" n="2"/>a decrease in the cost of living. Indeed, various conditions connected with the marketing of food, as well as with the development of our social life, have given rise to much uneasiness in every part of the United States. For instance, attention is called especially to the fact that our Federal Food Administrators have obligated our country to place up to sixty per cent of our available supply of butter at the disposal of England and the other Allies in Europe at a relatively low price, while we in America must pay one half as much more per pound for this produce. Even if we make allowance for possible political motives of a partisan nature, the fact remains that many people from every walk of life, and from every corner of our country, are making numerous and bitter complaints against our government because it did not take more effective precautions against a general rise in the cost of living during the war. Of course, in times such as the present, any and every government would be made the object of such accusations by one or the other party.</p>
   <p>But one thing is certain, and that is this: It is absolutely imperative that <pb facs="5418474_6_0050.jpg" n="3"/>we pay very close attention to the labor movement and to the general social unrest in their relation to the cost of living. It is undeniably true that unemployment is increasing, and the American Federation of Labor predicts bread lines by May, unless a forcible reduction in the cost of living is made very soon.</p>
   <p>Congress is being urged from many quarters to bring an immediate decrease in the price of the necessities of life, but Congress has obligated itself, by solemn promise to the farmers, to keep the cost of living at the present level by guaranteeing them relatively high minimum prices for their products. In order to stimulate production of agricultural products, Congress has already proposed an appropriation of 1250 million dollars; it intends to use this money to force the retention of high prices through control of the market. For the present it is concerned with the price of this year's winter wheat and of pork. Government authorities at Washington are giving their attention to these two items and will make a report within the next day or two. Judging from conditions in general we believe that the Government will make every effort to keep its promise to the farmers by maintaining its high price <pb facs="5418474_6_0051.jpg" n="4"/>policies, especially since a very important year for politics is close at hand.</p>
   <p>No doubt, the officers of the Government are fully prepared to defend its price regulating policy. With that calm determination which has always characterized Wilson's administration, they are beginning to carry out the policy of forcible maintenance of high price levels. This is apparent from the request for the necessary money and from the fact that the Government has published full information regarding the manner in which it will carry on its wheat business.....</p>
