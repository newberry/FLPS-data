   <p>Freedom of speech is the sacred right of every citizen, and freedom of the press is the foundation of every healthy government. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Washington, said no government should object to censors, meaning, of course, public criticism of the administration. He also added that freedom of the press could be looked upon as the best censor. Jefferson, the eminent jurist from Virginia, who drafted the document of American independence, was also the champion who advocated freedom of the press in America. He alone was responsible that no censorship was imposed upon the press of this Nation.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the press and the public must unite in watching and defending <pb facs="5418474_6_0414.jpg" n="2"/>this great privilege of ours, lest we should be deprived of that jewel, the freedom of speech. It may be recalled that the Supreme Court was called upon last June to pronounce a verdict about a law in Minnesota, which for two long years has muzzled the press of that State.....The press of the Nation became immediately aware of the fact that the law of muzzling the press would not be confined to the State of Minnesota, moreover, the freedom of the press was jeopardized generally. The newspaper syndicate of America united in the fight against suppression, of free speech, and emerged victoriously. The outstanding point in this legal battle was the fact that five members of the Supreme Court assented, while four dissented to the retention of freedom of the press. This indicated sufficiently that we have to unite our efforts against a possible recurrence of an attempt to subdue the press in future, as we did in the past. To introduce similar laws as was the case in Minnesota would be a simple procedure in any State of the Union, in which unscrupulous politicians wish to silence their critics by the method of suppression of the press. What if in <pb facs="5418474_6_0415.jpg" n="3"/>another instance the majority members of the Supreme Court would render a decision which would approve and uphold the muzzling of the press?</p>
   <p>Therefore, it would be needless to emphasize the importance of keeping the interest in the freedom of the press alive.</p>
   <p>The Committee for Freedom of the Press of the Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which has acquired the home of the former President, now a national shrine, has proposed to dedicate one room of this sanctuary to the Freedom of the Press. High dignitaries from every State of the Union will participate at the dedication ceremonies which will be held on October 20 of this year. The press of the Nation will, of course, be represented in its entirety. Thus, the occasion will present itself for an explanation of the significance of that day, which may be observed annually henceforth.</p>
   <p>In order to prevent misinterpretations, it is well to emphasize here that <pb facs="5418474_6_0416.jpg" n="4"/>this is not a case of propaganda for newspapers, but rather indicative of the right of the American people to defend a heritage for which their forefathers have shed their blood, and which the present generation must uphold. The American people can righteously consider themselves a free people, only then if they persist in defending and upholding this precious heritage, the freedom of speech. Freedom of the press, a principle upon which this Nation was founded, should be closely guarded at all times, and if attacked, must be fought for, and regained at any price.</p>
