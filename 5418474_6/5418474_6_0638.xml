   <p>The President is proceeding on his course of firm determination. It is evident from the dispatches which have been appearing in our telegram column that by January 27 he had taken supreme command over all fighting forces on land and sea. By publishing his order of January 27, and placing it at the head of the orders which he issued March 8 and March 11, he makes a grave accusation against McClellan. As our readers may see from the order of January 27, the President ordered the Commander of the Potomac Army and the Armies of the West to be ready to advance February 22, and made General McClellan responsible for the execution of this order. The order of March 8 is an odd commentary on the first order, for in the second order the President commands McClellan to immediately prepare the Potomac Army for field operations, and concludes: "This order is to be executed promptly, so that <pb facs="5418474_6_0639.jpg" n="2"/>the beginning of the operations of the Potomac Army is not delayed any longer." Having received this curt command, General McClellan was finally persuaded to leave his comfortable headquarters at Washington, and to establish an office in the midst of the Potomac Army. To show that he was indeed in earnest and would tolerate no further disobedience, President Lincoln issued a statement on March 11 to the effect that General McClellan had been relieved of the command over the other departments, and that henceforth his authority would be restricted to the Army of the Potomac.</p>
   <p>So McClellan is General of the Army of the Potomac for the time being, or, to use the polite language of the President, "until further notice". That means that the General must now advance and defeat the enemy, or his curtailed command will be taken from him. We hope that McClellan who is not devoid of ability and military knowledge, will, as General of the Army of the Potomac, make amends for the grievous sins of omission which he committed <pb facs="5418474_6_0640.jpg" n="3"/>as General of the United States Army.</p>
   <p>By a single stroke of the pen the President's order of March 11 puts an end to the department which the notorious Hunter, by his infamous machinations, stole from Fremont, and also to the department of General Buell; it unites these departments with the Mississippi Department, with General Halleck in command "until further notice".</p>
   <p>The order of March 11 very expressly provides also that all the territory west of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi shall constitute a special department, and that Fremont shall be in command of it. So Fremont's Department comprises a part of Virginia and Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, etc.--in short, that part of the theatre of war on which the decisive battle will be fought.</p>
   <p>Thus the Pathfinder triumphs over all his enemies, and the dirty Blair <pb facs="5418474_6_0641.jpg" n="4"/>clique, headed by the tippler Frank, and by Montgomery who "wrote so many letters," and, last but not least, by Hunter, who is a master at retreating, may now shiver in their shoes. This Presidential order involves a veritable revolution in the operation of the war. Henceforth he and his able Secretary of State will be in supreme command of all fighting forces on land and at sea, and now there are but three departments: the Potomac Department, the Mississippi Department, and the Fremont Department, and the instructions of the Commander of the latter Department are: "Let us have action!"</p>
   <p>The better parts of the Republican and the Democratic party share in Fremont's triumph; we refer to those Republicans and Democrats, who, like the Germans of Chicago, loyally stood by Fremont when the Government and the scum of the parties had conspired to annihilate him.</p>
   <p>Fremont's political and military genius and his honesty are pledges that he will use the great power invested in him by the President, who is fully equal <pb facs="5418474_6_0642.jpg" n="5"/>to the situation, to restore the unity and freedom of the Republic. Again we hear:</p>
   <p>Hurrah! Hurrah! from hill and valley,</p>
   <p>Hurrah! from prairie wide and free!</p>
   <p>Around our glorious Chieftain rally,</p>
   <p>For Union and for Liberty!</p>
   <p>Let him who first her wilds exploring,</p>
   <p>Her virgin beauty gave to fame,</p>
   <p>Now save her from the curse and shame</p>
   <p>Which slavery o'er her soil is pouring.</p>
   <p>Our standard-bearer then the brave</p>
   <p>Pathfinder be!</p>
   <p>Free Speech, Free Press, Free Soil, Free Men,</p>
   <p>Fremont and Victory!</p>
