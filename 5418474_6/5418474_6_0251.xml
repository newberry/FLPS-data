   <p>Those persons who have never shuddered in Chicago will have no occasion to acquire goose-pimples on July Fourth. The bloody revolution, which was announced in so many incendiary speeches by the communists, will not take place. The communist defence clubs will not appear; only the nineteen Bohemian riflemen, without weapons, will be in the parade. A place has been given to the nineteen, who will march in the July Fourth parade in the cause of the eight-hour day. But no education and defence club, no hunter's club, will march to the picnic grounds. The only armed people will be the regular city police who, according to the program, form a part of the regular parade, and who will be present in several divisions.</p>
   <p>And so, no flaunting of the militia law, which became effective on July 1, will be involved in the parade.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0252.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The nineteen Bohemian sharpshooters would show up more advantageously if Judge McAllister would lead them. However, as the men will leave their guns at home, nothing can be done as far as the law is at issue; they are sharp-shooters by brevet and, as such, cannot be excluded from the parade.</p>
   <p>A peaceful July Fourth for Chicago is due mostly to two causes. First of all, several trade unions refused to participate in the demonstration on July Fourth, if any transgression of the law was to be contemplated; and, second, the communist leaders, whose brains show better development than their mouths realize that any rebellion, even if successful at the start, could only result in complete dissolution of the party.</p>
   <p>The Illinois militia law, which became effective on July 1, and which forbids exercising and parading with arms, except with the permission of the governor, is by no means a new thing in the United States. Similar laws have been in force for years in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and are enforced without opposition.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0253.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Now, as far as the Chicago communistic defence clubs are concerned, they have dropped the plan, advocated by some "rabble-rousers," to resort to defiance. Also, the proposal to make a test case was given up; it had been decided that the defence clubs should appear in full regalia in the parade, and thus provide an opportunity to be arrested, during the parade or thereafter.</p>
   <p>Steps have already been taken to question the constitutionality of the militia law. A small division of the education and defence club marched and exercised in order to be arrested and so provide a test case.</p>
   <p>The matter will thus be adjudged by the courts in regular order, and may even reach the State Supreme Court, who will decide whether the militia law is constitutional or not. So, even the militia law gives no cause to worry.</p>
   <p>The only concession to the fear-invoking element is provided in the appointment of Dr. D. K. Schmidt as festival speaker at the picnic. He will speak in favor of the eight-hour day; the speech is to be in German.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0254.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But no one need worry about the doctor; in selecting the man who advocated revolt against the militia law, and letting him appear as festival speaker on the very day when the communists proclaim their obedience to the law, just shows that the committee which chose the doctor considers his address to be given on the Fourth of July as a speech of sheer buncombe.</p>
