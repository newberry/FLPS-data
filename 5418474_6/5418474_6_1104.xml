   <p>Martin L. Strauss, President of the Hartman Furniture and Carpet Company, has just returned from a stay in California to personally supervise the firm's special sale which, for the duration of one week, will be unique in its kind.</p>
   <p>The sale, to last for seven days, will be designated "National Hartman Week", and will take place simultaneously in all seventeen Hartman stores in Chicago and other cities. The occasion for it, as stated by Mr. Strauss, was induced by the rapid and phenomenal growth of the Hartman business and the increase of its customers in all parts of the country. This is what Mr. Strauss has to say of the sale, which is to last from April 10 to 17.</p>
   <p>"We are dealing here more with a celebration and with an advantage for the public than with a sale or with the intention of gaining a large profit. A <pb facs="5418474_6_1105.jpg" n="2"/>National Hartman Week in intervals of six months will be retained from now on as a lasting feature. In times when manufacturers are loaded with manufactured products and are forced to seek disposal of their wares at low prices, we decided to make enormous purchases by which we are enabled to sell good merchandise of the latest make to our customers at the lowest possible prices. Our customers do not have to wait for the usual sale, such as those announced from time to time by other stores. While the latter sell old merchandise, we offer our customers only new.</p>
   <p>"Speaking, as I do, in the name of the directors and officials of the Hartman enterprise, I should like to state that the steady growth of the seventeen Hartman stores signifies, in a way, the realization of a dream to make the Hartman service so perfect and to extend it to such a degree that our organization would have the reputation of being far ahead of all business enterprises of its kind.</p>
   <p>"Besides the twelve-story store in the city's loop district, on Wabash Avenue and Adams Street, the firm conducts nine similar stores in various parts of <pb facs="5418474_6_1106.jpg" n="3"/>the city. It also has large stores in Denver, Omaha, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and St. Joseph, Missouri."</p>
