   <p>Three prominent organizations are in favor of free distribution of school books.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the Alliance of German Clubs of Chicago and the executives of the Chicago Federation of Labor attended a meeting yesterday, at which a protest to be sent today in all probability to the deputies of the Chicago Legislature was taken under advisement.</p>
   <p>The text of the protest reads a follows: We perceive with growing astonishment the opposition of various German-Catholic as well as Lutheran communities and societies against the pending legislation, according to which it would be within the jurisdiction of the School Board to supply the pupils of public schools with textbooks free of charge. However, the communities and societies referred to, are giving the false impression that the opposition toward this pending legislation is shared equally by all German-Americans and also by people of other nationalities. Therefore, the Alliance of the German Societies of Chicago, in conjunction <pb facs="5418474_6_0105.jpg" n="2"/>with the Turner Association of Chicago, including the local branches, and the Chicago Federation of Labor, defend their stand in favor of the legislation of free distribution of textbooks among pupils of public schools. Following are facts and figures which justify our stand:</p>
   <p>1. In twenty-four of the forty-eight states comprising the United States of America, textbooks are distributed free of charge whether or not this is in compliance with the law.</p>
   <p>2. The system of free distribution of school books has been adopted by the majority of our large cities throughout the states. The city of Philadelphia has supplied its public schools with textbooks free of charge, since the year 1818, while a similar system has existed in the city of New York since time immemorial.</p>
   <p>3. The system of free distribution of textbooks in public schools has not only found general approval, but it has also given evidence of great saving. <pb facs="5418474_6_0106.jpg" n="3"/>Mr. E. G. Cooley, superintendent of public schools of Chicago, who in the capacity of agent for various book sellers has gathered valuable experience, revealed to us the othef day that the profit of those firms which supply schools operating under the free book distribution system is considerably less than in the reverse case.</p>
   <p>4. The present system permitting free distribution of school-books to children of poor parents only, from "funds reserved for the poor", can not be maintained indefinitely without harmful consequence. We are not in a position to hire detectives for the investigation of individual cases applying for free school-books. The fact alone that these books bear the stamp of the School Board signifies the social inequality of the less fortunate child.</p>
   <p>5. The school boards of the Eastern States have announced that in the absence of any other plausible motive in the defense of the free textbook distribution system, the reason stated in No. 4. is regarded as quite sufficient. Futhermore, the textbooks should be distributed <pb facs="5418474_6_0107.jpg" n="4"/>free of charge among all pupils attending public schools on the first day of each new school year. Due to numerous formalities under the present system, poor children are not supplied with textbooks for weeks and even months after the re-opening of the schools.</p>
   <p>6. The Chicago Board of Education has at its disposal sufficient "fund-books" to supply at least fifty per cent of the students with study material. This throws an illuminating light on the fact that the expenditure on this program would be rather low if the law of uniformity is adopted.</p>
   <p>7. Objections and arguments based on the possibility that books supplied by the Board of Education may be a medium of spreading contagious diseases, may safely be dismissed.</p>
   <p>8. This much-discussed system will undoubtedly be hailed by every citizen throughout the State of Illinois, since change of residence is not an infrequent occurrence, and thus, textbooks used in one school would not meet with the requirements of another under the present system.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0108.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>9. Every campaign against free textbook distribution, is that much grist for the mill of the publishers who denounce any legal measure of that kind in defense of their interests.</p>
