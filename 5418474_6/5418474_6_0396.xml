   <p>Next Thursday the American people will celebrate Thanksgiving in the traditional manner. Thanksgiving will be observed this year, as in preceeding years, with mixed emotions. In good years, when every American family has a turkey or goose in the pot, all are glad to give thanks, even though the thanks are expressed by excessive indulgence in food and drink. Thankfulness is generally expressed by families in huge family feasts; and on this day, everyone, large or small, considers it his duty to make strong demands on his stomach. Apparently it is for this purpose that schools suspend classes, not only on Thanksgiving Day, but also on the following Friday, since experience has taught that a large part of the pupils have to remain at home after the holiday because of their upset stomachs. In public institutions, too, places of public welfare as well as prisons--if the latter can be numbered among the former--it is customary to distribute holiday food on that day. The average American is convinced that <pb facs="5418474_6_0397.jpg" n="2"/>his share of Thanksgiving turkey and the accompanying cranberry sauce has been guaranteed him in the Bill of Rights of the Federal Constitution.</p>
   <p>Upon the fat years have now followed the lean ones, in which the Thanksgiving turkey has taken the shape of a skinny chicken; and in some families its annual resurrection has been abandoned in every shape and form. Along with the turkey every disposition for being thankful has disappeared. One has become conditioned in good times, and believe he owes thanks only when the contents of the horn of plenty of our American prosperity are spread over our holiday table. Today, when in many homes scarcity has become the kitchen chef, one has to adjust himself to whatever there is, whether he likes it or not; but one also assumes that he has the right to wear a long face and to dispense with thanks.</p>
   <p>When the first Thanksgiving festival was celebrated in America, the newly arrived settlers of this country did not have it so easy, either. Hard times were behind them, but they were thankful that they had been able to pull through. To be sure, they had turkeys, for at that time these fowl were running wild in large numbers <pb facs="5418474_6_0398.jpg" n="3"/>in the forests of New England, ready to be prepared for the frying pan. Today turkeys are more rare, they can no longer be brought down behind the house with an old shooting iron. Instead, we have today a great many things that render our existence more humane and more pleasant, things of which the pilgrims of 1621 could not have dreamed in the Plymouth of old. Let us bear in mind that the progress our entire way of living has made during the two hundred years, the physical and spiritual joys which we accept today with an air of confidence, were quite unattainable for them who sat at the first Thanksgiving table. The very same ones who today voice their dissatisfaction because they lack many things they consider indispensable would scarcely want to change places with the Pilgrims; they would look upon their lives as unbearable if they were suddenly transported back across two hundred years of history. They would wish they could return to our present times as soon as possible, preferring them to the "good, old" times in spite of all the wants and privations.</p>
   <p>Of course it is deplorable that the present-day economic set up has deprived many human beings of their means for subsistence, that many, notwithstanding all <pb facs="5418474_6_0399.jpg" n="4"/>other cares, have to suffer want on the day of Thanksgiving. We are sorry to say that the individual can do nothing about it, as the conditions have proven to be beyond our control. A comparison, however, with other countries shows that Americans, even those who are very poor, are still better situated than many a non-American, thanks to a sense of community welfare that prevails among our people. They have, at least, the knowledge that there is a desire to help him in his need and that there is a sincere hope that the endeavor which arises from this desire will be crowned with success.</p>
