   <p>Last Wednesday, the German Club of Governesses, arranged a successful concert in the Bethany Home, at 827 Center St. The profits of the performance were designed to secure a room for the club at the new Bethany Home, a purpose which was fully accomplished.</p>
   <p>The singing performances by Hella Reinholz and Louise Fleiner, who were accompanied by Mrs. Mackensen on the piano, were excellent, and all those who took part in this concert, were greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>After the concert refreshments were served and all participants enjoyed themselves immensely. Miss A. Kriegseisen who is very active for the club, announces that a meeting takes place every first Wednesday of the month, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, at the new Bethany Home. All German governesses are cordially invited.</p>
