   <p>Headquarters of German Rifle Company,</p>
   <p>August 17, 1861.</p>
   <p>Dear Fellow Citizens: Today we are opening a recruiting station to organize an infantry company of riflemen which will be taken into active service immediately. We are depending not only on our comrades of the Reserve Rifle Company, many of whom would rather march against the enemy than serve in the ranks of Home Guards, to report to us, but also on all other patriotic citizens who are able to bear arms and who wish to attach themselves to a good rifle company.</p>
   <p>Further information may be had at the recruiting station located in Newberry's block on North Wells Street.</p>
   <p>H. Eschenburg,</p>
   <p>A. Borcherdt,</p>
   <p>A. Block.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0703.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(Editor's note: Mr. H. Eschenburg has been captain of the North Side Home Guards. He has his company well organized and has given them an excellent military training. He is a person in whom everyone who wishes to go to war for the Union may have the utmost confidence. We do not doubt in the least that this new company will be an excellent one. Ho! then, all you who have hesitated before, our country needs defenders!)</p>
