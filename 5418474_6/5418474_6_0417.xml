   <p>Dr. Friedrich F. Schrager declared to the representatives of the Chicago press that he considers British propaganda as dangerous to the United States; and supports the attacks made by Mayor Thompson against the "British Lion" as a patriotic, heroic, and necessary deed.</p>
   <p>Dr. Schrager, who was summoned by the mayor to appear as a witness in the proceedings against the former president of the school administration, William McAndrew, is the editor-in-chief of the magazine The Progressive, Polished by the Steuben Club. He is a well known historian, whose writings "The Germans in the making of America," "Our Debt to France," and numerous pamphlets on historical subjects, have found a large reading public in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0418.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dr. Schrager arrived here this morning on the "Twentieth Century" from New York, and will remain in Chicago until the end of this week. Dr. Schrager received the representatives of the Chicago press in the reception rooms of the National Historical Society in the Bankers building. Soon a heated debate ensued concerning the definition of British propaganda.</p>
   <p>Dr. Schrager indorses the views of Washington that the United States should be on friendly terms with all the other nations, but should show no preference to any in particular.</p>
   <p>"Once already the Constitution of the United States has been violated on account of British propaganda," he declared. "It states in the Constitution that America shall take up arms against another country only in defense of its own soil." Therefore, it is quite possible that English propaganda will once more influence the American people in favor of England.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0419.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Dr. Schrager said "that he distrusts especially the plea in favor of an "English speaking union," which is promoted by the English."</p>
   <p>Upon the question whether he condemns all foreign political propaganda in the United States, Dr. Schrager replied, "that at the present time, only England and France are indulging in it." "A cultural propaganda, as it is, for instance, pursued by Germany can only benefit a country."</p>
   <p>The press then asked for his opinion on the burning of pro-British books. He declared " such procedure to be stupid and absurd."</p>
   <p>He added, however, that libraries should also secure books which defend opposite viewpoints to counteract this British propaganda.</p>
   <p>Dr. Schrager, the son of a German-American was born in Hamburg. Germany, and brought up in America. In the next few days he will, together, with the former Chief Justice Frederick Bausman, support the Mayor in his campaign against King George.</p>
