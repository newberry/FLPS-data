<title level="a">MEETING OF THE WIRTHSVEREIN</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers Association) held its regular monthly meeting at the Northside Turnhalle yesterday afternoon. Louis Schwuchow was chairman. After the minutes of the preceeding meeting had been read and accepted, the assembly proceeded with the agenda. A report on current business submitted by the Committee on Legal Problems was adopted.</p>
   <p>Since a meeting of all the committees to examine the books of the last fiscal year proved somewhat unsuccessful because not all the members appeared, it was decided that Moritz Wassermann and the secretary, Mr. Moehrlein, should check the books jointly.</p>
   <p>Paul Mueller urged all members to attend a meeting scheduled for last evening, and to prevent passage of any resolutions which would be harmful to Judge Kaufmann. [Translator's note: The reference is to the opposition to the appointment of Kaufmann as Justice of the Peace.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1288.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Three new members were accepted at yesterday's meeting.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller proposed that the members hold an anti-temperance convention in the State of Illinois. Mr. Wassermann said that he did not believe the Chicago tavernkeepers would consider such a proposal until they had their backs to the wall. And the saloonkeepers from the country districts would hardly appear at a convention to be held here. Mr. Miehle called attention to the fact that the country saloonkeepers showed no interest in the Springfield meeting, and that the Wirthsverein and the brewers had to bear all the expense. The matter was put on the agenda for the next session.</p>
   <p>A motion to nominate a committee of five to consider whether an excursion is to be held was defeated.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will take place at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle on the second Friday of next month, because the first Friday will be July Fourth.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1289.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A motion to request the Committee on Legal Problems to confer with the proper committee of the City Council regarding a recall of the city ordinance requiring licensing of horse troughs was accepted.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary reported receipts of $65.75; expenses were $12.50. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
