   <p>Last night's performance of Suppe's "Fatinitza" was produced by the Collner-Isenstein Theatre company at the Mc Vicker Theatre. It was a rare occurrence indeed, that every seat in the house was occupied. It was unanimously agreed that this was the best Fatinitza production ever brought before the Chicago public. And if this includes the exponent of the principal role also, then we join heartily in the praise. Miss Pagay was simply adorable as "Fatinitza." There were unquestionably better singers heard before in the title role, but for her dramatic talent, Miss Pagay cannot be surpassed. She was exquisite throughout the play, but the climax was reached in the third act when she appeared in the smart uniform of a Hussar officer. A thunderous applause interrupted the performance.</p>
   <p>The character of "Lydia"was impersonated by Miss Wassmann, and the least we <pb facs="5418474_6_1699.jpg" n="2"/>can say about her is that she was one among the best interpreters of the role ever heard in Chicago so far.</p>
   <p>Mr. Waldorf, as "General Kantschukoff," could have done more justice to his role. The war correspondent played by Mr. Wassermann, known as that ardent and devoted exponent of dramatic art, surprised us very pleasantly. Never before had Chicagoans the opportunity to see that part characterized so splendidly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Heinemann as "Pascha" was rather disappointing. Because this is the most piquant of all the male characters of the opera, much more was expected of him, and rightly so. What he did offer was mediocre indeed!</p>
