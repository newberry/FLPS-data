   <p>Seldom has such a crowd turned out to witness a German performance as that which filled McVicker's Theater last evening. Long before the curtain rose, standing room was at a premium, and many were unable to gain admission.</p>
   <p>The magnet that wielded this powerful attraction was the first performance in this city of Johann Strauss' celebrated operetta, "Die Fledermaus" (The Bat). The fact alone that Johann Strauss, the unrivaled composer of the "Blue Danube" and other matchless dance pieces, composed the music to this operetta, is sufficient guarantee that it is a fine musical production. It is a gem in every sense of the word, and his enchanting waltz melodies permeate the entire work. The text is from the French of Meilbac and Halery, and is very witty and full of sparkling fun.</p>
   <p>This operetta, taking everything into consideration, is far above the average of operettas and opera-bouffes performed in this country, and it is surprising that it has never yet been attempted on the English stage. If it was, it would certainly take better than "Pinafore" and "Fatinitza."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1701.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But much of the success of the operetta depends upon the performers. It not only needs good signers, but first-class actors, the latter more than the former. Those upon whose shoulders rested the burden of last evening's performance, can not be said to be great singers, with the exception of one or two; but they were all first-class actors. In fact, the acting was so good that the shortcoming in singing could well be overlooked.</p>
   <p>The orchestra and chorus did well, considering that they labored under the disadvantages of a first night. Prof. Rosenbecker deserves credit for his good handling of the baton.</p>
