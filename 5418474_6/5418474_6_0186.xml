   <p>A bill is pending to be introduced in the Illinois State Legislature, which due to its character, should be rejected by the committee to which the duty of the first consideration of a bill is assigned. The bill requests nothing less, than the forcing of every society issuing life insurance to its members to comply with the law regulating those Insurance Companies, which are in this business not to benefit others, but for their own benefit.</p>
   <p>This infamous bill requests namely, that societies maintaining a life insurance department deposit $100,000 each as a guarantee fund with the Treasurer of State in Springfield. The motive is obvious. The bill is directed against organizations which were founded for the purpose of providing death benefit for the beneficiary. It is plausible that these organizations are responsible for the decrease of the insurance business done by regular Insurance Companies; but back of that are some very good reasons.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0187.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The life insurance departments of the organizations in question are gaining in popularity because of the great saving arising from the fact that there are no business offices to be maintained, and no salaries to be paid to directors, treasurers, secretaries and presidents, the cost of which salaries, more often than not, exceeds the sum of several hundred thousand dollars annually. In contrast to this, the work of the secretary and the treasurer of a mutual aid organization is usually donated, and if one of these officers accepts a compensation, it is a small one indeed. Mutual benefit societies have no investment worries, for there is no surplus money for any investment. The only possible loss they could suffer would be through the dishonesty of either of the officials in charge; such loss, however, could never be of serious consequences.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, many an insurance company announced its insolvency as a consequence of the dishonest manipulations of its officials. Of course, those whose incomes depend on the prosperity of the Insurance Companies are alarmed by this condition.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0188.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This applies especially to the presidents of insurance companies, whose remunerative positions pay in many instances $50,000 annually. But mutual benefit societies do not operate for selfish reasons; furthermore, they are in no business relations with Boston and New York firms, and thus they do not contribute to the dependence of the Western part of the country from the East.</p>
   <p>The argument is that a fund is necessary for the protection of life insurance policyholders in case of an epidemic; but in such a case a small reserve capital would be insufficient, and the result would be the disorganization of the society. It was stated that with the exception of the Free Masons' reserve fund, of which the amount is approximately $200,000, no society which is including life insurance in its statutes could deposit the funds demanded by that bill.</p>
   <p>The legislative body of Illinois would indeed commit a crime against the interests of many hundred thousands of citizens of this state in passing the proposed bill; And, besides, it would be of benefit to none but the life insurance agent.</p>
