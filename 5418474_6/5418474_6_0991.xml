   <p>The German-American Teachers Union has made the following appeal: " On account of the convention of the German-American Teachers Union taking place in Buffalo, N. Y., July 6,7,8. The citizens committee, Buffalo, sends its heartiest invitation to all German-teachers. We can assure all delegates that every preparation has been made to solve their business and social problems. Enemies of Germany agitate everywhere, and German education in public schools is very much attacked and criticized. In Ohio, Illinois, New York, in the East and West, much secret agitation occurs to bring a decisive knock-out at the opportune time. Continuous vigilance and preparedness are necessary to oppose, successfully, such agitations. Only a strong organization will be of help. The individual is powerless. It is the duty of every German-American teacher to help form such an organization, or to support an existing one.</p>
   <p>Our organization has existed for 20 years; its right of existence cannot be doubted; its successful agitation during the past 25 years cannot be denied; but it was not able to prevent during the last year, the abolishing of German <pb facs="5418474_6_0992.jpg" n="2"/>education in some centers, or limitation of the same. The indifference of the German teachers, the disregard of their personal and general interests, have paralyzed the force of opposition of the organization.</p>
   <p>At the last convention in Louisville, a more solid organization was established, by a change in the constitution, as beside the individual membership, the formation of district and branch clubs has been established. The convention in Buffalo will show their activities and successes. Our organization makes it possible for every German American teacher in public schools, or private institutions, to become a member, and everybody, who cares for the maintenance of the German language, will find support and friends in our Union. We have full confidence in the German-American teachers, that they will appear in great numbers at our convention, and that they will show their enthusiasm for the cause. The citizen committee has arranged a splendid entertainment program. Besides gymnastics given by pupils of the public schools, an excursion to Niagara-Falls and Lewiston, has been arranged. The headquarters are in the German American Hall (Orpheus Hall) corner of Main and High Streets, where all the meetings will take place. A great number of <pb facs="5418474_6_0993.jpg" n="3"/>private rooms have been arranged for those who cannot find accommodations in a hotel. All applications should be made to Mr. H. Angermann, corner of Gennessee and Washington Streets, Buffalo, N. Y.</p>
