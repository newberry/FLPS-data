  <body>
   <p>The pilgrimage of four thousand farmers to the Nation's Capital was perhaps the most stupid thing the Democrats have done in this campaign. That this pilgrimage is part of the campaign is obvious. The sole purpose was to defend the Administration against attacks on its agricultural policy, and show the country that there are farmers who are satisfied. Whether this purpose was attained is questionable for the demonstration has already produced all kinds of aftereffects which are not working out to the advantage of the Administration.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the President's speech has been sharply criticized. Mr. Roosevelt maintained that the Administration has not caused the purposeless destruction of food. This assertion is both true and false. The context <pb facs="5418474_6_0805.jpg" n="2"/>shows very clearly what the President meant to convey. He declared that it was high time for the Administration to repeat at every opportunity that it had not purposelessly destroyed food in any form. [Editor's note: President Roosevelt actually used the word "wastefully" not "purposelessly".] He then laid great emphasis on the fact that the price of farm produce was so low at the beginning of his administration that it did not pay to bring the farm produce to market, while today the farmer's products bring him a very neat profit.</p>
   <p>If this price advance is really due to the policy pursued by the Administration, the President is of course justified in maintaining that articles of food have never been purposelessly destroyed. This assumption is, however, somewhat hazardous. Those who have followed the price fluctuations of agricultural produce within recent years are well aware that the increase in prices is due to the crop failures and not to the administration's policy of reducing production. Moreover in view of the facts it can probably be said that the destruction of five million pigs, the plowing under of grain and cotton, and <pb facs="5418474_6_0806.jpg" n="3"/>other similar measures, have caused the farmers considerable losses, for if the farmers had not destroyed these products they might now be able to sell them at very good prices.</p>
   <p>When President Roosevelt recommended the farm policy to congress, he declared that it was purely an experiment which could be given up immediately if it proved a failure. He added that if the plan proved unsuccessful he would be the first to inform congress of the fact. That sounds good, but means little, for whether an experiment proves a success or failure depends entirely on how one looks at it. If one takes the point of view that the policies of the Administration are responsible for the increase in prices of farm products, the experiment was a success. If one believes, however, that the increase in prices is due to the crop failures, the plan was a failure.</p>
   <p>The human element also is involved. It is not easy for a man in public life to admit that an important section of his program has been a complete failure. <pb facs="5418474_6_0807.jpg" n="4"/>For a president who is seeking re-election it is even more difficult, for he knows that the opposition will make full use of this information, and no man can be expected to provide his opponents with effective weapons in this way. One might perhaps maintain that an open admission of failure would be the best tactic.</p>
   <p>In view, however, of the tone adopted by the President's opponents in the press and in Congress, such an admission would probably be a mistake. Their attacks have long been so venomous, false, and malicious that an honest and objective discussion has been impossible. For a long time the President has ignored this mudslinging, or has shrugged it off with an ironical remark. The constant attacks have gradually got on his nerves, however. He went so far as to call the opponents of the Administration liars, a thing he should not have done. This appellation fits many of them but there are undoubtedly many among his critics who are honest and well meaning people who certainly have not deserved to be called liars.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_0808.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The President's opponents can chalk up one victory, at any rate. This is confined entirely to the realms of psychology, but is nevertheless important and momentous. They have succeeded in shaking the President's candor and self confidence and in arousing his irritation. This must be deeply regretted, for it would be only human for the President to defend his measures the more zealously in the future even if they are complete failures, such as the AAA and the NRA for example.</p>
