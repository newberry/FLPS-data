   <p>The militia bill was passed by the State senate. A large majority favored the bill. The vote was as follows: 31 for (17 Republicans and 14 Democrats) and only 10 opposed it (4 Republicans, 5 Democrats, 1 Communist), and in the House of Representatives no opposition was raised to the final passage of the bill.</p>
   <p>When the first draft of the militia bill was presented to the legislature, it was very doubtful that the measure would be accepted. Most of the representatives from the agricultural districts, Republicans as well as Democrats, were opposed to the bill. But the threats of violence expressed in Communistic papers and by speakers, the glorification of the Parisian atrocities during the French Revolution, and the insulting remarks about members of the State militia impressed the legislators of the rural districts. The representatives of the farming communities gradually came to the realization that the State needs a law for the maintenance of order, and that the existence of Communist <pb facs="5418474_6_0264.jpg" n="2"/>clubs whose members are armed and not affiliated with the State militia, is a condition which cannot be tolerated any longer.</p>
   <p>Then followed the foolish as well as impertinent conduct of Senator Artley during the senate session when the issue was being considered, and as a result, many more, who were originally opposed to the bill, voted for it.</p>
   <p>Those Communists who complain about the new law, or resent it, should blame their leaders, whose tactless behavior and threatening attitude resulted in the passage of the bill.</p>
   <p>If the Communists had used a little reasoning, they would have known that their procedure would produce this result.</p>
   <p>The main features of the law were published by us some time ago.....</p>
   <p>The armed Communist clubs in Chicago have no choice.....they must either become affiliated with the State militia--giving an oath of allegiance--or they must <pb facs="5418474_6_0265.jpg" n="3"/>disband.</p>
   <p>It is said, the more intelligent Communists are opposed to resistance, as advocated by a few "hot-heads" and intend to make a test case of it by questioning the constitutionality of the law before the Supreme Court.</p>
