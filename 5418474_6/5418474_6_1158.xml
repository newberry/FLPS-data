   <p>The annual meeting of the German Mutual Fire Insurance Company of North Chicago was held at Folz's hall yesterday evening. More than a thousand members were present. John Weiss of 232 East North Avenue, was elected president. Mr. Weiss is well-known throughout the city. He is a highly respected business man, and very popular in German club circles.</p>
   <p>The former president, Fritz Becker, was a very progressive leader. Under his management, the association acquired a high financial standing fully equal to any similar organization in Chicago. Appreciation for his efforts and sagacious leadership were expressed in an unanimous resolution. His unmitigated labor not only increased the membership, but also strengthened <pb facs="5418474_6_1159.jpg" n="2"/>the treasury, which assures the perpetuation of the enterprise indefinitely.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed on December 24 to draw up a resolution upon the demise of Joseph H. Ernst, the former secretary. The appended report found unanimous acceptance. It read as follows: "As the Ruler of life and death decreed to take from our midst our esteemed secretary, Joseph H. Ernst, we hereby declare that through his departure the association has lost a good, capable, and honest official. Chicago is deprived of an able, respectable and conscientious citizen; while his family mourns the loss of a faithful husband, a true father; and his acquaitances grieve over the loss of a staunch friend. To his widow and children, we hereby express our sorrow and sympathy."</p>
   <p>"Be it further resolved that these resolutions shall be read to the assembly and entered in the records of the organization, and that the widow of the deceased shall receive a copy thereof.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_6_1160.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>With profound compassion, we remain, your committee: M. Franzen, August Bercher and Peter Ebertshaeuser." A rising vote signified its acceptance.</p>
   <p>The statement of the Finance committee was certified by an audit and accepted as read. The receipts of the company from July 1, to December 30, 1900 amounted to $2,454.60. Expenses: $688.25. Surplus: $1,766.35. Capital resources on July 1, 1900: $97,197.49. Thus the total capital, up to the present, is $98,963.84.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed, consisting of Messrs. Rauen, Schade, and Schoen, which shall collaborate with the directorate in suggesting necessary changes of the by laws and submit them at the next general meeting for acceptance.</p>
   <p>Other election results are not available at this time, because the meeting continued until the early morning hours.</p>
