   <p>According to reports, which Manager Spaeth submitted to the Board of Administrators of the German Society, at their business meeting, in the month of May 155 families with 375 children, and 116 single persons received assistance. For this purpose $717.45 were spent. In 225 cases board and lodging was granted. Employment was procured for 383 persons, of which the larger part were placed as farm laborers. There is no demand for factory workers, or building, furniture, locksmiths,machinists, electricians, or kindred trades, on account of which great suffering prevails among them. For membership dues $499 were paid in; twelve new members joined with an annual contribution of $120.00, fourteen members increased their yearly contribution. The following ladies societies and lodges received assistance; Harmonie Lodge No. 3, Order of the Hermann's Sisters, Phoenix Ladies Society, Swabian-Badenser Ladies Society, Chicago- Bavarian Ladies Society. The branch of the German National Union of Chicago, allotted us $25.00. The German Society appeals once more to the charitably minded, better-situated German citizens of <pb facs="5418474_9_0798.jpg" n="2"/>our city, to add their mite, to place them in a position of continuing the good work among our suffering countrymen. All members of the German Society are especially asked, to try and obtain new members among their friends and acquaintances. The German Society has, during its 54 years of existence, proved to be one of the best organized charitable institutions in Chicago, and for this reason it should receive a befitting support from the public.</p>
