   <p>Much good has been done by the Chicago Rechtschutz-Verein (Legal Aid Society) during its short time of existence.</p>
   <p>During the month of October the society received 107 law suits, according to Mr. Joseph W. Errant, the attorney for the society, who has been nominated for state's attorney by the working class.</p>
   <p>In most cases Mr. Errant has succeeded through his forceful arguments in obtaining justice for his destitute clients....Mr. Errant has collected, altogether, $416.12 for 26 persons for withheld wages. Twenty cases were dealth with in court. Fifteen times the state sided with the defense and five times with the defendant. The state won in 13 cases; five cases are pending and two withdrawn until further notice.</p>
   <p>Poor people, unacquainted with the law, are daily coming to the office of the Verein to receive advice, given gratis by Mr. Errant or his assistant, Mr. Christ Meyer.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0458.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is evident that the Rechtschutz-Verein has become a necessity. In order to enable the Verein to continue its benevolent work all right-thinking people should take steps either to become members of the Verein or to contribute otherwise towards the upkeep of the bureaus.</p>
