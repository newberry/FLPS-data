   <p>The Ladies' Aid of the German Society held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon. Mrs. Bluthardt, vice-president, presided. After Mrs. Clara Berger had read the minutes of the last meeting, Mrs. Maria Werkmeister, delegate of the German Society, read the following report, which was accepted:</p>
   <p>"During the last three months, the Society gave $378.25 in cash to 108 persons and families; in September, $108 in 37 cases; in October, $139 in 41 cases; and in November, $89 in 28 cases.</p>
   <p>Board and lodging for homeless people cost $37.50, coal for the poor, $4.75.</p>
   <p>During these last months, precisely as formerly, it has been impossible to give aid to all applicants. Many a person who hoped to obtain help from us was disappointed and became discouraged. If we hear increasing complaints that the German Society does not consider the plight of the poor, because <pb facs="5418474_9_0993.jpg" n="2"/>one or another is denied assistance, that constitutes no proof whatsoever that we do not intend to give aid; we can relieve distress only in proportion to our available funds.</p>
   <p>The requirements or the poor exceed our resources to such an extent that the Ladies' Aid needs the full support of Chicago's Germans in order to enable the German Society to function adequately.</p>
   <p>After attending to various routine matters, the coming Christmas festivities were considered, as well as the presents to be distributed on that occasion. Several committees were formed to attend to the details incident to the coming celebration.</p>
