   <p>Since we have connections with the German Food Ministry and our own office in Hamburg, we can guarantee delivery or refund of your money. No other firm that advertises delivery of packages to Germany is as well organized as we are. At the present time we have fifty thousand cases, each one containing the articles listed below, en route to Hamburg. We make delivery on the same day on which we receive your order. Orders are sent to Hamburg daily. Send us your orders, and your friends will not have to wait.</p>
   <p>For ten dollars you may order: twelve pounds of rye flour, five pounds of Crisco shortening, five pounds of rice, four pounds of excellent coffee, five one-pound boxes of condensed milk.</p>

   <p>Send us ten dollars by check, postal or express money order. We pay for packing, fees, marine insurance and freight to Germany. Our firm was founded in 1905 and is known over the entire world. We have established a department to assist German-Americans in sending food to their former homeland. We estimate the exact cost of the goods and make no allowance for a profit.</p>
