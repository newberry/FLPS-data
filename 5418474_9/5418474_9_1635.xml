   <p>In the large hall of the International House of the University of Chicago there was a meeting, Saturday evening, of a number of men and women who are interested in the preservation of the German language in the United States. The invitations were sent out by Professor Martin Schuetze, who has been a member of the German Department of the University for many years, and has inspired thousands of students with a love for the German language and culture.</p>
   <p>In a rather long address, Professor Schuetze explained that the German language is losing ground here, that it will be a dead language in America if something decisive is not done to preserve and revive it. This movement has to start among young people--and young people born in this country--because the old people are dying out and a new influx from Germany can scarcely be expected.</p>

   <p>Professor Schuetze correctly remarked that a language is a living organism, and that it can only remain one if the youth are given the opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings in the language. For this purpose, the professor wishes to found a sort of German-American literary journal to serve as a central organ for the literary activity of Americans in German. The first number of this periodical will appear this month. The audience listened very attentively to the serious discourse of the professor, and rewarded him with hearty applause.</p>
   <p>At the close of the speech entertainment was provided. The program opened with the singing of a few songs by Annemarie Gerts. Helen Luening also sang several songs in German, for which special music was written by Mr. Johann Mauff.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The article ends with the information that a short play, written by Dorothea Schultz, a German-American girl, was performed. The name of the play was "Der Indianerueberfall auf New Ulm" (The Indian Attack on New Elm)].</p>
