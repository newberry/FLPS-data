<title level="a">URGENT APPEAL TO ALL WHO WERE BORN IN THE DUCHY OF NASSAU</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A large part--nearly all--of Westerwald, in the former Duchy of Nassau, faces famine, according to news from Switzerland and Germany. Remember, this was your fatherland. You need not be told what a total crop failure means. The potato yield was nothing; you of Nassau know how serious that fact is. Famine, with its fearful aspects, will rule the land unless we intervene. A long, hard winter must be faced by the people; larders are empty, and there is no income. People of Nassau! Fellow citizens! Your relatives, perhaps even your brothers and sisters, your parents appeal to you to help them in their distress.</p>
   <p>A number of people who formerly lived in Nassau have formed a temporary committee to help our countrymen as quickly as possible. Remember, "Whoever gives promptly, gives twice".</p>
   <p>We ask all people who were born in Nassau to attend a mass meeting next Monday, <pb facs="5418474_9_0984.jpg" n="2"/>December 8, at 8 P. M., at 177 Blue Island Avenue, to elect a permanent relief committee.</p>
   <p>Nassauer! Prove to the world that you have hearts of gold, that you think of the despair now affecting your homeland, even though you are thousands of miles away!</p>
   <p>We hereby ask the Illinois Staats-Zeitung to provide free space in the Sunday edition for the above appeal.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Provisional Committee:</p>
   <p>Peter Frankenbach (from Schlossborn, Nassau);</p>
   <p>Andreas Soehngen (from Bad Ems, Nassau);</p>
   <p>Hatzfeld (from Weilburg, Nassau);</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0985.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>W. Rande (from Bad Ems, Nassau);</p>
   <p>Gustav Graf (from Langen-Schwalbach);</p>
   <p>Wilhelm Brummer (from Wiesbaden, Nassau).</p>
   <p>Chicago, December 5, 1879.</p>
  </body>
