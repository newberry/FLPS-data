   <p>A noble deed which deserves our respect was done by the German Hod Carriers' Union, Local #6. Four Union officials, Charles Engel, Gustav Gaedecke, and Edward Richter, trustees, and August Pioch, treasurer, came into the office of the Abendpost last night and announced without preliminary that their Union had decided to contribute the sum of five thousand dollars to the Relief Fund of the Deutsche and Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft (German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society). They had brought the cash with them and they proceeded to pay it at once.</p>
   <p>The employees in the newspaper office thought that their eyes and ears had deceived them, but it was really true. Five thousand dollars was turned over by plain German working men who earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. Truly loyal German hearts must beat under those overalls for the beloved native land which, surrounded by enemies, is fighting so bravely <pb facs="5418474_9_0730.jpg" n="2"/>for her national existence.</p>
   <p>The Union of the German Hod Carriers has between six and seven thousand members. At a Union meeting they had enthusiastically voted for that large sum to be disbursed by their treasury--built up of membership dues--to be used for the relief of distress and pain in Germany and Austria-Hungary. It is a gift of love in the noblest sense of the word, because it came from people who cannot easily afford such sacrifices. It is made up of thousands of small amounts and its intrinsic value is much higher than the actual amount in figures. It is the spirit of a united willingness to sacrifice, and of unselfish German love of neighbor. The German Hod Carriers Union has highly honored itself with this gift. Three cheers for the German Hod Carriers!</p>
