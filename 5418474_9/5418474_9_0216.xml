   <p>During the month of January not less than eighty patients were nursed in the German hospital. This is the largest number of patients in the hospital during any month until now. The management expects even more sick people during February, and is making preparations for them. In order to meet the increase in expenses, friends of the institution, who like to practise charity, are requested to remember the same.</p>
   <p>The institution has been fortunate to engage an able eye and ear specialist, Dr. Boerne-Bettmann. During the short time he has been active in the hospital he has had excellent success with the different operations which he undertook.</p>
   <p>The Thimble Club is proving to be quite a resource for the hospital. At the last meeting of this club a considerable number of women joined it as members. The membership fees purchase the material which the club needs in its activities for the institution. A beneficial arrangement is the hospital ticket, which can be purchased for an annual fee of $5.00, and entitles the holder, in case <pb facs="5418474_9_0217.jpg" n="2"/>of sickness, to be taken into the hospital free of charge.</p>
   <p>The German hospital is now in such a position that it can undertake the most difficult operations. It will become just as successful, and will enjoy the same reputation as the large German institute in New York.</p>
