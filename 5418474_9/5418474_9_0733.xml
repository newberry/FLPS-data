   <p>The management of the Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft of Chicago [German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society] publishes below a list of all the paid contributions to their relief fund through August 31.</p>
   <p>The list, which includes the names of the donors is a long one, but at that it is only a faint reflection of the generosity of the German-American population.</p>
   <p>After the Aid Society had been established on August 7, its first job was to organize this work of relief. Collection has hardly started. The following list only represents sums collected by the Abendpost by means of approximately one hundred circulating collection lists. About eighteen hundred of these lists are still in circulation. Many substantial amounts which were <pb facs="5418474_9_0734.jpg" n="2"/>pledged some time ago have not been paid yet. There is no doubt that the total amount reported below represents only a fraction of the final total to be collected.</p>
   <p>The management of the Aid society has published the amount collected, firstly, to show the public what has been accomplished so far, and secondly--and this is the main reason--to bring about harmonious co-operation of the entire German element and the sons and daughters of Austria-Hungary. It is the ardent wish of the Aid Society and its management to but this Relief work on a national scale. To demonstrate to the world that the [American] blood brothers of the German nations now fighting for their honor and existence work together with the same degree of harmony and cooperation in sacrificing for the relief of distress as do the German and Austro-Hungarian armies on the bloody battlefields in the east and west.</p>
   <p>In union there is strength. Only unanimous co-operation can bring the best results possible. The Deutsche and Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft <pb facs="5418474_9_0735.jpg" n="3"/>of Chicago believes in the establishment of a great national committee to which all the money that may be collected in America for similar purposes should be transferred.</p>
   <p>Chicago has no desire to earn special glory or a privileged position. she only wants the greatest success. The opinion here is that a consolidation of the Relief work would not detract from the importance of local committees [chapters which have been formed or will be formed in other cities. In order to organize as many aid societies on the same basis with the Chicago Society as is possible, the Chicago Aid Society will gladly offer its advice and experience to individual citizens and vereine of other cities who do not yet have any organization for the promotion of the Relief work. But the Chicago Society wishes and urgently advises the formation of a national committee, consisting of the most prominent German-Americans and Americans of Austro-Hungarian descent, in which all local Societies would be represented, and where all the funds collected would be pooled. This would give a fitting expression of solidarity among Germany's and Austria-Hungary's sons and <pb facs="5418474_9_0736.jpg" n="4"/>daughters here in America.</p>
   <p>The management of the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Societies of Chicago is asking all those who read the foregoing suggestion to think it ever, and, in case the idea seems agreeable, to co-operate and work for its realization. Any further details will be gladly given by the secretary of the Society:</p>
   <p>Julius Goldzier,</p>
   <p>1020 Chamber of Commerce Building,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Below please find a report of the treasurer, listing contributions received by the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society. The report only includes actual payments made up to and including August St. Up to date there are approximately fifteen hundred collection lists in circulation, and the unpaid pledges made on these lists cannot be calculated at this time. But since these lists will have to be called in for accounting within ten days, the <pb facs="5418474_9_0737.jpg" n="5"/>next publication, which will come out in about a week or so, will inform our readers on the progress of the collection drive.</p>
