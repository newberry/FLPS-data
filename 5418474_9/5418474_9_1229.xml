   <p>Dr. Wagner, physician of the Twenty-fourth Illinois Regiment, sent us a letter in which he describes the impression which the activity of patriotic ladies of Chicago made upon our soldiers. He writes:</p>
   <p>"The report about the splendid success of the fair which Chicago ladies held for the benefit of sick and wounded Union soldiers made a profound and lasting impression upon our fighters; they note that people at home have a heart, that they think of those who have gone forth to battlefields to defend the country against the Rebels. In this connection, I wish to direct your attention to a matter which you might discuss in your newspaper. Today I signed the discharge papers of two men who were crippled in the Battle of Perryville, and I wondered just what the future would hold for these brave but unfortunate soldiers. The <pb facs="5418474_9_1230.jpg" n="2"/>one, formerly an able stonecutter was shot through the left side of the chest, his lung was severely injured, and two of his ribs were broken. The other had been a baker. The bones of his lower left arm had been shattered by bullets, and he had also lost two fingers of his right hand. Neither of these men will ever be able to resume his former occupation, but both of them are willing and physically fit to do some other less strenuous work. Are our fellow citizens, who could not do combat service, not honor-bound to provide suitable work for these men? Perhaps a committee could be appointed to serve as our employment agency for partly disabled soldiers. I would like to have your opinion".</p>
   <p>The subject which Dr. Wagner broaches in this letter is one of great importance. The needs of these patriots who have been crippled in the service of the Republic and are unable to work in their former professions or occupations can be temporarily cared for by private charity; but none of our brave soldiers want to accept charity if they can do some kind of work and thus support themselves and their dependents. We mention the matter so that the public will give it careful <pb facs="5418474_9_1231.jpg" n="3"/>consideration, and we do not doubt in the least that our citizens will find a way to solve this problem to the satisfaction of our heroic semi-invalids.</p>
