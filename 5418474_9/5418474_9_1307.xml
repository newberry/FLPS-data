   <p>The Germans of Chicago have had a little disappointment. To prove the well-known honesty of the Germans an exception, a clerk of the County Tax Office, Mr. Thomalen, has taken leave with a deficit of $4,000.00. Mr. Thomalen has been well known in the better situated German circles and had many friends. This sudden disappearance, therefore, caused much excitement, and in the County Tax Office the indignation about this affair is very great, as it seems Thomalen had been in default for about two or three years, but knew how to cover the missing amount at each revision. One of his supporters, who must have known about this affair, had given him a helping hand. It seems that Thomalen was always informed when an auditing of the books would take place and therefore was able to make his arrangements. This time the auditor appeared by surprise and Thomalen had no time to cover the missing amount. For his excuse, it may be stated that he has had much illness in his family and was in great need; although he is eagerly looked for, he has not been found yet, but it is not anticipated that he committed suicide.</p>
