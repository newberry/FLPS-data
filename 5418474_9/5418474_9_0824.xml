   <p>The management leased the large hall at the Auditorium for a Charity Ball, on January 25th, and again it is expected that this entertainment will become a brilliant social affair.</p>
   <p>Although only three years old, the Association has distributed in this short time more than $27,000. among needy charity institutions of Chicago, following the Mayor's appeal to citizens, last winter, to assist in mitigating the general distress. The German-American Charity Association was one of the first to respond. Two days after the proclamation, $1.500. was put at the disposal of the following institutions: United Bureaus of Charities $500.; Chicago Relief and Aid Society $500. The net profit of the Charity Ball, January 21st, 1897 was $10,450. After deduction of the above mentioned amount there was a balance of $8,950. left, which was distributed among the following charitable institutions: German Old Peoples' Home, Alexian Hospital, German Hospital, St. Elizabeth Hospital, Michael-Reese Hospital, Lying-In Dispensary, Bureau of Justice, Club Erholung, Home for Destitute Crippled Children, Uhlich's Orphan Home and Chicago Orphan Asylum.</p>
