   <p>The brewery workers and maltsters met at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle (Forward Turner Hall) yesterday afternoon to form a permanent association. About one hundred persons were present. Gustave Zinke presided, and F. Steinert functioned as secretary. After reading of the minutes Mr. Zinke was elected unanimously as president of the association for the next six months. Steinert was elected similarly as secretary, Henry Bussian became treasurer, and Martin Huss vice president. Martin Stengle was appointed member of the committee to draft bylaws in the absence of Muenz, who was out of town.</p>
   <p>President Zinke declared, that the association was founded to help the members and their families in case of sickness or death. A rough draft of the constitution, which explained the matter in greater detail, was then read to the assembly. Besides the previously mentioned officials, three directors will be added to the association, and a regular session is to be held every three <pb facs="5418474_9_0097.jpg" n="2"/>months.</p>
   <p>The constitution will not be adopted in its present form but is to be thoroughly revised by a committee which will submit its report at the next session. It was tentatively agreed that every member should contribute one dollar. Charles Buchmann was then elected unanimously as financial secretary of the organization. Adolph Schaefer, John Stienert, and Wilhelm Koehler became directors. After a large number of initiation fees were collected the meeting was adjourned until Sunday, Jan. 11, 1880; same location.</p>
   <p>The association will give a dance in January.</p>
