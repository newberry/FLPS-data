<title level="a">[THE DIRECTORS OF THE GERMAN SOCIETY MEET]</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The directors of the German Society held a meeting yesterday. After the financial conditions had been discussed, Mr. A. C. Hesing made an address. He said he was sorry to have to mention some unpleasant matters. He did not wish to appear as if he had stabbed some directors in the back. Each of the gentlemen knows, that if he is the owner of the controlling part of the stocks of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, he is nevertheless not the sole owner of it, and that he very seldom and only in exceptional cases exercises any control over what is printed in the paper. He further read an article from the Freie Presse wherein was insinuated that he had forced himself upon Teutonia as president and that he had been elected under the proviso that he would hand his salary over to the German Society. But this promise he has kept only apparently for he has not handed this money over to the German Society, but has given it only a note payable in September, which at that time may have become valueless. Further that through attacks on the president of the German Society he is aiming to have him removed so as to be able to take his place.</p>
   <p>This article has hurt him deeply, that its purpose was to ruin his credit and credit is, what he now needs. Each of the gentlemen knows that he lost 100,000.00 during the great fire and that in a recent financial transaction he lost another $100,000.00.</p>

   <p>He would pay his debts up to the last penny but for that he needs time and credit.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knobelsdorff knows", he continued, "that it was by chance that I went to the Teutonia meeting when they could not agree on a president, I was asked if I would accept the nomination. I replied that I would provide that I had the right to give away my salary and that my successors would not be bound by my action." Mr. Knobelsdorff confirmed these facts.</p>
