   <p>The willing and extensive participation which our appeal for co-operation and support by Americans of German descent in Chicago has elicited, and the ever-increasing interest which the movement has evoked, urges us to make the following explanation with reference to the aims and activities of the Deutsche Kriegswaisenhilfe (German Aid for War Orphans).</p>
   <p>The movement began during the war under the name "Soldaten Hilfe" (Soldiers' Aid). This was a society which consisted of a few American ladies of German descent who zealously endeavored to relieve the misery among German soldiers, gladly contributing their mite to this great charity. At first, only especially needy soldiers, principally the ones who had no relatives, were the recipients of aid from the organization.</p>
   <p>After the armistice was declared, a desire was felt to make our efforts more <pb facs="5418474_9_0609.jpg" n="2"/>effective and to extend them to the innocent victims of the war, especially to the widows and orphans of our severely tried and chastened fatherland. Thus "Soldatenhilfe" became "Deutsche Kriegswaisenhilfe"</p>
   <p>Only a few, who gathered in the home of Mrs. Anna Schaedler, joined in this noble work at first. Bolts of flannel and other materials were made into shirts, skirts, aprons, coats, trousers, stockings, etc. for these unfortunate people abroad.</p>
   <p>The good undertaking soon showed results, and in order to make room for the ever-increasing number of diligent coworkers, Doctor Link placed his spacious hall at our disposal. Soon a hundred articles of one kind could be sent instead of only one; and, through money collected for the purpose, hundreds of pairs of shoes were purchased and shipped. The first consignment, which has just now reached Holland on its way to Berlin, was valued at $6,500.</p>
   <p>As time passed the number of ladies who gave of their time and money increased <pb facs="5418474_9_0610.jpg" n="3"/>to such an extent that it was again necessary to procure more room, and again a generous man, Mr. Theodore Wilkins, permitted us to use, gratis, an entire floor of the building at 169 North Clark Street. Here all German ladies who wish to do so can contribute their labor to this worthy charity. Work tables and machines, have greatly facilitated the work. Financial aid also is increasing. Those who cannot come to sew, can co-operate by collecting money. Our treasurer, Mrs. Kaete Goldberg, who lives at 4538 Hazel Avenue, is ready to furnish all necessary information and collection books, and will also gladly receive donations.</p>
