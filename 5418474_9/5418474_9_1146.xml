   </div>

   <p>The Central Committee for the German peace celebration held another meeting in the small hall of the German House... The Finance Committee reported that up to now $13,180.00 have been collected, while the expenses so far amount to about $9,000.00. However, bills continue to come in(It is probably that the surplus in the end will amount to $1500.00. The Editor).</p>
   <p>The President, Mr. Georg Schneider, thereupon moved to turn the surplus over to the German Society. In support of his motion he pointed out that the German Society is the only purely German benevolent institution in the city, and said that since he had become President of it and spent daily an hour before noon there, he had become convinced that nowhere is suffering being alleviated so directly as by the German Society. He described the poverty and misery of many immigrants, and by way of a small example he mentioned the case of 20 German immigrants whose baggage a week ago was lost on the Erie railroad. Due to energetic steps of the agent who even threatened the company to bring the case before Congress, because immigrants stand under the protection of the United States, the case was quickly settled and the railroad company has promised to make good the total damage.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. A. Schoninger, as a former director of the German Society said it was a holy duty to help the immigrants. But it has to be considered how the society could be helped permanently. Besides, he wants to enlarge its activity; it should not only provide aid for immigrants, but take care of all interests of the Germans.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michaelis and Mr. Beiersdorff agreed with Mr. Schoninger, but saw in what he had said no reason for not turning over the present surplus to the German society. The proposed reformation of which would not in the least be prejudiced through that action.</p>
   <p>The motion to contribute the surplus to the German Society was thereupon adopted, under loud applause by all against one vote. On a motion of Mr. Emil Dietzsch the Central Committee declared itself permanent, in order to found an association, the chief aim of which it shall be to keep the German vote together, in order to take up the fight against corruption. Some critical voices were answered by Mr. Georg Schneider who maintained that such an organization would not need a great amount of money, but would win by its right and influence alone.</p>
