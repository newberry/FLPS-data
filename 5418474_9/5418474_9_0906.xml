   <p>Possibly a few of our readers are ignorant of the colossal duties at present of the German Society since emigration has attained such large dimensions. Quite a few families arriving are in utmost distress and are taken care of by the society and especially their indefatigable and capable agent Charles Endres, earned the gratitude of two families worth mentioning. One couple with three small children arrived from Hinterpommern with their destination as North Mc Gregor, Iowa, but only railroad tickets to Chicago and in possession only $8.00 left. This was spent soon and the hotel management put them on the street. The German Society with the aid of the Frauen-Verein, came to their rescue, gave them lodgings and transportation to North Mc Gregor. Under similar conditions a family of five children was taken care of.</p>
