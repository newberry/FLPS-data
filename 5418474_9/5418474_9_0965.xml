   <p>Due to the fact, of this year's heavy immigration and also to the fact, that a large number of these immigrants, chose the middle West, particularly Chicago, as its domicile, there was dealt a terrific blow to the workers of this city. The German Society of Chicago is doing its utmost, to meet with the difficulties, arising from such influx, and in connection with it, asked the German Societies of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore for their consent, to obtain the necessary aid, for the protection of the immigrants. We are proud to state, that the reformed management of our Chicago Immigrant homes is a success, and we will continue in this direction. We also endeavor to protect the Immigrants, at different railroad depots, against cheating or overcharging. We found only one railroad, whose dealing with Immigrants is blameless, this is the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago railroad, which has complied with all our requests. As to the rest of the railroad managements, we receive many promises, but there it also ends.</p>
   <p>A reply to out questions in the near future, would be greatly appreciated:</p>
   <p>1. After the immigrants arrival at Castle Garden, what agencies are assisting them to the railroad depots?</p>
   <p>2. How do they obtain their railroad tickets, and who advises them, as to the trains to take?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0966.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>You undoubtedly share our interest in this matter, and we consider it, our sacred duty to give the Immigrants, all the assistance we can.</p>
   <p>Those railroads, which we are not willing to co-operate, and comply with our requests, in the interest of the Immigrants, can not receive our consideration.</p>
   <p>The management of the "German Society" of Chicago.</p>
