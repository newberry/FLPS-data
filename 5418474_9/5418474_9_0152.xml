   <p>Plans for the new structure to be erected at Hamilton Court and Grant Place have been approved.</p>
   <p>The new German Hospital upon which work will commence soon, is to be one of the most modern institutions of its kind in Chicago. The old hospital will, however, continue to operate until the completion of the new structure. The management of the hospital meanwhile centers its activities on the raising of funds with which it hopes not only to defray the mortgages, but also to secure a reserve of working capital.</p>
   <p>The organization devoted to the support of the German Hospital was founded Dec. 17, 1883; it is a charitable institution, granting no material gains to any one. Despite the shortage of funds, -the chief difficulty of the hospital, it has nevertheless extended care to a multitude of patients whose finances did not permit them to get medical aid. The philanthropic Mrs. Konrad Seipp <pb facs="5418474_9_0153.jpg" n="2"/>endowed the hospital with $150,000, in fond memory of her husband and son. This fund has been increased by voluntary constributions from the following: Mrs. Henry Bartholomay, Mrs. Albert F. Madlener, Mrs. Otto L. Schmidt, Miss Alma Seipp, Mr. Edwin G. Uihlein, Mr. Charles Gindele, Mr. William C. Seipp, Mrs. Margarethe True Brand, the heirs of the late Ludwig Wolff, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Theurer, Mr. August C. Magnus, Mrs. William H. Rehm, Mrs. Andrew E. Leicht, Mrs. F. Madlener, Mrs. Jacob Birk, Mr. H. O. Langhorst, Mr. A. Uhrlaub, Mr. Hermann Paepcke, Mr. Henry Schoellkopf, Mr. A. Schwill, Mr. Otto C. Butz, Mr. Harry Rubens, Mr. Fritz Glogauer, Mr. Adam Ortseifen, Messrs. Gustave Thaler, Emil W. Wagner, John Kranz, Rudolph S. Blome, George and Edwin Bolter, Mrs. Schumann-Heink, and many others. These donations have increased the funds available for the support of the German Hospital by $100,000, and the vision of a new and modern institution has thus become a reality.</p>
