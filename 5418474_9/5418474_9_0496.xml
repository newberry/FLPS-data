   <p>At the 76th yearly meeting of the German Society of Chicago, the following persons were re-elected its directors: Michael F. Girten, Robert G. Schenneman, Rudolf Kroch, and William Saltiel. From the reports of Mr. Girten and Mr. F. von J. Vyson the president and manager respectively, the following account of the Society's activity in the year ended October 31, 1930, is given for publication:</p>
   <p>The President's Report</p>
   <p>The year 1930 will surely be called "the year of depression." It has been characterized in history by a large number of unemployed. Stagnation of business and communications has been so acute all over the country that even a large number of banks have been forced to close their doors. The Government tried its best to help by spending large amounts but up <pb facs="5418474_9_0497.jpg" n="2"/>to now no improvement is noticeable.</p>
   <p>Under these conditions the demands for aid arising from widespread poverty have increased enormously.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the present yearly report covers only the period from November 1, 1929, to October 31, 1930, as shown by the auditors I wish to state that the months of November 1930 and January 1931, were the hardest in the history of the German Society. During these two months more than $4,200 was spent in helping the poor. However, there are also good news to report. A collection by Abendpost netted $1151.50. Also through a drive by a group of women under the leadership of Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, Miss Amelia Birk and Mrs. Meta Llewes Burgweger, we received $1,316. Our Christmas drive brought $1,356.50. In short a total of $6,059.50 was received, which includes the following: United Men's Chorus, their concert in the Medinah Temple, $3,600;</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0498.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>German-American Liberty League, $1,000; Wieboldt's Foundation, $950; German Day, $300; Suabian Society, $250; German Club of Chicago, $160.25; and Christmas Drive, $1377.</p>
