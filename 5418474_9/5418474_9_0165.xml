   <p>According to a report made by the Alexian Brothers about their last year's activity, 2955 patients have been cared for during this period at the hospital at Belden and Racine Ave. This does not include the patients being in the Sanatorium. The total number is 3060. Of this number 1887 have been cured, 466 are improving, and 91 are incurable; 296 have died, of which 77 were brought to the hospital in an already dying condition. December 31,1906, 215 patients remained in the hospital. 1803 of the patients paid the full price for care and attention, 345 paid reduced fees and 807 patients received free treatment and care. The city ambulance brought 633 persons, mostly seriously injured. According to their status 1665 were single, 915 married, 375 widowed. According to religion 1660 were Catholics, 1091 Protestants, 97 Jews and 107 without faith. The Alexan Brothers offer their thanks to their friends and benefactors for the contributions to the hospital. For the improvement of the hospital the laundry will have its separate building. Further rooms and localities are nearing completion, and the supplementary part of the front building and addition of bath rooms to the private rooms will be built next April.</p>
