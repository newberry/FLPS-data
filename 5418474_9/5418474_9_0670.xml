   <p>The wooden knight in the office of the Abendpost received further pounding at the rate of ten cents per nail by the following gentlemen [list of names and separate amounts omitted in translation; total $4.50].</p>
   <p>Formerly accounted for, $1,795.90; total to date, $1,800.40. [Translator's note: This is all the information in the article, and therefore the translator obtained additional details from the Abendpost's staff. The gigantic wooden figure represented a warrior, probably Hindenburg. The object was to stud the statue with large-headed nails, at the rate of ten cents per nail, until it became an Iron Knight. The effigy had been exhibited at the charity bazaar and at the Bismarck Gardens in the autumn of 1914 as well as at the Abendpost and elsewhere. After doing its share in gathering funds the Armored Knight was to be sent to Berlin or to Vienna, as decided by vote, but hostilities now engulfed the United States, and the statue's scheduled <pb facs="5418474_9_0671.jpg" n="2"/>sea journey became a local trip to the Turnlager at Cary, Illinois. There it reposes unperturbed and serene. The name of the sculptor is unknown.]</p>
