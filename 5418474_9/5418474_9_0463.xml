   <p>The following circular was sent to the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, with a request that it be published:</p>
   <p>The undersigned hereby announces, on behalf of the Bakers' Union of Chicago, that an employment office has been opened today, at 119 Fifth Avenue, second floor, Room No. 2.</p>
   <p>The object is to combat the bad influence of loafing in saloons. It cannot be denied that taverns have a deleterious effect upon unemployed bakery workers; card games are constantly indulged in and the saloonkeeper, in accordance with his interests, gladly chalks up the bill--facts which are not designed to further the moral or financial welfare of the men who frequent such places.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0464.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the other hand, it is not convenient for employers to go to several saloons and treat the boys, while in quest of suitable help.</p>
   <p>In consideration of the aforesaid, the employment division has been founded.</p>
   <p>The official employment bureau (119 Fifth Avenue) only charges twenty-five cents as a registration fee if a job is secured. Employers need only send a letter, stating whether a foreman or helper is wanted, and the day when the worker shall report. The fee for this service is twenty-five cents, in postage stamps, to be enclosed in the letter of inquiry.</p>
   <p>I believe that this service fills a longfelt want and will be appreciated by employers as well as employees.</p>
   <p>Submitted at the request of the Baker's Union of Chicago.</p>
