   <p>Treasurer Madlener sent another thousand dollars to New Ulm yesterday. He also received acknowledgments from that city for the $1,500 and the $1,500 previously sent as well as for $18,733 representing individual contributions, that is, money which was not sent by the organization. The detailed list will be published tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The collections were not so successful yesterday as might have been expected. Let us hope that the various committees will not lose their ambition, but perhaps they have not yet reported to the treasurer.</p>
   <p>The sale of tickets for the benefit concert which is scheduled for Friday evening at McCormick's Hall already shows gratifying results, and it appears that the expectations of the committee will be exceeded. Since every cent from the sale of tickets will go to the relief fund, every holder of an admission card may regard the full amount of his purchase as a donation to the sufferers.</p>
