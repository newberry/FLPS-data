   <p>The Deutsche Gesellschaft [German Society] held its monthly meeting yesterday, and thirteen members were present, among them Joseph Brandner, vice-president of the Deutsche Gesellschaft of New Orleans. Mr. Beiersdorf, president of the Deutsche Gesellschaft of Chicago, acted as chairman, and Secretary Eberhardt attended to the minutes.</p>
   <p>The report of the treasurer and that of the agent of the Society were read and accepted. Messrs. Frank Kiss, John Hochstaetter, and M. J. Hallers were admitted as members. Carl Moll and Mrs. Werkmeister were re-elected members of the board of control for another month.</p>
   <p>A vote of thanks was given to the arrangers of the Old Settlers' Picnic, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>According to the report of the Society's agent 1303 people called at the office <pb facs="5418474_9_0917.jpg" n="2"/>of the Deutsche Gesellschaft in August, 1881, 1147 men and 156 women. There were 144 employers who wanted to hire help. Immigration diminished considerably in comparison with previous months. In July there were 24,000 immigrants, whereas in August the number dropped to 15,000. All nationalities were represented, and the majority of the arrivals went on to the far West. We received eight complaints about lost baggage; in five cases the lost articles were found.</p>
   <p>Through the intercession of the Deutsche Gesellschaft the Barkmann family was supplied with funds to return to Germany. Mr. Barkmann died of sunstroke, as previously reported.</p>
   <p>As mentioned before, Franke, a baker from Berlin, read in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung that his family, now increased by twins, was anxiously looking for him; so he came.</p>
   <p>Charles Enders, the Society's agent, estimated that $509 was spent [in August] for relief and so forth.</p>
