  <body>
   <p>Yesterday at Ogden's Grove a banner dedication was celebrated and a picnic was held by the Harugari Order of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Phillip Kohler gave the main address from which we quote the following interesting items about the origin and history of the order:-</p>
   <p>Almost 27 years ago twelve noble German men, filled with indignation about the position of the Germans in America at that time met in New York, and founded a brotherly association for the protection and support of German immigrants, and gave it the name "Deutscher Harugari Order." Its purpose was to be: To maintain and propagate the German language in the United States; to give the German speaking citizen of the United States a chance to cultivate their intellectual and material interests and to elevate their social standing; to establish fraternal alliances for this purpose everywhere, to help the suffering and those in need of assistance, attending the sick, burying the dead, supporting the widows, to be as a father to orphans, to distribute the spirit of real humanity, etc. <pb facs="5418474_9_0101.jpg" n="2"/>Honor to them! The grain of corn which has been sowed 27 years ago, has grown in many German hearts, and developed into a mighty Oak tree, the branches and twigs of which are extending all over the States of America and lately also the shoots have taken root in the old Fatherland.</p>
   <p>The Order has today more than 400 Lodges, and a membership of 40,000 citizens in this country.</p>
   <p>To give you an idea of the charitable activity of our Order, you will permit me to quote to you the statistics about the standing and activities of the D. O. H. in the United States of America in the two years from 1872 to 1874.</p>
   <p>According to this, the total capital of the Lodges amounts to $400,000.00. Brothers supported in those two years numbered 6,225 with $114,382.00; 777 widows and orphans, $70,000.00; buried 583 brothers, widows of brothers, 304. Spent for funerals $62,266.87. Distributed for general charitable purposes $76,704.11. In this way was paid out by the Order in two years the huge sum of $308,657-84 for aid and assistance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0102.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The oldest Lodge in Chicago was founded in 1858 by 25 German citizens,-only three of the founders are left and rejoicing in the celebration tonight, they are the faithful brothers: Jacob Poths, Fritz Groth and Friedrich Heidel, to whom it must have been a profound satisfaction to see that the work of their life in the service of the Harugari has not been fruitless.</p>
