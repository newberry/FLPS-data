   <p>Governor Fifer of Illinois lately described in one of his banquetspeeches the moral situation of one country and according to his stand point, is finding a difference in the mental attitude of the farmers and the city dwellers. Listening to his words, one could believe that the open country is a Heaven for morality and virtue, which towns and cities are the morbid home of crime and corruption. The farmers, he says, don't know anything of the vices, which are haunting the city-people.</p>
   <p>This nonsense is nothing new and has been preached by other so-called leaders, long before Mr. Fifer was raised to power as Governor. It is time that Farmers for a long time have made up the largest part of the population, and as such have been the carriers of the pioneers' ideals during several centuries. But at the same time, it should be admitted that towns and cities, through hard labor and perseverance, have built up commerce and industries, which had to supply the needs of the farmers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1404.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the other hand, it is only natural that the total of crimes, committed in large cities, looks monstrous in comparison with the sporadic law-breakers, scattered over a large area of rural population.</p>
   <p>As a fact, crime itself, as a human scourge, is striking and gripping Man with the same terror, the same results and from the same reasons, no matter, if the offender found his oppottunity in a town or in the country side.</p>
   <p>Demoralization as the mother of crime, is the trend of our times and not a corruptive state of mind, affecting only one part of the population. Large cities of every civilization, present and past, have been the carriers of human progress, and without shame should be the place, where organized and congregated crime must be fought with the highest achievements of social science, human understanding and the law itself.</p>
