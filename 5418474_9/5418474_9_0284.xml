   <p>The chairman of the Peoples Alliance of the Bernhard Community in Stuttgart writes: "Although conditions in general are improving in Germany due to the temporary cessation of the nerve-racking devaluation of money, there exists, nevertheless, considerable distress among people of the middle class. They lack money to buy even the most necessary items. Earnings are less,with living expenses vastly higher than before the War. Therefore, clothing, shoes, underwear, and bedding, have been used indefinitely, until a large part of the population walks about in rags. Here want always predominates. How gladly we would like to help the cultured people of the middle class whenever they knock timidly at our door. Thank God, and thanks to your contributions, we can occasionally ameliorate conditions here and there. And, therefore, we implore you not to tire in this work of neighborly love in seeking help among the members of your circle."</p>
   <p>Friedrich Kiefner, Stuttgart, Schlosserstrasse 7. <pb facs="5418474_9_0285.jpg" n="2"/>Doctor Wolter, in Falkenburg, asks help for the following people. . . . . [A list of names appears, describing sordid conditions, Translator] Charlotte Schumann, an orphan, even tries to support a grandmother, but her meager earnings are insufficient; she also asks for aid.</p>
   <p>"In the name of the Children's Refuge and the Sisters, I herewith desire to express my heartiest thanks". . . . writes Reverend Doctor Kruetschell. "We are facing the purchase of our winter's coal supply and necessary additions to our provisions for the sixty-nine children. But equally important is the new roof for our building which burned recently. The walls remained intact, but will break unless bridged over, and, therefore, we add the urgent supplication: Do not forget us in the future. . . . ."</p>
   <p>"Thanks, ardent thanks for your presents which were sent to me in box #6229....." writes Johanna Wolter, directress of the St. Hedwings Lyceum in Reisse.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all. Enable us to send some help to the above enumerated cases. <pb facs="5418474_9_0286.jpg" n="3"/>Beautiful German hand-made articles, also honey, are offered for sale to help the sufferers abroad. Obtainable at our office, 128 North La Salle Street, Room 47, Phone: Franklin 0339.</p>
