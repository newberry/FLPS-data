   <p>The administration of the Uhlich Orphan's Home, celebrated last night in the Central Music Hall, its 28th anniversary. A large attendance was present and the guests had an opportunity to watch the orphans at their plays and their work at both of which they were quite at home. The number of orphans at present housed, has increased to about 100. The total receipts for the year were $13,183.41. The expenses were $18,523.02 of which the greater part went into new buildings. For household and asylum of the orphans, $7,327.04 were spent, about $71.01 for each child. Not considered in this amount are large quantities of food, donated to the institution, also the works of the women and maids' club, which is valued at $1200.00 a year. The Board of Directors of the orphans home consists of: Wilhelm Knocke, president, John Baur, secretary, I. L. Dietz, treasurer, F. W. Forch, Wm. Schick, lac. Huber, Henry Keller, Ad. Kurtz and Pastor John. Dr. Albert Ochsner of 710 Sedgwick Street is the house physician of the institution. Mr. Jos. H. Muehlke is the lawyer. The management of the home is in the hands of the couple A. H. Lang and their daughters Miss May and Emma Lang.</p>
