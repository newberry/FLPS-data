   <p>Attorney General Homer S. Cummings has called a conference in Washington to combat crime. His call was answered by six hundred delegates, among them governors and attorneys general of several states, state's attorneys, judges, chiefs of police, sheriffs, law professors, educators, and other persons who, by profession or as individuals, are interested in combating crime. The press gives detailed reports of the conference, and publishes all kinds of statistical material dealing with crime in the United States and other countries.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt opened the conference with an address, and quite a number of outstanding personalities are likewise going to give addresses. Furthermore, committees have been created to deliberate on the various <pb facs="5418474_9_1256.jpg" n="2"/>phases of the problem and submit recommendations to the conference. On reading about all this, one comes to the conclusion that this conference is the first one of its kind; but this is by no means so. Similar meetings have taken place before. At these former conferences, speeches were made and resolutions passed, but crime has not decreased. One may even say that crime has been on the increase.</p>
   <p>Rivers of ink have been used to write about the causes of this situation; many of these causes are universally known: lenience of juries, political corruption, laxity in handling applications for pardons, corrupt practices of lawyers, to mention only a few. These conditions, however, explain only why many habitual criminals for years escape the punishment they deserve. They do not explain why so many young people become habitual criminals, or how they contrive to commit their first crime, and later develop into professional criminals.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1257.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Crime and criminals have always been with us, and are likely to remain. Crimes of violence, and crimes against property, arise from human frailties and are perhaps irradicable. They cannot be considered as typical examples. The problem at hand is the professional criminal. There are, in this country, thousands of persons who make crime a profession. These persons are a grave danger to society. The worst of it is that state authorities seem to be powerless against them. According to reliable authority, Al Capone has about five hundred murders on his conscience. He was, however, never indicted for murder, but is at present serving a prison sentence for tax evasion.</p>
   <p>There is a large number of similar cases that make it clear that habitual criminals are, in certain cases, so powerful that the authorities seem to be quite helpless to deal with them. When, however, criminals get into a position where they clash with federal agents and use their guns, then, and only then, are they sentenced to die. That so many federal agents <pb facs="5418474_9_1258.jpg" n="4"/>lose their lives may imply that the criminals are the better shots.</p>
   <p>Many consider the failures in handling our criminal laws responsible for the increase in professional crime. Especially does that criticism come from English experts, who see, in the quick apprehension, trial, and sentencing of criminals, one of the strongest protections and defenses against crime. The English criminal law (and its execution) is noted for its swiftness. This assumption may perhaps not be quite justifiable, commendable though the English system might be. The basic cause for the crime evil lies in the fact that an extraordinarily high percentage of American youth has criminal tendencies. The cause lies in the home of their parents, which fails them as does the school. This is the reason the present conference for combating crime will be as little productive of results as former ones.</p>
