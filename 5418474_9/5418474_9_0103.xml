   <p>A picnic and the blessing of the flags of the Harugari Order of Chicago took place yesterday in Ogden's Grove. The Harugari choir sang the beautiful song "This is the Day of the Lord". The speaker, Mr. Ph. Kohler gave a brief historical sketch of the order. He said: "Hardly 27 years ago, on March 9, 1847, twelve German men assembled in New York, deeply resentful on account of the humble attitude of the Germans towards the Americans. To protect the German immigrant they formed a fraternal order and called it D. O. H., having as its purpose: The preservation of the German language in the United States, the promotion of the intellectual and material interests of German speaking citizens, help for the needy ones, support for the widows, etc.</p>
   <p>Today the order has over 400 lodges and a membership of over 30,000. The total capital of the lodges is over $400,000. Help was provided during the last two years to 6,225 brethren with $114,387; for 777 widows and orphans, $70,000; funeral expenses were $62,266.87.</p>
   <p>The Harugari order established its first lodge in Illinois in 1848, one year after it was founded in New York. The first Illinois lodge was located in <pb facs="5418474_9_0104.jpg" n="2"/>the town of Galena. There are nine lodges in Chicago, the oldest of which was founded in 1858. Only three members of this oldest lodge are still with us. They are: Jac. Poths, Fritz Groth and Fred Heidel. It must be a satisfaction for them to assist at today's celebration.</p>
