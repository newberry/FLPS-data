  <body>
   <p>At the beginning of the year 1926, the Alexian Brothers Hospital rounds out the 60th year of its uninterrupted activity in the service of suffering humanity in the United States, and particularly in Chicago. The submission of the 60th yearly report of the Alexian Hospital, would certainly appear incomplete to its friends and admirers without a short historical retrospect, especially for those, who were witnesses of and participants in the original development, and the activity of these pioneers of Christian Karitas and of hospital organizations.</p>
   <p>The founding of the Alexian Brothers association reaches back to the beginning of the 14th century, at which time a number of men suffused with Christian love formed an association, to care for the poor people, who were victims of the epidemic, to ease their suffering and to bury their dead. From this association of charitable men, developed the nursing order of the Alexian Brothers, which, in the course of time, spread to many institutions, devoted to Samaritan services, all over Europe. The latest settlements are institutions in Bavaria, Switzerland and Ireland. The Alexian Brothers have discharged <pb facs="5418474_9_0147.jpg" n="2"/>their duties for over 600 years, and the good reputation which the members of the association enjoy everywhere, is no doubt the best reward for their self sacrificing work.</p>
   <p>The General Training Institute, the residence of the Superior General, has been since the 14th century, in Aachen, the old German city of Emperors. Some of the buildings including the chapel, have been in existence since the year 1481. In December, 1865, the Superior General of Aachen, sent Brother Bonaventura Thelen to America, for the purpose of establishing a settlement, and thereby to open up new fields for work.</p>
   <p>Every beginning is difficult. Brother Bonaventura had to experience it too. His crossing was an adventurous one. He was shipwrecked, but was saved and finally landed on American soil. After looking around in several cities of the East and Middle West, he thought he had discovered the best location in Chicago, on beautiful Lake Michigan, a growing city where he could begin his difficult work.</p>
   <p>With the assistance and hospitality of noble minded people, Brother Bonaventura was enabled to pull through the hard winter, and to make preparations <pb facs="5418474_9_0148.jpg" n="3"/>to carry on the great task entrusted to him. On March 31st, 1866, the document of the founding of the first hospital (emergency hospital) was prepared. An illustration of the spirit of Father Bonaventura is the fact, that he picked up the first patient on Franklin Street, carried him home on his back, laid him in his own bed, and nursed him devotedly, while he himself had to dispense with a comfortable bed.</p>
   <p>The following year, when several Brothers were sent over by the Mother House, it was decided to immediately start the building of a hospital. However, the property was too small, and, diocese property, could not be acquired. The Brothers therefore decided to buy a big piece of property between North Franklin and North Market Streets; not far from North Avenue. In the fall of 1867, the cornerstone was laid for this hospital, which in a year's time was ready to receive patients. Scarcely three years after its erection, this hospital which cost so much money, was destroyed in the great fire of 1871. Of the furnishings, only a little heap of ashes remained. According to official estimate, the loss amounted to a bout $100,000.</p>
   <p>With undiminished courage, plans were immediately drawn up for a new building, and in the next year on the same spot a much larger hospital was erected, <pb facs="5418474_9_0149.jpg" n="4"/>which also served as the provincial Mother House, and novitiate of the Alexian Brothers in this country. For reasons which can be seen later, this hospital could not stay in the possession of the Brothers after the year 1895.</p>
   <p>A second hospital was erected by the Brothers in the year 1869 in St. Louis, Mo., on Osage St. and Carondelet Rd., which premises are the highest situated in the city. The buildings are surrounded by extensive gardens and parks, and with this hospital are connected, besides the surgical and medical departments, a sanitarium for nervous diseases. In the year 1888 was founded in Oshkosh, Wis., a third hospital, exclusively for nervous diseases. On account of the practical arrangement the quiet situation, with fenced parks and resting places, fully answers the demands made on an institution treating such maladies.</p>
   <p>Progress is and remains the password of the Alexian Brothers, and in the year 1893 another hospital was built in the eastern part of the Union, in Elizabeth, N. J. at great expense. The attendance at this hospital, situated almost in the center of the city, is always very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>The growth of Chicago, which even in America is without precedent, resulted <pb facs="5418474_9_0150.jpg" n="5"/>in the necessity of building elevated railroads, because the street cars were insufficient to handle the traffic. For this reason, the hospital on N. Market and Franklin Sts., which was in the path of the elevated road, had to give way.</p>
   <p>As soon as the necessity of a new home appeared, the society did not hesitate to look around for a suitable building location and decided, after serious consideration, to buy a lot on Belden and Racine Aves. On October 4, 1896, the cornerstone was laid by Archbishop Feehan in the presence of an immense crowd, amidst great festivities preceded by an imposing parade.</p>
   <p>In May, 1916, the Alexian Brothers celebrated the 50th anniversary of the foundation of their community and institution in the United States, amidst solemn ceremonies and the participation of a multitude of people. The Alexian Brothers can look back with satisfaction upon the success they have achieved in the service of suffering mankind during their 60 years in the United States. Although there were years of serious and exerting work, these sacrifices were not in vain.</p>
