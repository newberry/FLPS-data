  <body>
   <p>The committee on arrangements appointed at the last session of the Central Committee of the Singers' Alliance will meet today at five o'clock at Quincy Number Nine to decide on the hall and the date of the concert to be given for the people in New Ulm. As far as the various singing societies are concerned, probably all will participate in some manner. Those who cannot appear can be very useful, however, by selling tickets.</p>
   <p>The committee expects to hear from every song club of the city today.</p>
   <p>The Ladies</p>
   <p>The ladies who were associated with the last song festival are kindly and urgently requested to come to Brand's Hall, headquarters of the Germania Male Chorus, this evening to make arrangements for their participation in the New Ulm concerts. The ladies can be exceedingly helpful in making the affair a success.</p>

   <p>A Letter of Appreciation from New Ulm</p>
   <p>"New Ulm, July 26.</p>
   <p>"To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"In my recent visit to Chicago I was not able to thank you personally for the sympathy expressed in your valued paper for our misfortune.</p>
   <p>"I therefore take this opportunity to express my profound gratitude in the name of the people of New Ulm.</p>
   <p>"Immediate help is always best, and if Chicago does provide it, then I feel convinced that our town will be rebuilt within a few months and appear substantially as it did before.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0942.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Again thanking you heartily, I remain</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"S. Loewenthal</p>
   <p>"For the Relief Committee"</p>
   <p>To the German Singing Societies of Chicago</p>
   <p>Members!</p>
   <p>The delegates representing fourteen clubs affiliated with the North American Singers' Alliance have unanimously decided to give a concert next week for the benefit of the victims of the New Ulm disaster.</p>
   <p>It was agreed not only that combined choral singing should be offered, but that the separate clubs should also sing their own selections. The undersigned committee desires to provide an opportunity for all our German singers to do their <pb facs="5418474_9_0943.jpg" n="4"/>share in this humane work and also asks all clubs which are not affiliated with the Alliance to appear in the concert. This immense concert will also be the basis for the eventual formation of an alliance comprising all Chicago's singing societies, an organization which is being planned for the near future.</p>
   <p>All clubs which accept our invitation and intend to sing at the concert are asked promptly to send their addresses and their lists of songs selected for the occasion to Hans Balatka, Kingsbury Block, Room 5.</p>
   <p>Greetings from the Central Board of the North American Singers Alliance.</p>
   <p>Franz Amberg, president</p>
   <p>Oscar Schmidt, secretary</p>
