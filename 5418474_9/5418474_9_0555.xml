   <p>To mitigate distress, to bestow advice and assistance upon the German families living in Chiaago, who are not familiar with the language and contitions of this country, have been the endeavors of the German society for almost seventy years. Thousands of German families were benefited, especially during the war, and also after the war.</p>
   <p>The following communications are taken from the records of the activities of the German society during the last three months, among local German families:</p>
   <p>From June 1st until August 31st, ther German society supported with advice and deed 116 families with 414 children, and 49 single persons. Persons received 114 lodgings and 267 meals; 27 persons received free medicine and medical care. Through their intervention nine persons found admission to private hospitals, thirteen in the County hospital, three in Oak Forest, and four in the Tuberculosis Institute, free of charge.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0556.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In spite of make believes and assertions, that every one who is willing to work should secure a position, and taking into consideration the comparison of the records of the same three months of last year, a considerable change has taken place, which is quite alarming.</p>
   <p>Although the society was able to secure positions for 361 persons, however, this amount is ten percent less than the previous record.</p>
   <p>The number of persons who were looking for work amounted to over 4,500, thereby showing an increase of eleven per cent.</p>
   <p>It is also noticeable that the employer is inclined to pay smaller wages for unskilled labor than before. For purposes of relief the society spent in the last three months $1,713.29.</p>
