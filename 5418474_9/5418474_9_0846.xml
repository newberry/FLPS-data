   <p>The regular monthly session of the German Society was held yesterday afternoon under the leadership of its president, Mr. Max Eberhardt. The business manager, Mr. Oscar Kuehne submitted his report of last month's activities: Aid was given to 20 families with 48 children and 9 single persons; nine families with 20 children, and six single persons were helped for the first time, while 11 families with 28 children and three single persons had received help from the society previously.</p>
   <p>The reasons for their distress were: In five cases, the bread winner of the family had died; in five other cases, the father was sick; and in the same number of cases the provider had abandoned his family; two families were destitute and had no employment and among three families advanced age and infirmity were the causes of poverty. Of the single persons to whom assistance was given, two were sick, four had no money, or work, and three were old and feeble.</p>
   <p>The society paid $141.50 towards their support. Employment was found for 288 people, whereby they saved $576 in agency fees. Correspondence involved <pb facs="5418474_9_0847.jpg" n="2"/>the reception and mailing of 337 letters and post cards. The following firms became members of the German Society and paid the yearly dues of $50: E. W. Zander &amp; Co., Charles Seitz;.... and seven other companies; also, Dr. J. P. Buck.</p>
