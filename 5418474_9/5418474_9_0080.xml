   <p>Contributions to the society in money and material were received to the extent of about $125. The work of the sewing meetings has embraced the manufacture of 100 garments from 233 yards of cotton flannel, 187 garments from 328 1/2 yards of muslin, and fifty aprons and sacks from 121 1/2 yards of calico, - a total of 331 garments made up from 679 3/4 yards of material.</p>
   <p>In relation to the work done by this truly benevolent society the president desires to most sincerely thank the many donors of money and material, all of which has been most judiciously used for only the strictly needy and worthy poor, and she would further kindly thank the generous families residing on Wabash and Indiana Avenues for contribution of some needful things for her own personal use. Mrs. Haas has vigorously prosecuted the arduous labors of this society for five consecutive years without re-numeration, excepting for one month during September of last year, when <pb facs="5418474_9_0082.jpg" n="3"/>she labored also for the Bible Society in connection with the Relief Society. Those who may have means or material at their command for which they desire a worthy use are urged to freely contribute of the same to this Aid Society, which will use carefully and distribute wisely the contributions placed at its disposal. The mothers sewing meeting occurs each Wednesday afternoon, and the one for children on Saturday afternoon. In relation to the Thanksgiving dinner furnished to sixty-nine persons, the president desires to state that this was the gift of the Rev. G. C. Needham, pastor of the Chicago Avenue Church, who kindly admitted that number of poor, brought by the society to the Thanksgiving feast spread for the poor at his church on that day.</p>
