<title level="a">JOHANN STRAUSS III THE GUEST OF HONOR AT AUSTRIAN CHARITABLE AFFAIR</title></bibl>

   <p>An old proverb says, "Let a man be noble, helpful, and good". This was actually put into practice yesterday evening at the charitable festival of the Austrians in Schubert House, as Consul General Michael F. Girten remarked in his brief but highly applauded talk toward the end of the official program. The representative of the Austrian Republic, who was accompanied by his staff, sincerely thanked all who had contributed to the success of the festival, whether by taking part in the program, by financial support, or in any way whatever, and then, after announcing that the opera singer, Marie Seritza, was out of town and was unfortunately unable to be present, he introduced the guest of honor, Johann Strauss III, the well-known conductor and composer, who has been in Chicago for a few days.</p>
   <p>Dr. Strauss, who was accompanied by his gracious wife, briefly replied to <pb facs="5418474_9_0474.jpg" n="2"/>the Consul General's words, and expressed his pleasure at being able to take part in an affair so pleasant as this, which recalled memories of the old homeland. "Today I really began to enjoy my stay in Chicago," he declared.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the evening Dr. Jack Kobalter, the chairman of the festival, greeted the guests, who filled the great hall, and later even the rooms upstairs, to capacity, and gave expression to the hope that they would spend a few pleasant hours in pleasant company. And the experience of all the visitors was in complete fulfillment of this hope.</p>
   <p>A number of distinguished Chicago artists graciously offered their services for the rich program of entertainment which took place in the great hall. Their performances last night were of the highest quality. To begin with the ladies, especially deserving of mention are Miss Annemarie Certs and Miss Edna Werner, for their singing; and Mrs. Fritzi Rehbach, who again showed <pb facs="5418474_9_0475.jpg" n="3"/>that she is an artist on the piano. Angelo Lippich, Joseph Lenz, and Franz Schoenfeld, who also served as anncuncer, were in good voice and contributed to the success of the evening with their songs, some of which were Viennese. Directer Otto Randsburger and Mr. Harry Koenigsmann graciously volunteered to act as accompanists, so that success was assured.</p>
   <p>The Steirer Damenchor (Styrian Women's Chorus), under Director N. A. Rehberg, volunteered to take part in this worthy cause. As usual, their selections met with well-deserved praise, and not least the last selection, a group of three songs sung by a mixed chorus. The same can be said of the offerings of the Tyrole Gemischte Chor (Tyrolean Mixed Chorus) under Tony Godetz, the Chicago Zither Club under the direction of Joseph Waldherr, the Schubert House Orchestra under the direction of Emil Friedrich, and the three children, Hedwig and Lillian Rossman and Joseph Laffnitzegger, who gave a Styrian dance for which Ignatz Laffnitzegger played the accompaniment. When it comes to doing something for charity the Schuhplattler-Verein Gamsgebirg (Clog dance Society <pb facs="5418474_9_0476.jpg" n="4"/>of the Tyrolean Alps) never fails to he on hand, nor did it this time. Naturally, its dapces won great applause.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's affair was successful not only socially, but financially as well. Thanks to the fact that all the performers donated their services, and that the proprietor of Schubert House provided the hall free of charge, and that many others made donations of various sorts, the expenses were relatively small and a considerable amount of money was secured for the relief of poor and needy countrymen this winter.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: the article concludes with the names of committee members in charge of the entertainment.]</p>
