   <p>If our school council wasted less time on personalities and party politics in their sessions and paid more attention to methods of education, they would do more justice to this institution and render a greater service to the citizens and to the children, who would profit by it later in life.</p>
   <p>Any improvement that can be made in our system of education can best be decided on by teachers of standing, and the most experienced and efficient teachers should be invited by the School Board to discuss such important topics. One deficiency of our educational system can be seen even by a layman: the neglect of moral education; the lack of a daily lesson in which children are taught how to behave themselves outside of school.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1389.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To most of our teachers accomplishing anything worth while in this direction may seem difficult and hopeless, and not every teacher, male or female, has the natural talent to hope for success in this branch of instruction. But among our teaching personnel there are some, undoubtedly, who have a natural inclination toward child psychology and who would be capable of arousing the higher instincts which are latent in every child's heart. If these instincts are once awakened in a certain number of children, they will soon have a beneficial influence on their fellow pupils, and much good will result.</p>
   <p>"Youth must have free rein" is an old proverb. That is quite true, but the free rein must not degenerate into rudeness and then into a disregard of all human laws of conduct and, finally, into a contempt for all laws and the commission of punishable acts of lawlessness.</p>
   <p>Of the youthful criminals who stand every year before our judges, probably hundreds could have been saved for a better life if education in ethics and <pb facs="5418474_9_1390.jpg" n="3"/>behavior had received more attention in the schools, and the better instincts in human beings had been appealed to.</p>
   <p>Especially now, at a time when the whole world is talking and dreaming about peace on earth, the individual, too, is longing for a peaceful life after all these turbulent years. The police have already tried to comply with this desire as far as possible, and have taken action against the demoralization of our young people, against the brutality and rowdyism to which the growing generation claims to have a right. But they, by themselves, cannot curb this evil. Parents and schools have to co-operate and, because the former very often fail in this respect, perhaps because of indifference or ignorance, or because they have lost all authority over their children, it is up to the schools to take over the task of teaching ethical conduct, a thing which should always have been considered the foremost duty of a teacher.</p>
