   <p>The Administration of the German Evangelical Lutheran Orphan Asylum at Addison, Dupage County, Illinois has just published its annual report. The following deserves special mention:</p>
   <p>The Institution lodged in the past year 97 orphans, 52 boys and 45 girls. There were 39 orphans and 58 half orphans; from Chicago came 63 children. The health condition of the inmates was excellent. Confirmed(Religious) were 18 children. 12 boys and 6 girls. 34 applied for admission, of which only 9 could be accepted, the others had to be refused, for lack of space. Among those refused, there were only 5 orphans. The asylum received last year, several legacies, the one from Mr. William Buschmann of $5000...stands in first place. It is intended, to erect an addition, and make improvements to the total amount of $11,000. As superintendents Teacher Ernest Leubner and his wife, nee Wagner, are functioning.</p>
