   <p>Since the famed cow of DeKoven street (Mrs. O'Leary's cow) has retired from the (fire) stage due to various dementis, a new candidate has appeared to claim the fame of being the Herotratos of Chicago. People who claim to be members of the International are said to have set fire to Chicago. A long story of the conspiracy to destroy Chicago is reported in yesterday's Times - written much too cleverly and dramatically to be the story of a real incendiary. Even the Times does not dare to assert the credibility of the communication (that, it says, owes its inception to a frightened conscience). The story would be somewhat less incredible if the author did not appear in the mask of an American worker who claims to have become enthusiastic about the International in Paris. For one thing, the destruction of all big cities is, as far as we know, not at all on the program in the political credo of the International, and, even the partial destruction of Paris by the Petroleum-Commune met with the actual disapproval of the heads of the International in London.</p>
   <p>If the "Capital" had to be destroyed through fire, a far more "representative" place might have been found, than Chicago particularly, where the opposition between capital and labor has not by any length developed to the same acuteness as in London and Manchester, England; or in New York, and Boston, on this side of the ocean. The incendiary who pretends to be penitent and tells his story in the Times, though this will inescapably deliver him over to <pb facs="5418474_9_1127.jpg" n="2"/>the knives of the International, feels himself, that the fire, interpreted as punishment for the capitalists, really went a tremendous length beyond the program of the seven or more Chicago conspirators and members of the International. Instead of stopping at about Indiana street on the North Side, the fire raged up to Lincoln Park, bringing poverty to tens of thousands of workers, which was exclusively intended for "capital." The afore-mentioned penitent conspirator is cautious enough to remark that two of the original members of the International in Chicago (that is to say of the Chicago branch) died in the flames; likewise seven of the members who were charged with nursing the fire along; and that two other members have been so burnt that they probably will be cripples for life. The whole story in our opinion owes its origin to the tendency to present for great and horrible catastrophes, horrible causes and, therefore, to invent them, and finally to believe them. That part of Greek mythology that occupies itself with the monsters on the edge of the world, now receives in the modern Carbonari and "International" legends the modern counterpart.</p>
