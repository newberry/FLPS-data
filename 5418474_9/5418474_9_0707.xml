   <p>The German Society held its annual meeting in the Bismarck Hotel under the leadership of Miachel F. Girten. A short report of the activities of the Society in 1914 was given: 3,207 persons received cash relief, amounting to $8,761.30, meals were given to 10, 882 persons, besides shelter to 1,218 amounting to $1,577.80 a sum total of $10,339.00.</p>
   <p>The employment office of the Society places 3,442 persons; 61 persons were admitted to various hospitals, 7 persons found shelter in other institutions, 344 persons were given legal protection; mail, concerning work, or for persons without permanent residence, amounting to 5,179 was mediated.</p>
   <p>President Girten points to the necessity of new members; extraordinary circumstances, he asserts, reflects upon the Society which causes tremendous expenses, referring to congestion of business, the closing of the stock exchange, a result of the world war; furthermore, the arrival of many German reservists from other cities, which owing to the impossibility of being sent to Germany, remain here; <pb facs="5418474_9_0708.jpg" n="2"/>the majority, however being without any means whatsoever to exist, must be taken care of, thus causing a tremendous strain upon the society, although the German Consulate effectively secured employment for a few; nevertheless, the heavy burden rest upon the society, therefore the necessity of securing new members and acceptance of donations of all kinds are commendable.</p>
