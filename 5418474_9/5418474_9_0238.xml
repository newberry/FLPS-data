   <p>A few days prior to the municipal elections, John Fischmiller told his friends that he would give a day's receipts from his saloon to the Alexian Brothers Hospital, if Harrison was elected. The day selected was the first Sunday after the election, from twelve o'clock noon until midnight.</p>
   <p>Several announcements were published. Mayor Harrison was elected and Mr. Fischmiller kept his word. As was to be expected, the crowd at the tavern was unusually large and the net proceeds amounted to seventy-five dollars, which was given to the Hospital.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fischmiller's was a noble deed which certainly deserves emulation! We thank you, Mr. Fischmiller, for your kind efforts.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0239.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We thank all who participated. The inmates of the Hospital will remember the gift with gratitude and will bless you. We send our ardent thanks to all who had the welfare of the Hospital at heart.</p>
   <p>The Alexian Brothers</p>
