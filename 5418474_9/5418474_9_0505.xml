   <p>After the failure of our festivities on October 13, (dance and raffle at the Lincoln Turnhall), which had been arranged to obtain funds for the veterans, the committee in charge of the Fund appealed to the public for help.</p>
   <p>As a result of that appeal and the numerous letters mailed by our secretary, Comrade George Meyer, we obtained the following donations from generous persons. In acknowledging the various amounts, we also concur in the invocation, "God bless you!"</p>
   <p>Swabian Club, $100; William Wieboldt Foundation, $80; German Freemason Circle, $25; Carl Zwanzig, editor of the LaSalle County Herald, $25; C. Paschen, <pb facs="5418474_9_0506.jpg" n="2"/>Building Commissioner, $25; German Veterans Alliance of Chicago, $5 monthly. [Translator's note: smallest contribution, one dollar. Altogether, twenty names are listed.] Total, $347.50.</p>
   <p>A friend and supporter of long standing, in sending his contribution, enclosed the following note: "If among the 350,000 Germans in Chicago, only ten thousand can be found who will give a single dollar as a final sum--a sort of permanent memorial--then the old heroes would be protected from want until the final march. Even if only five thousand would each subscribe one dollar, then the plight of the veterans could be considerably ameliorated, since within two to five years most of our wards of the Grand Army will have been called to the 'Great Beyond'.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, my dear countrymen, be imbued with the Christmas spirit! Who will help? We cannot let the heroes of Germany's epochal period suffer from want and starvation. It would be a disgrace to Chicago's German community."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0507.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Donations will be gratefully received by George Meyer, secretary, 1711 Otto Street; Paul Hallmann, treasurer, 2708 Washington Boulevard (Masonic Temple).</p>
   <p>The Committee</p>
   <p>Consul M. Girten, honorary president</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Altogether six names are listed.]</p>
