   <p>The Board of Directors of the Uhlich's Orphanage, spurred by newspaper reports regarding the manner in which the wards of Mauermann are fed and treated, felt induced to start an investigation.</p>
   <p>These facts were disclosed: The children's food consists mostly of bread and syrup. The treatment of the children, - especially of the boys, is far too severe, often it is cruel. The main educational instrument is the rod. Such are the results of the investigation.</p>
   <p>Will these gentlemen, realizing now the state of affairs, take measures to stop these abuses? That would look as if we cared about what the press writes or to admit that "our management" up to now has been no good. To make improvements, let us wait until the end of the year, then we can proceed "out of our own iniative" - thus spoke one of these wise fellows - and his words were officially approved.</p>
   <p>Concerning the brutal beating of children, it was resolved to request Mr. Mauermann to forbid his son to mistreat the little ones and at the same time <pb facs="5418474_9_0331.jpg" n="2"/>to give Mr. Mauermann a vote of confidence.</p>
   <p>Who would dispute the fact that these Christian-German counsellors of waifs are smart, clever and humanitarian people?</p>
