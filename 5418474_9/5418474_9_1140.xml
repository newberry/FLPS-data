   <p>..To a telegram in which we asked the "Cincinnati Volksblatt" to send us type, we have received no answer. Another German publisher from whom we asked a favor, answered with an unpaid telegram, for which we had to remain in arrears to the amount of fifty-five cents, because we need the few pennies saved, to buy bread and water. On the other hand, the Cincinnati Commercial sent the Chicago Tribune without solicitation a whole supply of type, arranged in boxes and ready for use! That is American fellowship (Collegialitat).</p>
   <p>...The Germans of America collected a million and sent it to Germany... Here is a calamity infinitely worse for ten thousands of German families than the victorious war was for an equal number of families in Germany. Now it is time that rich Germany that is receiving 1200 millions of thalers from France, and whose capitalists own at least 600 millions of thalers of American securities. opens its hand....</p>

   <p>All copies of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung in our office building and in the homes of our editors have been destroyed. Not a single copy of the paper from before the day of horror is in our possession. We ask therfore everybody who has a collection of the paper - however incomplete - to keep it and to sell it to us later on, as soon as we are somewhat better established.</p>
