  <body>
   <p>No one can doubt nowadays that this system has been adopted here by the police. Take for instance the Pinkerton man, Johnson, who played the "agent pro vocateur" in that Anarchist trial, or were Selijer and Waller any different? And how about Wilson in the present law against the conspirators, or the until now unknown informer in the latest dynamite process?</p>
   <p>We have every reason to believe that the Haymarket bomb was thrown by an agent by order of the police department. We also have every possible reason to believe that both of the last mentioned conspiracies were instigated by stool-pigeons from the police.</p>
   <p>If we consider furthermore that one of the biggest noise-makers in Chicago's labor organizations, the same man who agitated against the Arbeiter Zeitung for not being radical enough, was unmasked as a stool-pigeon, and that additional disclosures of that nature will follow, then the entire working class of Chicago must watch its step.</p>

   <p>Under present conditions it is imperative not to venture into a field where the enemy is superior.</p>
   <p>Do not trust anyone, investigate your leaders, under no circumstances allow yourself to be provoked.</p>
