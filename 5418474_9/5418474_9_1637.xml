   <p>The results of the investigation of the origin of the population of Chicago, on the basis of the last census, has not been decided. After the publication of the census, interesting conclusions can be drawn. The population of German descent which was estimated at 112,228 in 1920, has increased to 350,000. The first figures refer only to those people of German descent, who were born in Germany or in German speaking countries, but the latter figures refer to all those who are of German descent, regardless of where they were born.</p>
   <p>Increase Of Other Groups</p>
   <p>The greatest increase, however, can be noticed by the Poles. The census taken in 1920 showed 137,611 people of Polish descent, this number has increased this year to 400,000. The arrival at these figures was reached on the same basis as with the people of German descent. The Negro population has almost doubled since 1920. According to estimates, Chicago has at the present time 200,000 Negroes. In the other groups there are approximately estimated 175,000 <pb facs="5418474_9_1638.jpg" n="2"/>Irish, 75,000 Swedes; 30,000 Danes; 150,000 Italians; 150,000 Czecho-Slovaks; 60,000 Greeks; 2500 Chinese and 300 Japanese.</p>
