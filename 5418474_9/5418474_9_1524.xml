   <p>The Lake View State Bank bought the property located on the southeast corner of Clark Street and Belmont Avenue (92 by 156 feet), where a branch of the post office once was, from Mathias Weiss, for $80,000. The Bank intends to wreck the old buildings and to erect a new three-story bank and office structure which is to be completed by May 1 of next year. The Bank's business has increased to such an extent that more room is necessary.</p>
   <p>John Kranz deeded to his daughter, Florence M. Kranz, the five-story commercial building, 17 to 21 West Washington Street, (40 by 180 feet) and the four-story business building, 456 South State Street (24.7 by 100 feet). The value of the former property is put at $304,000, and that of the latter at $112,800.</p>
