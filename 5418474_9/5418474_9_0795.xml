   <p>According to the report of business manager, Spath, the German Society has in the month of November considered 180 applications for assistance, of which 172 were granted. One hundred and eighteen families with 274 children and 54 single persons received help, a total of $555.50 being spent for this purpose. In 220 cases board and lodging, and in 18 cases 1/2 ton of coal, were paid for. Three hundred ten persons receiving employment. Since the cold weather set in, the number of unemployed were from out of town has greatly increased and in consequence, the requests for help have so increased it is to be feared the unemployment situation, which has lasted for over a year, will continue during the winter.</p>
   <p>The inquiries for farm laborers have ceased altogether, and prospects for factory workers obtaining employment, soon, are still very unfavorable. Membership contributions totaled $155.00 while expenditures for assistance have increased threefold.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0796.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is urgently requested, that more German citizens of means should join the German society, that they may be in a position to extend their humane work, for the benefit of the needy German workingmen's families, widows and orphans. Second hand clothing will be called for, if the donors leave their address at 61 La Salle Street, or telephone Main 4206.</p>
