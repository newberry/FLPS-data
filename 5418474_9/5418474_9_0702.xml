   <p>England wants to starve out Germany. By the most ruthless and brutal application of her own sea-power and that of France, in disregard of international law and all trade rights of neutral nations, Germany and Austria-Hungary are to be cut off from all overseas trade, and particularly from all imports of foodstuffs. At the same time England expects to feed her own people and France by importing American provisions. Huge quantities of American wheat have been bought up and shipped to England and France; many more millions of bushels of wheat are stored in the grain elevators of our Eastern ports, ready to be loaded on board ship, and still more quantities are being bought by the English. England is claiming the entire American wheat surplus for herself. A large portion of this wheat crop was raised by German farmers, and millions of Americans of German blood and heritage are sick at heart when they realize that all this golden grain, raised on American soil and by the hard work of their fellow nationals, is to benefit Germany's enemies only.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0703.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>German-Americans are trying to find ways and means by which their brothers and sisters [over there] may receive some of America's wheat surplus and thus thwart the devilish plan of Germany's arch enemy, since a shortsighted American business policy knew how to forestall an export embargo, which would have put an end to partiality.</p>
   <p>A remedy is believed to have been found. It is suggested that every German and Austro-Hungarian man and woman should send their relatives and acquaintances in the Reich and in the dual monarchy foodstuffs via parcel post! Especially pure American wheat flour in ten-pound packages!</p>
   <p>Would that be possible? Of course! Flour is not contraband, and may not be considered as such if it is destined for noncombatant civilians. International law says so, and that is also attitude of the United States Government in regard to the British starvation policy. The United States Mail will accept flour packages, properly wrapped, for parcel post service to Germany and Austria-Hungary. The U. S. Mail has to accept such parcels, and could not reject them <pb facs="5418474_9_0704.jpg" n="3"/>if it wanted to.</p>
   <p>Would this scheme be practicable ? Is a small flour shipment to Germany advisable? In a practical business sense, no! Because ten pounds of flour--and more could not be sent in a single parcel, since the weight limit is eleven pounds, and about one pound would go for the wrapper--represent a value of nearly forty cents at prevailing prices. The mailing expenses would be $1.45 to $1.50 including wrappings, postage and insurance. The parcel postage alone would be about $1.32 and insurance ten cents per package. The "gravy" therefore would be much more expensive than the "roast," so to speak, and from a business point of view the enterprise would be unpracticable and inadvisable on account of the high overhead. Even so, it would hardly be possible to nourish the German people in this way or even furnish them with an appreciable amount of their food requirements.</p>
   <p>The United States Mail would not be equal to that task, and would probably soon collapse under that volume of flour parcels. Besides, there are not enough <pb facs="5418474_9_0705.jpg" n="4"/>Mail steamers available to transport all those flour gifts.</p>
   <p>Other problems and sentimental considerations are also involved in this scheme.</p>
   <p>Even if it may not be possible, in this manner, to provide the blood relatives "over there" with the thousands of tons of flour which would be needed to put that delicious white roll back on the German breakfast table, nevertheless any flour parcels that could be mailed would make the recipient families in Germany and Austria very, very happy, and would relieve their food problems to some extent. Besides, it would vex "our" good enemies, the British, no end. Supposing a week from today news would get around that, within the last few days, German-Americans had mailed hundreds of thousands of flour parcels to Germany, and that the movement was spreading among German and Austrian Americans, would not the Britishers be scared and say: "And there are about twenty millions of that kind in America. What is going to happen, where are we going to get wheat and flour, how can we starve the Germans out?"</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0706.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The probable impression which this enterprise would make on the English, would be worth the trial!</p>
   <p>There are other possibilities which would make the experiment highly tempting, but we cannot go into that now. We just wanted to submit the idea to our readers. In case of a favorable reaction the Abendpost will be glad to find out how the plan could be carried out best and most efficiently and with the least possible expense, and will report on it in its local columns. Other ways could also be devised. What do you think of it?</p>
