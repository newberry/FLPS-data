   <p>As we briefly remarked yesterday, a number of citizens of the Tenth and Eleventh Wards met two days ago at Feldcamp's Inn, at the corner of Randolph and Halsted Streets, to devise means and ways to eliminate the large number of disreputable establishments in the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>A delegation consisting of Messrs. H. Vater, W. Swissler, N. Fountain, John Feldcamp, and E. Bardell visited the mayor and submitted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The citizens of the Tenth and Eleventh Wards of the City of Chicago sent a petition to the Superintendent of Police, requesting the closing of disreputable buildings in these wards; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The request was not heeded; and</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1416.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Whereas, Judge Salsbury dismissed the City's suit against a particularly offensive place, without notifying the plaintiffs or securing their consent, basing his judicial act on reasons which we consider untenable, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, citizens of the aforesaid wards, protest against the action of the aforesaid Judge Salsbury, in dismissing the heretofore mentioned suit without the consent of both parties; and we appeal to the Mayor of the City of Chicago, to protect our rights as citizens and taxpayers and to enforce the laws of the State of Illinois in order to protect the inhabitants and uphold the morals of the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That a committee of five citizens be nominated to inform the Mayor of the sentiments of the citizens and taxpayers in regard to the aforesaid matter."</p>
   <p>Mayor Colvin read the document and gave it serious consideration. He then <pb facs="5418474_9_1417.jpg" n="3"/>promised that he would do his utmost to eliminate that public nuisance.</p>
   <p>The delegation departed unostentatiously, hoping that the mayor would keep his pledge.</p>
