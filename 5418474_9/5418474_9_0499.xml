   <p>At a meeting of the executive commmittee of the "German-American Liberty League," held last night at the Hotel Atlantic, under the presidency of Ernest Kruetgen, a resolution was adopted upon the suggestion of the secretary, Mr. Leopold Neumann, to begin immediately to assist the needy unemployed Germans of this city during the hard times financially by obtaining work for them.</p>
   <p>Ernst Buhler, Swiss Consul of Chicago, was elected as treasurer. All donations are to be sent to him at his office, 38 S. Dearborn St. Donations will be acknowledged in the Abendpost.</p>
   <p>The Committee was instructed to work out a plan for the handling of these funds. All German societies should be requested by letter to join this undertaking. A collection, which was taken at the meeting yeilded 75 dollars.</p>

   <p>For the proposed Bunco Party; the following prizes were announced; Chas. Neumann, 5 bags of flour; Mrs. Eidler, 10 or more prizes etc., the surplus receipts of which will be given to he poor.</p>
   <p>The idea however, to start donations for the destitute Germans was much favoured. It was pointed out that the German-American Liberty Leauge not only engages in politics, but will support any German movement in the days of need as it is doing now.</p>
