   <p>In the German Altenheim (Home for the Aged) in Forest Park there was a Christmas celebration last night. On that occasion, all but a few ladies and gentlemen of the board of directors, and many friends of the institution came. After dinner, there was distribution of gifts. Every inmate received a handsome parcel which had been prepared by loving hands. It contained the usual Christmas pastry, cigars and tobacco for the men, fruit and candy for the ladies.</p>
   <p>Then followed musical entertainment in the festively decorated chapel. After the concert was opened by the good home orchestra, under the direction of Miss Emma Olsen, Mae Doelling-Schmidt, the well-known artist and piano teacher, came upon the stage. She played selections from "Eugene Onegin" by Tchaikovsky, for which she received great applause.</p>

   <p>The applause was increased when the artist played the "Sextette" from "Lucia," in the familiar arrangement for the left hand by Leschetizky. It was followed by Mendelssohn's "Auf Fluegeln des Gesanges," the concert study in Fmoll, and "Liebestraum," by Liszt and, as a finale, the "Tarantella" by Liszt. The artist's masterful presentations were rewarded with stormy applause.</p>
   <p>Little Patricia Scheunemann, a pupil of Mae Dolling-Schmidt, fitted her numbers to the occasion. She opened with "Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht" and "O Tannenbaum". Then followed a few concert numbers, the splendid rendition of which was duly appreciated by the audience and was rewarded with lively applause. The concert piano was loaned by the firm of Lyon and Healy. The concert was brought to a close with a few additional numbers from the house orchestra.</p>
   <p>Many of the visitors used the occasion to take a walk through the institution. The order and cleanliness, and the comfortable furnishings of the <pb facs="5418474_9_0372.jpg" n="3"/>rooms were duly admired.</p>
   <p>The Home gives now shelter to 268 inmates; it is under the direction of Dr. Walter Repmann. He and his brave housekeeper (sic) received well-earned recognition.</p>
