   <p>Mr. Hesing's first indictment required $50,000 bail and the latter two, $10,000 each making a total of $70,000 bail. The first indictment charges Hesing as conspiring with Rehm, the second with conspiring with August Newhaus, a storekeeper at the Lake Shore Distillery, and the third is against Hesing, himself as a distiller, the charge being simply that of conspiracy to defraud the Government of the Internal Revenue Tax.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. C. Hesing was visited at his residence last evening by a Tribune reporter, whose mission was to interrogate him in regard to the indictments found against him by the Grand Jury. Mr. Hesing stated that he had necessarily felt much annoyed at what he regarded as causeless persecution on the part of the Government, but he was confident of a triumphant acquittal if an unprejudiced jury could be obtained.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1273.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He had no idea on what the charges against him were based. He had never been inside of a distillery but once, and knew nothing of crooked whisky. He did not see how he could be justly accused of conspiracy; as his influence with the Government had always been exceedingly slight, and very little good it would do for him to conspire. In regard to the trial, Mr. Hesing said that he had engaged Mr. Edmund Juessen as his attorney, and he would enter a plea of not guilty. Mr. Hesing will be on hand this morning to give bail.</p>
   <p>The indictment against Rehm is simply that of conspiracy with Hesing, and the bail was fixed at $50,000.</p>
