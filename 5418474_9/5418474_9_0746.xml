<title level="a">UNANIMOUS ACTION OF THE GERMAN AND AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN AID SOCIETY</title><title level="a" type="sub">Progress Satisfactory</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>That the German element can act in unison when a great and noble cause is at stake, and that this co-operation can really bring wonderful results, was clearly and effectively demonstrated at last night's meeting of the various committees of the Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft (German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society). Since the meeting at which the Society was created, this was the first time that all the committees have met in conference, and the fact that only a very few members failed to answer the roll call proved that eagerness and good will prevailed.</p>
   <p>Shortly after eight o'clock, president Charles H. Wacker opened the meeting in the crowded upper clubrooms of the Bismarck Hotel. Immediately a request was made that all motions should be made in writing, in order to avoid errors, so far as possible. After the minutes of the organizational meeting were read, <pb facs="5418474_9_0747.jpg" n="2"/>Secretary Goldzier announced that a bond of fifty thousand dollars had been approved for the treasurer, that the incorporation documents had arrived, and that approximately one thousand collection blanks had been distributed among individuals, Vereine, and factories where many Germans were employed. Also the following lists of names of members of subcommittees were read:</p>
   <p>Program committee: A. Georg, chairman; Henry Suder, Jacob Spohn, G. A. von Massow, Oskar Gross, Gustav Berkes, and Heinrick Kraft.</p>
   <p>Committee for correspondence and relations with out-of-town associations: Louis Sala, chairman; Hugo Voigt, August Lueders, Albert Graff, Max Leichsenring, E. H. Seemann, Rudolph Seifert, and Fritz Maas.</p>
   <p>Music committee: Wilhelm Arens, chairman; A. Gill, Martin Fluegke, Fritz Maas, and Otto Haubold.</p>
   <p>Committee for meetings: Karl Christmann, chairman; Karl E. Schick, E. G. Kusswurm, Fred Hummel, L. E. Brandt, and Leopold Grand.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0748.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Upon request of the Austro-Hungarian Vereine, Leopold Neilmann announced that these Vereine had decided, at a meeting held last Saturday in the La Salle Turner Hall, to form a branch of their own [of the Aid Society], that they already had started to make collections, with good results so far. The comparatively small Verein Stock im Eisen, for example, had pledged to raise one thousand dollars, and a Hungarian Women's Aid Society had already collected two hundred and fifty dollars. These amounts were to be turned over to the treasurer, Oskar Mayer. Another organizational meeting was to be called for next Saturday, in the La Salle Turner Hall. In order to give this department of the great Aid Society proper representation in the association, it was requested to admit five more delegates to the committee and four more vice-presidents to the executive management. This request was approved unanimously. The report on the activity of the new department [committee for organization] was greeted with loud applause.</p>
   <p>No Great Volksfest for the Time Being</p>
   <p>At the request of the entertainment committee, chairman Adolph Georg reported <pb facs="5418474_9_0749.jpg" n="4"/>a plan to hold a big, but plain and simple, German Volksfest (picnic), on September 6th, in Riverview Park, for which steps had already been taken. Since the overhead expenses would be very low, great profits for the general treasury were to be expected. But, on request of Paul F. Mueller, who said that any festivities, which would lead to demonstrations, would not be advisable under present critical conditions, the proposal was referred back to the committee. Mr. Mueller's objection met with the active support of Theodor Kuehl, John Koelling, Arthur Josetti, Wilhelm Legner, and other speakers, and finally won the approval of the entertainment committee. A festival, therefore, will not take place.</p>
   <p>Chairman Eitel of the finance committee, reported on past activities, and declared that the committee would have a slow start while becoming familiar with their duties and assignments. He also mentioned Adolph Georg's plan to issue artistically designed coupon books in denominations of twenty-five cents, fifty cents, and one dollar. These books are to be put into all German stores, and their principal purpose will be to facilitate contributions by <pb facs="5418474_9_0750.jpg" n="5"/>people in the lower income brackets who would like to do their share by helping the good cause along with smaller amounts. This idea was liked so well that it was decided to ask the finance committee to have such coupon books printed at once. Mr. Eitel also promised that, pretty soon, a list of contributions made so far would be published.</p>
   <p>Then followed a report of the secretary about the activities of the executive committee; then, a report on the press committee activities by its chairman, E. Raster, who pointed out that almost three hundred Vereine had been asked to report all events and incidents, having any relation to the relief work, to this committee for publication and dissemination. Charles Runkel reported on the past success of the German Club, and how it had organized its relief work. Finally, it was decided to charge a committee of three with working out the business rules and bylaws, whereupon the meeting adjourned.</p>
