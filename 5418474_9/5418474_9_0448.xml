   <p>A new building has made its appearance on North Halsted Street. Its owner intends to provide a modern hall building suitable for diverse festivities for the Germans of the near Northside. In memory of the immortal composer, Schubert, it shall be known as the "Schubert House." On Saturday, October 26, at eight o'clock, the formal opening will be proclaimed amid suitable festivities. Location: 1923-1925 Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>Otto Schoeppel is the founder. He has been successful in providing and exceptionally diversified program for the coming celebration. Doctor J. W. Kobalter, president of the Alliance of German-Austro-Hungarian clubs of North America, will be master of ceremonies. At the very opening, the motto shall prevail that it is dedicated as a happy home, where songs and music of our homeland are honored, and youth in particular can find a beautiful hall for pleasure.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0449.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Various speakers will be there: The General Austrian Consul, M. Girten; Alderman Arthur F. Albert; Leopold Saltiel, the attorney,.... and finally the founder of the building, Otto Schoeppel.</p>
   <p>Colorful diversity is assured, choral singing, solo parts, and humorists who are prone to promote a jovial entertainment. The entire assembly will be requested to join in a medley of songs. Merriment is the keynote, and everybody is cordially invited to the house warming party.</p>
