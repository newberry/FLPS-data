   <p>Labor conditions and distress affecting German families remained unchanged during the month of September, according to the reports of the German Society of Chicago. Although employment was obtained for 113 people, job-seekers increased by forty percent. Wages were reduced. A few cold days affected the destitute considerably. The Association's entire supply of clothing and shoes is exhausted. Therefore we beg all well-meaning readers to send us their discarded warm clothing, overcoats, coats, trousers, underwear, shoes, etc. The Society will gladly make arrangements for delivery if notified by telephone or mail. Phone Randolph 4037, 160 North Wells Street.</p>
   <p>In spite of its depleted funds, the Society is giving help in the most pressing cases, continuing its benevolent activities as it has been doing uninterruptedly for seventy-five years.</p>
   <p>Support was given to 42 families with 132 children and 19 single persons, of <pb facs="5418474_9_0511.jpg" n="2"/>whom 6 were women. Homeless and unemployed people received 162 meals and lodging; 4 were sent to private hospitals; 6 to the County hospital, 4 to Oak Forest, where they were accepted as non-paying patients, and 8 obtained free medical treatment, medicine, etc.</p>
   <p>Expenditures for aid amounted to $694.30.</p>
