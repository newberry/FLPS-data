   <p>Weeks of wedded bliss, during which the young couple will be separated one from the other by iron bars and thick stone walls, are ahead of Frank Kibort, thirty-four years old, and Ida Reinberger, twenty-nine years old. Yesterday Judge Joseph Sabath, doing his duty against his will, performed the wedding ceremony in his private chambers at the county building.</p>
   <p>Kibort is at present in the county jail, to which he was taken following a warrant taken out by Krenn &amp; Dato for embezzlement. To all appearances, it looks as though he will have to spend some time longer in jail as he has no money for bail, and a speedy disposal of the case may hardly be expected. To safeguard the honor of the bride and her unborn child, Judge Sabath, in co-operation with the state's attorney's office, consented to perform the marriage ceremony.........</p>
