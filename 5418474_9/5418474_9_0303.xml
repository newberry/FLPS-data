   <p>The annual report of the Administration Board of the "German Catholic Orphanage of the Arch-Diocese of Chicago" and of the three Cemeteries, St. Bonifacius, St. Marie and St. Joseph has just been published. From extensive statistical materials are taken the following points: To the Orphanage 246 children were admitted, 200 were discharged, 6 died and on January 1, 1904 the number of foster children was 469. A total of 675 children were cared for. In the past year enclosed playrooms were built at a cost of $11,500; also five new greenhouses, which proved to be an excellent investment.</p>
   <p>At the cemeteries, St. Bonifacius and St. Marie, 1636 funerals took place; the receipts were $53,002, $11.169 more than in 1902. The St. Joseph Cemetery will be dedicated this summer. The receipts of the Orphanage were $3,180 from gifts, $8,142 from board and $1,709 from collections. The expenses were $43,513, leaving a deficit of $30,581. This amount was covered by the total receipts of the organization. Of the debts $8,583.50 could be repaid.</p>
   <p>The directors for the present year are: Rev. A. J. Thiele, President, Rev. <pb facs="5418474_9_0304.jpg" n="2"/>Peter Faber, Vice-President, Adam Jaeger, Treasurer, August Benz, Secretary.</p>
