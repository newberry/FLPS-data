   <p>The option is a one-sided affair. The holder of an option makes use of it only when real-estate values have  risen, and the owner of the property, who has given an option in this way, loses the increase in the value of his property. Five years ago, when Niles Center had no suspicion that it would become a big city in miniature overnight, Mr. C. F. Guenther gave an option to the Central Cemetery Company on twenty acres on Gross Point Road and Harrison Street, close to the Company's cemetery, at a purchase price of one thousand dollars an acre. The Company has now taken over the property, at a time when its value is at least double or perhaps three times the option price.</p>
   <p>For the reported sum of $70,000, the real-estate broker Albert F. Marthe bought the property, 173 by 290 feet, at the northeast corner of Ellis Avenue and 50th Street. In the place of the old apartment building he will build a group of modern one-family houses.</p>

   <p>On the southwest corner of 16th Street and 52nd Avenue, Cicero, a structural steel plant will be erected. The land, which contains 144,000 square feet, was sold by Benedict Aron to Abraham Nechin for the reported sum of $55,000.</p>
   <p>For the reported sum of $125,000 N. Koenigsberg and Leo H. Weisfeld sold the lot on the southeast corner of Lincoln and Warner Avenues, with a one-story building which contains nine stores, to Thomas H. Claridge. The building lot at 1531 to 1535 Devon Avenue, 50 by 150 feet, is said to have been taken in lieu of $45,000 of the purchase price.</p>
   <p>Walter Loeber acquired the one-story building at 740 to 744 West 79th Street, including the lot, from John J. Gunderyahn for the reported sum of $154,000.</p>
