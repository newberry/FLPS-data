   <p>The executive board of the German Society held its regular monthly session yesterday with Mr. Enderis presiding. [Translator's note: Elsewhere the name is spelled "Endres".] The following monthly report was submitted by the agent:</p>
   <p>"The German Society did its share last month in helping to relieve the general condition. The total amount of money spent, that is, the cash contributions to the poor, is slightly in excess of the January figures. In January $354.47 was donated to charity, and in February, $358.65 was contributed. The major portions were paid to indigent families which were without income because of ailing family heads, and to destitute widows with small children.</p>
   <p>"As was indicated in our last report, immigration actually increased in February; in fact, the upturn had begun to be noticeable in January. It is estimated that there were only from one hundred and fifty to two hundred arrivals in January, while in February the number increased to three or four hundred persons, laborers <pb facs="5418474_9_1029.jpg" n="2"/>of all nationalities. Many of these immigrants sought farm work.</p>
   <p>"During the last month, twenty-five employers, mostly farmers and gardeners in suburban areas, called at our office, and with few exceptions, secured farm help.</p>
   <p>"Such unemployed persons who are actually willing to do laboring work to make an honest living, and who hope to reach higher levels by this means, find opportunities increasing daily. Unfortunately, however, as we have previously reported, we are occasionally faced with a discouraging experience. Some people come to our office every day, some even two and three times a day, imploring us to find any kind of work for them so they need not starve. Finally, when, after considerable effort we have succeeded in finding the applicants jobs in keeping with their ability, and as good as the present financial stringency permits, then, instead of being highly grateful for the temporary respite, many of these people have shown dissatisfaction. They have made the most outrageous demands and have refused to work rather than accept a low wage. Then they annoy <pb facs="5418474_9_1030.jpg" n="3"/>us anew with supplications and complaints.</p>
   <p>"In this connection we may also add that there is a great demand for maid servants, but we rarely find girls who will accept such work, and therefore we cannot satisfy the many requests from prospective employers.</p>
   <p>"One case, involving lost baggage, was brought to our attention, and we took action to locate it.</p>
   <p>"Last year 723 persons called at our office--533 men and 190 women. Of these 723 applicants, 209 asked for help, 257 wanted employment and 165 requested advice and assistance.</p>
   <p>"Cash was paid in 50 instances; 46 people were given room and board for a short period; and employment was obtained for 83 persons. We received 62 letters and mailed 452.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Chas. Endres, Agent."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1031.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In the report of the Arrangements Committee, Claussenius, the Consul, declared that prospects for the Society's benefit performance,on March 16, are very favorable, and that success appears assured, provided that everyone co-operates wholeheartedly.</p>
