   <p>Since milder weather has set in, demands by needy upon the German Society have been fewer than were made in March of 1918, and requests for workers have increased, so that one hundred and eighty-five men and twelve females (women and girls) could be given employment, the latter through Frauenhilfe (Ladies' Aid), Telephone Franklin 5169.</p>
   <p>The Society assisted fifty-two families, in which there were one hundred and seventy-eight children. Fifty-six individuals, among them twelve ladies, also received aid. Thirty-one beds and twenty-nine meals were provided for unemployed homeless persons. Through the mediation of the organization four persons received free medical treatment in private hospitals, three in the County Hospital, and two in Oak Forest, and eight persons received private medical aid and medicines.</p>
   <p>Very soon all war prisoners, excepting those who are detained by the Government <pb facs="5418474_9_0646.jpg" n="2"/>for deportation, will very likely be released from Camp Ogle-thorpe. The Government pays the cost of transporting the released directly to any point in the United States. Thereafter the released are dependent upon themselves.</p>
   <p>Smaller groups of interned have already been set at liberty. During the last few days seven of them came to Chicago, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation expects four more tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The great majority of these unfortunates are without any means whatsoever, and since the German Society can provide beds and meals only temporarily, it is essential to place these men or women in paying work immediately. If possible, they should be paid every day, or receive lodging and meals as part of their pay. Therefore the Society requests all those who are willing to give these severely stricken people work to call Main 4026. Contributions <pb facs="5418474_9_0647.jpg" n="3"/>in the form of money should be sent to the office of the Society at 160 North Wells Street.</p>
   <p>The Society spent $715.15 for charitable purposes during March.....</p>
