   <p>The monthly meeting of the Ladies' Society was held yesterday afternoon at the Lincoln Club, with President Klara Rehtmeyer in the chair. A large number of members was in attendance. A resolution was passed in memory of a deceased member, Mrs. Marie Kessler. The president stated that the law firm of Goldzier, Rogers, and Froelich donated one thousand dollars to the Home, and that the late Mr. Jacob Gross, who was a member of the Men's Society and president of the executive board of the Home for several years, bequeathed one thousand dollars to the institution.....</p>
   <p>After having disposed of the necessary business, the members enjoyed a musical recital. Mr. Arthur Kraft, who is well known as a tenor, rendered some well-accepted numbers. He has a very melodious, strong, and faultlessly trained voice and certainly deserved the applause which his audience accorded him. He is apparently on the threshold of a very promising career. After a concert tour of the East he will return to Chicago. Mrs. T. H. Northuft <pb facs="5418474_9_0393.jpg" n="2"/>furnished excellent piano accompaniment for Mr. Kraft.</p>
