   <p>It is desirable to a certain extent that all who migrate to the United States should become citizens and take an active part in the affairs of their chosen country.</p>
   <p>No one should condemn the efforts of civic organizations to Americanize immigrants and to establish schools in which our people can learn the language of our country, and many other useful things.</p>
   <p>Again, there can hardly be any serious objection to giving citizens preference when people are hired to work during these hard times, or to taking strict measures against persons who gained entrance into this country illegally or who advocate adoption of a form of government that is different from the one which has been established and is cherished by the citizens of this country.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1628.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, it not only creates dissatisfaction, but is also very dangerous to make continued attempts to make life miserable for noncitizens, to resort to chicanery.</p>
   <p>Apparently people have forgotten what happened here during the prosperous years that followed the war, and above all, during the good years that preceded the war. People were very, very liberal minded. That was the time to tighten the reins, but they were left loose. People had plenty of everything and had no objections if other participated in the good things. This laxity of yesteryears is now avenging itself, and the people who came here in good faith in the principles advocated by this country, to establish homes, must suffer for it.</p>
   <p>Anybody who said to a real-estate broker in 1926: "Friend, I am a foreigner and cannot hold property for more than six years unless I become a citizen before that period of time has elapsed," would have been laughed at. And it <pb facs="5418474_9_1629.jpg" n="3"/>is remarkable that foreigners were better informed about this law than citizens were. It would be interesting to hear what real-estate men of that time would have to say on the subject.</p>
   <p>It has been established by the Government and by other qualified authorities that it is quite difficult to become a citizen, and that many difficulties must be overcome. All this, however, seems to make no impression upon those people who think it is their duty to convert all men to their faith, and who are not very particular in the choice of the means which they use to attain their end.</p>
   <p>And now they have an old law that is little known among the masses, and they demand that the state's attorney tell them what he intends to do to enforce this law. If the states attorney takes no action, any citizen can go to court and demand that the property of any foreigner, who has held this property for more than six years, be sold. Thus, talebearing is encouraged, and disturbances and ill will toward our country are caused.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1630.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>And yet, the matter has a comical side also. The lawyers are just the ones who know that there are many laws that have been forgotten and about which not even lawyers are concerned today, as for instance, the law providing for redistricting the state for election purposes. Suddenly there is a demand that these laws be enforced. It is impossible to find a suitable, printable expression for this attitude.</p>
