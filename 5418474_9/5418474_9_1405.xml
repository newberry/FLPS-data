   <p>The English Press of our city trembles with indignation about the inadequancy of our police force whenever crimes are on the increase, or when eminent citizens or public institutions become the victims of crime.</p>
   <p>Our police is by no means what it should be according to any standard of efficiency and it always has been so. Even if its efficiency had reached its climax, there would be a limit to it. The police is the army which is hired to protect the citizens against another army - namely the criminal element. It is a sad fact that large cities have a special attraction for criminals, and usually their number increases much faster, relatively than the population. But our police force has not been increased correspondingly, and the percentage today is almost the same as years ago when the city had only 250,000 inhabitants. Then already the complaints about inadequate protection were many and vehement. Chicago has a police force of 1900 men, or one for every 660 people, but New York's ratio is one policemen to nearly 500 citizens. Besides this, New York's population of 1,600,000 live upon 39 square miles, while Chicago's 1,250,000 citizens are scattered over 181 square miles; New York's total mileage of streets is 360 all of which are paved, but Chicago's total mileage of streets is 2800, of which 2000 miles are not hard surface.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1406.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is therefore not strange that some districts are too large and that it is impossible to give adequate protection.</p>
   <p>We need more policemen. Instead of 1900 we should have 3000. But this is unpleasant news for the taxpayers. However, we can not change these matters. If we wish to enjoy the pleasure of being metropolitans, we must not complain about the expense.</p>
