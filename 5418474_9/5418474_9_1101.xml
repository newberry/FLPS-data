   <p>This society expended during the winter months immediately following the great fire the sum of $64,146.80. The annual report of the society estimates the number of Germans rendered homeless at 50,000. This figure, apparently out of proportion to the population of the city, and those who suffered by the conflagration is probably very nearly correct, since the larger part of out German population inhabited the North Side division, which contained two thirds of the actual sufferers.</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen are the officers of the society: Francis Lackner, President; U. Clausenius, Vice-President; Henry Greenebaum, Treasurer; C. Knobelsdorf, Secretary; Joseph Kaufman, Superintendent.</p>
   <p> The Society during the dark days immediately following the fire, did a noble work and relieved untold sufferning. The officers placed themselves in immediate correspondence with their friends in all parts of the United States and the fatherland, and the following figures show that their appeals were not in vain. The following sums were received as indicated: from Chicago, $3, 384; from other parts of the state, $251.45; from Missouri, $55; from New <pb facs="5418474_9_1102.jpg" n="2"/>York, $16,559.41; from Iowa, $145; from the District of Columbia, $41.50; from Ohio, $99.85; from Maryland, $552; from Indiana, $30; from Nebraska, $147.60; from Virginina, $44; from New Jersey, $1441.42; from Kansas, $64.25; from Pennsylvania, $234.15; from Delaware, $20; from Louisiana, $5.00; from Wisconsin, $3.00; from Mexico, $557; from Germany, $40,926.75; from France, $100. Besides the sums mentioned, Germany contributed $69,708.49 to the general relief fund.</p>
   <p>The following is the summary of the work one and the relief afforded during the year. Work secured for 282 persons; application for direct money aid, 8,063; permits issued for building material, furniture, etc., so general distributing depets, 15,000; sewing machines and larger sums were distributed through the special committee of the aid society to 1,200; 3,691 persons received cash assistance to the amount of $44,95.21; 1,097 persons received clothing to the value of $7,688; 853 persons received tools to the value of to the value of $3,471; 13 received traveling tickets to the value of $429; 70 received fuel to the value of $716; 7 received the amounts of rent due, $180; 16 received general articles to the value of $54.</p>
   <p>The following sums were expended: medicine, $334; stoves, $60; furniture, <pb facs="5418474_9_1103.jpg" n="3"/>$31; burial costs, $24; taxes and freight, $72; salaries, $3,819; rent, $328; printing and advertising, $522; bureau material, $32. Further, 19 persons received tools that had been donated to the value of $200; 21 persons received donated furniture to the value of $150; eight received donated meat to the value of $4.00; 300 received donated clothing to the value of $3,000.</p>
   <p>The German society organized to aid immigrants from the fatherland on the inhospitable shores of a strange land, also gave its mite toward alleviating the sufferings of the unfortunate. Their expenditures amounted to about $600, which sum was very judiciously expended, and probably did as much real good as any similar amount paid out during the city's due necessity. The quarters of the society, at present in the Globe Theater Building, will move to the Metropolitan Block in a few weeks. George Schneider acts as president and H. Enders as executive manager.</p>
