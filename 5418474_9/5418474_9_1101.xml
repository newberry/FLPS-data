   <p>The German society organized to aid immigrants from the fatherland on the inhospitable shores of a strange land, also gave its mite toward alleviating the sufferings of the unfortunate. Their expenditures amounted to about $600, which sum was very judiciously expended, and probably did as much real good as any similar amount paid out during the city's due necessity. The quarters of the society, at present in the Globe Theater Building, will move to the Metropolitan Block in a few weeks. George Schneider acts as president and H. Enders as executive manager.</p>
