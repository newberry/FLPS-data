   <p>p. 6. The regular monthly session of the German Society's Directorate took place yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock at the office, No. 49 La Salle St. Mr. Max Eberhardt, the president of the Association, presided. Seven gentlemen were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kuehne's report about last month's activities stated: "As we expected, the demands upon the Association's treasury, were much greater than in former years. The increase of unemployed continues, likewise there are many immigrants from Germany who remained in the East for only a short time, and others who came here by way of Montreal, Canada.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0840.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Every day people request free transportation back to the country of their origin and this includes people who have been here for quite some time.</p>
   <p>"Assistance was given to 54 families with 45 children and 26 single persons. Help was extended for the first time to 23 families with 59 children and 21 single persons. In spite of previous help 31 families with 86 children and 5 unattached individuals found it necessary to appeal again to the society.</p>
   <p>"The causes for this distress are: In 7 cases death of the bread-winner of the family; in 7 families sickness of the father; in 3 cases mother and children were ill; 8 families were deserted; 24 suffered want through unemployment, and 5 families were of advanced age.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0841.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"The destitution of the single persons was due to sickness and lack of employment; distress was caused by sickness in 5 cases, and by unemployment in 20 cases.</p>
   <p>"We have spent $304.25 in cash and $6.12 for room and board, a total of $310.37.</p>
   <p>"Employment, mostly farm labor, was found for 121 persons whereby we saved them $242 in agency fees.</p>
   <p>"It is regrettable that we have to record many occasions where people refuse to accept work for irrelevant reasons or, give up their job soon after having obtained it..</p>
   <p>"We received and mailed 137 letters and post-cards.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0842.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Mr. M. J. Bransfield and the Prussing Vinegar Co., have been accepted as members, contributing a total yearly amount of $10."</p>
