   <p>The Board of Directors of the German Society held their monthly business meeting yesterday. We take the following quotations from the report of the business manager:</p>
   <p>Spent for charity $314.15. This amount was distributed among 85 families with a total of 119 children, and 48 single persons besides. It helped to procure board, lodging, and shoes. $213.00 was received in membership fees. Mr. Madlener gave $1000.00 in memory of his deceased father. Employment was assigned to 327 persons.</p>
   <p>During the past six months the Society spent $2098.98 in helping to support needy families and single persons. A total of $2278.00 was received in fees. The Society appeals to all Germans to support their worthy undertaking.</p>
