   <p>Already over three years ago, immediately after relief funds had been established on neutral American soil to help German war widows and starving orphans, warning voices could be heard that claimed that a great percentage of the amount which warmhearted Americans, not exclusively of German origin, had contributed most generously had found its way into the German propaganda coffers.</p>
   <p>The warnings were, at that time, laughed at. His Excellency Count Bernstorff [then German ambassador to the United States] and His Excellency Doctor Dumba were addressing many letters at that time to the "dear German-Americans," assuring them that the money was sent over there and used exclusively to alleviate the plight of the widows and orphans.</p>
   <p>The latest reports of Attorney General Becker of the State of New York prove conclusively that Count Bernstorff had used these funds, contributed <pb facs="5418474_9_0658.jpg" n="2"/>in large part by people of moderate circumstances, for the infamous and totally useless propaganda which has brought so much grief to our country and especially to Americans of German descent. The bazaars, the funds of the Red Cross and the Iron Cross were merely a "camouflage" for those gentlemen, who cared damned little for suffering widows and German babies, but a whole lot for bombing ships carrying cargo. Their own assistants admitted that much during the trials.</p>
   <p>The indictment against the representatives of the Imperial Government cannot be removed or alleviated, if the treasurers of those bazaars now solemnly declare that the moneys collected had been duly transferred to the Ambassadors of the Central Powers. These fellows have never been accused, certainly it was not charged that they themselves had distributed the money to the propaganda agencies. They were probably the innocent victims of conniving schemers. It does not make much difference either that the Emperor and the mighty gentlemen in Berlin and Vienna had been informed how generously and liberally the "German-Americans" had helped with their money. The indictment is made against those who <pb facs="5418474_9_0659.jpg" n="3"/>were not ashamed to use the dollars partly given by poor people for the miserable job of dynamitings and espionage on neutral soil. It is to be hoped that these revelations will definitely prove to Americans of German blood, that they and their sentiments for the country of their birth have been exploited in the most shameful manner. Whoever is still in favor of this strange "system of bookkeeping" which Count Bernstorff and his associates have introduced does not promote the cause of the pro-Germans, but helps to deceive those Americans of German origin, who for too long have been fooled, due to their love for their blood relatives across the ocean. A government that condones the methods of Bernstorff and his agents does not deserve the slightest assistance, which these men of German blood once were willing to give, because they did not know that behind the appeal to their hearts there lurked the treacherous motives of unscrupulous propagandists.</p>
