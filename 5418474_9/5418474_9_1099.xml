   <p>The members of the "German Society" held a meeting yesterday afternoon in the office of the Society, at the corner of La Salle and Randolph Streets. of the speech of President George Schneider we reproduce the following lines; "The German Society is the only German non-denominational relief society in Chicago and for that reason deserves the warmest support of every German.</p>
   <p>Aside from the duties of my position as President I also have worked in the interest of immigration. It is well known to you that two years ago a convention took place at Indianapolis, which had as its aim the raising of the immigration question to a national question, to request the national law making body to make of immigrants wards of the Republic who have the intention of becoming citizens and to order the steamship companies to treat them decently. The convention appointed a committee of which I have the honor to be the President, and intrusted us to work for the speedy passage of such laws.</p>
   <p>In consequence of conferences, Congressman Fred Myers has introduced a bill to that effect. Of course congress proceeds slowly and it will take some time before the results will be made known."</p>
