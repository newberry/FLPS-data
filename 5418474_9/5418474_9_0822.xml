   <p>The preparations for the fourth German-American Benefit Ball are progressing nicely under the leadership of its committees. Although the above Association has only been in existence for three years, it nevertheless succeeded during that time, in distributing $27,000.00 for the aid of Chicago Benevolent Institutions. Last winter, when the Mayor issued a proclamation for the amelioration of suffering, the Association was among the first to respond to the call and two days after the request it has $1500.00 available which it distributed as follows: United Bureau of Charities, $500.00; Chicago Relief and Aid Society, $500.00; German Relief and Aid Society $500.00; The net proceeds of the Benefit Ball, which was given on the 21st of January, 1897, were $10,450.00.</p>
   <p>After deducting the above amount, a balance of $8950.00 remained, which was allotted to "The German Old Age Home, Alexian Hospital, German Hospital, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Michael Reese Hospital, Lying In Dispensary, Bureau of Justice, Association "Recreation" (German) Home for Destitute and Crippled Children, Uhlich's Orphanage." <pb facs="5418474_9_0823.jpg" n="2"/>The Association decided to distribute souvenirs again, to all who will visit their Ball.</p>
