   <p>The German Women's Club will distribute Christmas presents among poor children on Tuesday, Dec. 28, at Klare's Hall on North Clark Street. The children will be treated to music, coffee, and cakes.</p>
   <p>Spectators will be served for 25 cents. Visitors are asked to bring along different kinds of foods to replenish the insufficient supplies of the Women's Club.</p>
   <p>We have repeatedly written against publicity-making charities--in which the principal object is ostentation--but, to our regret, without success. The treat and the gifts really do not come from the German Women's Club, <pb facs="5418474_9_0968.jpg" n="2"/>which only takes the credit at the expense of others. Rather than digging into their own purses, these rich ladies prefer to ask the Press for support. Clothes dealers, toy and book shops are pressed till the necessary supply of second-hand merchandise is together. If this is still insufficient, a few musicians and artists are chosen, who will be flattered and persuaded to give their services free for the good work. A feeding en masse will put up a scene the effects of which very seldom fail to appear. The spectators will have to pay an entrance fee and the German Women's Club will get the laurels. With the satisfaction of having taken a share of the children's tears of gratitude, the lady of the Club goes to bed, pleased that her own purse is still intact and that she acted according to the word of God. The left hand does not know what the right one is doing.</p>
