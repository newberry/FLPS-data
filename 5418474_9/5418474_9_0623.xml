   <p>(A short time ago, the Abendpost was requested to devote its columns to the German-American Aid, and to support the organization as much as possible. The answer was: Gladly, under the condition that you explain the object and the program of the organization. For you demand the confidence of the public, and you will obtain the full measure of their confidence only if the people are convinced that your cause is a worthy one, that your organization is reliable, and that the needy persons in whose benefit your efforts are made will receive all gifts which may be contributed. These conditions were met by Dr. J. H. Brune, acting secretary of the German-American Aid. About a week ago we received a letter from him which we did not immediately publish because we thought it expedient to furnish, along with his missive, a complete list of contributions which he had received. Several days were required to compile this list, and we received it today.)</p>
   <p>Object and Program of the German-American Aid</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0624.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To the Editor of the Abendpost, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: Mr. C. Hildebrandt, a member of the executive board of our Aid Society visited you and reported that you will be glad to use your publications, the Abendpost and the Sonntagpost, in the service of that good cause--German-American Aid,--thus rendering valuable assistance in making our charitable endeavors successful; but that you ask for some sort of credentials--that is, you want to know about our aims, our finances, our program, and our ultimate method of distributing gifts.</p>
   <p>On August 15, the German-American Aid, by unanimous resolution, commissioned me to send you the desired information.</p>
   <p>The object of the German-American Aid is to collect money for the needy people in Germany. Our members are Americans of German descent and they are unselfishly devoting their time and money to lighten the burden of the unfortunates in the "old country". They expect and ask no remuneration whatsoever.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0625.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>When we organized, several plans to render immediate help were submitted to us, as, for instance, to charter cargo space in ships and fill this space with food to be sent abroad. But money, as well as the necessary transportation facilities, was lacking. Later, we decided to buy meat and lard which local packers held in storage in Rotterdam and Antwerp, and ship these commodities to Germany via insured railroad freight. Meanwhile the packers informed us that they could make no more shipments from storage houses in Rotterdam and Antwerp. This information was verified by the well-substantiated news that the German Government had purchased all meat and lard supplies on credit contract, and had immediately shipped them to Germany.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, we wrote to the Ministry of Food in Berlin, and requested that office to inform us what goods were most needed and to what address they could be sent. We have not yet had an answer to our letter.</p>
   <p>Hence we decided to deposit all money contributed to the cause, and to defer any large disbursement until the respective commissions arrive from Germany and Austria.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0626.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We have information that members of these commissions will be here soon and will take over the work of buying goods, so we resolved to assist them in every possible way, and to place the money which we receive at their disposal, since they undoubtedly know best what to buy, how much, and where to send purchases.</p>
   <p>Hence our chief object is to gather funds.</p>
   <p>If, in the meantime, official appeals come from Germany or Austria for articles which are immediately necessary, such as powdered milk, etc., we shall, of course, heed the request by making a shipment of the required goods.</p>
   <p>We now have a balance of $3,092.42 in our treasury. We organized only a short time ago; our contributions come from the common people, and, though the cause is a good one, the individual amounts given are small. However, with the help of the German press and the willing efforts of the members of the German-American Aid, our balance will undoubtedly increase greatly.</p>
   <p>As soon as our organization is completed, the machine well oiled and working well, we shall bend our efforts to securing contributions from the wealthier classes <pb facs="5418474_9_0627.jpg" n="5"/>also. We shall also try to obtain well-known persons for work on the various committees. So far the elite have evinced no interest in the cause--very likely because they deem it expedient to be cautious for the time being, so as not to run into any difficulties with the authorities enforcing the espionage laws, which are still in effect.</p>
   <p>Be that as it may, we are going forward.</p>
   <p>We have divided the city of Chicago into five zones and placed an organizer in each zone. It is his duty to solicit contributions, keep records of them, arrange mass meetings, and address the gatherings, endeavoring to induce all who show any sympathy or interest to join in the cause. These organizers report regularly in committee meetings, exchange experiences, and request advice to aid them in efficient performance of their duty. For the present the state of Illinois and adjoining states are being worked by a committee of businessmen. We have an information bureau where the general public can obtain advice and directtions on packing and shipping procedure. We also try to put senders in touch with merchants who sell "the best for the least," so that the buyer receives as <pb facs="5418474_9_0628.jpg" n="6"/>much as possible for his money. We shall also establish places where all kinds of clothing may be deposited. These depots will be under the supervision of committees consisting of ladies who will be assisted by men in sorting, packing, and shipping.</p>
   <p>I wish to add that, beginning in the first week of September, we shall hold mass meetings in which able speakers will explain the aims of, and the need for, this movement. Our committee on halls has already viewed quite a number of auditoriums, and has rented several of them for future use. Various choral societies in different parts of the city have promised their co-operation.</p>
   <p>So you see, Mr. Mueller, a sound foundation has been laid, and it is up to the press to aid in the movement, without respect to political, personal, or religious convictions.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>German-American Aid,</p>
   <p>Doctor J. H. Brune, Secretary pro tempore.</p>

   <p>For Germany's Infants</p>
   <p>In accordance with the principle, "a dollar today is worth ten tomorrow," our <pb facs="5418474_9_0630.jpg" n="8"/>board of managers, which met yesterday, decided to ship a quantity of first-class, pulverized milk to Germany. Every week one hundred packages of this milk, enough to feed twenty-five hundred infants for a week, will be sent to the Ministry of Food at Berlin, and later a like amount will be forwarded to the authorities at Vienna. As soon as contributions increase, the quantity of milk will be increased. The board of managers hopes to be able to send one thousand packages weekly, instead of only one hundred.</p>
   <p>Purchase of Milk Cows</p>
   <p>It is known generally that a number of prominent Americans of German parentage have organized for the purpose of buying milk cows for Germany, to compensate for the loss of cows sustained through the inhuman Treaty of Versailles. Naturally it will require quite a bit of time to carry out this proposal. So, since there is urgent and widespread need, and the least hesitation may cost precious young German lives, it is necessary to supply good milk immediately.</p>
   <p>As soon as the most urgent need is adequately met, we will proceed to furnish <pb facs="5418474_9_0631.jpg" n="9"/>sufficient fats for the hungry. The idea is to render assistance in time to prevent many deaths from the "English sickness".</p>
   <p>The following ladies were active in behalf of this cause at the picnic given by the Swabian Society: Mrs. J. H. Brune, Mrs. Elly Wettmann, Mrs. Emilie Kunz, Mrs. Jette Steger, Mrs. George Feht, Mrs. Anna Weissmantel, Mrs. Carl Paddock.</p>
   <p>The amount of $41.42 was realized through the sale of flowers donated by Peter Reinberg, and $354.50 was obtained through the sale of buttons, and the payment of dues.</p>
   <p>This evening a mass meeting will be held in Laschober's Hall, 52nd Street and Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow evening, at 8 o'clock there will be a massmeeting in Ottawa, Illinois.</p>
   <p>On Monday, September 1, a picnic will be held at Starved Rock, to organize the cities of Utica, LaSalle, and Peru.</p>
