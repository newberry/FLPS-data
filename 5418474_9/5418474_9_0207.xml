   <p>The Board of Directors of the "German" Hospital accepted in their last conference a report for the first nine months of the year.</p>
   <p>During this period 572 patients have been taken care of. One third of these patients paid the full rate; one third paid 50% of the rate, and the remainder were taken care of free of charge.</p>
   <p>One thing is certain, namely that the hospital is too small to meet the demand made upon it. It must be enlarged. We have the ground but the money is lacking. The Board of Directors will be compelled to appeal to the public for the support of this worthy undertaking. The preliminary steps for the collection of these funds have been already completed. Mr. E. Kuegemann has been engaged as collector by the hospital. He will visit all those people, who are being considered as willing to contribute to this cause.</p>
