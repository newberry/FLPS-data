   <p>The yearly picnic for Uhlich's Orphanage will be given today at Ogden's Grove. The festival is different from former picnics of its kind because no appeal to a definite contingent in our community is made; instead of invoking the aid of this or that club, involving people from certain districts of Germany, such as Baveria, Nassau....etc., the festival committee now asks all our local Germans to participate. The annual picnic given by Uhlich's Orphanage long ago took on a much broader aspect; it became a German picnic, and all Germans went to the affair if it was possible. This is entirely due to the fact that the public in general has become fully aware of the institution's humanitarian efforts and knows that the children are well taken care of, that everything is done to provide an adequate substitute for the parental home, that the youngsters are not compelled to exist in dungeonlike surroundings but live and enjoy themselves like children not bereft of parents, that good schooling is provided, and that although their education is based on Christian principles, no bigotry <pb facs="5418474_9_0339.jpg" n="2"/>is resorted to. Besides, the public knows that the administration is capable and economical in its management and is therefore able to care for a large number of children.</p>
   <p>This year the institution needs more money than formerly. With an increase in population there is also a correspondingly larger number of orphans. The place is beginning to be crowded, and an annex is urgently needed. For this reason the appeal has been general. Participation in the picnic helps to increase the funds of the institution. We feel that no one will ignore the appeal unless prevented by illness[from attending]. Ogden's Grove can be reached equally well by the Webster Avenue line or the Clybourn Avenue line.</p>
