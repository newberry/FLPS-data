   <p>The executive board of the German Society held its regular meeting yesterday, President Georg Schneider acted as chairman. Several business matters of minor importance were attended to, and the agent of the Society read his monthly report, after which the meeting adjourned.</p>
   <p>After that, the central committee, which is in charge of plans for the summer festival, met, and Mrs. Werkmeister addressed the assembly in the absense of the president and vice-president.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mettich, in presenting the report of the planning committee, said that an agreement had been made with Mr. Winter regarding the use of his park, and that Mr. Winter had made every possible concession. Mr. Schwengel was requested to take charge of the sale of beer, and everything connected <pb facs="5418474_9_1008.jpg" n="2"/>therewith. Mrs. Molter, speaking for the ladies' committee, said that beer and meat have been ordered, and that other items will also be ordered promptly. Mr. Schwengel was authorized to purchase whatever may be needed.</p>
   <p>It was decided to engage the Chicago Orchestra for the festival.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koechster was requested to contact the Germania Male Chorus, and ask that they provide two quartets for the festival, and Georg Schneider was asked to call on the Schweitzer Maennerchor (Swiss Male Chorus) for eight singers.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned until Tuesday afternoon, at five o'clock, and all committees were asked to be present at that time.</p>
   <p>The report of the agent of the German Society for the month of June contains the following items:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1009.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Figures showed little difference during the months of May and June. In May, there were 3600 arrivals, and in June 3400 arrivals, and in June 3400 people arrived.</p>
   <p>The nationalities were as follows: Citizens of the German empire: 500; of these, 300 were from the northern part of Germany, and 200 from the southern part of Germany; all continued on their journey to other parts of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, and California. Bohemians: 200, to Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska. Portuguese: 60, all to California. Poles: 75, all of whom reminded in Chicago. Swiss and Italians: 50 each, going to Iowa and California. Dutch: 25, all to Iowa. Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, and Belgians: 2000; a part remained in Illinois, and the remainder went to Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska. English, Scotch, and Irish: About 200; most of them went to California, Nebraska, or Kansas. Russians: 350 to 400, about 50 families, mostly Mennonites, possessing an aggregate capital of $125,000 to $150,000 in cash. They went to York county, <pb facs="5418474_9_1010.jpg" n="4"/>Nebraska, with the exception of fifty who chose Minnesota, and twenty-five, Dakota. The first contingent, those who intend staying in York county, Nebraska, were given free transportation from Chicago by the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad.</p>
   <p>Requests for aid: 176; forty-five were given cash; forty-one free or partial travelling fare; three, fuel; thirty-three, board and lodging; three, medical aid; two, hospital care; and six, medicine.</p>
   <p>Total expenditures (in cash) for aid during May amounted to $471.69.</p>
   <p>Farm labor is still very much in demand; also single women.</p>
   <p>During May, sixty-six employers applied at our employment office, and we succeeded in finding jobs for 176 persons out of 308 who looked for work. Advice and help were given to 176.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1011.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Altogether, 663 persons called at our office; 483 men and 180 women.</p>
   <p>We received 62 letters, and mailed 1495 letters.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Charles Endres,</p>
   <p>Agent.</p>
