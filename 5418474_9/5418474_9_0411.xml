   <p>The members of the Ladies' Club of the German Home for the Aged, attended in large numbers, yesterday afternoon. Mrs. Klara Rehtmeyer, the president, called the meeting to order. The association feels deeply bereaved because of the death of the following members: Mrs. Hedwig Weber, Mrs. Dorothea Moe, and Mrs. Katharine Deppe, and passed resolutions accordingly. A large festival, in commemoration of the founding of the institute, is contemplated by the Ladies' Club. It is to be given at the Germania Club House, on March 7, and extensive preparations will be made. The president informed the assembly that $2,091.35 has been bequeathed to the Ladies' Club by Mrs. Luise Hadelman, also $192.73, a legacy of Mr. Hermann Klanowski, and $150, through the last will of Nicolas Mass.</p>
   <p>A highly pleasing program was again provided by Mrs. O. Frankenhuis, <pb facs="5418474_9_0412.jpg" n="2"/>chairman of the Entertainment Committee. Among the various offerings the chairman herself excelled in her well-conceived and expertly prepared lecture on Germany and America.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Meyenschein Deubert gave vocal selections, with the piano accompaniment by Miss Alpers, and Mrs. A. Schirmer recited several delightful poems, on the timely topics of this era. Excellent offerings, all!</p>
