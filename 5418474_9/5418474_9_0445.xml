  <body>
   <p>I wish to inform the German people about conditions in the Cook County poorhouse, and how the Germans are treated in comparison with the Americans and Irish. Through misfortune I was forced to come here and was willing as much as my swollen feet permitted, to work. Still, I was obliged to shovel snow barefoot in the most bitter cold, because my shoes were too small. I begged the Superintendent for a pair of stockings but I could not get any. There are many old and young healthy people in the poorhouse, who have not been yet eight days in the county before being received here - American Irish and English - who are furnished pants, shoes and stockings, and yet are not allowed to work, while there are here also from sixty to seventy-year-old Germans, who, unable to speak English, receive nothing.</p>
   <p>The room and the work bosses are all Irish and the Germans have to work under their direction. Any sensible German here could give more information if he were asked. There are not only patient Swabians but also patient Germans, and <pb facs="5418474_9_0446.jpg" n="2"/>they are oppressed not only by the temperance law but by the Americans.</p>
   <p>(An answer from the officials of the poorhouse will be published in our columns. Editor.)</p>
