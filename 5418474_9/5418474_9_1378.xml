   <p>At the request of United States Attorney General Homer Cummings no fewer than six new bills have been put before Congress; the purpose of these bills is to render the existing laws against various kinds of crime more severe, to facilitate the legal prosecution of criminals, to render the defense of criminals more difficult, and to close certain loopholes that enable clever criminal lawyers to obtain immunity from punishment for some of their clients.</p>
   <p>The new laws proposed by the Attorney General provide that the manufacturers, vendors, and importers of weapons must submit to the customs authorities in their districts exact lists of the deadly weapons and other implements and means of killing which the criminal world uses to carry on its illegal activity, and must pay a special duty on such goods.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1379.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Another provision imposes a penitentiary sentence of ten to twenty years and a fine of $5,000 to $10,000 for harboring any design upon money or securities that are kept for safety in any national or Federal Reserve bank.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cummings also recommends that the husband or the wife of a criminal shall be permitted to testify against him or her, and that such testimony shall be just as valid as that of other witnesses.</p>
   <p>[Under these laws] the favorite alibi-proofs which are so frequently employed to ensure the acquittal of a defendant charged with a crime would be admitted as evidence only when they had been submitted to the office of the Attorney General in time to have them investigated in detail as to their veracity.</p>
   <p>And finally, the Attorney General considers an amendment to the Dyer Act to be desirable. He recommends that the Federal Government prosecute not only those who transport stolen automobiles but also those who carry any other stolen articles from one State to another.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1380.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Cummings states that the bills should be passed because they will make it easier for Government authorities to fight crime.</p>
   <p>Although his intentions may be good, we cannot see why so many new laws are necessary in the war on criminals. The existing laws are entirely adequate if the States will make unreserved use of them. Our country needs no additional laws. What it does need is strict enforcement of the present laws.</p>
   <p>Adoption of the new Federal laws by Congress will reflect adversely upon our State courts. Perhaps they deserve it. However, the Federal Government as well as the States must understand that the proposed legislation is another step toward depriving the States of their rights.</p>
