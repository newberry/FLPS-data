   <p>Mr. Murphy, one of the American agents in Russia, will soon issue an appeal to German-Americans, to aid German colonists who are starving in Russia. He says that there are in the distressed provinces 300,000 German colonists, 220,000 of whom are Lutherans and 80,000 Catholics, who are in distress, who appeal to their kinsmen in the United States for aid. The crops have failed for several years and there was not a drop of rain for ninety-two days in 1891. The colonists have been decimated by spotted typhus fever. The government has done all in its power to relieve the sufferers and has expended over two million rubles ($110,000,000). Aid must be speedy in order to be effective.</p>
   <p>If the German American citizens will send a shipload of unground Indian corn, the peasants will be enabled to grind part of it in their own windmills and to sow the remainder. Mr. Charles Emory Smith, the United States Minister here, will see that it is properly distributed among the German colonists, who have been instructed how to cook it.</p>
