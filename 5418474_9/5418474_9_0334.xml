<title level="a">THE ORPHANAGE FESTIVAL</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The orphanage festival given by the board of the institution at Ogden's Grove yesterday was a great success and exceeded even the expectations of the most optimistically inclined.</p>
   <p>The children to whom Uhlich's Orphanage means "home" rose at an early hour. They were eager to enjoy the day and could hardly restrain themselves. Finally, at nine o'clock, after being nicely dressed, combed, and fixed up, they set out led by Superintendent Blankenhahn and several other persons and proceeded to Center Street, where they boarded an open car which the North Side Street Car Company had provided gratuitously for the occasion. After arriving at the corner of Clark and Ohio Streets the children marched to St. Paul's Church and shortly afterwards formed in line again. Led by the Germania Band, they returned to Clark Street and proceeded to the car barns south of Division Street, where two Clybourn Avenue cars, reserved for them, brought the beaming children, the orphanage officials, and the brass band to the picnic grounds.</p>

   <p>At Ogden's Grove the children amused themselves hugely, but the festival did not come into full swing until late in the afternoon. By three o'clock there were already several thousand people present, mostly women and children, and towards evening the place was densely crowded; it was a joy to behold what an interest our Germans showed in the orphans.</p>
   <p>A signal was given at three o'clock, whereupon the children came to the band stand and fell in line; led by Mr. Blankenhahn, they proceeded to the restaurant while the band played a lively march. Mrs. Lange, wife of the bakery owner, treated the happy throng to ice cream and cake.</p>
   <p>Other food was generously provided for the youngsters by the members of the Ladies' Club. Mrs. Brauckmann gave meat, Mrs. Niemeier, president of the club, potatoes, etc.; and others donated various items. In short, the little ones could eat to their hearts' content. Pastor Kling of Salem Church and Pastor Klein of Zion Church came at an early hour and met many of their church members. Pastor Hartmann of St. Paul's came towards evening and soon afterwards <pb facs="5418474_9_0336.jpg" n="3"/>mounted the band stand and addressed the crowd in a short speech. He expressed his regrets that the Reverend Mr. Lambrecht because of overwork could not deliver the festival speech, and he then accorded a fitting tribute to President Garfield, confined to his bed, wounded by an assassin's bullet. Then the speaker expressed his appreciation of the beneficent work performed by the association which maintains the orphanage and gave thanks, in the name of the board, to all who had come to attend the festival as well as to the Germans in general for the liberal support given to the institution at all times and particularly when its finances were near the vanishing point. The speaker received loud applause.</p>
   <p>In the evening, after the day's work was done, men also came to the park in large numbers. Beautiful illumination increased the attractiveness of the festival, which was not marred by any untoward event; joviality prevailed until midnight.</p>
   <p>In this connection we must mention that Mr. Blankenhahn, whose work as <pb facs="5418474_9_0337.jpg" n="4"/>superintendent has been greatly appreciated by all, tendered his resignation three months ago, and that it was reluctantly accepted. His successor, the Reverend Mr. Mauermann, former pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation of Homewood, Illinois, will take charge on the first of September. He is regarded as a very capable pedagogue.</p>
