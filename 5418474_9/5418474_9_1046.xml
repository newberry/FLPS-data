   <p>As a result of the intense cold prevailing during the past month, demands upon the [German] Society were greater than in December, as the appended figures will show, and this brought about a difficult situation, since our funds were almost entirely depleted. We provided assistance only in the most urgent cases, after extensive investigation proved that dire want prevailed.</p>
   <p>The C. R. and A. Society [Chicago Relief and Aid Society (?)] at present gives aid only to needy people who suffered losses in the Chicago conflagration, and very rarely are other persons considered. This, in turn, increased applications for help at our office. Aside from this, the county administration decided that it could give help only to persons who had been residents in the county for a year, and this leaves to the German Society all persons who have not lived here for the required length of time.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable if the attention of our more prosperous Germans could be <pb facs="5418474_9_1047.jpg" n="2"/>aroused to the fact that without adequate interest and help on their part, the German Society will not be in a position to continue indefinitely to fulfill its task in a proper manner. If in some cases, the desired help to the impoverished was not forthcoming, it must be remembered that it is not the fault of the German Society which, after all, is limited by the money at its disposal--money which does not increase of its own accord, and which must be replenished by our German countrymen who are imbued with a sense of responsibility to the community and who have a philanthropic attitude, so that the German Society may function in every case that comes within its jurisdiction.</p>
   <p>Because of the Society's lack of funds and the justified expectation that immigration will increase considerably this year, it is desired that our local Germans take a more active interest in our Society, since this would enable us properly to fulfill the demands which will be made of us within the next few months.</p>
   <p>Statistics about our activity during the two months, January and December, are <pb facs="5418474_9_1048.jpg" n="3"/>given here. The number of calls registered at our office in January were 792; in December, 726; showing an increase of 66 for January. In January 498 men registered, and in December; 491, an increase of 7 for January. Women who sought aid at our office numbered 294 in January, 235 in December; an increase of 59 for January.</p>
   <p>In January there were 18 employers, in December, 34; a decrease of 16.</p>
   <p>In January 223 persons asked for employment, in December 243; a decrease of 20 for January. We secured jobs for 90 persons in January, and for 76 in December.</p>
   <p>In January an increase of 31 was noted among persons asking for advice and assistance in various matters; in January there were 269 and in December 238 cases in this classification.</p>
   <p>A complaint about lost baggage was presented last month, which was settled to the satisfaction of the persons concerned.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_1049.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The following number of people asked for aid: In January, 296 persons; in December 281; an increase of 15 for January. Among these there were 3 in January and 2 in December who sought hospital admittance. Medical aid was requested by 3 in January and likewise by 3 in December. Here we would like to repeat that the German Society can provide free medical treatment and medicine to destitute sick persons through the courtesy of a number of our most prominent physicians and druggists. Free medicine was asked for and received by 5 persons in January and by 4 in December.</p>
   <p>In January we received requests from 10 persons for free railroad fare; in December, 8 asked for such assistance. In January 31 persons asked us to pay part of their railroad fare; in December, 22.</p>
   <p>The German Society gave coal to 22 poor families in January and to 15 in December; the expense was defrayed by our Society.</p>
   <p>Lodging and board was given to 59 immigrants and homeless persons in January; <pb facs="5418474_9_1050.jpg" n="5"/>in December, 38.</p>
   <p>Our total expenditures in December were $240.10; in January, $354.47; an increase of $114.37 in the latter month.</p>
