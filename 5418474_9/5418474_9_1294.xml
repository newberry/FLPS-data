   <p>It is a sad fate to which the 74-year-old Charles Gersch yesterday afternoon gave expression in a complaint to the county court. Up until a few years ago, Gersch was the owner of a comfortable home, proprietor of a sung bank account and--last but not least--a bachelor.</p>
   <p>But today Gersch is sick, with no friends, no money, and--married. His 68-year-old wife Elizabeth is blamed for his present fate. Without telling him anything, he explained in his suit, she sold his home for $23,000, let him hand her $4,000 in stocks and bonds for "safe keeping," and suddenly disappeared, taking all that money with her--and was never seen again. She is supposed to be in Los Angeles or elsewhere on the Pacific coast.</p>
   <p>In his complaint, Gersch is not asking for a divorce, but he wants his share of <pb facs="5418474_9_1295.jpg" n="2"/>the money realized from the sale of the two-story house at 5843 Midway, from which he was driven after his wife sold it to strangers behind his back.</p>
