   <p>The Chicago officials of the Turn District held a consultation at their last session in regard to the proposed of the "Lincoln Turn Club," that a memorial be dedicated to the great founder of this movement. The original plan was to provide a statue; this has been abandoned, and now a substitute has been suggested, a "Father Jahn" orphanage. In this institution, all orphans of Turners shall find a haven of refuge. Turner Lorenz, a committee member of the Aurora Turn Club cited a number of reasons for such an undertaking. There statements were then ordered to be printed and mailed to the separate clubs.</p>
   <p>A Father Jahn memorial, an orphanage, which shall be a "protection from sterms of existence for the dependants of Chicago Turners." Orphanages of such a pattern were founded in Germany, during and after the "Thirty Year War." The Holland methods and arrangements served as models. The terrible losses among the adult members of the population necessitated such provisions. (Compare Hansen's History of Germany, During and After the "Thirty Year War.")</p>
   <p>These homes also served as schools in order to promote the religious beliefs of the children; to maintain the sacred principles which were inculcated by <pb facs="5418474_9_0326.jpg" n="2"/>their parents; and to promote a united front against "popery," which means to beer arms later, so that the annihilation of the "Thirty Year War," to which this debacle degenerated finally, should not result in a weak progeny; since hunger, pestilence, and other causes, which are a by-product of recurrent destruction, tend to create a resistless, listless race. The acceptance of these principles did much to ameliorate future conditions. The German public school which is a partial result of this procedure, is a glowing testimonial to its efficacy.</p>
   <p>We are confronted with a similar case today. The children of free-thinking, or let us say, non-religious parents, are in the same position as those of the former sordid period. In this wrangling which we can readily perceive, we note a new from, but fundamentally it is the same. These children of poor, and let us assume, free-thinking Turners, fall into the hands of their adversaries. The from compulsion caused by the fight for existence precludes any other course, and to heap further disgrace and contumely upon the friends and followers of their parents belief, these children are systematically estranged and may later even oppose them as they would soldiers, and hangmen. The mind of these youths is poisoned against their progenitors, and, if possible they are converted until they emerge as enemies. Who then, shall prevent this? Obviously, their contemporaries and the Turners. It is evidentally their <pb facs="5418474_9_0327.jpg" n="3"/>duty, at least within their small circle of activity, Chicago, to preclude and avoid the reproach, that we have not tried to the utmost human ability. That the state and the community or other public administration should take cognizance of this is wrong, since practice has shown how persistently the various sects endeavor to recruit this supply of parentless children.</p>
   <p>When the writer once made a similar suggestion he was told in a sneering manner, that the Catholies have their own orphanages, so have the Methedists, the Presbyterians, etc., that no more are needed and our children would be properly raised in the only salvation assuring religion. From another standpoint, it is very important, that the ever growing progressive army of the Chicago Turn District preserve its ...progressive spirit ...and its true, sublime principles....</p>
   <p>It is therefore advisable that we sanction and accept the same methods that others use daily in the service of their deities. Hundreds of churches, hospitals, and orphanages of all denominations, are being built from the money contributed by unknowing, and poor people. We stand hare, inactive, and indifferent to the future.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0328.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In consideration of the aforesaid, 5,000 men should be able to provide an asylum for their descendants, as a contingency against misfortune. A quiet home, far away from the bustle of the world, to educate the new generation before they face the fight for independent survival, and if possible, to provide for the inclusion of incapacitated wives and mothers, to save them from penury.</p>
