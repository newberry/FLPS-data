   <p>At a meeting of representatives of the German Catholic congregations of this archdiocese, held yesterday afternoon in St. Peter's Hall, reports were read which gave proof that German Catholics of Chicago and vicinity are actively engaged in relieving the distress of their brothers in Germany and Austria. Monseigneur Rempe was in charge, while Father J. Strehl of the St. Aloysius parish acted as secretary. The report of the treasurer, Father J. Schiffer of St. Philomena parish, indicated that up to the present time approximately nine thousand dollars had been donated.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the representatives of the various communities mentioned the collection of large quantities of clothes, shoes, and other useful articles which were ready for shipment. In order to heighten interest in the good cause, it was decided to hold a number of rallies in the various communities. The first of them will take place Sunday night, November 23, in the St. Alphonsus Athenaeam, where Miss Jane Addams will deliver an address.</p>
