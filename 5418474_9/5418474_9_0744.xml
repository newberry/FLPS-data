<title level="a">GERMAN RESERVISTS LEAVING ELMHURST</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The colony of German reservists in Elmhurst has been dissolved. The hospitality which the authorities of the evangelical seminary for a few weeks had extended the reservists, who were stranded here because they could not obtain passage to Germany, had to come to an end. Vacation time is almost over, and the institution had to make preparations for the return of its regular students. The [German] consulate, by the way, has found jobs for many of the reservists, with the help of the press and private individuals, leaving only a few men who have not been taken care of yet. In spite of all warnings, there are still men coming from out of town to report for service.</p>
   <p>Keep Faith With Germany</p>
   <p>It is a wonderful thing that the war, which the land of their fathers has to fight now, has revived the loyalty and patriotism of German-Americans of the second and third generations. Yesterday Mr. E. W. Wagner, head of the brokerage <pb facs="5418474_9_0745.jpg" n="2"/>firm of E. W. Wagner &amp; Co., a grandson of Lorenz Brentano and nephew of Judge Theodor Brentano, started a collection among the members of the grain exchange for the funds of the Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft (German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society). On the first day he netted more than a thousand dollars, which will be forwarded to Mr. Oskar F. Mayer, treasurer of the Aid Society. Mr. Wagner will continue the collection, and hopes to turn over another generous amount to the relief fund. We hope that this splendid example of German loyalty will inspire other descendants of Chicago German pioneers to do likewise.</p>
   <p>The Aid Society</p>
   <p>Next Tuesday afternoon, at five o'clock, the management of the Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft, consisting of the officers and chairmen of the subcommittees, will hold a meeting in the Germania Club, where important matters will be discussed. We hear that a decision is to be made as to how the names of donors are to be published in the newspapers. Contributions are coming in steadily, and in satisfactory amounts.</p>
