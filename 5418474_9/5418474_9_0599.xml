   <p>There is a "too early"--as there is a "too late". The words "too late" are among the saddest of any language. Experience, as well as the history of both man and nations, proves that a "too early" may be just as bad and just as full of tragic consequences as the "too late".</p>
   <p>"Too early"--we can read it on the tombstone of many a gifted inventor or genius who died poor, inglorious, and embittered, simply because he was ahead of his time with his inventions, his ideas, or his teachings. These words are explanation for so much fruitless effort, so many lost battles and campaigns.</p>
   <p>And most of the time it takes more courage to avoid a "too early" than to prevent a "too late".</p>
   <p>The heart and the head--emotion and reason--guide the actions of man. Emotion <pb facs="5418474_9_0600.jpg" n="2"/>seeks expression and desires immediate action. Reason ponders and hesitates, looks into the future and reflects.</p>
   <p>Reason is responsible for a "too late" when quick action is called for; sentiment may be blamed for a "too early".</p>
   <p>In the war history of nations we can read often enough: "The troops, full of enthusiasm and fighting spirit, and tired of long waiting, desired nothing better than to engage the enemy. But the general knew how precarious his position was and resolved to wait for reinforcements. But finally he yielded to the persistent demands for action and--his army was beaten and dispersed, and the campaign which had begun with such promise ended with a tragic defeat. The attack had been launched "too early".</p>
   <p>The German people were in want; they had suffered and their destitution was great in 1917, when Germany's armies still held all fronts victoriously against the enemy.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0601.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The misery of the German people grew more intense as the armies broke down and were pushed back in the fall of 1918. The suffering was becoming more acute than ever before when the German delegates submitted to the terms of the Armistice in November.</p>
   <p>But today, eleven months after the signing of the Armistice, the distress and misery of the German people are greatest. It is greater than during the long war years--greater than at the time when the representatives of the people were forced to sign the Armistice, and later the Peace Treaty. Today the suffering of the German and the Austrian people has become unbearable, with no help in sight!</p>
   <p>Americans of German descent have either known or suspected the plight of the German people and have pitied them. And all the time they wanted to help them so badly; they wanted to follow the dictates of their hearts.</p>
   <p>But during 1917 and 1918, as long as the struggle lasted, their American citizenship compelled them to sacrifice, to join in the fight against Germany, and to <pb facs="5418474_9_0602.jpg" n="4"/>suppress all emotions of compassion for the suffering German people. When the war was concluded, they could give free rein to their pity for their suffering brothers over there, but they restrained their impatient hearts--they somehow managed to restrain themselves, in the hope that peace would come soon and they would be at liberty to act.</p>
   <p>This hope was disappointed. Peace was delayed and the stringent war measures remained in force; the distrust against all those who were suspected of being German sympathizers disappeared very slowly and hostile elements never missed an opportunity to look for an excuse to fan the flames again. So the word was to wait patiently. Disappointed in their hopes and expectations, tormented by their grief over the suffering German people, German-Americans were still hampered by war restrictions and were afraid that the time to start relief action on a large scale had not yet arrived. They were afraid that such action on behalf of their suffering brothers and the destitute and starving German women and children would be branded as German "propaganda," that the beneficial process of a gradual change of sentiment toward things German would be disrupted and they themselves would be endangered and regarded as obnoxious, and, most important, <pb facs="5418474_9_0603.jpg" n="5"/>that the good cause of the starving and suffering German and Austrian women and children would suffer a serious setback. They disregarded the demands of their hearts because they thought it was "too early".</p>
   <p>This apprehension was justified. The danger did exist, but it does not now.</p>
   <p>The emotions have calmed. The artificial hatred created by propaganda has just about run its course. The truth will out. People realize now that many things told them had no foundation in fact, and that the German people were the scapegoat rather than the culprit. They realize that the German people are the bulwark of western Europe and America against the subversive influence of eastern Europe--that today they suffer more than ever before and are in danger of being lost unless they are given some kind of assistance.</p>
   <p>Now there is no longer any danger of being "too early". Now is the time to act, to render prompt and vigorous assistance, if a "too late" is to be avoided!</p>
   <p>Now one can no longer dare to brand or even to suggest that relief action and <pb facs="5418474_9_0604.jpg" n="6"/>generous contributions to aid the starving women and children of Germany and Austria are German propaganda or un-American activity.</p>
   <p>To work hard, to give generously, is now American in the best sense of the word, for charity and the immediate alleviation of distress, especially in the case of suffering women and children, always was and still is a typically American characteristic.</p>
   <p>Our fellow citizens of Anglo-Saxon stock will no longer reproach and suspect Americans of German lineage if they raise millions for the alleviation of distress among the German people. They will even lend a hand for this purpose, and they will be disappointed if instead of millions only thousands of dollars are collected, and if the names of especially wealthy men and women either are missing from the subscription lists or only appear for small amounts.</p>
   <p>Now is the right time for the concerted action which must follow the preliminary skirmishes. All hands on deck and let's all pull together!</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0605.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The slogan is: Solicit and subscribe. A dollar given now is worth a hundred dollars given a year from now. Ten thousand dollars now mean salvation for a hundred children--ten thousand dollars six months from now could not bring back the life of one child who died from starvation in January or February.</p>
