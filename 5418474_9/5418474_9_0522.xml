<title level="a">GERMAN SOCIETY LOOKS BACK UPON 70 YEARS OF ACTIVITY.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The German Society, which looks back upon an activity of 70 years, during that time has done a great deal of charitable work, held its yearly meeting yesterday, on which occasion the president of the society, former Judge Girten, and the secretary, both of whom devoted themselves unselfishly to the business affairs of the organization, submitted their reports, as follows:</p>
   <p>Yearly Report of the President:</p>
   <p>"70 years old? No, 70 years young should be said on the occasion of the German Society's jubilee, because it is the oldest among all the charitable organization, public or private, and can look back with pride upon zealous action in mitigating the need of our countrymen during the seventy years. Its work cannot be estimated in figures, and the value of its assistance, be it in money, coal, clothing, offer of work or advice in need and difficulties, is tremendous. Permit me a short retrospect which includes the period from January 1, 1914 - the year in which the cruel World War began, until December <pb facs="5418474_9_0523.jpg" n="2"/>31, 1924, when the German Society closed its 70 years career.</p>
   <p>During this time it assisted 9,558 families with 31,326 children, secured work for 28, 634 people, procured legal aid in 2,200 cases, helped almost 3,000 persons during the critical war period, spent almost $110,000, for help, and was always ready and willing to assist with advice and information. The powerful performance of the German Society in spite of the hard times and financila difficulties should be a spur to carry on this noble work in the same sense. For such reason do we solicit new members and patrons, who should generously contribute the necessary funds, and we request the kind co-operation, especially of the German elements in Chicago, so that we may be able to achieve our aim.</p>
   <p>Legacies.</p>
   <p>From the managers of the estate of our member of long standing, Mr. John F. C. Hansen we received $500 and Mr. Theodore A. Kochs, who also was a member of long standing, willed us $1,000.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0524.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Death</p>
   <p>We lost, this year, a number of faithful members, who supported us steadily with their contributions, namely: Louis C. Bartling, Ernst von Danden, Adolph George, who was a director for many years, Dr. Otto Guenther, Theodore A. Kochs, also a director, Dr. Ernst Saurenhaus, Wilhelm Schick, Otto C. Schneider and Horst Scott.</p>
   <p>As members of the Executive committee for the next three years: Messrs. Michael F. Girten, Robert G. Schenneman, Adolph Kroch, George W. Torpe, were re-elected and Judge Alfar M. Eberhardt, son of the former president, was newly elected.</p>
