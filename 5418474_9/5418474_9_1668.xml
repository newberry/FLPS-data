   <p>It is quite impossible for the average American to dismiss from his mind the belief that a German cannot be whole-heartedly an American. As much as the German tries, so they say, to do his duty as an American citizen, in his heart he will always keep his deep affection for his old home land, therefore creating a complex of his feelings.</p>
   <p>This perception is due to a radical mistake by all those who judge but superficially and are unable to understand the philosophical discipline of differentials. Historical research, and a probing of facts regarding the composition of German spiritual life in America would immediately correct this attitude.</p>
   <p>A test of historical facts leads to proof as to why the Germans have preferred the United States as their second father land. The prevailing conception of the Americans, that only material reasons had been the <pb facs="5418474_9_1669.jpg" n="2"/>deciding factor is untrue. The compulsion to earn daily bread is unquestionably very strong, but it was not sufficient, in most cases, to break the ties which chained one to his father land. To do this much stronger motives were required than that, and these the old Europe offered them in large measure. First, there was the pressure of faith. The principles of the state demanded, that the minority of the people had to accept the faith of the majority of the people, therefore, leaving the alternative, either to accept or to change their native home. History has bestowed upon mankind testimonials of honor, that for faith, which is the evidence of freedom of thought, everything has been sacrificed. And only America could be the new homeland, because of its immense area, in which a state religion, which existed in several colonies of this country, could not exercise compulsion on conscience. Therefore, America proved to be a strong magnet to the German immigrant.</p>
   <p>It is needless to say, that because these people were compelled by force to secure a new homeland, on account of their faith - they had to break <pb facs="5418474_9_1670.jpg" n="3"/>with their old country. Compelled by force, they value America higher because of the freedom in their conviction, which they can exercise here, and which Germany denied them. This was the first step to Americanism.</p>
   <p>The second break occurred through feudalism, which proved not less oppressive than the tyranny they had had to endure through their faith.</p>
   <p>The feudal lords considered the peasants as beasts of burden. And when these German farmers learned of a country, which had abundantly fertile soil, and which could be maintained independently, where he could be his own master, free from oppression and tyranny, they naturally hurried there. In this case it was also a matter of course, that America was preferred to feudalistic Europe.</p>
   <p>The immigration of later years has been an escape from absolutism. The citizens of Germany rose against the tyrannically policed state, and caused the exceptionally large immigration in 1848. The men of those times took a hostile attitude <pb facs="5418474_9_1671.jpg" n="4"/>against political Germany, They had suffered much in the old fatherland, but here they found their ideal of political and economic freedom completely realized, therefore it was a matter of course that they became entirely saturated with the spirit of Americanism.</p>
   <p>These influences and conceptions proved prominent until the latter part of the last century. The cultural struggle brought hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics to this country. The Socialist persecution in Germany also brought hundreds of thousands here, who perceived their salvation in the economic doctrine of America. In connection with this, other important American influences made themselves felt.</p>
   <p>The German immigrant did not come over as a traveling worker, but with the firm purpose of acclimatizing himself, and, as time passed on, he grew with this country. The children, who were educated here and some of them born here, strengthened this affection for the adopted country, so that thoughts of <pb facs="5418474_9_1672.jpg" n="5"/>political alliance with Germany here completely vanished.</p>
   <p>Now this indisputable progressive course in Americanism is criticized by the opposition. It claims that the Germans in America did not renounce their language, and they believe, therefore, that the Germans are still strangers to American institutions. This also is but superficial judgment, which overlooks the development of the German people.</p>
   <p>The first settlers were practically forced to associate exclusively among themselves on account of their ignorance of the English language. Their customs, which are very dominating in social connections, were also clannish in effect. With Puritanism, which is still a dominating factor in this country, the Germans could not become friendly. Enthusiastically they joined other citizens and participated in everything which served the common welfare. For it, they worked in the fields, in the offices, and the factories; they took part in all general and useful undertakings, but as soon as their work was done, and they were by themselves, among their own people, <pb facs="5418474_9_1673.jpg" n="6"/>they lived according to their own individual taste. That probably is peculiar, but it does not indicate hostility.</p>
   <p>The different nationalities of this country, with all their different views, can be compared to a large garden, in which all trees are not of the same kind, but nevertheless are rooted in the same soil. One tree is as useful to its owner as the other, and he values each one, according to its way of producing.</p>
   <p>In such a manner Germans have to be comprehended, so they can be understood and fully valued.</p>
   <p>Each nationality of this country offers different talents, but in each lives the spirit of Americanism.</p>
