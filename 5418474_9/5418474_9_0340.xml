   <p>To call a person charitable is a fine tribute paid to the one devoted to the alleviation of the suffering of humanity. But nothing can be nobler than to take the place of father of mother to the little orphans, and rear and rear and guide them all through childhood until they too are ready to take their places in the outside world. This is exactly the work the management of the German-Catholic orphanage in Rosehill has announced to do. Various German-Catholic communities throughout Chicago have adopted this humane system of caring for orphaned children ten years ago. Considering the comparatively short period since the original orphanage of Rosehill was built, and the fact that that structure was destroyed by fire, Oct. 26, 1879, it is highly commendable indeed, that they have not lost any time to erect a new orphan asylum, surpassing in excellence the building consumed by the flames.... Imposing ceremonies preceded the opening of the orphanage last Thursday.</p>
   <p>The home is built to accomodate 300 children. Among the fifty-six boys and <pb facs="5418474_9_0341.jpg" n="2"/>forty girls in the home now, are also twenty foundlings. The management of the institution is entrusted to an Administrative Council, which is chosen by the seven Catholic communities, responsible for the erection and maintenance of this home. But the sisters, known as servants of Christ, are the direct managers of the home. The headquarters of their organization are in Gernbach, near Coblenz on the Rhine.</p>
   <p>Children placed in this German-Catholic institution remain there until after they have received first communion. Thereafter, they are placed in private homes, but remain under the guardianship of the Orphan's Home until they reach maturity.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the new building is very spacious, the sisters have taken upon themselves still greater responsibilities, namely, to take in, and care for, motherless infants, although the father may be living. Many a young widower, finding himself in just such a predicament, will hail this excellent opportunity offered to him by the sisters to give the child proper care and rearing.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0342.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After the simple but impressive dedication ceremonies were concluded, the installation of the newly elected officials took place. They are: Pater Essing, from the St. Michaels community, president; C. Wenn, pastor of St. Bonifacius Church is vice-president; Adam L. Amberg is treasurer; and Lorenz Biehl, secretary.</p>
   <p>The building is equipped with all the latest modern comforts....</p>
