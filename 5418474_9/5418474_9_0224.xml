   <p>The following is a report regarding the development of the German hospital in its new home:</p>
   <p>The hospital is enjoying healthy growth and development. Numerous applications for admission are being received. Seven weeks ago we moved into our new home. About fifty patients were admitted, and nearly one half of them have already been dismissed as cured. Dr. C. Fenger has already undertaken sixteen operations, some of them very serious, but with good results.</p>
   <p>The financial conditions also are becoming more favorable. More "paying" patients are applying for admission with the result that income exceeds the expenses. It is desirable that we pay the balance which is still due on the building, in order to devote our whole time to the management of the institution.</p>
   <p>We are glad to report that we have made arrangements in our German hospital for a dispensary. It is open to the public daily, except Sunday from 10 to 12 o'clock A.M. Poor people, as well as children receive medical advice and treatment; however, it is expected that they pay for the medicines which are <pb facs="5418474_9_0225.jpg" n="2"/>sold as cheaply as possible. Dr. J. H. Hoelscher, previously with the Alexianer hospital, is the head of this department.</p>
   <p>A contribution of $25.00 will add an additional bed to the hospital, and an annual contribution of $25.00 assures the donor the right to vote in matters pertaining to the hospital, and at the same time pays the expenses of one patient every year.</p>
   <p>The German hospital is now in a position to undertake the most difficult operations. For examinations and consultations see Dr. Ch. Fenger, 229 N. LaSalle Ave. People without means may apply direct to the hospital.</p>
