   <p>Distress is threatening. Ominous days lie ahead. Help can only come from America. As on previous occasions, we must come to the rescue to lessen the burden.</p>
   <p>Send Food Now</p>
   <p>The new harvest will not be available until July. During the interim, Germany must depend on imported foodstuffs. The German mark, diminished in value, cannot buy anything in foreign markets.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_9_0544.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Do Not Let Your Loved Ones Suffer from Hunger</p>
   <p>Send them good, fresh American food, like that which the Central Committee delivers regularly every week to its warehouse in Hamburg.</p>
   <p>The packages of the Central Committee contain carefully selected assortments--quality foods--designed to strengthen undernourished bodies as rapidly as possible. We send the finest products obtainable in this country, and our shipments are therefore highly esteemed by the famine victims in Germany.</p>
   <p>Whoever has no dependents or knows of no one requiring help can donate a package through the Central Committee, thereby helping the cause.</p>
   <p>The packages "A", "D", "E", "F", "H", "I", "L", "O", and "P" [described later] will be delivered to the homes of the recipients. The packages "B", "C", "G", "K", "M", and "E", will be delivered free to the railroad <pb facs="5418474_9_0545.jpg" n="3"/>depot at the destination. In Vienna, all packages will be given to the addressee at the warehouse; in all other parts of Austria, delivery is free to the depot at the destination.</p>
   <p>We guarantee delivery of every package.</p>
   <p>Central Committee, Inc.</p>
   <p>For the Relief of Distress in Germany and Austria</p>
   <p>Food Package Department</p>
   <p>247 East 41st Street (Suite 72), New York, N. Y.</p>
   <p>Orders may also be sent through: The American Welfare Association, 128 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Ill.; office hours from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
   <p>[The advertisement concludes with a detailed specification of the contents of the food packages marked "A", "B",...., "R".]</p>
