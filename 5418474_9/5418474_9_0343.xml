<title level="a">THE ORPHANAGE IN ROSEHILL</title>
</bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The executive board of the Rosehill Orphanage cannot begin rebuilding at this time, because of inclement weather. It will be remembered that the Orphanage was destroyed by fire on October 26. However, as soon as conditions permit, building operations will be started, and, in the meantime, stone will be hauled.</p>
   <p>It is planned to erect a substantial, large building at an outlay of $20,000. This is a large sum, considering present funds. However, judging from the interest shown the institution in the past, and the hearty response of generous people who gave aid after the fire, the board hopes that sufficient money will be available eventually to provide a suitable building for the unfortunate children.</p>
   <p>The executive board takes this occasion to thank all who contributed so <pb facs="5418474_9_0344.jpg" n="2"/>generously and promptly as soon as the tragedy became known. In connection therewith, we express our gratitude, first of all, to the inhabitants of Rosehill, whose ceaseless efforts during the fire prevented destruction of the two new adjacent buildings. There was a lack of fire equipment, and only the prompt action of the citizens prevented a more serious loss; in fact, nearly all of the furnishings of the destroyed building were removed and, most important of all, none of the children was injured. Shelter was provided elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The St. Michael's parish held a fair and gave us the receipts, amounting to $800, for which we give ardent thanks, and we also desire to express our gratitude for the activities of the residents of the West Side, who arranged a concert at the instigation of the Catholic Club and raised $1200; for the donation from the Luxemburger Aid Society, $50; for a $50 contribution from the Schwaben Verein (Swabian Club); and for $20 donated by the New Strassburg <pb facs="5418474_9_0345.jpg" n="3"/>and Richton communities.</p>
   <p>While it is highly gratifying to observe the generally prevailing benevolent attitude, it is also equally deplorable to note the activities of scheming persons who use the fire and the plight of the orphans as a pretext for collecting money to enrich themselves. It has been reported that people are soliciting funds in the rural districts, as well as in the city, without being authorized to do so.</p>
   <p>We therefore advise the public that all persons presenting themselves as collectors should be regarded as swindlers unless they can identify themselves by presenting letters of introduction signed by Reverend De Dycker, president of the institution, or a local parish priest.</p>
   <p>The sisters of the Orphanage--and they are the only ones thus far authorized to solicit funds--will hold a house to house canvass in the near future, and we <pb facs="5418474_9_0346.jpg" n="4"/>hope the people will rally to the support of the institution.</p>
   <p>In behalf of the executive board,</p>
   <p>L. Biehl,</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
