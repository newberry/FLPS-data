   <p>In spite of other current points of view, Prohibition was abolished in an effort to destroy the dishonorable fraternity of bootleggers and speakeasies. However, the first year of personal freedom did not justify this expectation. The bootlegger is still at work and the speakeasies are still flourishing, protected by the same rowdy elements which, in times past, have always composed the following of the bootlegging barons.</p>
   <p>The lengths to which these mobs may go under certain circumstances is shown in the case of John Gelbert. Gelbert, who refused to debase his job as school janitor by being a screen for a speakeasy, was accosted by a band of these rowdies and so brutally attacked that his condition is now very critical. Gelbert's straightforwardness and his sense of right did not permit him to become an <pb facs="5418474_9_1265.jpg" n="2"/>accessory to crime, and he paid the price for his honesty.</p>
   <p>The leader of the gang escaped with little punishment, for he was arrested on the charge of inciting a riot, and was fined a mere fifty dollars. We are surprised that Gelbert, the janitor, was not also arrested and thrown into prison as a dangerous criminal.</p>
   <p>The affair is going to have an aftermath. A series of raids have been launched in this district as a result of the Board of Education's complaint that these same speakeasies have sold liquor to school children.</p>
   <p>No matter what the outcome of the whole business may be, one thing is certain: Only neglect of duty on the part of the police makes such conditions possible. It is up to the captain of every district to see that order is maintained. If Al Capone could, with pride and justice, call himself "Salesman to His Majesty, the Public" because he gave them what they wanted, there must have been some <pb facs="5418474_9_1266.jpg" n="3"/>reason at that time for such a lawless condition. Today, such an excuse is no longer valid.</p>
   <p>One can and must demand that the menace of speakeasies be abolished without regard to political influence. If this is not soon accomplished we shall live to see new attempts made to impose upon us the old Prohibition law in some new dress.</p>
