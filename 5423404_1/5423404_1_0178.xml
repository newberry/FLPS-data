   <p>Among the many reasons why a worker ought to be a teetotaler, one is prompted to place economic considerations high on the list, especially as regards men with a family. But for a well-paid, single young man the economic aspect is far from the most important. The time, for instance, that he wastes in connection with his liquor consumption, whether in saloons and other such establishments or in his own home, is a much more serious matter. The workingman's spare time is particularly valuable because it is so short. It must be used wisely, if he is to keep up with developments in his line of work, and keep himself mentally and physically fit, so that he may be able to advance himself and improve his lot in that struggle for a place in the sun in which most of us are engaged. Knowledge and alertness are his best weapons in this struggle, and are becoming more and more necessary for success. The <pb facs="5423404_1_0179.jpg" n="2"/>worker has, really, no time to waste on liquor. Instead, he would do well to cultivate the habit of reading, in order to become more proficient at his job, and also to supplement his formal education, which often is none too good.</p>
   <p>But the waste of time is not the worst aspect of drinking. Let us consider what liquor does to the worker. It tends to rob him of the desire to improve his lot, and fosters within him an indifference and hopelessness, which are dangerous because, under their influence, he shrinks from any serious endeavor. He who has made drinking a habit finds it difficult to keep mentally alert, and liquor takes the edge off his will power. He is not likely to undertake anything that requires a sustained serious effort.</p>
   <p>Will power is something modern man must have if he is to obtain for himself some of the good things of life. And the working class, in its own interest, should do all within its power to remove everything that undermines this quality. Otherwise, its material and cultural progress will be slow.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0180.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Such considerations as these merit the attention of every young worker who is sincerely concerned about his own welfare and that of his class. He had better decide that liquor shall have no place in his life.</p>
