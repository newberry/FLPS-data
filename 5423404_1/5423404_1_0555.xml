   <p>Some employers have enthusiastically supported the widely publicized campaign for the "American plan" or the open shop, the purpose of which is nothing less than the distruction of the trade unions. Campaign headquarters have been established in New York, and it was recently reported from that city that the campaign did not make much progress during the year just ended.</p>
   <p>The movement is not new. In fact, it has always existed more or less openly, but it is particularly apt to blossom forth during "bad times" The year 1921 should, therefore, have been quite favorable. However, it seems that the campaign was so unsuccessful that its leaders are ready to dissolve the organization. The harm done to the trade unions has probably backfired.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that employers and industrial leaders can be so politically and socially shortsighted as not to realize that the trade unions, in their present form, are their best friends. Do they really believe that by means <pb facs="5423404_1_0556.jpg" n="2"/>of force they can make the American workers give up all organization? Or do they think for one moment that the so-called anti-syndicalist legislation which has been introduced to fight radicalism will hurt anybody but the trade unions?</p>
