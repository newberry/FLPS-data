   <p>The tariff debate has demonstrated conclusively that the common people have only a few spokesmen in the United States Senate. Some Senators represent mining interests or the steel industry, others the shoe manufacturing industry, or the cotton mill owners, while still others speak for the tanners and so on down the line. It is evident that while passing as the people's representatives, most Senators in reality represent corporations which are enabled to earn enormous profits, thanks to our tariff policy.</p>
   <p>On the assumption that Senators are servants and representatives of the people, they are being paid very good salaries and, in addition, enjoy many desirable privileges. In spite of the fact that many of them are millionaires, we have never yet heard of a Senator turning down anything that he had coming.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0455.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When somebody recently proposed a tax on the dividends of corporations, a wave of protests broke over the Senate floor, and Senators jumped to their feet with tears in their eyes, in the defense of the widows and fatherless children who would be hard hit by such "unjust" taxation. It was astounding to see how well widows and helpless children are represented in our Senate. But we did not notice that the esteemed lawmakers spoke up in behalf of the many who depend on their own toil for a meager existence, which is made even harder to bear on account of the present high tariff. We suspect that our Senators are concerned only about those who are widows and children of men that owned shares in powerful corporations, and not about those whose pitiful income hardly permit them to buy sufficient food. From the point of view of most Senators, we have in this country a privileged class of widows and children comparable to those other privileged classes that control our industries and natural resources. The working and producing classes do not rate much consideration except at election time, for, strange as it may seem, they do have the privilege of voting, and there are so dangerously many of them. The same old promises have been put forward <pb facs="5423404_1_0456.jpg" n="3"/>time and again, and have been believed by the voting masses. But one must be patient. The pay-off will come sometime.</p>
