   <p>p.7................The meeting expressed its gratification - (1) on the election of Wm. McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt, as President and Vice-President of the United States; (2) the policy of the administration relating to Phillipines and Cuba; (3) and what was accomplished in the Orient was praised; (4) the nation received best wishes since the American people showed enough wisdom to, again, place a Republican congress to aid the President.</p>
   <p>As citizens of the State of Illinois, those at the meeting expressed an especial pride because the old "war governor's son, Richard Yates, was elected Governor of the State; and that he has surrounded himself with a circle of able servants, among which is especially named an outstanding member of the Swedish American Republican League, Moses O. Williamson head of the Tax Department.</p>

   <p>The hope was expressed that the City of Chicago might soon be freed from Democratic mis-administration concerning the election of Judge E. Henecy as Mayor. Satisfaction was evidenced regarding the development of the state organization; and the different clubs which made the growth possible. Lastly a warm expression of thanks was made to the city of Galesburg and its citizens for the hearty welcome which the participants in the meeting received.</p>
