   <p>The Idrott Co-operative restaurant's annual general membership meeting was held last Friday in its new building, which is located at Belmont and Wilton Avenues. About seventy persons attended, among whom were delegates from the lodges Illinois Swedes and Jupiter, the Idrott Young Peoples' Club, and the Lake View Swedish Socialist Club.</p>
   <p>The new building, which is owned by the organization and which houses the restaurant business, has now been completed at a total cost of $78,566.68. The new restaurant is much larger than the old one, with up-to-date equipment in all departments. It employs twenty-six persons, including those in the bakery shop.</p>
   <p>The financial report showed that last year's net profit amounted to $7,000.70, and the total assets of the organization, as of December 31, 1923 were $28,014.09.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0710.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A bonus of $150 was voted to the management, and $50 was appropriated for the library committee.</p>
   <p>The meeting decided that all employees are to be insured. It was also decided to install a first-class soda fountain in the restaurant, and to set aside $250 for new acquisitions for the library and reading room.</p>
   <p>New officers were elected to replace those whose term had expired.</p>
