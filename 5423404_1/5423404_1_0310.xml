   <p>When one hears an American boast to the foreigner, he can with good reason doubt his sincerity; he is bragging for his own gain or he has a political axe to grind. "Yes, the Swede is certainly a man with brains," is what one may hear even though the expression is lacking in enthusiasm, the voice losing heartiness, at the end of the sentence, so one at once rightfully doubts the American's sincerity.</p>
   <p>Ignorance or jealousy alone could cause any man or woman to say anything uncomplimentary about the Swedes, recognition of our intellegence is due us. The Americans could not belittle our intelligence if they want to be righteous and honest.</p>
   <p>A grand picture of Swedish intelligence has, especially during recent weeks, been painted wherever a Swedish-American colony may be found. In all these <pb facs="5423404_1_0311.jpg" n="2"/>spots one finds the younger generation outstanding in diligence, behavior and knowledge. In exchange, we note with great pride in papers received at this office the many long articles about Swedish children who have earned top notch marks in their classes, the older ones graduating with highest honors.</p>
   <p>It is a credit to practically every Swedish-American home that every effort and sacrifice is made to give the children a thorough education.</p>
   <p>The parents of the rightfully complimented children have gone through many a hard struggle, with the mediocre education they were able to get, to give their children a real education; as a reward should be credited, even praised for their hard earned accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The standing of Swedish-American children in the grade school, high school, business college, and university is an irrefutable argument to present when confronted by one of the many overbearing, know-it-all Yankees, who, at all times, are inclined to ridicule and belittle the Swede of this country. Though most Yanks are strong for gold and silver, we credit them with having one real ideal, the American public school which is unexcelled anywhere.</p>
