   <p>The Union Bank of Chicago was organized a short while ago by Swedish-American and Norwegian - American businessmen. The capital of the bank is announced at $200,000 with a surplus of $25,000, all fully paid. The bank will be located in the Bankers' Building, southwest corner of Randolph and La Salle Streets, Chicago, and it will open for business about May 1. The officers of the new bank will include such highly respected men as: Mr. Chas. E. Schlytern, one of the organizers and for many years treasurer of the Milwaukee Avenue State Bank; Mr. Gustaf Hallbom and Mr. Eos Hegstrom, two well-known Swedish businessmen, who for many years have been connected with the State Bank of Chicago. The board of directors will consist of prominent, rich Scandinavian-American businessmen. Nearly <pb facs="5423404_1_0472.jpg" n="2"/>all the stock of the new bank is held by our countrymen in Chicago. The bank will become the representative Scandinavian bank here, and it aims to gain the confidence of the people through conservative but vigorous leadership.</p>
   <p>It is to be noticed that the bank will have large deposits from the very start, and there is full assurance that there will be rapid progress from the very start.</p>
