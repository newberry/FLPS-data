   <p>The time has long since passed when Swedish immigrants were satisfied merely to "chop wood and carry water" for other people in this country. They are now pursuing careers in all lines of endeavor, and while many of them naturally are best suited for unpretentious and not always well-paid, but time-honored and honest manual labor, a great many have entered professions which require long and expensive training. They are doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, journalists, artists, public officials, business executives, and so on. A remarkably large number have studied for the ministry, and fortunately a Swedish-American intellectual proletariat does not yet exist.</p>
   <p>Such reflections as these are particularly apt to occupy one's thoughts at this time of the year--commencement time, when graduation exercises are about to be held at our high schools, colleges and universities. The majority of <pb facs="5423404_1_0063.jpg" n="2"/>Swedish-Americans preparing for professional work are attending or have attended Swedish-American institutions for all or part of their formal education, while quite a few Swedish-American high school graduates have won scholarships in American universities, where they have given a good account of themselves.</p>
   <p>Anybody who will go to the trouble of looking through the list of alumni appended to the catalogues of Swedish-American schools will be convinced that we are not exaggerating. A supporting example is provided by a news dispatch on another page of this issue, in which it is reported that four countrymen, all of whom attended a Swedish-American school in Minnesota, have graduated in the same class from the medical school of a university in another state.</p>
