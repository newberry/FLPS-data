   <p>p.6.....Under this heading the editor of Svenska Kuriren (The Swedish Courier) writes a two column article which, without consideration for its competency, leaves a highly painful and unpleasant impression with a Swede. He may be a Swedish-Swede, or Swedish-American, writes the Svenska-Amerikanska Western (Swedish-American Western) and puts in later, a, just as rightful, as sharp contradiction, out of which we take the liberty to quote the following:</p>
   <p>The article in question which was to constitute a criticism of Dr. V.Hugo Wickstrom's, Ph.D. lecture in Chicago, recently, is an attack directed against the lecturer, instead, wherein passion and small-mindedness too clearly come forth for it to be able to win any sympathy, even among Kuriren's own readers.</p>
   <p>What caused this hostile feeling in Kuriren's editor is difficult to determine; perhaps, he was dashed by what he considered to be a lack of <pb facs="5423404_1_0374.jpg" n="2"/>attention from Dr. Wickstrom's side, as the case appears to be with another Swedish great man; perhaps the enmity for Dr. Wickstrom is only another out-burst against everything genuinely Swedish, which is so often seen in Kuriren's columns.</p>
   <p>We have often wondered about the contemporary's easy provocability, when it involves anything Swedish. Almost every time accord among the Swedes in America is being winnowed,or actually gained, the movement becomes the object of scorn and mockery from the side of our honored contemporary, Svenska Kuriren.</p>
   <p>What can be the meaning of this? Svenska Kuriren's publisher and editor is widely known as a man of sharp business sense, and a newspaper man of ability, above the ordinary, and we endorse this recognition, with but one exception. When it concerns the interest of Swedish-Americans as Swedish-Americans he places himself wholly on an American basis and <pb facs="5423404_1_0375.jpg" n="3"/>ridicules, puts down, and scorns all allusions to the Swedish and the Swedish spirit.</p>
   <p>He appears not to realize that the preservation of "the good Swedish" among the Swedes in America is the base itself, upon which his newspaper rests. The Swedish people are neither stupid nor ignorant, they quickly learn the country's language, and if all of the Swedish-American newspapers were edited in the same spirit as Svenska Kuriren, and if they succeeded thereby in imbuing our country-men with the same spirit, it would not be long before a Swedish-American news-press would be found superfluous.</p>
   <p>What appears especially to have awakened Kuriren's anger was that the lecturer gave utterance to the public feeling which obtains in Sweden toward us Swedes in America. There is hardly any one of us who have any relatives and friends in Sweden for whom we feel, and of whom we think often, with loving thoughts. These entertain, naturally, the same <pb facs="5423404_1_0376.jpg" n="4"/>feelings for us, and we need not become ill-willed; therefore, when one be-thinks that nearly every family in Sweden has some member in America, one should not, then, become insulting and angered by the fact that friendly consideration for us obtains at home. Kuriren's editor has of a certainty only bitter memories from the native land, but he should remember that not all Swedes have left the father-land under the same circumstances as he and have, therefore, friendlier feelings toward Sweden, and the Swedes.</p>
   <p>The article in question closes with an exhortation to the Swedes to wholly merge into the American nation which has the future before it, while Sweden has only the past. How much does the author of the article know of the future? His seer's vision has often shown itself to be treacherous, perhaps then, also, now.</p>
   <p>The future, is, of course, but a mirage, a something about which we know absolutely nothing, but the past is something we know about with definitive-ness. We know that Swedish men have won honor for themselves and their <pb facs="5423404_1_0377.jpg" n="5"/>country, far from Sweden's boundaries. This has happened not only in the past, but even in the present, and this gives us reason to believe that the Swedes in the future will know how to do their share toward world-progress.</p>
   <p>But we can well be good Americans even though we love our old native land preserve the brother-tie which binds us to the Swedes on the other side of the ocean, and interest ourselves in Sweden's culture and development.</p>
