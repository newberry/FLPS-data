   <p>Who doesn't know Mr. Ludvig Larson, on the corner of Chicago Avenue, and Sedgwick, near Hesselroth's old drug store? All Swedes who have lived in this good city for a few years know him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Larson has been in the restaurant business for a generation there on the ground floor; and the second floor is known as Larson Hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Larson, together with his wife, nee Ida Ekblom, were pleasantly surprised in the old, honorable, Swedish-American manner, last Saturday in their home, 565 Arlington Place, by about one hundred friends. The occasion was Mrs. Larson's birthday. It has always been celebrated with a grand coffee party. Mr. Larson wondered why in the world there were so many men at Mr. Larson's kettle-drum. However, later in the evening, he was enlightened when the director, John E. Ericsson, seized a coffee cup by the ear, raised it, and <pb facs="5423404_1_0255.jpg" n="2"/>inquired, if it were possible to obtain a bit of a "prod in the weather." Oh, yes-John E. is never long-winded so he was served willingly. He began by congratulating Mrs. Larson on her birthday, but rebuked the lord of the house for permitting his silver wedding anniversary, which fell on October 24, to pass uncelebrated by the many friends of the family.</p>
   <p>Ericsson, speaking for all the guests, wished Mr. and Mrs. Larson many happy years ahead, and reminded them that friendship never dies, that the friends they have acquired still stand as a fortress of protection about them. As a remembrance of the day and friendship, Mr. Ericsson, in behalf of those present, presented a charming loving cup in silver, and in it were many ringing, new, white silver dollars. Mr. Larson expressed thanks for himself and Mrs. Larson, for the beautiful gift, but still more for their friendship. The evening hours passed quickly amid pleasant conversation and merriment.</p>

   <p>Ludvig Larson is a native of Westgotha; he was born in the vicinity of Skofde, October 2, 1860. While a young man he emigrated and came directly to Chicago. That was in 1881. After having worked nine years for others, he opened his own restaurant in 1890, at 370 Chicago Avenue. He has made himself known as a straightforward, honest and industrious business man. Only recently, he gave up the enterprise and became a real estate broker.</p>
   <p>Larson is a Swedish-American in the highest sense of the word. He loves the land of his adoption without sacrificing his love for the sod of his fathers. He prefers to speak the mother-tongue; he gets on best among his countrymen, and his most earnest efforts are for Swedish fraternaties in Chicago. He is a member of the first Swedish society in Chicago, Svea; he is likewise a member of Vega, and the Svithiod lodge of the Svithiod order.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Larson was born in Eksjo, Smaland. She has lived most of her life in Chicago. The couple have one child, a daughter.</p>
