   <p>We take it that the actual meaning of the term "living wage" is a wage on which the recipient can maintain life.</p>
   <p>Right now, the big employers are discussing whether or not workers in general are entitled to such a wage. Some of them say "yes," but the majority says "no". The railroad commission, which has of late been much in the public eye, and whose members draw an annual compensation of ten thousand dollars each for their toil is on record as having recommended that railroad employees be paid only a little more than half of what the commission itself has admitted to be a living wage.</p>
   <p>Elbert H. Gary, president of the United States Steel Corporation, is a judge, and, as a rule, judges are dignified gentlemen, whose statement one is inclined <pb facs="5423404_1_0425.jpg" n="2"/>to take seriously. But "His Honor" will pardon us for suspecting that he is indulging in a bit of humor when he publicly announces that "the cost of living is the deciding factor in the wage policies of the Steel Corporation". Gary and his corporation were never known to pay their workers fair wages. To be sure, he was highly praised in most of the country's press for his generous treatment of the steel workers when he raised their wage rate to thirty-six cents per hour. For our part, the action reminded us of the farmer who gave his horse an extra grain of cats so that the poor animal would be able to stand up in its stall.</p>
   <p>Thirty-six cents an hour is not an impressive wage for work in a steel mill, which in a few years time, transforms a strong and healthy man into a physical, and often a mental, wreck. As we see it, such a wage makes a joke out of the much heralded and much abused phrase, "the American standard of living."</p>
