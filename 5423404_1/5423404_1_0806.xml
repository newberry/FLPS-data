   <p>As previously stated in Svenska Kuriren (Swedish Courier) there was no indication for alarm from the national political standpoint in the election. Certain of our daily papers have done their best in impressing the voting public that such was the case, but now that the contrary has been shown it is to be hoped that these newspapers are enjoying their mistake.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago the victorious men elected to office were those who were on the "Fusion" group. These were mostly judges of our courts where ability is rated above the so-called party principle. The two major parties Republicans and Democrats had agreed to name half each of our judges to be elected. It is to be hoped that this principle will be carried forward to a greater extent by those in political power. Irrespective of the party to which these candidates for judges were attached, no partiality was shown in the result of the vote. Each candidate received about the same number of votes with slight modification.</p>

   <p>The Sociolistic Party at last Tuedsay's election showed itself to be so strong as either the Republican or the Democratic Party. This, or anything like it, has never occurred before now. For the future it spells a warning to the leaders of our two "great" major parties - who ought to sit down at once and deeply and most seriously study this situation.</p>
   <p>The most important point in the November election just held in Chicago is shown most clearly and self-explanatory, that tack is necessary as far as the National Politics are concerned to bring about a proper local election.</p>
   <p>It is not only cheap politics to attempt to govern local action from the national view-point, but dangerous as well. Nothing is to be gained from remote control from Washington. It was the clear intention of the framers of our Constitution that the local people were to have freedom of action, that they might in turn delegate to the National Government the representatives of their choice.</p>
