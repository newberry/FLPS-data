   <p>The Swedish-American Republican Women's Association held a very interesting and well-attended meeting February 8 in the Butler House. The meeting adopted the following resolution in favor of our esteemed countryman C. S. Peterson, who has been nominated as the Republican candidate for the office of president of the County Board:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Mr. C. S. Peterson has been placed in nomination for the office of president of the County Board of Cook County, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We believe that if elected he would stand for efficiency and economy in the affairs of the County; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, the Swedish-American Republican Women's Association, hereby endorse the candidacy of Mr. C. S. Peterson for the office of president of the County Board of Cook County."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0949.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Everyone present pledged herself to work diligently in Mr. Peterson's behalf. The Immanuel Women's Home Association also came out for Mr. Peterson's candidacy at a meeting which was held February 10 at 1511 North La Salle Street. Its president, Mrs. Emmy Ewald, addressed the meeting, and pointed out his many qualifications for the office, declaring that if he were elected he could be depended upon to handle the affairs of the county in an honest and efficient manner, which would greatly benefit the community, and reflect honor on his countrymen in this city.</p>
