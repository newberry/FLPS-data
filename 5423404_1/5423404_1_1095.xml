   <p>The Swedish candidate for Alderman of the 25th Ward, L. F. Hussander was defeated by his Democratic opponent, R. E. Brookman. The only victorious Swedish candidate was Peter J. Youngquist, Republican, who was elected Collector of the township of Jefferson.</p>
   <p>Some very important gains were made by the Republicans at this election, chief of which was that of capturing the office of Mayor for their own candidate, Hempstead Washburne. The office of City Clerk also went to a Republican, James R.B. Van Cleave. Several gains were made in the City Council, where fourteen Republicans are in office; although there are nineteen Democrats and one Independent.</p>
