   <p>In Des Moines, Iowa, a real-estate evaluation commission of forty-three men was recently appointed, and among them was one lone Swede. Commenting on the incident the local Swedish newspaper remarks: "The Swedes are drawing the short straw--as usual".</p>
   <p>This sounds somewhat disgruntled, but it must be admitted that our colleague puts the finger on a situation which is all too common, not only in Iowa's capital city, but in other parts of the country as well. The political cake is sliced and dished out without much regard for fairness, and foreign nationalities, with the exception of the Irish, get the crumbs and leftovers, unless local conditions make it imperative to court a certain national group in order to secure its vote. This goes for political appointments as well as for elective offices.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are several reasons for this; as far as the Swedes are concerned they have, to a considerable extent, only themselves to blame for the unsatisfactory condition. Many of them fail to take out citizenship papers since they plan to stay here only a few years and then return to Sweden. Others, who are citizens, neglect to register as voters, until some ward worker or Swedish leader, by means of pleas and entreaties, makes them do it. On election day many of them stay home.</p>
   <p>It happens quite often that Swedish candidates do not have the active support of their own countrymen and at times, they even encounter opposition within their own national group. In communities where the Swedish vote might actually decide the election, the opportunity is lost, because of lack of unity and because personal and political considerations are given precedence. Naturally, this weakness is taken advantage of by other political factions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1076.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Swedish candidates are often very able men and, of late, the question of nationality is becoming less important. The day may not be far off when the best men will be elected or appointed to public offices regardless of nationality and party affiliations. When that time comes the Swedish-Americans shall no longer draw the short straw.</p>
   <p>For that matter, there is no reason for despair even under present conditions. There are, throughout the country, many Swedish-Americans holding important public offices to which they have been either appointed or elected, and their number is growing.</p>
