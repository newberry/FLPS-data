   <p>If we are to believe our so-called "economic experts," the depression has now reached the bottom and better times are in prospect. They declare that definite signs of improvement on the labor market have already appeared but at the same time they exercise caution, and point out that the return to normal is bound to be a slow process, and that a rapid upswing is not to be expected.</p>
   <p>One likes to believe the best, and it certainly would bring joy to everybody if the predictions of these experts turn out to be right. But one thing is certain,--that whatever improvement may have been noticed in other quarters it has not yet reached the unemployed. They have heard similar prophecies before but the only change they have experienced, so far, has been a change for the worse, and they are looking for something more convincing than words before they will believe that their prospects are improving. But they do, of <pb facs="5423404_1_0754.jpg" n="2"/>course, hope, as sincerely as the rest of us, that the encouraging expert opinion is based on facts.</p>
   <p>There are certain signs, visible even to laymen, which indicate an approaching change for the better. One of them is that businessmen are finally realizing that it is the money spent by the working masses that keeps business going and when they become unable to buy, normal business becomes disrupted. Another encouraging sign is the fact that labor leaders have urged the adoption of unemployment insurance, a shorter working week without reduction of pay, old age pensions, and legislation prohibiting the employment of minors. These and other recommendations are being discussed in responsible quarters, and some of them are gaining supporters, even among employers.</p>
   <p>It is nothing more than what one would expect that these recommendations should be made by prominent labor leaders, such as Green and Morrison, of the American Federation of Labor; Howard, of the International Typographical Union; Berry of the International Printing Pressmen, and others, but that employers and newspapers <pb facs="5423404_1_0755.jpg" n="3"/>supported by them are also wise enough to see their merit is a pleasant discovery and most encouraging. However, we are not deluding ourselves into thinking that they are particularly concerned about the fate of the workers. The main reason for their change of attitude is this: The manufacturers cannot sell their products to the retailers because they, in turn, cannot sell them to the workers, who make up the majority of customers. They cannot buy anything because they have no money to spend. It is, therefore, imperative that they be given employment at good wages. When that happens business can get started again.</p>
