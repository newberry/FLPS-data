   <p>Thomas Lawson, the direst plague of the mighty corporations, has published an article in the November issue of Everybody's Magazine, which would render him liable to a long term in prison if his article were not based on facts.</p>
   <p>In his article, he tells that Senator Clark of Montana paid $10,000 to fifty members of the legislature of the State to influence them to elect him United States Senator from Montana. He also states that Clark was a friend of Heinze, the copper king, and together they worked in opposition to the Standard Oil Company, which was trying to make its influence felt in the State; also that Standard Oil revenged itself on Clark by compelling him, with the aid of the newspapers, to resign as Senator in order to escape a disagreeable investigation. He continues <pb facs="5423404_1_1000.jpg" n="2"/>by stating that Clark, later on, was appointed Senator by the Lieutenant-Governor, during the absence of the Governor from the State and that Standard Oil, by means of threats, prevented him from keeping his seat in the Senate until after the following election, but at this election Clark and Heinze succeeded in beating Standard Oil, and Clark was elected without open bribery. The Standard Oil Company had asked Clark to come to the Company's office where Mr. Rogers told him that either he had to give up the Heinze interests, or else give up his seat in the Senate. At this point, Clark told Rogers to go to Hell, but afterward, said that if Rogers could show a majority of the Senators pledged over their signatures, to refuse him [Clark] seat in the Senate, then would he join hands with Standard Oil Company against Heinze. The article continues that Mr. <pb facs="5423404_1_1001.jpg" n="3"/>Rogers, one week later, showed him a statement signed by two more than a majority of the Senators, declaring readiness on the part of the signers to keep Clark from taking seat in the Senate unless he should separate from Heinze and join the Standard Oil forces. Finally, Clark broke with Heinze, and now holds seat in the highest law making assembly in the country.</p>
   <p>Does this not show clearly that the Standard Oil Company is actually directing the whole of our legislation here in America? And what are we to believe and think of the Senators who signed the paper referred to? We have not forgotten Senators Burton, Mitchell, Heinrichs, and Depew. We have some notion of their whereabouts. But what other "honorable" men in the Senate have joined in this despicable deal?</p>
