   <p>In the columns of this paper, we have frequently pointed out that a large number of the religious leaders oppose the labor movement which they consider a "thorn in the flesh", an evil which ought to be weeded out with the roots. These leaders have been doing their utmost to accomplish the destruction of labor unions, and as a rule their efforts in this respect are suitably rewarded.</p>
   <p>The paper, Catholic News, presents to us with clear proof of this in its report of a telephone conversation between Mr. Pullman and Father McCabe. The conversation ran as follows: Mr. Pullman: "Hello Central! Give me Main 542. Hello! Is this Father McCabe? Good; this is Mr. Pullman of Pullman Packing Company. We are pleased to send you $500 for the new spire on your church Father, for we realize that your church is an important factor in the maintenance of order in this city. I am not a Catholic Father, but I consider the <pb facs="5423404_1_0478.jpg" n="2"/>Catholic Church a strong conservative force in this age of changes.</p>
   <p>"And in connection with this Father, you know that we are employing about two hundred of your church members in our shops. Now recently, some organizers from the Industrial Federation of Labor have sneaked in among our workers. They preach the gospel of dissatisfaction to the workers, and advise them to demand higher wages, and what is worse still, I fear that the new organization is of Socialistic tendencies, or even Anarchistic. I believe that the members of your church ought to be warned from the pulpit against this organization. Not all of our workers are church members, and I have often thought there might be a danger of the workers not in the church contaminating the believers, especially as regards the question of the relations between employer and employees. Why yes, Father McCabe, I certainly do think that these questions ought to be discussed from the pulpit from the conservative point of view of your ancient and deeply respected church."</p>
   <p>In this manner they are won, one after the other,--our spiritual leaders.....Pullman is merely one out of many who bribe the priests and ministers. Pullman donates a new spire to a church; Rockefeller donates a new alter piece; Carnegie <pb facs="5423404_1_0479.jpg" n="3"/>gives a pipe organ; Pierpont Morgan presents money; Wanamaker delivers sermons; Russell Sage is too stingy to give a cent for the advancement of the cause, but he is ever there when harvest time comes around.</p>
