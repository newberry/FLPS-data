  <body>
   <p>Next to the presidential election, the interest of the people of Illinois centers about the choice of a United States Senator from our state. This office is the highest that the state has to offer any of its sons, and it is of the utmost importance that only the highest type of man represent Illinois in the federal Senate. An ordinary, professional politician will not do.</p>
   <p>A man worthy of the office, is our countryman, Peter A. Waller, of Kewanee. He was nominated as the Democratic senatorial candidate at the primary, and is now seeking the support of his fellow citizens at the polls on November 2. This support is certainly deserved in his case, for, contrary to ordinary practice, the man did not seek the office, but the office sought the man.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0903.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That is more than can be said of his Republican opponent, the street railway magnate, William B. McKinley, who for a long time has been eating out of the political meatpots, and who is now trying to climb a step higher on the political ladder.</p>
   <p>Peter A. Waller is a man of wide knowledge, keen intelligence, ability, dependability, and integrity. He has had long and valuable experience as a businessman and industrialist, and he is a friend of the workers. There is no confusion in his mind, and he is broadminded and practical. The fact that he has traveled widely, both in this country and in Europe, is another asset of no small importance.</p>
   <p>On the League of Nations question, his ideas coincide largely with those of Senator Harding. Like many other statesmen, Waller believes that agreements among nations are the logical instruments for the prevention of war and <pb facs="5423404_1_0904.jpg" n="3"/>promotion of world peace. He does not believe that the solution of the world's problems is to be found in the League of Nations under its present setup.</p>
   <p>We endorse Peter A. Waller because we believe that the people of Illinois cannot find a man better fitted to represent them in Washington. At the same time, we admit that we are proud of the fact that he comes from good old Swedish stock, and this is, of course, one reason why citizens of Swedish ancestry should give him their support on election day.</p>
   <p>It is within our power to secure Waller's election. His candidacy has attracted great interest all over the state, and if all Swedish-American voters throw their united weight into the scale we do not believe he can lose.</p>
   <p>A victory for Waller will reflect honor on ourselves, since if he wins he will become the first United States Senator of Swedish birth. The state of <pb facs="5423404_1_0905.jpg" n="4"/>Illinois will have an excellent representative in the upper house of Congress, and the Swedish name will gain in public esteem.</p>
   <p>Therefore, vote for Peter A. Waller next Tuesday. Make a cross in the little square in front of his name in the Democratic column on the ballot, even if you otherwise vote "straight". If we all do this, we shall have done our duty.</p>
