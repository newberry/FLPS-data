<title level="a">OVERPRODUCTION AND LACK OF WORK</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>In employer circles, there is already talk of lack of work during the coming winter. It is being said that the period of idleness to come will have overproduction as its cause. But if we ask about the cause of this overproduction, the answer is that the unions are responsible, with their many strikes and their unreasonable demands for higher pay for the workers.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. E. Clow, treasurer of the Employers' Association, is responsible for this profound piece of reasoning. He goes on to say:</p>
   <p>"Retreat is the watchword of the day. The unions have lost their minds. Even before winter arrives, hundreds of men in every branch of industry will have been discharged. The workers have brought about a state of stagnation in production."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0662.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Thus, it has remained for Mr. Clow to see in strikes and in higher wages for workers, the causes for industrial overproduction. We admit our inability to follow his reasoning.</p>
   <p>For quite some time, we have harbored the idea that when all the workers in a given industry, for one reason or another, cease work, [a period of] stagnation in production ensues within that particular industry.....Consequently, the more strikes [there are], the less danger [there is]of overproduction. It is clear that strikes are not the cause of overproduction, nor will they be responsible for unemployment during the coming winter.</p>
   <p>The assertion that high production costs are the cause of mass discharge of workers is equally childish. Everybody knows that the greater the buying power, the more remote the period of overproduction. The workers, as a rule, do not hoard their money; they spend it--sometimes for luxury articles and for goods that are harmful to the health. But in any case, the high wages flow back into the channels of business and become a part of the commercial life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0663.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The worker is fearful of overproduction, perhaps more so than the employer, since the consequences affect the worker more severely. For this reason, the unions are bent upon shortening the working day; already, the work period in most branches of industry has been reduced to eight hours a day. The employers, on the other hand, have steadily fought this drive for a shorter working day, claiming that the shorter working day would hurt industry and retard the development of the country. The blame for over-production must, therefore, be placed at the door of the big employers.</p>
