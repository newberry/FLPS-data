   <p>Once more a Swede has been killed in one of the many saloons in the city. The crime took place at 55 East Chicago Avenue where George Johnson and William Peterson are conducting a saloon. Last Friday, about noon, Fred Johnson, a laborer, living at 196 Gault Court, went into the saloon in company with a blind man by the name of Borjeson. Johnson ordered a couple of drinks, paying for them. Shortly afterwards, Charles Bowman came into the saloon. He is conducting a one man affair at 85 East Chicago Avenue. A few remarks were exchanged between Fred Johnson and Bowman, whether pleasant or not was not known by the only men who witnessed the crime; namely, one Sam Anderson, and the saloon-keeper, Peter Johnson. Then Bowman pushed at Fred Johnson, and in answer, the latter's fist hit Bowman in the face. The saloonkeeper separated the two men, but Fred Johnson came back at Bowman, threatening to give him a beating. In return, Bowman pulled out his gun and fired two shots at his antagonist. Johnson was hurt, but not fatally, as it seemed at first. Later in the afternoon he was taken to the police hospital where he <pb facs="5423404_1_0218.jpg" n="2"/>died at 8 P. M. the same day. Bowman gave himself up at the East Chicago Avenue police station. At the coroner's inquest on Saturday afternoon, Bowman was ordered held over to the grand jury...</p>
   <p>The murdered man was born in Sweden thirty-one years ago, and at the age of ten years came to Chicago with his parents. He was married and leaves a widow and three children, also his aged mother. His home is at 196 Gault Court. It is said that he was of peaceful nature, never starting trouble. His great fault was his too great love of liquor.</p>
   <p>The man who is accused of the crime is also a man in his best years. In the past he has conducted a saloon business in the same place where he shot Johnson last Friday, but a year ago his license was revoked on account of another murder which took place in his saloon shortly before. The victim at that time was the twenty-three year old Lillian Buttler, who was shot and killed by a Swede, Fred Carlson. Shortly afterwards Bowman had his license renewed, and opened a saloon at 85 Chicago Avenue. It is asserted that <pb facs="5423404_1_0219.jpg" n="3"/>Johnson and Bowman were never on terms of friendship.</p>
   <p>The many liquor stores have made Chicago Avenue a street which is feared and despised by peaceful citizens. The few respectable swedes who are yet conducting business there are most keenly aware of this fact. Many of the houses on the street are now occupied by drunkards, thugs, and other persons of a shady type. They are the living results of the saloons of the street. If the government of our city would revoke some of the liquor licenses issued on the street in question, Chicago Avenue might yet become the type of street which it once was, and not a place to be feared and despised.</p>
