   <p>The Result of the Election of Judges on this coming Monday is at present a topic for interested suppositions. Instead of making the election a confirmation of the principle of non-partisanship where judges are concerned, we are now witnessing attempts at making it a partisan election of the most expreme type. So the outcome of the election will depend upon the extent to which this or that political boss will be able to bring to the polls a sufficient number of bums for the winning of this battle of ballots. Perhaps by a margin of but a few votes.</p>
   <p>Old tried judges who have given their best years in an effort to execute worthily their tasks, and who as a result have won unquestioned respect have been forced once more to play at the election gamble - as a reward for faithful service to the community!</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1043.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Who cares to ask, at the hour when justice in court is at stake, whether the judge be Republican or Democrat? We advise all Scandinavians to vote for all the present Republican judges and all the present Democratic judges who are seeking re-election.</p>
   <p>As to the new candidates, we wish to urge the election of our countryman Carl R. Chindblon of whose excellent qualities many of us have become aware through personal experience. Similarly do we call attention to the Norwegian-American, Oscar M. Torrison who, for a period of years has been judge in the Municipal Court and as such has won undisputed respect.</p>
