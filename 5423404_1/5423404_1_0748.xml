   <p>Few experiences are as depressing as that of meeting a person who wishes to sell his labor, but cannot find a buyer. One would like so much to help him, but is, as a rule, unable to do so. An encouraging word about better times being sure to come may sound well enough, but does not provide the unemployed with a roof over his head and food on his table. A small gift does help some, but only temporarily, and it is not what the unemployed wants. He has the strength and skill necessary to earn his own living, and is both ashamed and resentful when circumstances force him to accept alms.</p>
   <p>The current depression has now lasted for more than one year, and if it follows the pattern of previous periods of stagnation it should now have reached the bottom, and improvement should be in sight. But the unemployed cannot live on hope alone. He and his family have to eat every day, and <pb facs="5423404_1_0749.jpg" n="2"/>they are so much concerned with their present everyday problems that they have little time to think about the future. All this talk about the better times which ordinarily follow a period of depression means little, therefore, to the man who is out of work now and to those that depend on him for their daily bread. But hope may give them strength to continue the struggle and help them keep up their morale. What the worker needs is immediate help, preferably in the form of employment that will enable him to take care of his family, and make him a productive member of society.</p>
   <p>It should be remembered that at least ninety per cent of the needy are men and women whose self-respect suffers when they have to accept charity in any form. These people do not want alms but they do want an opportunity to support themselves, and such an opportunity is now denied them. To thinking people it seems unreasonable that such extensive unemployment is permitted to exist in a country as rich and as great as the United States, particularly when one considers that it is not as densely populated as most countries. Such reflections are of no actual value now, except that they may stimulate <pb facs="5423404_1_0750.jpg" n="3"/>our efforts toward improvement of existing conditions. When the present emergency has been met, it is time to start making plans for the prevention of similar crises in the future.</p>
   <p>Economic experts agree that "good times" cannot be expected to return unless the purchasing power of the masses is increased, but many of them hold that this new purchasing power must come from within the masses themselves. According to them the middle class, and those workers who are employed, must make the money circulate. They seem to forget that these two groups always have to put their money into circulation, and if the country is to wait for them to bring back confidence and a normal market it will wait a long time.</p>
   <p>As we see it, no lasting improvement will occur until the Federal Government and state governments as well as the big corporations recognize their duty to the public and discharge it by undertaking employment on a large scale. The effort of the individual is only as a "drop in the bucket". But signs are appearing which indicate that high authorities are beginning to realize that <pb facs="5423404_1_0751.jpg" n="4"/>drastic measures must be taken in order to curtail unemployment. This realization is coming none too soon.</p>
