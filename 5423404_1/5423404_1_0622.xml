   <p>The truck drivers' strike in Chicago is at end. The workers lost. They not only lost the strike, but most of them lost their jobs, and the few who were able to keep their jobs have lost the right to wear the union button. "To the victors belong the spoils," now as ever, and the victors (the employers) have made the conquered pay heavily for the cost of war. The sign which was the pride of the organized drivers (the union button) has been taken away from them, that is, they are permitted to wear the buttons at home, but not at work.</p>
   <p>One asks, with good reason, what right does the employer have to prevent <pb facs="5423404_1_0623.jpg" n="2"/>the workers from wearing the union button on their coats? The answer is, by the right of the strong; the strong naturally prevails over the weak. Thus, the workers who were beaten in the fight have no just complaints. If they had won, they most certainly would have displayed but faint mercy in their demands for war indemnities. But to the man not involved in the conflict, the methods employed seem objectionable. The spirit of the slave driver, prevailing among the southern plantation owners prior to 1860 is at work among the employers of the present day, and is manifest on every possible occasion. To be sure, at present the issue merely concerns the union button, but who will guarantee that the employers may not soon decree for their workers some nice striped uniforms such as those worn by the prisoners in the jails of the state? The tendency is <pb facs="5423404_1_0624.jpg" n="3"/>the same, the will is there, only the power is lacking to compel the workers to wear the prison clothes.</p>
   <p>The four thousand workers fought long and they fought courageously. But what about the other thirty-four thousand organized drivers in Chicago? Did they do their duty towards their comrades? Were the weekly strike contributions paid regularly? Hardly. "Me today, you tomorrow," the ancient saying has it, and it is rather more than likely that those who forgot their duty during the strike, and who, as a reward for their lack of interest, are still entitled to wear the union button may lose this right in the near future, and then, perhaps, will they remember the words, "what you desire others to do to you, do you the same to them."</p>
