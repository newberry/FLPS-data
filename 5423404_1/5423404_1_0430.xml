   <p>Financial interests in the East are raising a howl of protest <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the proposed appointment of a farmer as a member of the Board of the Federal Reserve Bank. It is claimed that such an appointment would indicate a trend toward class <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and Bolshevism, in spite of the fact that the proposal does not suggest that any particular class be represented. However, under the existing rules it is expressly understood that the Board is to consist of bankors exclusively.</p>
   <p>Experience has shown that the polices of the Bank are not formulated with a view to the interests of agriculture. Its directors are all big bankers, and its credit system is based on short-term credits only, Mostly thirty, sixty, and ninety days. This suits the purposes of business and industry, but is practically useless to farmers and stock breeders, who, as a rule, need credit for from one to three years. It seems clear that this institutions could be of <pb facs="5423404_1_0431.jpg" n="2"/>much greater service if a man with a thorough knowledge of the needs of the farmers were appointed to its Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>The big bankers have always taken it for <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> that their opinions should be decisive in all <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> of this nation's wealth. But the Senate proposal concedes, in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> that those who produce this wealth should also have something to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to be made of it.</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that this <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> addition of one farmer member to the Board, which <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> could not be dominated by him. But he would, at least, be in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> to keep <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> they would have us believe that <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> about to <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> tirely unfounded, and its <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the people. The fact is that if all the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> they could not possibly <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> fiasco out of the reserve bank <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> than has been made of it by the professional <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/></p>
