   <p>Scandinavians in Chicago have supported the Republican Party by voting for it. But their loyalty to the party has not been proportionally appreciated. Comments are unnecessary, however; but the fact remains that the political leaders within the Republican Party ignore the importance of the number of Swedish voters and the service they have rendered.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that the party leaders' ignorance of the importance of Scandinavian votes has kept our countrymen from receiving just rewards for the service they have rendered. This is especially true if we take into consideration that other nationalities with less voting power have been given more and higher political positions. The Republicans have men within the party who can qualify, and who are as able as any, but nevertheless, the Scandinavians should not be denied the patronage of their declared political party. They have built an organization strong enough to elect a Scandinavian Mayor in Chicago. This organization would have no trouble at all in selecting <pb facs="5423404_1_1082.jpg" n="2"/>a candidate of its own choice, one who would gain the support, not only from the Scandinavians, but from a large majority of other voters in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Among the foremost Scandinavians in Chicago is a man who has lived here the past twenty-five years and who has taken an active part in commercial and political affairs and therefore is better qualified than others. This man is Frederic Lundin, the crafty and popular Congressman and Chief of the firm Lundin &amp; Co. As "I will" symbolizes the miraculous growth of Chicago during the past thirty-eight years, so is the "I Will" motto a true expression for Frederic Lundin's character. At ten years of age, only a few months after coming here form Sweden as a poor boy, He began selling newspapers on Chicago's streets to help support his old parents. At the age of twenty he was the manager of a large clothing company, for which he began to work as a messenger boy. At twenty-five he was manager of the firm which bears his name, Lundin &amp; Co., which employs hundreds of workers. At twenty-seven he was elected State Senator of Illinois with a majority of any thousand votes. At forty he was elected congressman with a plurality of 12,000 votes. During the past <pb facs="5423404_1_1083.jpg" n="3"/>fifteen years he was been a member of the Cook County Republican Central Committee. He is known as an untiring worker, a good organizer, with a splendid character, and eloquent speaker, a born leader. After only a few weeks' work as congressman, at a special session he introduced a bill which undoubtedly will become law, dealing with the old age pension problem. This bill was under consideration in the Illinois Legislature. That in brief, is the career of Mr. Lundin, a newspaper boy at ten becoming an industrial leader, congressman and political leader at forty. With these accomplishments as a background and possessing exceptional energy and character, he serves as an example of what a man with ability and character and desire to prove himself worthy can make out of opportunities. Now Lundin's sponsors believe he is the logical candidate for mayor of Chicago in the coming election. They believe in his popularity and vote-getting power. He is of the progressive type, a self-made man, in the prime of his life, a man with a winning personality, with practical and sound ideas.</p>
