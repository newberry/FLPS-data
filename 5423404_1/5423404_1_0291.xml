   <p>We read the following notice in most of the Swedish newspapers sent here to Chicago from Sweden:</p>
   <p>"Don't travel to America! The National Association Against Emigration has asked the Swedish railroads for permission to set up signs at the railroad stations with these words painted on the signs: 'Don't travel to America'."</p>
   <p>We had a good laugh when we read this notice, which we found very silly. The Association, through such foolish action, has given itself a "certificate for poor opinion" showing its impotency to handle the situation! Hasn't everybody the right to use their own judgment in traveling to any place, wherever it is located?</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0292.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But has this incident, we have related, anything to do with the announcement that an invitation will be sent out to the Swedish public at large, both in Sweden and here in America, to sign up for stocks in the propose new Sweden-North America steamship line? Then comes the question: are some of Sweden's most prominent and patriotic men, who perhaps are members of the Association working against this proposed new steamship line? We will now recall how well-grounded we were in one of our latest editorials regarding this proposed enterprise when we cautioned our readers here in America, and particularly in Chicago, not to subscribe for any stocks in the new line until assurance is received from Sweden that this new enterprise is sponsored and made secure by its people, parliament, and government. Therefore, we now warn our countrymen here not to take any action concerning the new proposed steamship line until the Swedish railroads decide upon the Association's request which will probably be according to the directions of the Swedish government and which we have will be "No"!</p>
