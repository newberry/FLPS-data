It is safe to assume that Republican voters will support his candidacy.</p>
   <p>Albert O. Anderson is now serving his second term as alderman of the Thirty-third Ward, and is seeking nomination as the Republican Congressional candidate from the Seventh Illinois District. He was born in Chicago, but received most of his formal education in Sweden. From 1904 to 1911, he was engaged in the banking business in North Dakota, but he later returned to Chicago, and is now in the brokerage business here.</p>
   <p>Anderson has been very popular as an alderman, and has always championed the cause of the less privileged people. He has been especially interested in improving the transportation system in our city. On several occasions, he <pb facs="5423404_1_1070.jpg" n="3"/>has fought alone in the City Council, refusing to compromise when he felt sure that right was on his side. He is highly respected for his integrity. There is general agreement among the voters that he will make an excellent Congressman.</p>
   <p>Daniel Anderson is seeking the Republican nomination for Congressman from the Third District. He is a native of Nebraska, and was born in Wahoo in 1884. After having graduated from high school in that city, he attended the Northwestern University Law School, where he received his Bachelor of Law and Master of Arts degrees. He has practiced law here since 1914, and has a fine reputation both as a lawyer and as a man. He maintains offices at 105 West Monroe Street and at 6000 South Halsted Street. It may be added that he speaks and writes Swedish fluently.</p>
