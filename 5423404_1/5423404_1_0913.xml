   <p>When a public official discharges his duties and conducts himself in such a manner as to win the esteem and confidence of the voters it is only proper that the latter should show their appreciation by re-electing him to the same office, regardless of the political party to which he belongs. But this procedure should, of course, not be followed to such an extreme that the one so honored gets the idea that nobody can take his place.</p>
   <p>Such an official has, during his years of service, gained experience that money cannot buy, and society should benefit by such experience as long as possible, within proper limits, instead of breaking in new and untried men at too short intervals.</p>
   <p>Among the candidates for judges of the state Supreme Court at the coming election <pb facs="5423404_1_0914.jpg" n="2"/>we find our countryman Axel Chytraeus who has been renominated by the Republicans and endorsed by the Prohibitionists. He is an able jurist, highly respected by the public as well as by his colleagues of the bar. He has been a judge since 1898 and certainly deserves the support of all Swedish-American voters.</p>
   <p>County Commissioner Carl R. Chindblom is also a candidate for re-election. He has demonstrated unusual qualifications for this very important position, and enjoys the confidence of both the public and his co-workers. He is a credit to his race, and Swedish-Americans should honor themselves by helping him to win by a large margin.</p>
   <p>Chindblom's colleague, Oscar R. Hillstrom, is younger in terms of service, but he came through the primary with flying colors and his record as a public servant entitles him to re-election.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0915.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>John Kjellander, Chicago's famous City Sealer, is a candidate for Clerk of the Criminal Court. He is just as popular among other nationalities as he is with his own, and has never been involved in any of the scandals which all too often occur in the City Hall. What he now asks of the voters they will surely give him with best wishes, and we don't have to ask the Swedes to do their share.</p>
