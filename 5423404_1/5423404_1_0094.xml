   <p>p.11....The Bethany College Association of Chicago celebrated its third annual Festival last Monday evening, It was held at the Swedish Lutheran Trinity Church in Lake View, before a"full house."</p>
   <p>This was one of it's best Festivals, and, small wonder, when the program included such talent as the soprano singers, the Misses Lillian Forssee and Gertrude Smith, both former teachers at Bethany College; and the celebrated baritone, Mr. Gustaf Holmquist.</p>
   <p>Miss Forssee sang "Summer" by Cecile Chaminade, and Gertrude Smith gave "Villanelle" by Dell Agua. Mr. Holmquist sang "It Is Enough" from Mendelssohn's Elijah, without false praise, it can be said that more glorious baritone voice than his is hard to be found in our great worldncity. Dr. Swensson has made it <pb facs="5423404_1_0095.jpg" n="2"/>his aim to be present at the annual festival of the Association always. He was there present at this time, too, and gave a talk on child-bearing. Other numbers on the program included an organ-solo by Mr. A.O.T. Astenius and a Reading by Miss Phoebe Roberts, who appeared in place of Miss Glenna Smith.</p>
   <p>After the Festival election of officers was held in the basement of the church. Professor C.J.Wilson of North Park College was elected president; Dr. Arvid Pihlblad of the Augustana Hospital was elected Vice-president; Miss Ester Holmquist; secretary, and medical student G. Ellison, treasurer. As Director-members the following were elected: Mrs. Sophie Young and Messrs. G. Nelson, and P.C.Pearson.</p>
   <p>While refreshments were being served a short talk was given by the retiring president, Dr. C.L.Lenard; also by Professor Wilson, Dr. Swensson, and lawyer C.R.Chindolom.</p>
   <p>Some of the young women honored the Association by preparing a fine "coffee-table". The collection which was taken up for the Bethany College Endowment <pb facs="5423404_1_0096.jpg" n="3"/>Fund amounted to thirty dollars.</p>
   <p>It is the aim of the Association to celebrate a private Festival next fall.</p>
