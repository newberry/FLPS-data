   <p>It is well known that most railroad corporations do not think it necessary to show any consideration for the public. They are deaf to criticism, and do not even pay any attention to statements made by the President. At no time in his administration has the President spoken more bluntly than when he declared, in a letter to the secretary of the Federated Shopcrafts of the Jersey Central Railroad, that he failed to see why a minority of the corporations were justified in refusing to make the same work agreements which had been made by the majority of the companies. He even went so far as to blame this minority for the tie-up in coal deliveries which caused so much inconvenience among consumers in many parts of the country.</p>
   <p>In this connection, it is also worth remembering that the Department of Labor, <pb facs="5423404_1_0418.jpg" n="2"/>for which these corporations have no regard, complained that in defiance of our immigration regulations foreigners in great numbers were being smuggled into the country, and put to work on the railroads. At the same time the Bureau of Locomotive Inspection of the Interstate Commerce Commission published date showing that during the period from July 1 to December 31 of last year deaths caused by railroad accidents had increased by 180 per cent, and that of the relatively few locomotives which had been inspected, 4,596 were in such poor condition that they were unfit for safe operation.</p>
   <p>One day last week, a Swede came to the offices of this newspaper and asked our help in filing an application for compensation with the Industrial Commission of this state. He was a locomotive mechanic, and, like his fellow workers, he had ceased working when the corporation which employed them refused to renew its agreement with its employees. This case is only one of many. The corporation in question has not yet made any agreement with its workers. Their union was dissolved, and, like many others, he had to go back to work when <pb facs="5423404_1_0419.jpg" n="3"/>he had spent his savings. When he returned to the shop, he found that most of the machines, because of lack of maintenance, were so run-down that it was dangerous to operate them. And sure enough, after a short time an accident happened as a result of which he lost a finger. He has now been one the sick list for two months. When he sought compensation from the corporation the latter readily acknowledged its responsibility and offered him the sum of twenty-five dollars in complete and final settlement of his claim. It will undoubtedly prefer to spend thousands of dollars fighting a lawsuit rather than to pay the poor man the couple of hundred dollars to which he is entitled.</p>
   <p>For how long are the railroad corporations going to get away with this overbearing attitude toward their workers, the public, the Congress, and the President of the nation? Exactly as long as the workers, the public, the Congress and the President will let them.</p>
