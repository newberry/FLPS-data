   <p>Last Thursday evening, the Scandinavian Club was formed at the University of Chicago. Its purpose is to bring together those professors and students who are especially interested in the Scandinavian peoples and their culture for mutual exchange of views and information, and for further development of these interests.</p>
   <p>Professor Chester N. Gould was elected president of the Club; Florence Heden, vice-president; and Anders M. Myhrman, secretary and treasurer. Professor Gould, who has just returned from a trip to Sweden, gave a very interesting talk on life in that country. He had visited for a considerable time at the University of Uppsala, and it was especially interesting to hear him tell of Swedish university life.</p>

   <p>The Club's next meeting will be held August 15 in Classics 21, and all who are interested are cordially invited to attend.</p>
