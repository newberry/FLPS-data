   <p>In last week's issue of this newspaper, we published an article written by Professor A.A.Stomberg of the University of Minnesota. The Professor discussed the study of the Swedish language in our schools, with particular reference to the University of Minnesota.</p>
   <p>It gave us great pleasure to receive, read, and print this article, for Professor Stomberg is perhaps better qualified than anyone else to speak with authority on the subject.</p>
   <p>His message is of great interest to Swedish-Americans even to those who prefer to remain neutral in regard to the language question.</p>
   <p>Professor Stomberg's statements are of special interest to Swedish-American <pb facs="5423404_1_0112.jpg" n="2"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="[illegible]"/> <pb facs="5423404_1_0113.jpg" n="3"/>be clear to youth of Swedish descent that it is in their own interest to learn the language of their fathers. For most of them it should be easy; they learn the fundamentals at home, and in a very short time they gain a fine command of the language. Many a student, after finishing his linguistic studies, finds that he has made a mistake by neglecting Swedish; but then it is usually too late to do anything about it.</p>
   <p>Professor Stomberg's excellent article performs a double service. In the first place, it delivers a telling blow to "know-nothingism", and secondly, it reminds Swedish-American parents, and youth that in their Swedish language, culture, and tradition they have a valuable heritage which they cannot afford to dissipate.</p>
