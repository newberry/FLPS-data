  <body>
   <p>Our distinguished countryman, Frederick De Lang of Glencoe, has been nominated as the Republican candidate for Congress in the Tenth District.</p>
   <p>Mr. De Lang is a man of culture, erudition, and wide knowledge, who is highly respected by his associates in business and in private life. He believes sincerely in the fundamental soundness of Republican principles, and has made a thorough study of the political problems of our times. His district could hardly find a more worthy man to represent it in Congress.</p>
   <p>He was born in 1854 in Albany, New York of Swedish parents, with whom he moved to Chicago when he was three years old. Here he attended the public schools, and then entered Rush Medical College. After his marriage in 1882 to Serena Lawson, the couple made their home in Lake View, where they lived until 1893 <pb facs="5423404_1_1139.jpg" n="2"/>when they moved to Glencoe, which is located in the center of the Tenth Congressional District.</p>
   <p>While living in Lake View, De Lang was among those who advocated incorporating the town into the city of Chicago, which incorporation later took place. He has been active in Chicago politics, and, associating himself with the leaders within the Republican party, has become very influential.</p>
   <p>De Lang has taken great interest in church and social activities and is a member of many clubs and societies. He belongs to the Congregational Church of Glencoe and served as a trustee for many years.</p>
