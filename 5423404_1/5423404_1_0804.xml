   <p>It can't be worse in Russia than it is here, is the belief of William Bross Lloyd, a capitalist of Evanston, Illinois, the recent candidate for United States Senator of the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>Lloyd, together with George Koop, and his chauffeur, Louis Wade, were arrested Friday, while they were distributing circulars protesting against increased fares on the Elevated lines. Lloyd's automobile was decorated with the Red flag alongside the American flag, and a threatening mob had gathered.</p>
   <p>Saturday, Lloyd, wearing a red neck tie, appeared in court, together with the aforementioned persons, and asked a jury trial, which was deferred until the 11th.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lloyd later on explained that he still adhered to Socialism, and praised the Bolshevik regime in Russia. "One cannot believe everything one hears about <pb facs="5423404_1_0805.jpg" n="2"/>the Bolsheviki," he said. "If conditions continue in this country, as they have for the past two years, I believe I will go to Russia myself. If there is no change, I believe it will be well to get away from this country."</p>
