   <p>Spring is here but it has not been able to chase away the monster of unemployment. There is no noticeable speed-up of building activities, and no general improvement in factory employment. But the season brings with it warmer weather, and the unemployed are beginning to leave the big cities, and the hopeless search for work there, for the country and the smaller communities. The lucky ones find a job here and there, and the surplus of labor in the industrial centers is reduced slightly.</p>
   <p>Better times are bound to come, but not until the time is ripe. Up to now, those who have, or control, capital have not made the slightest effort to improve the situation by creating opportunities for work. The profits of corporations have been used to support the stock market, but not to increase the turnover of goods. The terrific stock market crash did not only paralyze the labor market but seems also to have knocked all optimism out of our business and industrial leaders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0767.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A more optimistic attitude is urgently needed. The capitalists are holding on to their money, and refuse to put it into circulation unless they are sure of making a profit. They are waiting for better times, and do nothing to bring them about.</p>
   <p>But spring has a tendency to induce optimism in us ordinary people, and perhaps we will be able to inspire the big fellows to new and effective efforts to break this homelessness that seems to hold the entire nation in its grip.</p>
   <p>Let all of us get busy with the work which we have planned to have done this spring! It will help some.</p>
   <p>President Hoover and the secretaries of labor and of commerce have done their best to spread encouragement and alleviate fear, by issuing reports on the fundamental soundness of our economic setup, and by calling into conference leading financiers and industrialists in order to make them open up their vaults and get their machines going. There is plenty of money in the country, and interest rates <pb facs="5423404_1_0768.jpg" n="3"/>are low, but capital is unwilling to come out of hiding, and no law can force it to come out.</p>
   <p>But unemployment can, to a great extent, be prevented by legislation, and such legislation must be enacted in the near future in order to avoid a repetition of the crisis through which we are going at the present time.</p>
