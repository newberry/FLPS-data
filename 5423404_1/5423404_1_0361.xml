   <p>During the past few years, America has been visited by an army of Swedish "explorers" of both sexes. These men and women have come from Old Sweden to study the cultural and industrial development in this country, to gather information as to how we Swedish-Americans are situated economically and morally, and afterward, to announce through the Swedish press the results of their investigations for the Swedish people. Every one of these persons has promised faithfully to tell the truth about America, and it is probable that none of them has deliberately broken his or her promise--and yet, it has been broken by all of them.</p>
   <p>In the Swedish press, we read on one occasion the most insane statements about the United States. Voices of warning against emigration to America were heard in this press, and the investigators' stories were filled with untruths. America was painted in the darkest colors; it was described as <pb facs="5423404_1_0362.jpg" n="2"/>the "promised land of scoundrels and criminals," and honest, capable workers were strongly advised not to go to such a bad country.</p>
   <p>The foremost reason for the appearance of these articles in the Swedish papers is probably to be found in the unforgivable ignorance of the writers of the articles as to conditions in the country, the people, and the culture which they are attempting to depict. The instinct of self-preservation will make the Swedish press pleased and grateful on receiving the articles as indicated.</p>
   <p>Some of the contributors to the Swedish press concerning American life and culture have gone to such extremes that it seems almost criminal. These facts do not hurt the Swedish-American greatly, but they serve to wound the relatives and friends left behind at home. For the thoughts of the father and the heart of the mother are ever alive to the vicissitudes of their children.</p>
   <p>One of those who will surely not commit the mistakes mentioned above is the well-known clergyman from Varnhem, Sweden, Reverend David Holmgren, member <pb facs="5423404_1_0363.jpg" n="3"/>of the Swedish parliament, who is visiting America at present for the same purpose of studying conditions in America among Swedish immigrants. In spite of his capacity for making keen observation, and in spite of his will to give a true picture of conditions, Mr. Holmgren is quite unable to get to the bottom of the situation here during the brief time at his disposal. His lecture here in the city last Thursday evening gave clear evidence of the correctness of our statement.</p>
   <p>In this lecture about the causes of the emigration from Sweden, he painted conditions in our old country in the very darkest of colors, and conditions in America, on the other hand, in the most brilliant light. No hope is looming on the horizon of Sweden, according to Mr. Holmgren. There is no salvation for that country. America, on the other hand, is quite the land of the fairy tales, in Mr. Holmgren's view. In other words, the lecturer hit as far above the mark as other Swedish students of Swedish-American conditions have hit below the mark.</p>
   <p>During his lecture, Mr. Holmgren made the following statement: "Sweden cannot <pb facs="5423404_1_0364.jpg" n="4"/>produce enough for her inhabitants. About 1,500,000 of the population are living on a starvation level; 200,000 menservants are paid $30 per year, and in addition 4 barrels of rye, a few quarts of milk, 6 barrels of potatoes, 20 to 30 pounds of pork, and 15 to 20 pounds of herring." We invite the comments of the Swedish press upon the statement quoted.</p>
   <p>The lecturer asserted that there is no over-production in America; that in this country the employer and the employee are on a footing of equality, and that the former is doing everything in his power for his "brother," the worker; that the inmates of the poorhouse in Hennepin county, Minnesota, are getting as good food as is served at the Grand Hotel, in Stockholm, Sweden; that the cost of the daily food portion in the poorhouses here ranges between seventy-five cents and one dollar. These statements are so absurd that there is no need of wasting words in refuting them. Where and how Mr. Holmgren secured the "information" thus presented to the Swedish-American public we do not know, but this we do know: the statements quoted contain more of falsehood than of truth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0365.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We Swedish-Americans may listen to the type of information referred to and regret that an honest man, with sympathy for the poor and needy, should be given such a misleading story of American conditions by some individual having an axe to grind. If the Swedes in Sweden accept the story as God's truth, then that would be unfortunate.</p>
   <p>We respect Mr. Holmgren for his good opinions about our adopted country, but we shall call him to account for the exaggerations made by him here, as well as for such as he may make when he goes back to Sweden to lecture on the "land of gold".</p>
   <p>But we are inclined to think that it was kindness that prompted Mr. Holmgren to leave the shady side of American life untouched in his lecture in Chicago, and we hope that when he lectures in Sweden, he will present both sides of American life, for we do not believe that he would deliberately present a distorted picture of this country to his compatriots in Sweden.</p>
