   <p>From our earliest years, we have been taught to look at the great country of the Czars as the most barbarous country in the world, a land where the government, through its officials and officers, will throw freethinking men and women, who had never been tried in court, into subterranean prisons, there to languish, or send them to work during the rest of their lives in the mines of Siberia. Siberia has been pictured to us as somewhat akin to the Hell that threatens through the dogmas of the church, a place where those "who enter here leave all hope behind."</p>
   <p>Here in the United States; "the land of freedom of thought and speech," we have become so used to dwell upon the woeful fate of the Russians who love liberty that we have forgotten to pay attention to our fellowmen in this country who suffer persecution "for the sake of their faith."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0859.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As far as we are concerned, we gladly permit the various religious sects to carry on their fight for the domain over the sinners, although we have to confess that the means employed by the sects are frequently far from noble. But when the secular powers take a hand in the fight, sentencing to prison members of a certain faith because they consider Saturday a holier day than Sunday, and, therefore, carry on work on the latter day, or when an attempt is made to expel from the Senate a person because he belongs to a sect, the dogmas of which are at variance with such as are generally held, then there is something the matter with our liberty of thought.</p>
   <p>Our reason for comparing the United States with Russia is the brutal manner in which a number of so-called "respectable" citizens of Telluride, Colorado, acted against members of the miners' union there, while the government there took no steps to stop the crimes committed by them. A telegram informs us that on last Tuesday night about one hundred members of the Citizens' Alliance, an organization consisting of mine owners, <pb facs="5423404_1_0860.jpg" n="3"/>manufacturers, and prominent merchants, armed with guns and rifles, broke into homes of peaceful workers, and with cuts and blows compelled fathers of families to accompany them to a waiting express train. Pushed into the coaches of this train, the workers were transported out of the city, having been warned not to return. Most of those who were thus expelled from the city were members of the Miners' Union. Among them, however, were also certain people who had sympathized with the workers, one being A. P. Floaten, an alderman and highly respected merchant. This man had so far forgotten himself as to take a leading part in the campaign of the Socialist party in the city. This was the reason for his expulsion from the city.</p>
   <p>The American press has not found it necessary to raise its voice against this cowardly deed. Let it be supposed, however, that the armed robbers had been members of the miners' union, and that those who were attacked had been "prominent citizens." What would then have happened? The question is easily answered. Governor Peabody, so highly beloved by all the mine <pb facs="5423404_1_0861.jpg" n="4"/>owners, would at once have sent his faithful sabre rattler, General Bell, to the place to take prisoners of war all members of the Miners' Union. The peace-loving press would praise the Governor and his General for having shown such alertness and vigor in a time of danger.</p>
   <p>We are yet leaning upon the oft repeated assurance that we are living in a land of freedom, a land of equality, in a land where all citizens have equal rights and duties. We believe--or at least, we wish to believe--that there are no anarchists in the United States, but if the Government in our country were to investigate the activities of the "prominent citizens" of Telluride, it would find that in that western city a breed of anarchists is being developed of the most sinister kind.</p>
   <p>By the right of physical force and guns one hundred capitalists drove eighty workers out of the city of Telluride in Colorado, simply because the workers dared to utilize the rights which belong to every citizen in this country. Did worse things ever happen in Russia?</p>
