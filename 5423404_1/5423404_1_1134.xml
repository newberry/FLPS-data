   <p>Our popular and able county commissioner, Carl R. Chindblom, is seeking renomination, and should be assured of his countrymen's support at the primary next Thursday. He has conducted himself as an honest and capable public official, and Swedish-Americans, particularly, should show their appreciation at the polls by giving him their support to a man. Naturally, in the execution of his duties, Chindblom has acquired enemies, who now are trying hard to have him removed as county commissioner. If they should succeed it would be an injustice to Chindblom and a loss to the commission and the public.</p>
   <p>Our genial city sealer, John Kjellander, who has won a national reputation in his efforts to protect the public's interests and rights, is seeking nomination <pb facs="5423404_1_1135.jpg" n="2"/>as clerk of the Criminal Court, and he certainly has earned the confidence and support of his countrymen and the general public. His remarkable record as a public official reflects credit not only on the Swedish name but also on the entire city of Chicago.</p>
