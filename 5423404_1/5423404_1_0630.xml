   <p>Judge [Theodore] Brentano came to the aid of Chicago's meat packers a few days ago, by permitting them to defy the order issued by the city authorities in regard to the housing of strikebreakers in buildings within the stock yards.</p>
   <p>On the joint recommendations of the Board of Health and the Building Commission the Mayor ordered the packing companies to cease using their warehouses as sleeping quarters for their employees, on the ground that their health and life were endangered by this practice, particularly because of the fire hazard.</p>
   <p>This order was to go into effect within three days after its issue, and was very embarrassing to the packers, who value the lives of their workers less than those of their cattle.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0631.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In their distress, the company attorneys went to Judge Brentano and asked him to issue an injunction preventing the city from enforcing the order. The judge complied with the request, and the order is now null and void.</p>
   <p>To the layman it would seem that His Honor is prejudiced, but we do not doubt that his ruling is within the law. However, he is taking upon himself a responsibility which no individual has a right, morally or legally, to assume-- the responsibility for the lives of thousands of human beings.</p>
   <p>The Health Department has declared that the buildings lack proper ventilation, and the Building Commission has found that those structures which are being used as sleeping quarters are not equipped with fireproof fire escapes, and neither do they contain the prescribed number of exits, so that if fire should break out the lives of the occupants would be greatly endangered.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0632.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is virtually certain that in case of a fire at night, hundreds, possibly thousands, of people would perish, and if this should happen, who would be responsible? The answer is: Judge Brentano and the packing companies. We will grant that the city authorities have done their duty--partly. It remains for them to force the packers to comply with the law, and make Judge Brentano realize that he has no right to jeopardize the lives of thousands of workers.</p>
   <p>Let the police who are on strike duty enforce the city and state laws.</p>
