   <p>The American people are not without admiration for the Japanese, but they seem to have the characteristics of one's admiration for a little boy whose back one may pat, exclaiming, "what a brave little fellow he is!"</p>
   <p>But now it happens that the Japanese are not in the little fellow class at all. Already he has left his school days behind, and claims to have grown up, perhaps, a full grown man.</p>
   <p>To illustrate this, we will mention a comparison between the Japanese soldiers on one hand, and on the other, the English, French, German, Russian, including, too, the American soldiers, on the occasion of the <pb facs="5423404_1_0367.jpg" n="2"/>march by the allied forces against Pekin for the relief of the legations which were besieged by mobs.</p>
   <p>An American officer, Captain of the Ninth infantry regiment, and a participant in the march against Pekin, speaks as follows of the soldiers of the various nations, who participated in the "military parade": "The Japanese are the best soldiers in this place. They march better, are better able to find food in a foreign land; they maintain their lines of communication and transportation better than any of the powers, our own soldiers not excepted. They make but few comments during their march. As to bravery, the Japanese will compare favorably with the English or the Americans. They have had to stand the hardest attacks during the fights, and under these circumstances they have proved to be of high grade in regard to bravery, ability, and perseverance. I believe that we Americans are as brave as the Japanese, but braver we could not be."</p>
   <p>The opinion thus expressed by an American officer, a man who has seen <pb facs="5423404_1_0368.jpg" n="3"/>service not merely in China, but also in the Philippines and Cuba is fully supported by the correspondents who were present on the various fields of action in the War.</p>
   <p>There has been talk about the "yellow danger," of the final control of Asia by the Mongols, and many have probably drawn the conclusion that China is hibernating, instead of believing that the nation is dead. But the "yellow danger" remains, and if at some future day it were to increase, this would occur whenever Japan takes the initiative, and in addition, Japan would take China under the shadow of its wings. We Americans speak of "America for Americans." The "yellow danger" will perhaps find expression in "Asia for Asiatics," and Japan would be the leader in the movement thus initiated. What would be the result if the four hundred million Chinese trained and lead by the Japanese, who are already up-to-date in every respect, were to call a halt 'to the European invasion? Perhaps the European powers would hesitate before tackling the bear which hitherto they have thought asleep way off in Asia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0369.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>But the Japanese are men, not children of some long past age, as many pretend to believe.</p>
