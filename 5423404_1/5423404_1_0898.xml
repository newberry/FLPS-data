   <p>The coming election in Illinois is of special interest to citizens of Swedish blood, since far-reaching decisions are to be made, and men are to be elected for very important state offices and it behooves all qualified men and women to cast their ballots on Tuesday, November 7th.</p>
   <p>One of the most important offices to be filled is that of state treasurer, an office which should never be intrusted to a professional politician, but to an expert in financial matters, of proven ability and integrity. Oscar Nelson, of Geneva, is such a man, and he is the Republican candidate for the office. He is better qualified than the opposing candidate, and deserves the support of all voters who have the state's best interests at heart.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0899.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of Oscar Nelson it can truly be said that he is the right man for this job. He was born in Geneva, Illinois, of Swedish parents, and is a fine example of a second generation Swedish-American, a man of wide knowledge and sharp intelligence, ability and fairmindedness. He is a friendly man of the people, and is highly esteemed both as a private citizen and as a banker by the people of his home town, who know him best. That he also enjoys the confidence and respect of the business and financial world is indicated by the fact that his candidacy is endorsed by the Illinois bankers' organization.</p>
   <p>It is in the voters' own interests to elect Mr. Nelson state treasurer. He is a recognized expert in money matters, and this cannot be said about his Democratic opponent. One may rest assured that he will discharge his duties in office in the best interests of the people of Illinois, and in a manner that will reflect honor, not only on himself and his state, but also on the nationality from which he sprang.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us all cast our votes for him on November 7th.</p>
