   <p>Frederick Lundin, our prominent countryman in Moreland and the Republican candidate for alderman for the 26th Ward, is a young industrious business man, respected and honored for his honest and his sincere manners. Moreland should be proud if it could be represented in the City Council by such a man as Lundin.</p>
   <p>He came from Sweden to this country with his parents when he was a child. He began his early life as an errand boy and is now a useful business man. Lundin rejected the candidacy for a long time but finally consented to accept it, when he was told that Moreland ought to be represented by a man who both would and could make his voice heard in the Council.</p>
   <p>Lundin's rival is a grocery merchant, T. Soyle, who said last spring at a meeting at the Sherman House, among other things, "Let us lay the Swedes beneath the table."</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0935.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We Swedes will answer by placing our countryman, Lundin, at the table and Soyle beneath it.</p>
