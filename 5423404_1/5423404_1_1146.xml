<title level="a">SWEDISH CANDIDATE FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT JUDGESHIP</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>An election of great importance to everybody in Cook County will take place next June 7. On that date fourteen judges of the Circuit Court are to be elected for a term of six years. There are altogether forty-two candidates, of which fourteen are Republicans, fourteen Democrats and fourteen Socialists, and it is our task to pick those that are most competent, honest and otherwise desirable.</p>
   <p>Among the forty-two candidates there is only one Swedish-American, namely, Attorney Edwin A. Olson, and he is on the Republican ticket. He won the nomination with a large majority, and it is now up to us to see that he is elected. There are many reasons why we Swedish-Americans should vote for Mr. Olson, and no reason whatsoever why we should not. He is an able jurist and will add to the prestige of the court.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>His career has been one of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Illinois, in <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> school in his home town, and then the Elliot <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> came to Chicago penniless but <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson is an attorney for the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> Life Insurance Company, the largest of all other Swedish-American business organizations, and for the Swedish Chicago Cemetery Association, and for several other large corporations. In addition, he has a considerable general law practice.</p>
   <p>He has been very active in welfare work among our countrymen, particularly as a member of the Board of Directors of the Englewood Hospital and as vice president of the Swedish Old People's Home Society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1148.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He also presided over the committee which recently, during one week of campaigning, raised ten thousand dollars for the new home in Evanston, of which he is a director.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson also served a term as president of the Swedish Republican League of Illinois.</p>
   <p>It would be truly regrettable if we pass up this opportunity to elect such an able and representative Swedish-American to the Circuit Court. There-fore, countrymen, let us all go to the polls on election day and, in the Republican column of the ballot, place our mark in front of the name of Edwin A. Olson.</p>
