   <p>The City Council's decision of last week giving the Telephone Company the franchise it asked, is so unbelievable that many Chicagoans have awakened and are up in arms against the city aldermen, who apparently sold their honor and otherwise acted like anything but honest men.</p>
   <p>A large number of organizations have protested against this unfair transaction. People in all walks of life have voiced their opinion against the scandal. But what difference does it make? Now that the Gas Company's deal has been put over, the City Council have shown themselves as a bunch of roundheads with strong bulldog tactics.</p>
   <p>Now the Aldermen have submitted this unfair deal to the Mayor's approval in the hope he will let the contract go through. If the Mayor vetoes this ordinance, then, like in the Gas Company case, its passage will require a two-third majority vote. It may be said in Mayor Dunne's honor, that he never gave his consent to shady transactions. We will now see what Mayor Busse will do. Should he <pb facs="5423404_1_1046.jpg" n="2"/>sanction this transaction without any modifications he will be blamed as being the same as the black-spotted thieving animals. As it looks, the Chicago Council has started a career which will put Philadelphia, New york, and San Francisco in the shade. Does there exist a City Council like Chicago's? </p>
