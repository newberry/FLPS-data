   <p>Hard times and soup kitchens are with us again. Each day during the past few months has brought us news of closed factories and reduced wages for the workers. In spite of the stubborn insistence in some quarters that good times are still with us, the misery of hard times and soup kitchens are closing in about us. This sinister fact cannot be hidden, not even by those papers which so willingly close their eyes to the depressing facts of our social life.</p>
   <p>Our daily papers are beginning to publish stories of the situation, quite akin to the tales from ancient Rome. The hungry masses are crying for bread, and the politicians are competing in their show of benevolence. Just to give an example:</p>
   <p>Alderman Michael Mullen of Ward Eight last Wednesday morning established <pb facs="5423404_1_0795.jpg" n="2"/>a free soup kitchen at 435 East Front Street. Immediately the place was crowded with a throng of hungry people who, however, soon went away carrying baskets with bread and cans filled with coffee and soup.</p>
   <p>The condition of the unemployed has become so alarming and the number of petty thieves so large that the machinery of law, usually so hardhearted when the question of punishment for petty offenders is concerned, has stalled. In our police courts we have witnessed such remarkable incidents as to hear policemen ask lenience from the courts for the accused who stole to satisfy his hunger.</p>
   <p>Here is a scene at court: A man accused of having stolen a loaf of bread is before the judge. The arresting policeman is the chief witness. But what do we hear? The policeman forgets that he is the accuser.....This is what he says: "Your Honor, in the rooms below, there are in the neighborhood of two hundred people who are starving. This man, Jones, is a worker, not a thief. He was to divide what he stole with the others. I arrested him to prevent him from committing some worse offense such as <pb facs="5423404_1_0796.jpg" n="3"/>robbery. For the same reason I also arrested his associates in stealing. About 3 A.M. they are accustomed to go out to get hold of something edible. A side of pork was taken last Monday, and the butcher told me not to hunt for it. "God knows that they needed it," he said. In a number of the rooming houses there are people who neither have a cent, or anything to eat."</p>
   <p>And how did the judge answer the policeman's appeal for mercy for the offender? The judge is not a minister or a priest. Perhaps he is not even a member of any church. He is a politician. Perhaps many of those he sends to prison are better people than he. Yet, after all, the judge is not heartless, and his reaction to the appeal of the policeman was expressed as follows: "To steal a loaf of bread under such circumstances is no crime."</p>
   <p>And now, hear the words of a clergyman who made a visit to the soup kitchen: "This is a sad lineup! All my life I have studied the problem of human misery, and I am not any closer to the solution of it than when I started. I suppose that as soon as these people have consumed their piece of bread soaked in syrup, they will be perfectly content with their existence and <pb facs="5423404_1_0797.jpg" n="4"/>will not consent to work till they are driven to it by hunger."</p>
   <p>Is that a clergyman speaking? Seated in a comfortable study he has tried, all his life, to solve the problem about which he now utters his pronouncement, and from the profundity of his study and meditation, he has arrived at the conclusion that laziness is the cause of poverty. Oh, what blind leaders of blind people!</p>
   <p>Dear and Reverend Mr. Clergyman: Put aside your phrases about the Fall of Adam and about the Blood of Christ, and try instead to find the reason why there is so much unemployment in our age. Try to solve this problem in a manner worthy of a wide-awake human being and a clergyman.</p>
