   <p>The only place where true religion can be taught is in the home. The best, if not the only place in the world where true respect for religion can be instilled is the home. If children are not taught religion in the home, they may perhaps, never absorb it. In saying this, we do not refer to religious forms and opinion, but to real religion. We are not unaware of the fact that children in Sunday Schools may learn by heart large portions of the Bible, and become familiar <pb facs="5423404_1_0278.jpg" n="2"/>with the great deeds of Moses, and with the sins of David. But this is not religion. It is not even closely related to religion.</p>
   <p>We also know that visitors at church may be taught to sing religious hymns, may listen to beautiful prayers, may participate in the ceremonies, read the scriptures, etc. The churches are performing their duties in these matters, but this is not what we call religious upbringing.</p>
   <p>To mould the character; to elevate the moral level and strengthen the moral fibre; to develop the soul, must, for the main part, be taken care of in the home. The teachings of the average Sunday <pb facs="5423404_1_0279.jpg" n="3"/>School do not create the higher moral principles in the scholars, but the religious impressions received by children in their home will usually remain with them throughout their home will usually remain with them throughout their lives.</p>
   <p>It is found occasionally, of course, that children, brought up in so-called non-religious homes, may become church members at some later period in their lives. They may never have seen religious formalities observed in their homes; their parents may never have gone to church; they may even be brought to believe that their parents were but little better than heathens; none the less it will be found, on investigation, that their basic conception <pb facs="5423404_1_0280.jpg" n="4"/>of God and of righteousness; their attitude towards life and death, may be traced back to teachings during infant years - teachings by fathers and mothers.</p>
   <p>If a child is ever to underst and the full significance of those words, "God is the father of all mankind and we are, all of us, sisters and brothers, and consequently equal," they must be exemplified in the home life. If the father and mother do not practice this in their daily lives, if a child is brought up to believe that certain persons are to be despised, others kept at a distance, and others feared, not all the churches and Sunday Schools in the world will be able to change this conviction, absorbed during earliest childhood.</p>
