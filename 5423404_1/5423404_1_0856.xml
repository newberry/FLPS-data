   <p>A Swedish lecturer has gone up and down the land denouncing the American way of selecting the head of the nation, saying that the last presidential election cost over $25,000,000, which is more than the King costs Sweden in a hundred years. Jamestown, N. Y., the only city in America almost completely populated by Swedes, was the last stop in the lecturer's tour.</p>
   <p>A Swedish-American paper, Vartland, has come out in defense of the cost of elections stating that the expense is not born by the taxpayers but by friends of the presidential candidates, who pay the costs of the presidential campaign.</p>
   <p>Svenska Nyheter holds up Vartland's argument to ridicule and, in an editorial, raises the question of why the rich friend, big business and <pb facs="5423404_1_0857.jpg" n="2"/>corporations contribute to a candidate's campaign expenses. Is it not in order to get returns from the president when elected? And after the election, do not these rich people rake in again, from workers and customers, the money spent in contributions? And again, does not the money spent at election demoralize thousands; and does not Vartland, which is at home in the Scriptures, know that such corruption involves the "loss of the soul"?</p>
   <p>The editorial asks Vartland for further explanation and is impatiently waiting to learn the truth.</p>
