   <p>A new researcher in history.... has arisen among our people in Chicago. His name is Louis G. Northland.</p>
   <p>In the issue for December of The World Today, he has written an article about the Swedish-Americans, and the article contains clear evidence of the author's eminent ability as a writer as well as his impartiality of mind and his love of truth.</p>
   <p>This reporter of past events first of all brings us the consolation that fifty years hence the Swedish language, whether written or spoken, will <pb facs="5423404_1_0318.jpg" n="2"/>have disappeared from the land, also that everything genuinely Swedish will disappear and be devoured by Americanism, even as he himself has become so Americanized that no trace is to be found in him of old time Swedish straight-forwardness and honesty.</p>
   <p>Whether from ignorance or ill will, he has, in his account of leading Swedish papers in Chicago, excluded two; one of these is the Svenska Nyheter, the most widely read Swedish paper in Chicago. The reason we can imagine. We know the business methods of the fellow, and we have never considered it suitable to ..... pay him money in order to be mentioned in his writings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0319.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Probably for the same reason he is proudly passed by the admittedly greatest Swedish born marine painter in this our adopted land, Charles Hallberg. But we are unable to understand why he has excluded from the rank of our Swedish-American authors such writers as Carl Fredrik Peterson, Geedmund Akermark, Custaf Wicklund, Ville Akerberg, Ernst Lindblom, and others, and instead entered in the ranks the names of Hjalmar Nilsson, Signe Ankerfelt, Aron Edstrom, Therese Linder, Mauritz Stolpe, Edward Sundell, and others. Perhaps he knows who is more willing to pay the most to have his name in a publication. It has been part of this new history writer's routine to assess for contributions, even the charitable institutions which applied to him for mention in the daily press in connection with some social or other affair arranged by them. At the time, he was a reporter paid by the newspaper for which he was working. This, however, did not prevent him from <pb facs="5423404_1_0320.jpg" n="4"/>collecting from $25 up from the committees on arrangements. Finally, people became tired of his business methods, and reported the matter to the paper which employed him, with the result that he was kicked out, as the saying goes.</p>
   <p>How much he has received from each of the sixteen Swedish-American papers which through his mediation, had their names published in the magazine we do not know, and besides, it does not matter to us at all. But we think it our duty to protest against the underhanded methods applied by this mean dealer in historical data, against such as are too honest and honorable to buy for themselves mention in a paper.</p>
