   <p>Swan P. Norman, president of the 12th Ward Republican Club, has been elected as delegate from the 4th congressional district to the Republican National convention. He has been and is now an energetic Republican, and has for several years been employed by the County. At present, he is a Cook County assessor and has held this position since 1899.</p>
   <p>Mr. Norman was born in Kristianstad, Sweden forty-eight years ago, and came to Chicago in 1882. He operated as Building contractor for many years on the West side, where he built hundreds of buildings, some of them quite large. The National Malleable Casting Company is also one of his establishments, <pb facs="5423404_1_0982.jpg" n="2"/>and also the Illinois Moulding Company. He is an ardent member of several Swedish societies and interests himself in their accomplishments for the sake of patriotism.</p>
