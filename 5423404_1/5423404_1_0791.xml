   <p>We want to express a warning to our compatriots, both men and women with reference to various employment bureaus in Chicago. The Swedes have a well organized, free employment bureau, the one conducted by the Swedish National Association. This bureau is conducted carefully and conscientiously. But there are hundreds of other bureaus in the city conducted by untrained and conscienceless scoundrels, who are in the business purely for the purpose of getting money from the people applying for work. The bureaus in question fleece from the poor applicant two or three dollars (which the latter, as likely as not, has borrowed from some friend) and once having paid the required fee, the applicant is made to wait many days without getting a job. At length, he may be sent, perhaps to the south, somewhere, to work in mines, or <pb facs="5423404_1_0792.jpg" n="2"/>out west, there to labor in the forests, or in the mines.</p>
   <p>A while ago, a young, strong and virile Swede came to America. In Sweden, he had wife and a child, and it was his intention to send for them as soon as he could save enough money for the purpose. On coming to America, he had merely a couple of dollars left. These he paid to one of the exploiter-conducted employment bureaus, and was promised a job in the south at three dollars per day. Arriving at his place of work, he found that it was a mine. He was made to labor deep down in the mine, and his pay was one dollar per day, out of which he had to pay five dollars per week for board and lodging. Of course, this was a deep disappointment to him, but all he could do was to remain and work till he could save enough money for a ticket to Chicago. A few days after he had started work, he was hurt in the mine, and taken to a hospital. He is now a cripple for life, and will probably become blind.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0793.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We could mention several other cases; especially could we tell of Swedish girls who, in the most heartless manner, are being cheated and ruined. It makes us "boiling mad" to think of such depravity, and often we wonder why God should have made us Swedes so soft and credulous, not to say simple-minded, in regard to matters of business. All this paper can do is to issue warnings to our countrymen, and to un-mask the rascals who prey on them.</p>
