   <p>There has been written a great deal about the Yellow Peril since the Japanese fought the Russians a couple of years ago. And those who see far into the future have reached the conclusion that with industries and their management as well as with wars, Japan will beseige the whole world. As we think what the future will bring forth in this respect, we look with a Christian eye at the handling of this situation. We believe that by so doing we have performed a Christian service that no one can take offense at. Now lets get to the facts. That the Japanese have already started contacting business of various kinds here in our large city of Chicago. They have reached into the working girls domain already. It is said that large numbers of Japanese have for a long time been coming to America's metropolis and getting stronger every day. And as soon as the Japanese land in Chicago they find hundreds of women with both arms outstretched as a welcome, they take them home in a hurry and show him the kitchen, the whole palace or the flat and then say to them. All of this I will turn over to you and your honesty if you will, that is you will be my Butler and not run away from me just because we have some little misunderstanding. For <pb facs="5423404_1_0304.jpg" n="2"/>example if you run out nights, or if the cooking utensils were not kept clean, or the food was too salty or too sweet, or too sour, or a hundred other things that you will manage, it will be my duty to school you, to correct you, and to read the law to you. But you see that is as it should be. So such trivial matters you should not worry yourself about. The good Jap stands like a living question mark. He understands little or nothing of all these questions which have been brought up, therefore he says yes, yes, and yes until he can taste it with his tongue, and bows his well meaning. And therewith he is taken in, when he is clipped and bathed and taken to the maid. After he has his bearings he runs up and down and around on all his duties, quiet and obedient as a cat without a question or a complaint about the work. So we say here about this question when the working girls are considered it will not be girls but the Japanese. This hard fact must be met; sit tight with patience and become lords on the question of working girls as maids.</p>
