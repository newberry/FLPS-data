   <p>Four years ago, when it was revealed that our countryman, Judge Harry Olson, had been persuaded to seek the mayoralty, we warned him that he was making a great mistake, and we cited for his benefit the Biblical proverb: "When rogues tempt, follow not," it proved to be applicable.</p>
   <p>To Judge Olson's services as a jurist we did the greatest justice, and we predicted a still brighter future on this pathway for him, if he refrained from political intrigues.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1107.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every one makes mistakes. Judge Olson is still a comparatively young man. He was, naturally, still younger four years ago, and his mistake can be considered forgivable. Now, one cannot excuse him on this account. He stands in full consciousness, under exactly the same circumstances.</p>
   <p>Mr. Victor Lawson, owner and publisher of The Daily News, who makes pretentions to a kind of "over-electorship" within the Republican party in Chicago, although he is said to be a Democrat, has given Judge Olson the call to the mayoralty, again this time as he did four years ago. Lawson has ordered the Republican bosses, who obey <pb facs="5423404_1_1108.jpg" n="3"/>his slightest wink, to gather around Olson, and lead their political adherents to the polls to vote for the Judge in the primaries.</p>
   <p>However, the question of whether The Daily News will stand by Olson until the primary election is an open question. One recalls the same newspaper's call to Congressman Foss to seek the senatorship last fall, and how the Daily News forsook Foss a few weeks before the primary asking him to withdraw in favor of McCormick. It is not impossible that history will repeat itself.</p>
   <p>Already one may doubt, whether, the two political bosses, Deneen and Brundage, are honest in their assurances that they aim to work for <pb facs="5423404_1_1109.jpg" n="4"/>Olson's nomination. But their henchmen do not appear to have any warm admiration for his person, or his qualifications.</p>
   <p>Last Monday Judge Olson opened his campaign in the Second Ward, the so called "black belt," and ex-Governor Deneen was there to "stand sponsor."</p>
   <p>He appeared still to be averse to "answer for the child." He spoke most unimpressively about his candicacy for Mayor, and his qualifications for this office, but tried to win his listeners through loose talk about national policies, and the presidential election in 1920. Even the credulous descendents of the African wilds sat and gaped when he said <pb facs="5423404_1_1110.jpg" n="5"/>that the future of the Republic depended on the outcome of the mayoralty election in Chicago, April 1, 1919.</p>
   <p>What Brundage has in mind in supporting Judge Olson's candidacy, we do not know. All we have heard is that Mr. Brundage was ill, and allowed himself to be represented by another at the great "fraternalizing festival," when all orthodox Republicans, who could find the space in the little dining room at the Hotel Morrison, came together, before the whole world, proclaimed their acceptance of Judge Olson's candidacy for mayor.</p>
   <p>We regret that Judge Olson has permitted himself to be persuaded to make the same mistake a second time. His defeat this time will hurt his <pb facs="5423404_1_1111.jpg" n="6"/>reputation and spoil his prospects for further success on the course he himself has chosen, and to which he has been called by the people's vote.</p>
   <p>He has, in the meantime, only himself to blame, and cannot hope for any consideration or commiseration from us.</p>
