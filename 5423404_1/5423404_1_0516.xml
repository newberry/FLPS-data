   <p>p.6..........It is a known fact that petroleum has really been found in Northeastern Texas, and the discovery will certainly be in time, an enrichment for the state as well as for the individuals or companies, who give time, trouble, and money to this useful pursuit.</p>
   <p>But even another class of people have understood how to "earn money," on the discovery, and of these the great public should beware. This class is made up of so-called "promoters," who, through buying or in some other way have secured for themselves a few acres of land, under which it is claimed that great reserves of petroleum are to be found. The exploitation of this wealth they are not selfish enough to reserve for themselves, but will permit a larger or smaller circle of their fellow-men to share in it through the "purchase" of shares in the enterprises.</p>
   <p>Among these "companies" a number appear already to have done a shining business, <pb facs="5423404_1_0517.jpg" n="2"/>through the sale of stocks, even before they have begun to drill for the supposed oil. Others have made trial-drills without finding oil but by the sale of a few hundred thousand shares "at ten cents on the dollar" of the market par-value,the Messrs promoters have just as fully reached their goal. Ten cents for a share, which "among brothers are worth a dollar," appears surely to be a pretty low price, but to be able to sell shares it is necessary to offer them cheaply, and 100,000 shares at ten cents each cost, of course, little more but bring in exactly as much as 10,000 shares at one-hundred cents each. Many among those who buy such shares know themselves, that no oil will be found but hope that in time they will be able to resell the shares bought all these help, therefore, to swell businesses, and all appear to be satisfied and happy - except the lost owners of the shares, who, after they have found there expectations mocked feel themselves just as much lost as the market-players in New York, who at the recent catastrophe there had the misfortune of finding themselves on the wrong side.</p>
   <p>Our intention is, in the meantime, not to dissuade from all buying of shares in Texas oil firms, when, of course, sometimes such firms may be founded on good suppositions, and only need capital to become profitable. But none should, according <pb facs="5423404_1_0518.jpg" n="3"/>to our viewpoint, lay down his money in such enterprises before he himself has, with the aid of really versed persons carefully tested their standing and their prospects for success. The exportation for the utmost caution in this matter is necessary, since the every day experience shows that the great majority, all too easily, allow themselves to be fooled by the prospect of extraordinary profits, when, in addition, from the world-city, Chicago, thousands of dollars stream to an "underhanded prophet's" treasury-chest, it is no wonder the more honest and trusting citizens in the country permit themselves to be fooled by such promises, which are given them by the Messrs. promoters - often as the only reward for their money.</p>
