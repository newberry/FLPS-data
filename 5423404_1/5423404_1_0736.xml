   <p>The many predictions that the bad times would improve during the summer are not being fulfilled. Half of the summer has already passed, and the employment situation in Chicago and throughout the country has not noticeably changed. It is really alarming, and it is the duty of our authorities to take measures that will provide work for at least some of the thousands who are suffering under enforced idleness. There has been much talk of starting extensive public works, and one wonders why it is not being done.</p>
   <p>The transportation system here in Chicago is bad, worse than in most other large cities. But a so-called traction fund, amounting to sixty million dollars, is available, and it would cover part of the cost of construction of a subway, a project to which the voters have already given their consent, and which would provide work for a large number of men. What are we waiting for?</p>
