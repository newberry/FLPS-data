   <p>p.6.............Mayor Harrison appears to have tired of posing as a special guard of the community's interests as regards to the street-railways company, and has taken a rest. It was perhaps only a role which he had studied for campaign purposes.</p>
   <p>Many besides ourselves,have assumed this to be the case, and the assumption has become strengthened of late.</p>
   <p>The committee which worked on the traction issue before has put out a rather comprehensive report on the question, both as regards Chicago and other cities, but that in itself does not,of course, solve the problem.</p>
   <p>The mayor motivated his negligence with the statement that there is time enough to handle the traction question when the companies make application for new <pb facs="5423404_1_1055.jpg" n="2"/>charters. Later Harrison signified that he does not at all intend to name any commission for the handling of this affair, and it was his friends in the legal department who made a last attempt to save the traction commission from being put on the shelf.</p>
   <p>What can be Harrison's meaning? In the first place to let the traction companies take the initiative and dictate terms for the new concessions. A privilege which the city on no account should give up. In the second place Harrison wants, clearly, to have absolute freedom when it comes to dealing with the companies. He will undertake the negotiations; and we doubt not for a moment that the companies will find it much easier to come to terms with one man than with a number of men. Perhaps it also will be cheaper for them.</p>
   <p>After four years of effort to settle the traction question to the satisfaction of the community, Harrison has now come so far (1) that the companies and not <pb facs="5423404_1_1056.jpg" n="3"/>the city administration will propose the terms in the new charters, (2) that Harrison himself will negotiate with the companies. Under such circumstances the peoples' rights are, of course, not very secure.</p>
