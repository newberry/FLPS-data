   <p>Chicagoan praises Sweden and Norway: A political meeting was held last Friday evening at the Scandia Hall to promote the candidacy of Elmer Washburn. One of the speakers was Melville E. Stone, who enjoys the reputation of being a highly educated and a widely travelled man. He has visited Sweden and Norway, and has nothing but praise for these Northern countries. In making comparisons between the social conditions in the capitals of these two countries and his own home town, Chicago, he admitted that he had no reason to glory in the fact of being a Chicagoan. In particular his comparisons applied to the different street-cleaning systems used in Chicago and in Stockholm, which latter city he referred to as "the Venice of Norway". From this remark, it appears that Mr. Stone, like the majority if Americans, possesses a very limited knowledge of goography.</p>
