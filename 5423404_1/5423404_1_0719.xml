  <body>
   <p>A couple of weeks ago we commented on the co-operative building activities in Boston, which may be considered the first venture of this kind of any consequence in the country. But the idea is spreading and we are glad to report that it has now been taken up in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Unions of the building trades here are making plans for the building of thousands of homes for their members, and the work would, of course, be done by the members themselves. For some time, a committee has been working out preliminary plans. It seems quite likely that these plans will materialize, and if they do, workers will invest their savings in the undertaking, which is based on the principles of co-operation. One immediate result would be the employment of thousands of men who are now out of work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0720.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is considered a sound policy for the workers to withdraw their money from the banks and use it in enterprises which offer them advantages. The Citizens Committee and other capitalistic organizations are now using this money to force the construction workers to submit to the decree of Judge Landis.</p>
