   <p>p.11...............Our countryman, Julius Johnson, is a candidate for the Republican nomination for State Auditor in Illinois. He was born in Lynn, Henry County, Illinois, April 18, 1871 of Swedish parents, who was among the first settlers on the Illinois praries. While attending public school he worked on the farm, later he prepared himself for a business life by studying at Augustana College, Rock Island. Mr. Johnson was for a while engaged in newspaper work, later being connected with industrial affairs in Moline, Illinois. Already, before becoming "of age," Mr. Johnson took a lively interest in politics, and during the last twenty years he has been very active within the Republican Party in Western Illinois, although he never before aspired to any position on the ballot. From time to time he has occupied responsible positions with the Secretary of State, and the State Treasurer, in the Insurance Department, and other State Offices, <pb facs="5423404_1_1114.jpg" n="2"/>and is particularly well equipped for the office he seeks, viz: Auditor of Public Accounts. Julius Johnson lives in Moline, Rock Island County, where the Republican Convention unanimously endorsed his candidacy April 17, 1916.</p>
   <p>Swedish-American Republican State League unanimously also endorsed Mr. Johnson at its last convention held at Princeton, March 9, 1916, where 443 delegates were present, representing more than 80,000 Swedish-American Republicans in Illinois. Mr. Johnson has found strong support for his nomination and his chances of victory are very good.</p>
   <p>The Primary Election will be held Wednesday September 13, 1916. Don't forget to cast your vote for Julius Johnson for Auditor of Public Accounts.</p>
