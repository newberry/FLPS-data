   <p>During the recent tariff debate in Washington, it was clearly brought out how certain business practices of corporations and large industrial concerns are detrimental to the small consumers. In the end the small consumers are the ones who are forced to carry the heavy burdens and pay every tax that is being assessed. They are practically helpless, since they are not organized and cannot protect their own interests.</p>
   <p>The president of the United Mine Workers recently issued a statement in which he denounced the business methods of the coal barons, and he had good reasons for doing so. He declared that railroad companies and corporations are permitted to purchase their coal at unreasonably low prices, which sometimes do not even cover the cost of production, and since the mine owners cannot make any money on these big customers they have to take their profits out of the hides of the smaller consumers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0453.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We realize that competition is keen, and that the big consumers are entitled to a certain reduction, but the poor man who can hardly afford to heat his flat, should not be left holding the bag.</p>
   <p>It is a common saying that "business is business," and this phrase has become an alibi for practices which do not comply with the best standards of fair dealing and business ethics.</p>
