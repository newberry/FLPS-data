   <p>Last week several thousand marble workers were locked out because, so it was claimed, they had broken the contract they had entered into with their employers. This has provided a number of reactionary papers with the opportunity to condemn all labor organizations as well as the labor movement as a whole. One case of breach of contract is made the point of departure for hateful attacks against the whole labor movement, which, in the opinion of these papers, is composed entirely of breakers of oaths and promises. If 999 out of a 1,000 contracts between employers and employees are kept sacred by the latter, no mention is made of the fact, but when the one-in-a-thousand case occurs--when the organized workers break a contract which has perhaps been broken a thousand times by the employers in the course of the year--then all the sluices of hate are opened,...and a flood of foul, lying statements bursts forth over organized labor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0667.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are not at all the friends of those who break their promises or contracts, but before we pass judgment we desire to see whether there are any mitigating circumstances. In our investigations we have almost invariably found that in the cases where the workers have broken their contracts, their action has been preceded by breach of contract on the part of the employers. But the acts of the latter have never been criticized by the reactionary press. Breach of contract by the employers is not noticed so much by outsiders as is a similar offense by employees. The employer works quietly,....offering steady employment to each and every individual if he is willing to work for lower wages. Many workers who do not possess true class consciousness agree to this proposal, and thus the contract which the individual employer had entered upon with the labor union is broken. If the union delegate now learns of the matter, he will demand of the employer that he pay his workers according to the agreed scale. The employer feels strong enough to defy the union,....and, believing that his workers will stand by him, he declines to be "ordered around". The leaders of the union then call a strike, and the reactionary press starts to howl about breach of contract.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0668.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is a fact, however, that contracts between employers and labor unions are broken more frequently by the former than by the latter.</p>
