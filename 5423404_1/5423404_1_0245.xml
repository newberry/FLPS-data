<title level="a">SUNDAY CLOSING QUESTION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>We doubt the reader is well aware here in Chicago that for some time the Sunday closing law has not been enforced by the present strong party. It is naturally the closing of the saloons that we refer to. New laws are not necessary but enforcement of the present law, which clearly enough requires Sunday closing. Just how great an effort not to enforce the law is exerted by the political party in power is hard to say. You are aware that among the large cities, Chicago can show larger accomplishments than any other. But the people themselves in the city undermine the law, shall we therefore draw a conclusion that the element of the city people that are against the saloon closing on Sunday are so easy going that they will not take notice of the happenings. In the meantime Mayor Dunne makes the statement that he will not particularly enforce the Sunday closing law, naturally he means the majority do not want it done. The matter of enforced or not-enforced laws apparently does not seem as important to the mayor as they do to most of the people. Are we then to understand that if a law hinders us from doing what we consider our right to do then our personal freedom is at stake. Does the mayor mean that such laws are unjust?</p>

   <p>It seems as if it were a question of the many against the individual, and if the latter is allowed to follow his own inclination he will hurt himself in one way or the other. The community must govern over the individual and therefore often the best individuals are sacrificed for the good of the community. Seemingly what happens to the drinker is that by the life he lives he only harms himself, therefore it should be only his own affair.</p>
   <p>However, many are interested in what the individual does, if he harms himself the entire community of which he is a part is equally harmed. But on the other side of the question there seems to be some uncertainty as to the good that would result from the law. Man's nature is curious and at all times it has seemed hard to enforce morals by law. It is an old known fact that forbidden fruit seems the most desired.</p>
   <p>,When Mayor Dunne hesitates in enforcing the Sunday closing law he does so because for him it does not seem important at the moment. He is not the kind of a person <pb facs="5423404_1_0247.jpg" n="3"/>that lays trouble to persons or political system. Such a motive no one could believe him guilty of. But it is questionable whether his easy going manner is the best. When President Roosevelt belonged to the Police Department in New York City and he was entrusted with the duty of seeing that the policemen did their duties, he explained that all laws that were enacted should be lived up to. He explained that he himself did not believe certain laws were absolutely right, but as long as they were laws they must be enforced. When a law seems to be strict the entire people soon bring it to a point where it will be repealed. In the same manner Governor Folk in St. Louis said to those who protested against the Sunday closing law question, "As long as Sunday closing is a law I will enforce it. If the people think this law too strict they are free to repeal it, but I am sworn in to watch over the enacted laws."</p>
   <p>Question: Suppose that the Sunday closing law is not just, is it better to do as Mayor Dunne has done, let it be a dead law or enforce it as President Roosevelt and Governor Folk have done. Mayor Dunne takes for granted that the people do not want <pb facs="5423404_1_0248.jpg" n="4"/>it enforced, but is it the majority's desire. If he enforces the law in the strictest sense, it would soon snow what the people think of the question, and if the law seemed too drastic it would not take long before its impracticability would be felt and the law makers would repeal it.</p>
