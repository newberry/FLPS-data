<title level="a">THE STATUS OF THE SWEDE IN POLITICS</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Carl Smalandson</title></bibl>

   <p>The retiring or reticent trait of the Swede is periodical, noticeable from time to time in scattered parts of the country. At the last primary election the Swedes have in many locations attracted much attention by beating their opponents, regardless of what their nationality might have been. By these victories they have demonstrated that they can co-operate and win their objectives. However, most of the time the vote of the Swede is looked upon as and practically proven to be an article of transferable or purchasable merchandise. Where substantial state organizations of Swedish partisans have worked hard and in unity, they have succeeded in drawing the attention of the big party leaders and, in return for a sizable bloc of votes, they have secured appointments and even elections for many of their countrymen. In addition to offices won they have gained a surprising amount of respect from all nationalities in their colony.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0931.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Regarding the holding of offices by Swedes, there are comparatively few and not enough for excitement. Here and there the high officials show their appreciation of Swedish votes by appointing a Swede to a fair position, though not a high one. For example, the governor of Massachusetts appointed a Swede as chairman of the Board of Registration in Pharmacy. Ordinarily an Irish politician, who can barely sign his own name, has a very decisive preference, no matter how well educated and trained by experience a Swede might be.</p>
   <p>In politics the average Swedish-American shows two sides or views. Mixing with his countrymen he is very important, preaching the doctrines of his favorite party eloquently creating the impression that he is considered an able man in political circles. He is more humble when it comes to demanding an appointment, though he creates the impression that he holds a worth-while bloc of Swedish votes. His greatest humility comes to the surface when it is a question of raising funds for a club or a publication.</p>
   <p>In the case of many of our Swedish politicians, the greatest honor granted them is a written invitation to a rally to tell the crowd how they can count on the <pb facs="5423404_1_0932.jpg" n="3"/>Swedish vote. Such rallies are held, as a rule, in quarters over a saloon making it convenient to have plenty of free beer on tap as bait.</p>
   <p>This fall, the Swedes have more candidates than ever before for governors, congressmen, and other inferior offices. It is now a question of whether they stick together and elect their candidates and prove what influence Swedish support of other candidates may accomplish. Naturally the Swedes must stick together. Their influence, even concerning national politics is growing even though much depends upon the second generation.</p>
