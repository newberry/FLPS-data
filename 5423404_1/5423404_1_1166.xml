   <p>A prominent member of Chicago's Swedish colony was honored, on Tuesday, September 18, by being nominated by the Independence League for County Commissioner and simultaneously president of the Board of County Commissioners. His ability to handle the job is not doubted by anyone.</p>
   <p>November 17 seems to be the most important day in his life. He was born on November 17, 1844; he arrived in Chicago on November 17, 1864; he was married on November 17, 1874.</p>
   <p>Robert Lindblom's important connections are not only in Chicago. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce in Milwaukee and Minneapolis; the Board of Trade in Chicago; the Produce Exchange and New York Consolidated Stock Exchanges, New York; the Union League Club and Swedish Glee Club, Chicago. He was one of the original thirty-five directors for the World's Fair and made a great appeal to the American public for funds, necessary for the Fair, himself donating $100,000.</p>
