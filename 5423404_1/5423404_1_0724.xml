   <p>A brief news item in last week's issue told of the great progress which is being made by the co-operative movement among farmers. This is a gratifying development. We have always believed in the co-operative idea, and have always been at odds with those who systematically oppose it, and who, as a matter of course, seem to oppose not only co-operation but all social progress and reforms that promise to benefit all the people.</p>
   <p>According to statistics for 1919, the first year for which authentic information is available, the co-operative farm organizations did a gross business of eighty-six million dollars that year. In every State of the Union, with the exception of one, at least twenty per cent of sales made by farmers were made on a co-operative basis. Illinois was the exception. In our State the percentage amounted to ten and one half. No less than 511,383 farmers throughout <pb facs="5423404_1_0725.jpg" n="2"/>the country were involved in these co-operative transactions.</p>
   <p>Even though we have no accurate figures with which to prove the assertion, there can be no doubt that 1919 was a peak year, as compared with previous years. And it is equally certain that during the last two years the gross business done by these organizations has been even greater. For farmers as well as consumers are realizing more and more the advantages of the co-operative system.</p>
