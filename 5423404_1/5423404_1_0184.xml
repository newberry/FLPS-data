   <p>Much has been said and written about personal liberty, and most of it is empty phrassology. The term "personal liberty" sounds good and appeals to most of us, but it has no basis in reality.</p>
   <p>Ever since the dawn of our civilization man has had to surrender, little by little, many of his personal rights and privileges. The further a nation progresses in civilization and enlightenment, the more does the individual's personal liberty become limited, and the more does he become dependent on his fellow men. It is considered that ninety-eight per cent of the laws now on the statute books of the United States directly or indirectly tend to limit personal liberty. And we would not want it otherwise.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that protests against restrictions of personal liberty are most violent when the interests of the liquor trade are affected. At other times people are quite willing to make minor sacrifices, even submit to inconveniences <pb facs="5423404_1_0185.jpg" n="2"/>for the common weal. Why all the excitement when the saloons are threatened? One is tempted to ask whether the liquor interests enjoy special rights and privileges. Or perhaps all such special interests possess inherent, God-given rights which have been denied the common run of humanity?</p>
