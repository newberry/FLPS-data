   <p>The bloody World War has brought sorrow and suffering over the warring nations but, strange to say, it has also indirectly promoted one humane cause in that it has forced many of these nations drastically to curtail the consumption of alcoholic beverages in order to preserve and strengthen the moral and physical fiber of their populations. Russia led the way when its rulers decided to forbid the use of liquor in any form, and reports from that country agree that the order is being strictly enforced and has had a very beneficial effect on its enormous population.</p>
   <p>In Germany radical measures were adopted in order to limit the use of liquor, and on January 7 of this year, President Poincare of France signed a bill prohibiting the sale of absinthe and beverages containing absinthe in that country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0187.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even in England voices have been raised in warning, pointing out the devastating effect of alcohol on the British people, and reports have just been received that King George, several members of the cabinet, Field Marshal Kitchener, and others of high rank, have pledged themselves to abstain from the use of liquor in order to set an example for the people.</p>
   <p>The seriousness of the times and the supreme effort which these nations are now making have brought home to their leaders the dangers of the liquor evil. In their attempt to remove everything which tends to reduce the fighting strength of their peoples, they turned against liquor as the worst offender, and at the same time one which may fairly easily be eliminated.</p>
   <p>Thus, in the midst of this world catastrophe, the temperance cause has received an impetus which bodes well for the future.</p>
