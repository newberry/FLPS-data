   <p>Our countryman, C.O. Williamson, has received an appointment as Agent of Cook County.</p>
   <p>The circumstances in connection with this appointment are rather peculiar. The appointee, C.O. Williamson, is by no means a "prominent" Swede, no matter how one looks at it. In fact, his life in the lime-lights of politics, social and fraternal activity is still an unwritten chapter. The fact remains that he is Swedish and that he has received the appointment. However, from reliable source we have learned that the Cook County Board of Commissioners deemed it advisable to make this appointment in order to get on a friendly footing with the Swedish voters. If such is the case, it might be the dawn of a new era, when the organized voting power of the Swedes of Chicago will gain full recognition and we will receive treatment in accordance with our standing in society.</p>
