   <p>Whenever and wherever strike disorders occur, the press warns against it, quite correctly, insisting that nothing good can issue from the disorders. "Remain quiet and calm," is the word, "and you will gain universal sympathy."</p>
   <p>On valid reasons we ask ourselves and you the question, "When and where is the universal sympathy for strikers shown?" We answer by showing the general attitude during the great street car strike in New York. To our knowledge, no disorders of any kind have occurred during this strike. The workers ceased working, kept calm and quiet, and waited for the universal sympathy. And they got it! Hardly had strike breakers placed their feet into the cars before the latter were filled with passengers, who naturally sympathized with the strikers, <pb facs="5423404_1_0626.jpg" n="2"/>giving them lip service, but in action they sympathized with the street car company, by means of their nickels helping it to hold out on the strikers.</p>
   <p>We warn the workers not to put too much reliance in the "universal sympathy" which, according to the press, will be extended to them if they keep orderly and calm during strikes. A sympathy which does not find expression in action is not worth having.</p>
