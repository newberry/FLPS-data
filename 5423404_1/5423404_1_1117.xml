   <p>A short time ago we had occasion to call Chief Justice Harry Olson "the man of the day". As it turned out, the day was not his but, fortunately for Chicago, the judge is still with us.</p>
   <p>Some people are pushed into the foreground through the force of circumstances, and are offered their opportunity accidentally; but when that opportunity has passed they sink back into the obscurity where they really belong. In such cases the day is more significant than the man.</p>
   <p>Harry Olson does not belong to that class of men. His mayoralty campaign was blasted in the primary, but to him this was merely an incident. Today he is in the thick of another struggle, the outcome of which may later be considered his life work, and which is already attracting the attention of <pb facs="5423404_1_1118.jpg" n="2"/>the world: namely, his fight for the introduction of progressive reforms in the Municipal Court. Two days after his defeat at the polls he established a new department of the court which, better than anything else, demonstrates his insight and sentiment. Even though it amounts to the creation of a new court, it may seem insignificant to some people, since this court will not handle cases involving more than twenty-five dollars, which is merely "chicken feed" to those who are impressed only by million-dollar judicial contests. But to thousands of our underprivileged citizens it is good news, and an assurance that justice is not yet dead even though it often seems to be.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the new court is to aid those who formerly have been unable to obtain justice because they lacked money to hire legal councel. The underpaid charwoman, laundress, and others in similar positions may now appeal to the Small Claims Court in room 915 of the City Hall. The procedure is simplified and the claimant is given a chance to present his or her case at a nominal cost.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_1119.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It has been said that many women voters refrained from supporting Judge Olson's candidacy for mayor at the primary because they considered him indispensable as Chief Justice of the Municipal Court. Whether or not one agrees with the logic of such reasoning, it must be admitted that it indicates a remarkable appreciation of a remarkable judicial ability, and Justice Olson's latest innovation, the Small Claims Court, is another proof that the high esteem in which he is held is well placed. He is still "the man of the day".</p>
