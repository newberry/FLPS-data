   <p>On June 6, Chicago's voters are to elect twenty judges of the Circuit Court and one judge of the Superior Court. Two lists of candidates are presented to the voters, and on one of them--the so-called nonpartisan list--are the names of John A. Swanson, [Swede] and Oscar M. Torrison [Norwegian]. The former is at the present time a judge of the Municipal Court; the latter is already on the Circuit Court, and is now seeking re-election.</p>
   <p>John A. Swanson was born in Chicago, April 14, 1874; his father was John Swanson, a tailor. After having graduated from high school, he entered Northwestern University law school, from which he graduated in 1895. That same year he began to practice law, and has done so ever since, except for intermittent periods of public service. He soon came into the political limelight, and was elected to <pb facs="5423404_1_1072.jpg" n="2"/>the lower house of the Illinois legislature in 1910. He served there for two years, and in 1914 was elected state senator from the thirteenth district for a term of four years. However, it is as a judge of the Municipal Court that Swanson has attracted most attention, and everybody who has followed his work there agrees that he has shown great ability as a judge, an unusual capacity for work, and a deep appreciation of the responsibilities of his office. His judicial insight has been especially apparent in his conduct of the Landlords' and Tenants Court. His work there was particularly strenuous because of the housing shortage. He sometimes disposed of as many as 175 cases in a single day, and the best part of it was that, in the majority of cases, the litigants came to a friendly agreement.</p>
   <p>We recommend both Judge Swanson and Judge Torrison as well qualified for the offices which they are seeking.</p>
