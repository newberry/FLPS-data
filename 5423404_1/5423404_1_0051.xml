   <p>It has been stated by people who should know that of the many thousands of teachers of both sexes in our public schools only twenty-five per cent have sufficient education and training to do their important work properly. If this is true, which it probably is, we are confronted with a truly deplorable situation. Its seriousness is readily realized when one considers how important it is for the future of the country that the younger generation receive efficient and thorough instruction in the fundamental subjects which are taught in the public schools. The fact that the majority of unqualified teachers are to be found in country schools does not help matters any. In fact, it makes them worse; for it is from our rural population that the national stock has to depend for new blood and physical and spiritual vigor.</p>
   <p>The reason why so many of our school teachers do not measure up to proper standards is that the salaries paid for this kind of work are too low, and do <pb facs="5423404_1_0052.jpg" n="2"/>not attract the better minds. Some communities can hardly afford to pay higher salaries, while others simply do not want to, even though they can well afford to do so. However, during the last few years the teaching profession itself has done considerable propaganda work in its own behalf, and some improvement has been noted. In many cases the Government has come to the aid of small and poor school districts that actually lack the money for increasing the salaries of their teachers.</p>
   <p>In order to improve existing conditions in our public educational system, it has been suggested that a Governmental Department of Education be created. It certainly is the foremost duty of a nation to see that its children are properly cared for, not only physically but mentally, and that they receive at least an adequate elementary education. It is, of course, in the nation's own interest to see to this, for as its children are so will its future be.</p>
