   <p>The mighty temperance organization, The Anti-Saloon League of America, recently held its convention in Chicago, and Swedish interests were represented by Reverend Gustaf Kunt Stark, who is superintendent of the Illinois branch of the League's Swedish department.</p>
   <p>Gustaf Knut Stark was born in Eksjo, Sweden, January 15, 1867, and came to America with his parents in 1875. The family lived first in Tidioute, Pennsylvania, where Gustaf Knut attended public school. But he left home early to shift for himself, and roamed about considerably. At one time he was employed by the Marshall Field Company of Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the age of 18 he registered at Augustana College in Rockford, Illinois, and alternately studied and taught school until he had completed the theological course and was ordained as a minister. Two of his brothers <pb facs="5423404_1_0207.jpg" n="2"/>are also pastors, namely, F. M. Johnson of Chicago, and A. W. Stark of De Kalb, Illinois. Reverend Stark has successfully served several congregations, the last one in Evanston, until two years ago, when he was appointed superintendent of the Scandinavian branch of the Anti-Saloon League of Illinois, and he has amply demonstrated his fitness for this job.</p>
   <p>As a pastor, Mr. Stark held several positions of trust in religious organizations, and he is now the secretary of the board of directors of the Anti-Saloon League of Illinois. He is also an active member of the Chicago Law and Order League. Work is his hobby, and he speaks Swedish and English with equal ease.</p>
   <p>In 1894 Reverend Stark married Jennie Virginia Peterson of Rockford, and they have four children. Reverend Stark presided at the great Swedish temperance meeting which was held in Orchestra Hall last Thursday in conjunction with the national convention of the Anti-Saloon League.</p>
