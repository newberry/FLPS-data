   <p>Sometime ago we met a Swedish American who, after a few years' stay in America, had progressed so well (!) that he was able to assure us, in a somewhat haughty manner, "I never read a Swedish paper!".... Always there have been individuals of this type, and perhaps there are more of them than we usually think.....Many will say that they read American papers when, as a matter of fact, they do not ready any papers at all. Except for the fact that they are Swedes, one might think that they could not read at all. . . . . Some people will say that the price of the Swedish papers is too high; they complain that a respectable Swedish paper costs five cents per copy while the American papers, whether morning or evening edition. . . . . may be had for one or two cents.</p>
   <p>But the time is long past... when the Swedish-American press needed to defend itself; yet it may not be unwise to say a word occasionally in its favor; <pb facs="5423404_1_0359.jpg" n="2"/>people are prone to forget, and one may easily become so used to a good thing that one no longer appreciates its value.</p>
   <p>It is far from easy to publish a Swedish-American paper. For the American press, the foreign language papers are as a thorn in their side; it is of course to their interest that the foreigners shall be "Americanized" as quickly as possible, which means, to forget the language, the culture, the great past of the people whose descendents they are, and become subscribers to the American papers. The selfish interest of these papers is hidden behind the well-sounding name, American citizens. But when these newly made citizens demand a portion of the political clambake, then we see at once how genuine the interest was.</p>
   <p>At the present time, the Swedish-American press need not take a back seat for its American competitors, either as to content or manner of presentation. Any one of the worthy representatives of the Swedish press may well be supported, and advantageously so, by any Swede <pb facs="5423404_1_0360.jpg" n="3"/>We urge our readers not to permit the Swedish newspapers to become a sort of charity inmate in their house. Give this paper a prominent place, the very foremost place.</p>
