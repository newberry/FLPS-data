   <p>No sooner had the Railroad Commission's announcement of a coming reduction of railroad freight rates been carried over the wires than it was announced from another quarter that a reduction of the wages of railroad employees would be necessary. In other words the personnel will have to make up for the reduced rates.</p>
   <p>Such action seems entirely unjustified inasmuch as the Commission guarantees the roads a net profit of 5.75 per cent, not only upon actual invested capital, but even on the socalled watered stock, after the new freight rates have become effective. This really amounts to a dividend of ten per cent on the invested capital, which should be quite satisfactory, even for the railroads, in these times of "slow" business. The Commission seems to have been more concerned about the dividends to be distributed among the owners of railroad <pb facs="5423404_1_0429.jpg" n="2"/>stock than with the living standard and just demands of the four hundred thousand railroad workers and their families.</p>
   <p>A short time ago, the United States District Court ordered a reduction of fare on the Chicago Surface Lines from eight to seven cents, effective next June 15. The company immediately announced that this reduction would make it necessary to cut the wages of its employees. As in the case of the rail-roads, there was no justification for a wage cut for the Surface Lines' workers. It has repeatedly been proved by competent transportation experts that the surface cars in this city can be operated efficiently and profitably on a five-cent fare, or a six-cent fare at the most. It is being done in other large cities. But here, as soon as the fare is reduced from eight cents to seven, the workers are immediately called upon to contribute the difference. Who has real reason for complaining about "bad times"?</p>
