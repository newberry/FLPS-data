   <p>The power industry in this country appears to be just as much in need of close supervision and control as the railroad industry was before the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission. To be sure, the Federal Power Commission is supposed to keep an eye on the conduct of the power corporations, but its authority is so limited and its resources so small that it cannot even undertake to look into the affairs of one half of the companies which are supposed to be under its jurisdiction. The result is that the power industry is able to conduct its underground but nonetheless effective propaganda against public control of, and interference with, its vast enterprises.</p>
   <p>The testimony in the Power Commission's reopened investigation of the affairs of the power trust has revealed that the Federation of Women's Clubs was <pb facs="5423404_1_0410.jpg" n="2"/>given eighty thousand dollars by the National Electric light Association between the years 1924 and 1928 in order to smooth the way for the latter's propaganda work through certain arrangements which have been made with the Federation's president, Mrs. John Sherman, of Colorado. Mrs. Sherman's part of the money was paid through an advertising agency in the form of six hundred dollars for each of twenty-four articles in a number of periodicals. These periodicals themselves paid, on the average, less than ten dollars for each of these same articles.</p>
   <p>This Mrs. Sherman, and also a number of university professors who, under the pretense of impartiality, have served as agents for the power companies, should be expelled from their organizations. The universities, as well as the Association of University Professors and the Federation of Women's Clubs, could learn much from John D. Rockerfeller, the younger, who is at this time carrying on a valiant fight in order to induce the stockholders of the Standard Oil Company of Indiana to clean house and to force the company's president Robert W. Stewart, to resign.</p>
