   <p>In the primaries next Saturday we should be vote conscious and cast our votes, because it is the peoples privilege to nominate the candidates for the various offices, instead of the political bosses doing so by convention. This is the first time direct nomination have taken place in the state, therefore no one should hesitate to vote.</p>
   <p>We find a great deal said about the offices the various candidates are seeking at the primary and we should have a clear understanding as to who is worthy of our support.</p>
   <p>The most important office is that of governor. We believe many of our readers will grant us the privilege of predicting that the present Governor Charles Deneen is the best candidate. He has shown himself as being capable as a manager. His opponent has tried to belittle him in the eyes of the public, but without any luck. Charles S. Deneen stands out as a right minded public servant who is among the best governors the state has had. Therefore you should cast your vote for him on primary day. For Secretary of State Fred Sterling is candidate with some others. Without wanting to belittle any of his opponents we are of the belief that he is the best candidate and he is also <pb facs="5423404_1_0923.jpg" n="2"/>given preference by the Swedes, therefore you should vote for him on primary day. We find a good many Swedish candidates here in the city and state. We believe that a landsman should be given preference if he is as good as his opposing candidate. It is seldom a Swede is elected who does not prove himself worthy. We can honestly say vote for Swedish candidates.</p>
