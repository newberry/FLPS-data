   <p>A chill as of death lingers over these words as they were pronounced by the manager of an industrial establishment to a worker yet in the years of full power. The prouncement was followed by action depriving the worker of his means of existence. "Too old," is the verdict meeting the young man of thirty-five who seeks employment with the railroad corporations. "Too old," hears the craftsman who is approaching the forties. "Too old," <pb facs="5423404_1_0849.jpg" n="2"/>is the greeting meeting millions of men and women who have reached the age of forty-five and seek almost any kind of employment.</p>
   <p>During this period of ebbing competition; during these times when the gold sharks are riding roughshod over the producing masses, and the devilish worshipers of Mammon compel children of school age to fight the bitter fight for bread in mines and in factories, it is no wonder that men and women create free tickets for the selves to another world.</p>
   <p>His name was James Hollander, his age forty-five, and he was living <pb facs="5423404_1_0850.jpg" n="3"/>at 222 W. 129th Street, New York. He was a traveling salesman for a firm in New York; he did not drink, he was honest and reliable, but he was "too old," the manager of his company told him and discharged him. Hollander went to seek work, in New York, in Chicago, in vain! A bullet from his own gun ended his sufferings.</p>
   <p>The coroner's jury decided that it was a case of suicide; millions of people meet the same end in similar cases. If the rulers of the great corporations in our country were consistent, they could not help but state that the man died from old age - at forty-five.</p>
   <pb facs="5423404_1_0851.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We do not accept either of these two verdicts; we insist that Hollander was killed by his employers who, in this case, were simply the hangmen of our American commonwealth.</p>
   <p>A curse on a civilization which makes slaves of children, while hurling the middle-aged worker down into his grave before his time.</p>
