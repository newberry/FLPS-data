   <p>Oscar F. Nelson, the present Chief Factory Inspector of the State of Illinois, is a candidate for the Democratic nomination as Representative in Congress from the Ninth Congressional district, Chicago. Mr. Nelson was born in Chicago 1884 of Swedish parents, who emigrated from Sweden. He started early to do his part to support his mother and the other children by selling papers at the are of nine, after his father's death. Later on, he entered the Post Office department as a Special Delivery boy, and at the age of twenty-two, he became a Post Office clerk and was elected president of the Chicago Post Office Clerks' Union, serving for four years. His carrier record is remarkable. When he complained about the unsanitary conditions in the Chicago Post Office, he was fired. He was at one time National president for the National Federation of Post Office Clerks, and was re-elected twice. He was also the legislative representative for the Federation in Washington, and through his efforts a law was adopted whereby Post Office Clerks and mail carriers should not work more <pb facs="5423404_1_1125.jpg" n="2"/>than eight hours a day, and whereby their wages should be raised considerably. Their minimum salaries were, therefore, raised from $600 to $800 annually. He also succeeded in getting the maximum salaries for Post Office Clerks raised from $1,200 to $1,400, annually. Mr. Nelson has represented his organization in the Chicago Federation of Labor for eleven years, and was elected vice-president of this Federation in 1911. He was re-elected twice. Governor Dunne appointed Mr. Nelson Chief State Factory Inspector for Illinois in 1913, and he has been very successful as such in this State, protecting working men, women, and children, according to the labor laws of Illinois.</p>
