   <p>The expenditures of the educational system in this country are very high, and during the last decades they have increased at such a rate that it is feared, in authoritative quarters, that they may soon come to represent a financial burden which the country cannot carry. Even such an enlightened man as Dr. Pritchett, of the Carnegie Foundation, seems to be of this opinion. At least, that is the impression one gets from reading an article in which he proves that annual expenditures for education have increased from one hundred and forty million to one billion dollars in the last thirty years.</p>
   <p>However, during the same period, our national wealth has increased from sixty-five to three hundred billion dollars, so that there is no reason to worry about the money which is being spent upon our schools. At present, it amounts <pb facs="5423404_1_0048.jpg" n="2"/>to only two per cent of the national income. We most certainly can afford to spend that much money upon the education of the younger generation. But we must make sure that the quality of this education is of the highest possible grade. The quality is of more importance than the cost; and it is one factor that does not appear on statistical charts.</p>
