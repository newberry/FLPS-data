   <p>For a long time now the country's workers have been busy organizing themselves in order to successfully conduct the struggle which they must continually wage if they are to improve their lot and make their existence bearable. They have more sacrifices with an enthusiasm and unselfishness which have not been equaled in any other human endeavor, and the beneficial results are more and more beginning to make themselves felt.</p>
   <p>Little by little they have induced their employers to grant them shorter working hours and a few cents increase in daily wages. Under pressure by the trade-unions and the rapidly expanding socialistic school of thought, a number of big industrialists have recently agreed to a general wage increase, and they now make much of the fact that this increase also benefits those workers who are not organized. In some instances this may be true, and there are unfortunably, workers who consider this fact a sufficient reason for not taxing upon themselves the burden and <pb facs="5423404_1_0590.jpg" n="2"/>sacrifice inherent in trade-union membership. Such a point of view is considered smart by some people of the type that does not hesitate to reap the benefits from other people's efforts, without making their own contribution.</p>
   <p>No man should be such a slacker. They who now enjoy the results of the tedious struggles and sacrifices of others should be honest with themselves, acknowledge the source from which they come, and join the active ranks.</p>
