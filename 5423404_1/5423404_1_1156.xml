   <p>The State of Illinois, through the Attorney General in Springfield, has opened a lawsuit
    against the Illinois Central Railroad, to get back $5,000,000, which the company is <gap
     unit="word" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> to have failed to deliver to the State, although,
    the company, through its charter, is obligated to give up seven per cent of its gross income,
    instead of paying taxes. This agreement is fifty years old. The governors of Illinois, according
    to the charter mentioned, have always been self-appointed members of the company's Board of
    Directors. It seems, therefore, peculiar that this, the State's lawsuit action, has not
    attracted the attention of governors a long time ago.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, to Governor Deneen's credit that he is going to let the <pb
     facs="5423404_1_1157.jpg" n="2"/>Attorney General take this important matter to the courts,
    even if the court's procedure will take a long time and the decision may not be made until long
    after he has left office. The Governor has asked the legislature for an extra appropriation of
     $<gap unit="char" extent="3" reason="illegible"/>,000 to meet the expenses for this court
    trial. The people's representatives ought to think it over more than once, before they allow the
    Governor such a large sum. Many of his other proposals have been opposed in the legislature.</p>
