   <p>Joseph Vehon, president of the Royal Tailors and a national figure in the wholesale tailoring business, died yesterday morning at his home, 3638 Grand Boulevard, at the age of 84.</p>
   <p>The deceased came to America from Poland as a young man. With several hundred dollars borrowed from his countrymen he started his tailoring business and rose steadily until he became one of the biggest clothing merchants in America.</p>
   <p>He was the father of the business principle "Your money back if you are not satisfied". With this principle as his motto he started a small clothing business in a small town in Iowa in 1870. In the same year he came to Chicago and opened a retail store, and shortly afterwards he entered the wholesale tailoring business. His firm now has two plants, one in Chicago and one in New York, where over two thousand tailors are employed.</p>

   <p>Mr. Vehon participated very little in public affairs, but he did belong to many Jewish charitable organizations.</p>
   <p>The funeral will take place Monday morning. He is survived by a daughter, Miss Emma Vehon and a son, Mr. Morris Vehon.</p>
