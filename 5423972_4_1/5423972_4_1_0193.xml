<title level="a">JUDGE MACK APPOINTED</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The appointment of Judge Julian Mack of Chicago as judge of the new Court of Commerce is making quite a satisfactory impression on the Jewish citizenship and on the Chicago citizenship in general.</p>
   <p>Judge Mack, although a Democrat, is absolutely non-partisan. It is his personality and his status as a man of great knowledge that secured him his appointment to this honored and trustworthy office. In fact, he showed his ability in the past while he was on the bench as judge of the Circuit Court of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We are mighty proud to have one of our Jewish brethren appointed to this office. He is the first Jew who was appointed Circuit judge for life. The present administration revolted quite a bit against this appointment, but it did them no good for President Taft saw fit to appoint a Jew as judge of the Circuit Court in Chicago.</p>
