  <body>
   <p>The Mothers League opened a vigorous campaign to save the lives of the children of Chicago, who are imperiled due to the high cost of milk. The Health Commissioner, Dr. Dill Robertson, will, starting today, be overflooded with thousands of petitions by mothers from all parts of Chicago, demanding that the city establish milk stations in various districts, where milk should be sold at low rates.</p>
   <p>This step was taken at yesterday's meeting of the League Executive, in the Forward office, It was announced that the movement to organize the women against the high cost of living is being brilliantly carried through and that the mothers are joining the League in great masses. Mrs. Fanny Schmild, organizer of the 34th Ward, reported that a branch of the Mothers League was already organized in that district.</p>
