   <p>Again, the member of the Illinois Branch of the American Union of Rumanian Jews are in the fore for their good work for the Third American Liberty Loan. Last Sunday they were the first to start the campaign in the local Jewish communities. At their massmeeting yesterday at the West Side Coliseum they advanced a step further.</p>
   <p>The Rumanian Jews subscribed $8,100 for Liberty Bonds. Mr. Henry Friend, the well-known State Street merchant, promised to buy Liberty Bonds for the same amount, which means that the total sum will reach $16,200.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bronstein, president of the Illinois Branch, declared that the campaign among the local Rumanian Jews has not ended yet. He hopes to be able shortly to raise the sum to $10,000, and to get Mr. Friend to subscribe a like amount.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0562.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The General Jewish Liberty Loan Committee is convinced that the inspiring action taken by the local Rumanian Jews, will be followed up by the great Jewish masses.</p>
   <p>Those who bought Liberty Bonds in large amounts at the massmeeting are: A. Weiner--$500.00; Joseph Desauer of New York--$500.00; Illinois Lodge P.O.W--$500.00; Goodshal and family--$300.00; Lucy Nachman and family--$3600.00; S.D. Wolfson--$400.00; I. Rosenfeld--$300.00; the Hirsch family--$300.00.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. J. Bronstein was chairman of the massmeeting. Beautiful and powerful speeches were made by Edward A. Gore of the Association of Commerce; Judge Philip P. Bregston and Dr. Jacob Gortenstein.</p>
   <p>At schiff and Company's State Bank, in the first hours of the campaign, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0563.jpg" n="3"/>Liberty Bonds in large and small sums were sold to Jews to the amount of $1,850.</p>
   <p>At the Covenant Club, where $35,000 worth of Liberty Bonds were sold on Saturday, the campaign is directed by the following committee: Mrs. Nathan D. Kaplan--chairman, Mrs. Fred Bergstein, Mrs. Samuel Zuker, Mrs. A.B. Zelenfriend, Mrs. A.D. Wiener and Mrs. Hugo Friendstein.</p>
   <p>Upon the initiative of Mr. I. Shure and others, the Progressive Lodge, #252 0.B.0., decided at a meeting yesterday afternoon to buy $1,000 worth of Liberty Bonds.</p>
