   <p>In the last organized attack on the Federation by irresponsible organized groups, the Federation as a whole, as well as its individual active officers, displayed their worth by ignoring the unfounded accusations, arguments, and complaints from those gangs who are the shame of Chicago's Jewish community. Every means was exerted to involve at least one responsible director in a deliberate plot against the Federation. They clamored for explanations, sought interviews with the officials, boasted of discussions with this one or that, but failed in every ruse. The Federation and its directors, knowing that these opposing gangs are ostracized from Chicago's Jewish Community, found it more befitting their position, a representatives of this community to ignore these people.</p>
   <p>But of late things have taken a new turn. The Rabbi of Kihileth Anshe Marov, Dr. Shoenfarber, who besides other qualification is a feature-writer, contributing weekly the "News and Remarks, "in the Chicago Israelite, has for <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0083.jpg" n="2"/>various reasons, known only to himself, acquiesced to the gang, whereby Mr. B. Horvitch, the president of the Federation, found himself in a predicament that necessitated an answer.</p>
   <p>As long as the Federation was assailed with contempt and insult from a gang that received no attention, and as long as this Jewish body and its directors were degraded only in restaurants or in unreliable publications, the proper method of action was that of fulfilling King Solomon's advice, "Do not answer a fool's folly." But with the Rabbi of the Kihileth Anshe Marov on the scene, the theme assumed another aspect.</p>
   <p>Dr. Shoenfarber writes in English, and the publicizing of false accusations against the greatest and best Jewish structure that Orthodox Jews ever <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0084.jpg" n="3"/>established since their coming to America; to be organized and lead by people of unclean thoughts in an English newspaper that is read by the non-Jew as well as the Jew, is, to put it mildly to the reformed Rabbi, a great injustice.</p>
   <p>The fault finding brought by irresponsible subjects, when printed in English, represent actual accusations of Orthodox Judaism before an entire world. In such an instance we cannot stop to ignore the Rabbi or disregard the article. And, Mr. B. Horvitch, as president and father of the Federation, wrote the Chicago Israelite the following letter:</p>
   <p>Editor of the Chicago Israelite:</p>
   <p>"I read your paragraph in last week's issue of the Israelite, showing the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0085.jpg" n="4"/>attitude taken by a somewhat Jewish paper toward the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities. I must confess my astonishment to find that you placed too much value on such heckling and actually gave it space in your paper.</p>
   <p>That the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities is used for political purposes has as much truth in it as the argument saying Jews use blood for ritual purposes.</p>
   <p>"Who are these so called leaders who make use of the Federation for political or other purposes? On examining the list of directors and officers, we find seven Rabbis, seven women, fifteen prominent businessmen, when even your newspaper would not consider placing in disrepute. We have three persons among the directors who hold public office: Harry M. Fisher, Judge of the Municipal Court; Harry A. Lipsky, member of the Board of Education; and <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0086.jpg" n="5"/>Max M. Korshack, assistant corporation council. These, I presume, are the well-known politicians who take advantage of the Federation. Yet everyone knows that they were elected to their respective positions long before the Federation even existed. I am the <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> who had the honor of securing the services of these three honorable men, and, I must confess, that instead of their receiving any advantages from the Federation, it is the Federation that benefits by reason of their honorable offices being used for our community.</p>
   <p>"We are fortunate that our young people, after securing public office, display enough interest to give time, money, and services to the Jewish community, especially in such instance that brings them more harm than good. As you know, the only work of concern to the Federation is the task of asking for money. This is a thankless task for anyone, especially on the West Side. I say with certainty that those devoting their time to social work lose <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0087.jpg" n="6"/>friends instead of making them.</p>
   <p>"What a tragic situation, to have among us people who devote their energies undoing the good others have accomplished. Such scandalizing animals would attack these men even if they were not interested in Jewish affairs. When it is our god fortune to secure their services, they are accused of having unsuitable motives.</p>
   <p>"The same accusation may be made against Judge Julian V. Mack. Would you print in your paper a call for an investigation if some busybody claimed Judge Mack was getting undeserved credit or honor for his activities in Jewish affairs?</p>
   <p>"I wish with all my heart that those of our people who attain public office be one those who proved their worth and received their fame through good <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0088.jpg" n="7"/>work for the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>"The actual truth of the entire subject is of the following nature: After the Federation was founded and Established as an institution, a representative of the Jewish newspaper you mention, demanded that officials of the Federation pay special attention to his paper so that it may receive recognition by the public.</p>
   <p>"His present attitude is the result of our non-compliance with such 'politics'."</p>
   <p>"Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>B. Horvitch"</p>
   <p>We hope that this reply will aid in preventing the spread of such false accusations among non-Jews.</p>
   <p>P. B.</p>
