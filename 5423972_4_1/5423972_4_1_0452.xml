   <p>Windsor Nova Scotia.</p>
   <p>Dear Editor: We were very glad indeed when we read in your newspaper that the movement for a Red Moggen David in the United States and Canada had met with great success. We recognize the importance of this work and are deeply concerned that it should bring useful and successful results. We therefore would suggest to you several things based upon our eight weeks of experience in the camp life of the Jewish legionnaires.</p>
   <p>1) The first and most important work of the Red Moggen David should be to provide for the families of the married legionnaires. He who has lived through the experience of receiving a heart-rending letter from his wife and children (and among us are many such) can understand the painful and depressing impression that is left upon all of us. After all, we who are going to fight for the welfare of our nation, are entitled to have those who do not go to fight, give us all possible and suitable encouragement so that we may, with an untroubled <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0453.jpg" n="2"/>conscience, take up our task. That goal can best be attained when we can feel that our people sympathize with us and care for our loved ones.</p>
   <p>2) It is absolutely useless to give the legionnaire many knitted things. In Windsor they give each legionnaire a good sweater, a knitted cap, and knitted gloves. All that a legionnaire needs is a sleeveless jersey sweater. It is therefore much better to apply the work and the material toward more useful things such as the following: thin woolen socks, towels, handkerchiefs, a shaving set (the government supplies a razor but it is not a safety razor, and is of inferior quality), needles, thread, buttons, dentifrice materials, a mirror, writing material, a wristwatch, thin underwear, and, most important of all, tobacco and cigarettes.</p>
   <p>3) It is of utmost importance that everything sent to the legionnaires in Camps Windsor and Halifax, should be addressed to the committee and not to any private individual. The cities of the Provinces should particularly keep this in mind.</p>
   <p>4) All other organizations that are giving aid to the legionnaires should do so <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0454.jpg" n="3"/>through the Red Moggen David. On the one hand it will centralize this work and make it more thorough, and on the other hand, it will be better and more convenient for the legionnaires since they will know that they have just one place to which to apply for their needs and wants. And the same reason should apply in the organization of all Red Moggen David groups under one central body that will establish a uniform and thorough system in the work of all the groups.</p>
   <p>5) Everything that is sent for the third group of legionaires in Halifax should be sent to the following address: Private M. Dubinsky, 2791 Jewish Battalion, York Redoubt, Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
   <p>In the name of the committee of the third group of legionnaires, D. Israeli, Moses Zetland, S. Goldman,</p>
   <p>Press Committee.</p>
   <p>All Jewish newspapers are requested to print this letter and we ask that it be given a prominent place in your newspaper.</p>
