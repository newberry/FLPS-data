   <p>As the investigation into the Government's oil contracts proceeds more fradulent dealings are uncovered. At first only two cabinet members were involved (one resigned and the other one is still serving); but now the names of many prominent politicians and other officials in Government service have been dragged into the scandal, not to mention the names of Attorney General Daugherty and the late President Harding. Every one whose name is connected with the scandal is responsible for some unjust transaction. Each one committed a criminal act.</p>
   <p>Let us delve [into some of the details]. In the states of Wyoming and California the Government owns oil wells that have never been developed. Twenty years ago the Government decided that these wells should remain under the supervision of the Navy Department. They were to be reserved for later use by the American Navy. When Harding became President he appointed Mr. Fall as Secretary of the Interior; and this secretary allowed the big oil magnates to <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0346.jpg" n="2"/>engage in a series of underhand deals involving the Government oil fields in Wyoming and California. Mr. Fall was a friend of two of the oil magnates, Sinclair and Doheny; they made the underhand deals with Mr. Fall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fall, as Secretary of the Interior did not have the jurisdiction over the oil wells, they were controlled by the Secretary of the Navy. Therefore, it was necessary to obtain the approval of the President to turn over the wells to the department of the interior. Mr. Fall saw to it that President Harding should sanction the transfer; Mr. Denby, the Secretary of the Navy was to know and approve the move. Then Mr. Fall entered into a contract with the two oil magnates and gave Mr. Doheny access to one oil well in California and Mr. Sinclair access to another in Wyoming. After securing the leases, Mr. Doheny declared that he himself expected a profit of not less than a hundred million dollars from these small transactions.</p>
   <p>Also part of the general agreement between Mr. Fall and the two oil men was the agreement that the money which the Navy Department received for the leases <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0347.jpg" n="3"/>should be used for specific departmental purposes. This decision also had the full approval of President Harding since he had to approve the leases.</p>
   <p>Senator Caraway [of Arkansas], who is leading the attack [on the Administration] brought out the following facts:</p>
   <p>1. President Harding had no authority, without the approval of Congress, to permit the leasing of the oil fields to private individuals. The only branch of the Government that has full power over its property is Congress. The President has no authority to spend one cent, or transact any business whereby either Government funds or property change hands, without the approval of Congress. In this case President Harding did not secure any authorization.</p>
   <p>2. Secretary of the Navy Denby had no authority to use the money he received for the lease, which amounted to one hundred million dollars, for his department without the approval of Congress. No department <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0348.jpg" n="4"/>has the authority to spend Government funds without receiving permission from Congress.</p>
   <p>3. These transactions were made secretly. It is hardly feasible that neither President Harding nor Secretary of the Navy Denby did not understand why their colleague, Mr. Fall, had requested that they turn the entire deal relating to the oil wells over to him.</p>
