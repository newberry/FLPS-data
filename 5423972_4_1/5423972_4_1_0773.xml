   <p>The short duration of the cloakmakers' strike in Chicago is a happy phenomenon. It indicates that both sides arrived at an immediate understanding, regulating their negotiations so that in the future they may work together in greatest harmony. Naturally, cloak manufacturers had to make concessions to workers in order to give them reason to return quickly and to resume their work. We must give them (the cloak manufacturers) credit for their quick action. A prolonged strike would have spelled ruin for both parties, the industry and the workers. A very important third party would also have suffered thereby, namely, the workers' unfortunate Jewish relatives in Russia, Poland, Galicia, and Rumania.</p>
   <p>In many Eastern European countries money can now be sent directly to the individual. When the Jewish worker in America earns a salary he does not <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0774.jpg" n="2"/>need to rely on relief societies but can, in most instances, send his money directly to the relatives across the sea. This is only possible if he works steadily and receives a good wage. If not, he must strike for many weeks, depending on a minimum to satisfy his own needs and to carry him through the bad times.</p>
   <p>If both parties had this in mind when they decided to end the strike quickly, then they have certainly earned the gratitude of many war victims who depend on the aid received from the well-employed, well-paid Jewish cloakmakers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The quick adjustment of differences between cloak manufacturers and workers is also, indirectly, from a social and economic point of view, a happy and welcome phenomenon. Manufacturers have demonstrated their comprehension of the trend of the times. Today we are experiencing one of the most critical moments in the economic existence of mankind. New economic and socioeconomic factors seek to improve upon and to displace the old forms. Old <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0775.jpg" n="3"/>economic modes and methods cannot compare or compete with new ones. We do not believe that a stubborn, old, economic conservatism can save the old system. On the contrary, the more stubborn the old economic forces are, the greater are their chances of becoming obliterated.</p>
   <p>The time in which Capital dictated its terms and the workers had to accept them, is past. The concept wherein the producing forces are entitled to earn a decent living without being wage slaves any longer, as in the good old days, is at present too strongly entrenched not only in the minds of workers, but also in the minds of all other classes of people. The present strife between Capital and Labor no longer entails wages only, it demands a better, a finer, a more pleasant way of living. In England, for instance, the struggle between Capital and Labor called for fewer working hours.</p>
   <p>The English workman will compromise on the question of wages but not on the working-time schedule. He understands that his right to live and enjoy life is as well founded as that of any other class of people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0776.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Should he spend his entire day in the factory, when will he enjoy life? In earlier times (Middle Ages) the worker was promised his reward in the next world. The Christian Church, especially, of that time, set up the poor man as an assured candidate for Eden, in order the better to exploit him in this world. Today the worker no longer accepts this illusion of a heavenly reward; he wants cash in this world, which demand is, of course, not wrong. It is the destined duty of Capital to acknowledge the workers' right to money in this world. He is entitled to enjoy life the same as everyone else. In order to do so, he must have two things: the necessary means and the necessary time. This means, better wages and fewer working hours.</p>
   <p>We doubt very much whether Capital will be the loser in the long run, if it acknowledges its duties to the worker. We still believe that well-paid, well-rested, satisfied workers can accomplish more and produce more than badly paid, tired, embittered workers. It is hard to believe that the clever agents of Capital cannot recognize this.</p>

   <p>The transition from piece work to time work and weekly wages in the cloakmaking industry must certainly be a disagreeable one to manufacturers who are at present loaded with orders. But from a broad social and economic point of view, the establishment of a weekly wage and a forty-four-hour work week is one of the most important socio-economic reforms in America's economic life. The fact that Jews were the first to install this important reform--the cloakmaking industry being almost entirely in Jewish hands--fills us with pride and stands as a credit to our nation. This reform will not be limited to the cloakmaking industry alone. It must find its way into other industries, and to us Jews will belong the credit for seeing it through. Millions of people will thank us for it, for making their lives pleasanter and easier.</p>
   <p>It is very important to fix firmly the fact that to both sides, the Jewish workers and the Jewish manufacturers, belongs the credit for this great deed, and as we have grounds to be happy with the improved livelihood of our workers so we have reason to be proud that Jewish manufacturers in a great industry were the first to recognize the duties of Capitalism.</p>
