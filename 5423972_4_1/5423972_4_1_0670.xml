   <p>All preparations have been completed to receive delegates and guests to the Second Annual Peace Conference to be held in Chicago, the first week in May. The First National Peace Conference was held in New York, in 1907, at the same time the Second Hague Conference took place. The First National Peace Conference contributed much to the important conference at the Hague, where delegates of forty-four nations got together in a friendly atmosphere.</p>
   <p>The Congress in Chicago would have a similar purpose, as well as to strengthen the will of the United States for international arbitration in times of stress between nations. Another task would be what steps to take a realize the old dream, of insuring a permanent peace amongst nations.</p>
   <p>Let's hope that the Peace Conference in Chicago would bring the desired results, and that the ideals of a general peace, with which friends of humanity have been advocating, will be realized. However, peace on earth will never have much value if the rights of weak and persecuted nations will not be assured by the stronger nations. Nations that have been driven away from their countries, should get their lands back and be helped to return to their fatherlands. All nations must be free and equal, and should live and tend to their affairs without fear <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0671.jpg" n="2"/>of aggression by their stronger neighbors. Then, and only then, can we hope of having lasting peace amongst nations.</p>
