   <p>If for instance, an ordinary Jewish rabbi of a congregation should deliver a sermon, and mention the historical fact that Rabbi Samuel Hakoten was head of a Talmudic academy in Pompodito, it would not be surprising, because first, it is not surprising news, and second, we knew it already, and did not need to be informed of it. On the contrary, however, if a learned doctor of high social standing should tell us in English or German that Rabbi Samuel Hakoten was rector of the Hochshule in Pompodito--he thus becomes a professor of rabbinical literature, and if he is still single, he can wed a girl with a large dowry. It seems as though both have uttered the same thing, but who makes the statement, and under what circumstances it is made, makes a great difference.</p>
   <p>We say this in reference to the tempest that Theodore Roosevelt raised in Chicago yesterday by his slogan "Americanism and Preparedness."</p>
   <p>As a slogan it is ineffective. In the course of a year or more, these two words in this connection have not stopped ringing in our ears. The newspapers are full <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0592.jpg" n="2"/>of them. The present administration in Washington, and President Wilson do not stop talking about Americanism and Preparedness. Yet, by his slogan, Mr. Roosevelt stirred up everybody in Chicago, just as if he had coined these words for the first time. Mr. Roosevelt himself says that this is nothing new because he preached the same thing in 1905.</p>
   <p>Upon analyzing the significance of these two words, we find that they reveal absolutely no new idea. What is Americanism? Loyalty to America and American institutions. It is understood that every American citizen wishes Godspeed to America and to American institutions. What is preparedness? Preparation, America should be prepared to encounter an enemy although Mr. Henry Ford and his "Rodef Sholom" (Road to Peace) congregation are opposed to preparedness, we know that their arguments go unheeded, and that their number is so insignificant that they can make no impression on the political course of America. Although everyone knows that peace is a blessing for every nation, yet every American also knows that it takes at least two to make a bargain. America wants peace. But what if <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0593.jpg" n="3"/>Japan should decide that war might be more profitable for her? Japan-- it should not be forgotten--has a distinguished army of two million, a powerful navy and has every reason from her point of view, not to be satisfied with America. Japan can send an army to Mexico and attack the United States from land. The Mexicans cannot resist the Japanese army, and in all probability, will even support the Japanese.</p>
   <p>America understands this full well, and there are very few Americans who are opposed to preparedness.</p>
   <p>And yet, Mr. Roosevelt's slogan, "Americanism and Preparedness" was received with great enthusiasm, just as though it were a brand-new invention. But it was Mr. Roosevelt who said it--that explains everything. It is not what is said, but who says it--that is the principal thing.</p>
   <p>The Republicans remember Mr. Roosevelt for his political victories, notwithstanding his assistance three years ago, to the democrats by causing the Progressive party to break away from the Republican. His prospects for a Republican nomination are good, and the public is aware of it. On his lips, a slogan like <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0594.jpg" n="4"/>"Americanism and Preparedness" gains new meaning. Behind this slogan lies a hidden meaning, but everyone recognizes it. "Only give me the nomination, and let me reenter the White House--I will show you what Americanism and Preparedness mean. You know what [kind of] a bird I am."</p>
   <p>The public understood this, and that is why the slogan caused such a sensation. That is why the cry, "We want Teddy" was raised even though his visit to Chicago was [supposedly] non-political.</p>
   <p>Wilson also speaks of Americanism and Preparedness, and he speaks beautifully and forcefully. But to the adherents of Roosevelt, these words have a different gusto when they come from his [Roosevelt's] mouth.</p>
