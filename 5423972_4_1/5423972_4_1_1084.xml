   <p>Mr. T. V. Foderly, head of the Information Bureau of the Department of Immigration, has recently declared that during last year 19,891 immigrants turned to his division in search of work, especially agricultural work. He proposes that the government of the United States should consider the question of unemployment and establish local, as well as central bureaus of employment.</p>
   <p>He also revealed that 3,086 naturalized citizens sought information concerning work.</p>
   <p>Apparently, this proposal will be adopted by the government, because no other condition is so undesirable in this country as unemployment. Though we have a permanent industrial reserve army as large as the one in <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1085.jpg" n="2"/>England, the system under which work is regulated is far worse than in any other country.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows how bad it is to depend upon private employment bureaus, which prosper on the unemployed. It stands to reason that private agencies do their best to skin every individual who fails into their clutches, and we often hear that besides swindling their victims by extorting their last few pennies, they never give the type of work they promise.</p>
   <p>Moreover, it has recently become known that these private agencies make matters worse for the unemployed by announcing that there is a great deal of work to be had in the cities where they operate, which in turn brings thousands and thousands of workers, from near and far, who become dependent upon the employment bureaus. Everyone can readily see that the more unemployed people there are in the city, the greater volume of business they do.</p>
   <p>Still another factor enters in that exposes the social weakness of the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1086.jpg" n="3"/>private agencies, namely, that they are a permanent tool in the hands of the bosses for the advantage of supplying strike-breakers. They often send workers to another city where a strike is in progress. These people, who invested money in agencies and in railroad tickets, are easily lured into becoming scabs, against their own will.</p>
   <p>It is therefore of the utmost importance that employment bureaus be in the hands of the government, which is closely in touch with all sections of the country, and the unemployed will know that they are not being deceived.</p>
   <p>A good beginning has already been made in New York. Notwithstanding that this task has been undertaken in such hard times, it is hoped that the New York Minicipal Bureau of Unemployment will accomplish a great deal on this field. If, however, free government bureaus were established throughout the entire land as a permanent institution, it would be a real consolation <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1087.jpg" n="4"/>for the unemployed.</p>
   <p>A new inspiration will then become apparent. The mere fact of having the government come in contact with the unemployed would lessen unemployment in general.</p>
