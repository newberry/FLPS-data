   <p>Who has not heard of Congressman Henry Goldjogel, the first Jewish congressman? His name is known far and wide - wherever a Jew abides. Congressman Goldjogel wrote to Congressman Sabbath as follows:</p>
   <p>"My dear Congressman:</p>
   <p>During my stay in Chicago, I have heard that there is opposition to your being nominated to Congress, and I hope that by now this opposition is so insignificant, that you really need not worry about it.</p>
   <p>"You have been a very fine Representative in Congress, and when I say this, I know that I know that I am expressing the opinion of all my colleagues - the New York Congressmen. You have so zealously defended the interests of your District, that there should be no question in any one's mind as to sending you back to Congress. The intelligent and highly satisfactory work which you have performed in the Committee on Immigration, alone, should be sufficient to influence the Chicago public, particularly those <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0313.jpg" n="2"/>who came from foreign lands, and above all, the children of Israel, to vote for you.</p>
   <p>"It is very seldom that a man, who serves only part of a term, gains as many friends as you did during your brief term in Congress. I know how you labored attending to the hundreds of details congressmen are obliged to attend to in Washington. It was my sincere pleasure to hear all congressmen speak of your efficient and satisfactory service.</p>
   <p>"I hope that the people of your District will recognize the fact, that in you they have a real standard-bearer of the people, and will send you back to Congress, without too much effort on your part.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Henry M. Goldjogel."</p>
   <p>When Mr. Goldjogel was in Chicago, he was interviewed by a reporter of the Daily Jewish Courier. The contents of the interview are: Having been in Congress for eight years, I am convinced, that it is necessary for the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0314.jpg" n="3"/>Jewish people to have Jewish congressmen in the House of Representatives. It is not, God forbid, because our law-makers are in any way against the Jews. We can readily depend upon the average freedom-loving, tolerant America, in every case, that he will make no distinction between a Jew and non-Jew. But with the enormous influx of immigrants during recent years, the majority of whom have not as yet had an opportunity to become Americanized, there exist problems which are unknown to the average American, but which the Jewish congressman knows perfectly well. It is also necessary for him to obtain the sanction of his colleagues, in order to win the desired proposals.</p>
   <p>When, for instance, a question arises as to whether or not an immigrant to the United states, should know the language of his native country, the non-Jewish congressmen could not imagine that it is possible for Jews from Russia, Poland or other countries to be well educated in Jewish and yet not know the language of the country.</p>
