   <p>Last Sunday afternoon and evening the Jews on the West Side had the opportunity of hearing the great Jewish tenor, Medvediev, with his company, at the Douglas Park Auditorium. This is the first time that a concert has been given with real Jewish folk songs, by noted Jewish singers. All those who were at the concert listening to the folk songs must admit that the Yiddish language, Jewish melodies are not orphans any more, for the Jewish folk songs are creations of the nation in itself, which were sung by the old grandmothers while rocking their grandchildren to sleep, or by the Jewish laborers at their daily tasks. It was really a pleasure to see how the enthusiastically large crowd listened to the old folk songs, so beautifully sung in the Yiddish language by the great tenor. He, in his artistic genius, pictured the old Jewish Hebrew teacher, whom they call the "Reby" who talks, to the Jewish youngster, teaching him the "Alef Baiz," which means the A. B. C. in the Hebrew Language. This song is called the "Cheder."</p>

   <p>The great singer made such an impression on the audience as they were reminded of their childhood days when their "Reby" came for them the first time to take them to "Cheder," (the Hebrew school). Madam Rosawsky Medvediev, soprano, with great talent and skill sang the songs "The Child Lies in the Cradle" and "The Golden Pea-Cock."</p>
   <p>B. Corpowsky, the baritone, sang the songs: "I Shall Be A Rabbi." This song was sung according to the old Jewish custom and was well liked by the audience.</p>
   <p>The violinist, Samuel Gardner, with his wonderful masterly technique, filled everyone's heart with Jewish nostalgia.</p>
   <p>The two concerts by Mr. Medvediev, without a doubt, were the most appreciated entertainments on the West Side.</p>
