<title level="a">HARRY A LIPSKY APPOINTED ELECTION COMMISSIONER</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Harry A. Lipsky, general manager of the Courier, who has hitherto occupied the office of Chairman of the Cook County Civil Service Commission, was appointed yesterday, by Judge E. K. Jarecki, as one of the three new members of the Board of Election Commissioners. Immediately following the official announcement, Mr. Lipsky and the other new members of the Board took the oath of office in the presence of a large number of friends who came to congratulate them and also wish them success.</p>
   <p>The other two new members of the Election Board are Anthony Czarnecki and Robert W. McKinley, Lipsky and McKinley are Democrats, whereas Czarnecki represents the Republicans.</p>
   <p>The office of an Election Commissioner is one of the most important offices in Cook County. The Board of Election Commissioners has full authority over the elections held in Chicago. The Board, which consists of representatives <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0227.jpg" n="2"/>from the two major political parties, sees to it that the elections are run honestly and that citizens have absolute freedom to voice their opinions on governmental affairs at the ballot box. Only people of sound character are given such an important office. Judge Jarecki appointed Mr. Lipsky upon the merits of his distinguished record as a member of the County Civil Service Commission and also as a member of the Board of Education under Mayor Harrison.</p>
