   <p>Who, among us, has never noticed the fact that adult Jews who come here from European countries, are very often able to find some means of making a livelihood, which holds a future for them, much quicker than their children who were either born or were raised in this country? If an individual has not yet become aware of this phenomenon, he needs only to look around with open eyes, and then he will be convinced that this is a fact.</p>
   <p>The reader who will be inclined to doubt the correctness of this assertion will certainly point out to us thousands of young Jewish men who have succeeded in their undertakings, and who have even achieved some degree of wealth. He will point to young people who have studied, or who have made themselves useful in their fathers' businesses, or who have proved to be successful salesmen, agents, etc. We acknowledge that this is true.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0982.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Should we select, from the successful young Jewish men, those who are not only capable of earning a livelihood--even a comfortable one--but who are also likely to improve [themselves] and make a success of their lives, we will immediately understand that they are the exceptions to the rule. The average young American-born man lives from hand to mouth, and doesn't think about his future.</p>
   <p>In this respect, he [the young American-born] ranks lower than the newly arrived young greenhorn who constantly thinks about the future, from the very moment he begins to earn a dollar. When the young native-born American sets out to look for a job, he may find many which do not rate very high socially, and which do not pay enough. He will hesitate to accept such jobs. As an American, who knows the language and who sees that others are "making good," he is reluctant to accept just anything. And if he does get a job, he does not think about a rainy day. This is an American characteristic. There isn't a people in the whole civilized world with so little foresight and so little industry as the Americans. They inherited this attitude from their forefathers, who came to a vast country rich in [natural] resources. Because these resources [were abundant], <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0983.jpg" n="3"/>the forefathers took things for granted and would not provide for a rainy day. Statistics prove it. In Switzerland, for example, out of every thousand inhabitants, five hundred are successful, i. e., they provide for the future, practice economy, and save money. In France, out of every thousand, three hundred and forty-three are successful; in Germany, three hundred and seventeen; in Italy, two hundred and twenty; and in the United States, only ninety-nine. And our [Jewish] children who become Americanized adopt, above all else, this American disregard for money, and the confidence of Americans, viz., that this is a land of opportunity and why bother about tomorrow.</p>
   <p>There are thousands of young men from eighteen to twenty-two years of age who go about idle. These young men seek only jobs that will suit them. Meanwhile, they are supported either by their parents, or by some other means. On the other hand, the greenhorn who must get along and has no one to fall back on, accepts any job he lays his hands on. As soon as he earns <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0984.jpg" n="4"/>a dollar, he immediately thinks about the future, and he starts saving some money.</p>
   <p>The late James J. Hill, railroad magnate and empire builder, at one time expressed this remarkably wise and practical thought: "If you want to know whether you are destined to be a success or a failure, you can find out quite easily. The test is simple and infallible. Are you capable of saving money? If not, take yourself out of the 'can succeed' list. You have lost. You may think you haven't, but you will lose as sure as death, because the seed of success is not in you."</p>
   <p>This thought is not new. King Solomon said something to this effect long ago. But James J. Hill said it in an American idiom.</p>
   <p>This tradition of letting tomorrow care for itself, because this is a land of plenty, can be traced back to the time when land could be obtained for the taking, when forests were free, when the field and air were replete <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0985.jpg" n="5"/>with game, with beast and fowl. In America the amount that is thrown out, through the kitchen door into the garbage can, could feed millions of people. When our [Jewish] young men become Americanized, they adopt this American trait. Their lack of foresight and their inability to save any money are signs of their bad fortune. They will never attain the success that their greenhorn, un-Americanized fathers attained.</p>
   <p>America is also beginning to realize that the time has come for people to begin to save and to practice economy. Those who are not so well off, need to take immediate steps in this direction by starting to practice economy now.</p>
