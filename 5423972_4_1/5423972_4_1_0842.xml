   <p>In the coming election, the Board of Cook County Commissioners will implore the local citizens to confirm a loan of $4,000,000, through the issuance of bonds, in order to complete the construction of the new Cook County Hospital.</p>
   <p>Four years ago the local citizen granted the issuance of $3,000,000 worth of bonds for the purpose of constructing a new county hospital. At that time we were certain this $3,000,000 would be sufficient to construct a hospital equipped with all the modern improvements. But the Cook County officials know nothing of the art of economizing or sparing when it is a matter of the public's money. And why should they economize or spare? They were not elected to their offices for the sake of the public's interests. Those having power to nominate and appoint their candidate, do so not because this or that candidate is a true friend of the people. In politics <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0843.jpg" n="2"/>the whole of society benefits by mutual aid, and when the one who is elected has personal obligations to individuals, he must fulfill them on society's account, if he is a politically honest man.</p>
   <p>No one accuses the Cook County Commissioners of closing such contracts as have been closed by the convicted Tammany Hall politicians of New York State. But still less will anyone dare to praise those who have wasted the vast sum of $3,000,000 by claiming that they have acted entirely virtuous upon closing contracts and handing out jobs; that they have done everything for the good of all, manifesting administrative and financial competency.</p>
   <p>The dead are not removed from the grave. Nor does public money, which has gone to waste, resuscitate; not even in the minds of those who believe in most anything. The question now is not what has been achieved in the past four years with the $3,000,000, but whether we should grant another $4,000,000 to complete the hospital?</p>
   <p>The answer to the question can not be two-sided. The present Commissioners of Cook County have proved to be inept to administer such a huge sum of <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0844.jpg" n="3"/>public money. The citizens of Chicago are not assured that these commissioners will not waste the new sum of $4,000,000. They (the Board of Cook County Commissioners) are like simpletons or children who lose everything given to them. They, therefore, can not be entrusted with anything. Thus every earnest citizen should vote against the issuance of new bonds.</p>
   <p>The contention that the hospital must be completed would have substance if the Cook County Commissioners were elected for a few decades. But, as the case is, re-elections will be held this fall. Then the people will fully know that the newly elected need be entrusted with a sum of $4,000,000 to complete the County Hospital. The citizens will have to assume the responsibility of not electing simpletons or children for commissioners, but honest men who should be capable of directing public affairs.</p>
