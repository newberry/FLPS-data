   <p>A New Department Store of Rothschild Co.</p>
   <p>One of the greatest department stores of the world will be opened on State St., an enterprise which has at its disposal unlimited capital. The head of this concern is Mr. Abraham N. Rothschild, a business man of extraordinary capabilities. He immigrated to the United States in the year 1866 and went first to Davenport, Iowa, where he worked in the retail store of his brother.</p>
   <p>Later on he formed the firm of E. Rothschild Bros. who have branches all over the country. After the great Chicago fire of 1871, he came to Chicago and opened a small business in W. Madison St. The business grew and prospered and in 1875 the firm opened a wholesale house at the corner of Madison and Market St., but already, in the year 1881, the localities were too small and they moved to much larger premises, at Monroe St., where they still are, Mr. Rothschild has been manager of various retail, wholesale, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1487.jpg" n="2"/>and banking undertakings, and was president of the "Palace Clothing Co." which had businesses in Minneapolis, Kansas City, and other cities in the West. One of the partners is Mr. Nelson Morris, known as the chief of one of the greatest meat packing houses of the world, also Mr. Herbert N. and Mr. Ira Morris. The management of the new undertaking is exclusively carried out by Mr. Rothschild and Mr. Lazarus.</p>
   <p>The firm M. Rothschild and Co, intend to take the whole front on State St. between Van Buren and Jackson, but at present, some store-keepers still have contracts which run to July. The building on State and Van Buren has seven floors, with an electrical tower displaying Chicago's enterprise. All floors, except the basement and top floor, are for the sale of merchandise. The basement contains the engines for steam heat and electric light, also for the electrical tower.</p>
   <p>Two-thousand persons will be employed. This number will be doubled when the planned annex is taken over. The business will introduce several new <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1488.jpg" n="3"/>departments unique in the history of Department Stores.</p>
   <p>The well known reputation of the founders, their business abilities, their capitalistic background, guarantee a good success and the hope, that it will become one of the greatest and best conducted Department Stores of Chicago.</p>
