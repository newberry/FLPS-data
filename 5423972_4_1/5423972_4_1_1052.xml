   <p>There is a God that rules in heaven, and a boss that rules on earth. Bosses rule, political or otherwise, - what is the difference where, - New York, Mexico or Kiev, - whether it be Sutzer, or Bailis, - you find him everywhere. The mob hollers "Hurrah!", dances and shouts at his command. Mexico does as Hoarto demands, New York judges do as Murphy asks. Therefore, have no fear for suffragettes, women's votes. With soft heart and gentle understanding they will follow in all the footsteps of man. For the mighty boss they will dance, bow and curtsy. Might and arrogance are enshrined by both sexes. Everyone wishes to possess them, especially the weaker sex. The woman may rule in her own home, boss her own husband, but, when it comes to politics she will forget this superiority remembering only that she is a woman, a weak and tender person who envies man his physical strength and therefore showers him with love. And, should he also possess <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1053.jpg" n="2"/>power, then her love is doubled. She puts him on a pedestal, makes him boss and gives him her vote. The best of them will side as the men do, which means two votes for the boss. The boss is, and will be, suffragettes or no suffragettes. He rules whether it be in America, Russia or Mexico.</p>
