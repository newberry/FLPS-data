   <p>The Jewish Shelter Home will hold a Mass Meeting, Tuesday October 20, at 8 P. M., at Columbia Hall, South West Side corner of Halsted and 12th Street. All Jews of Chicago are urged to be there.</p>
   <p>BROTHERS AND SISTERS:</p>
   <p>As you already know, there are over 16,000 hungry school children in our city of Chicago. Many of these unfortunates are Jewish children, whose parents are unable to support them. Our Jewish children have always been remarkable students, but starvation and undernourishment rob them of their mental facilities. Moreover, these poor children are dying of starvation, and if properly provided for, they would grow to be the pride of the Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0926.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>BROTHERS AND SISTERS:</p>
   <p>The responsibility is placed upon our shoulders. We must help the parents of these children, so that they may be able to feed them. The Jewish Shelter Home is doing all in its power to relieve this situation. You who are members of our society can see how much good your nickels are doing.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact, that our society is the interest of all men and women of the City of Chicago, we are calling a Mass Meeting, in order to explain the work and duties of our society.</p>
   <p>We urge every one, member or non-member, to come to this Mass Meeting.</p>
   <p>By all means be there and hear the shocking reports.</p>
   <p>Respectrully yours,</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
