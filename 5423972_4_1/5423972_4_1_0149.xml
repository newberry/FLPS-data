   <p>Leonard I. Wissman, well known Chicago attorney, has been appointed Assistant State's Attorney of Cook Country.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wissman has practiced law here since 1917. He first attracted public notice in the notorious "Parlor Banker" case in which a number of Lawn-dale residents had been mulcted of sums aggregating $100,000. Due to Wissman's able prosecution of the case, all the culprits were brought to light, and approximately 60 per cent of the loot was recovered.</p>
   <p>In 1918, he again attracted wide attention by his suit against Swift &amp; Company, in which he charged the packers with illegal methods and illegal combination. The charges were later sustained by the Federal Government, and the packers combination ordered dissolved.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0150.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Another interesting case was the recent one of the Twin Tube &amp; Rubber Company, wherein close to a $1,000,000 had been obtained through the sale of worthless stock. This was the last case tried before Judge Landis, and the local press carried accounts of praise accorded Wissman by that noted jurist.</p>
   <p>Attorney Wissman is a member of the Chicago and Illinois Bar Association, and is also a member of the Masons, Knights of Pythias, B'nai B'rith Young Men's Charities, and the Zionist organization.</p>
