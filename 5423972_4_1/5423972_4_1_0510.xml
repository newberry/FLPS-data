   <p>A letter from a Jewish soldier stationed at Camp Grant was received by the office of the Courier, which reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Together with me rooms another Jewish Soldier, a very fine chap. Every time he sees me receiving a letter from my sweetheart, he becomes melancholic. He envies me when my girl writes to me. He says that on account of bashfulness he did not make the acquaintance of girls and therefore has no one to write to him. In our camp, as well as in other camps, there are thousands of such young men. Why shouldn't Jewish girls write to them? The Christian girls do it and that gives great satisfaction to the soldiers, who are often very lonesome."</p>
   <p>The suggestion of this Jewish soldier is not only brilliant but useful all around as well. Particularly for those soldiers who long for a Jewish letter, it would be a treasure to find a girl who is able to write Jewish. And a Jewish girl who writes only English will also find an "intended" Jewish soldier who <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0511.jpg" n="2"/>would be thankful to receive a letter. It seems to us that the Soldiers Welfare of the B'nai B'rith would gladly furnish the names and addresses of such Jewish soldiers. It also seems to us that there should be many Jewish daughters who would want to do this act of benevolence.</p>
