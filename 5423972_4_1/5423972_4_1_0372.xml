   <p>The Jury could not reach a verdict in the third trial of the election fraud, and the suit against the accused must, therefore, be continued. As we know, two persons were found guilty in the first trial, and the jury acquitted five people in the second trial.</p>
   <p>These decisions, rendered by the jury, can probably afford a pretext to those who are against investigating the election fraud and against convicting the swindlers by claiming that the prosecution has no ample grounds on which to build the charges. But viewing the matter from an impartial standpoint, we arrive at the conclusion that it is only but right that action against the accused be continued with all the expedience and vigor that the city can possibly command. That irregularities <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0373.jpg" n="2"/>had been carried on in the counting and balancing of votes was shown in each trial. There is no doubt that patriots have exaggerated somewhat in reporting the number of votes for their favorite candidates. This is a crime which must be uprooted, and the city, through its authorities, should apply all efforts to put an end to this form of crime. It is certainly difficult to single out the one person responsible for this crime. That is why the jury renders a decision of not guilty, or can not reach a verdict. But the principal thing is not whether or not the accused are sentenced; the main thing is to eradicate the fraud. By bringing the guilty to justice, the big "patriotic" boosters of certain candidates will not be so willing to take a chance.</p>
   <p>Whoever can remember will recall that a few years ago there was going on, among the West Side Jewish "politicians," some sort of braggadocio. They would claim that they used to "count in" and "count out" certain candidates on election day.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0374.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The indictment in the Healey-Weiman controversy yielded good results, which lasted for a few years. Further action against the election fraud of 1912 will bring about cleaner and better elections in the future, even if none of the accused is sent to jail.</p>
