  <body>
   <p>In the entire history of mankind there cannot be found another generation as sinful and criminal as ours. No other generation has been as bestial and cruel as our unfortunate generation. In the dark ages there still remained peaceful, bright corners on earth where some form of ethics and morals endured thereby justifying the entire race.</p>
   <p>When we look however at the present situation, it would seem that the whole world from east to west, from north to south is encircled by an infernal Gehenna and is deluged with bloody sin.</p>
   <p>Perhaps still more criminal than the war countries are the so-called neutral countries. In essence neutrality is a sin from a moral standpoint. To stand <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0630.jpg" n="2"/>by cold-bloodedly and witness the commission of a crime means to become a greater criminal, especially when [one profits by that crime]--when [one fattens on another's blood]--this is not only a horrible sin but [it is disgusting and ugly as well]. The so-called neutral countries are now [feeding and thriving upon European blood.</p>
   <p>And should the war countries find some justification in the eyes of history [for their agony and travail]--the neutral, "Peaceful" nations will find no such justification, and [the verdict of history will fall heavily].</p>
   <p>To the question--Why did you remain silent when mankind was drowning in its own blood--they will be unable to answer and like thieves in the night, [they will hide themselves].</p>
   <p>Our generation is entirely guilty of the present blood-bath which is <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0631.jpg" n="3"/>unparalleled in history. [Also to blame are] the artists and poets who were deluded and intoxicated by the smell of blood. The future historian will look contemptuously upon their art and will have little confidence in it because he will believe rightfully that the artists were lacking in the human spirit. In all their beautiful works, in all their great truths, the future historian will detect plagiarism, imitations from ancient times when man was still a savage.</p>
   <p>All are guilty from the extreme leftists to the extreme rightists, from the ultra-orthodox to the ultra-heterodox..... Equally with the leaders of the socialists, the leaders of the church will stand before the future judgment day of history..... Perhaps the socialists are more to blame in this war than the Catholics and other religious groups, because the present war of munitions and technical instruments is in the hands of the working masses. If the socialist leaders had not allowed themselves <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0632.jpg" n="4"/>to be deluded by the various ministers of portfolio, perhaps the war would not exist.</p>
   <p>A generation is guilty--with but one fortunate or unfortunate exception--the Jews. With lofty heads Israel can stand proudly before the future court of nations. With righteousness can we proclaim; our hands did not cause this bloodshed.... We were neutral but we did not profit from our neutrality.....On the contrary, we suffered more than all the nations, despite the fact that we had no "interests" in the war. We were neutral. We did not want war but we did not stand aloof. Our neutrality was disinterested for our wounds were perhaps more severe and painful than [those of others].</p>
   <p>"An entire generation is guilty" --but one light [may castigate their crime--the light of our needless agony].</p>
