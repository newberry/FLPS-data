   <p>Chicago's musical prodigy, little Abie Shynman, is soon to be taken abroad to complete his studies in Vienna. The young musician, who is but nine years of age, is already qualified to teach. He has been granted a preparatory certificate by the Balatka Musical College. He won the honor of being the youngest music teacher, in two years, under the instruction of Miss Anna Balatka. Young Shynman is also a composer and his productions have been favorably criticized by the most competent judges. He was born at Newcastle-on-the-Tyne, England, and at the age of four years took part in a benefit concert at Cardiff, South Wales. He lives with his parents at 566 N. Ashland Ave. A grand benefit concert will be tendered Abie, under the auspices of the faculty of Balatka Musical College, at Kimball Hall, on the evening of October 24th.</p>
