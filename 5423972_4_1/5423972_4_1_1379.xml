   <p>The Community State Bank, the successor to the old Twelfth Street Savings Bank, is located in the building occupied by the latter bank at 1637 West Twelfth Street. The new institution has proven itself to be a trustworthy and honorable institution during the war period. It has never accepted the responsibility of sending money to Europe merely for its own profit: the safe delivery of the money has always been [the primary concern of the bank]. It, therefore, repeatedly warned its customers not to send money to those parts [of Europe] that were still in a war turmoil. This precautionary move on the part of the bank has saved [its clients] thousands of dollars, and prevented thousands of Jews from suffering unpleasant and bitter [financial] experiences. The Community State Bank stands ready to prove these assertions, and is willing to accept all challenges to the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1380.jpg" n="2"/>contrary from any other bank.</p>
   <p>Now that the war turmoil has subsided and normal relations have been resumed with nearly all the European countries, money can be sent, with a reasonable amount of security, to Poland, Rumania, Lithuania, Austrian Galicia, Germany, and Palestine. Send your money through the agency of the Community State Bank. It has a reputation for being trustworthy and reasonable. It is ready to guarantee safety and punctuality [of delivery], and satisfaction to all; for the Community State Bank is an institution which does not place profit above service. The rapid growth of the bank is the best proof of its popularity and honorableness.</p>
   <p>Open a savings' or checking account in this neighborhood bank. Your money will be safe, and you will be satisfied with your service.</p>
   <p>Safety boxes may be rented for less than a cent a day. Protect your valuables and jewelry from fire and theft.</p>
