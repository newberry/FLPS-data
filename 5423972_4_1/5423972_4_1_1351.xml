   <p>Yesterday the "fall-opening" arranged by the Halsted and Roosevelt businessmen, which will last until Tuesday, November first, began. It is a real carnival. All the stores on Halsted Street, between Fourteenth Street and Gilpin Place, and from Union Avenue to Peoria Street, are overloaded with various kinds of merchandise, which is being sold at low prices. The whole neighborhood has been magnificently decorated, music is being played, and big crowds from the West Side and from other districts are being attracted.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, when the carnival opened, the stores were full of customers. The businessmen expect the same to be true throughout the entire carnival, because during this time they offer great bargains. An extraordinary amount of business was done yesterday at the L. Klein and Twelfth Street Department Stores, and also at cloak stores, clothing stores, millinery stores, shoe stores, woolen stores and restaurants, and particularly at Golds' Restaurant. This big up-to-date Jewish restaurant on the West Side is one <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1352.jpg" n="2"/>of the best known in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Irving Klein, of the L. Klein store, designates the "fall-opening" of the Halsted and Roosevelt district, as a celebration of a [commercially] developed West Side. Mr. James Walsh, of the Twelfth Street Store, also refers to the affair in the same way. Mr. Samuel Bielski, president of the Halsted and Roosevelt Merchants' Association declares that this affair will confirm the motto the association, "The great West Side for greater values."</p>
