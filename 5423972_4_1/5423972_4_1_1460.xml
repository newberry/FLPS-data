   <p>The new six story building, which was built by Mr. Samuel Phillipson for his large business firm, Samuel Phillipson &amp; Company, was opened yesterday, and from early morning until late at night, thousands of friends came to wish the Jewish philanthropist good luck.</p>
   <p>Mr. Phillipson accepted the greetings of his many friends very pleasingly and told the reporter of the Daily Jewish Courier, that his business is now established in such a manner that it is not necessary for him to devote his entire time to it. He will, therefore, have an opportunity to grant more of his time to welfare work.</p>
   <p>"It is my sole and greatest desire," Mr. Phillipson said, "to do something for Chicago Jewry. The Federation is already established, in which I have helped as much as I possibly could. I hope that the Chicago Jewish contributors of the West Side will cooperate with me."</p>
