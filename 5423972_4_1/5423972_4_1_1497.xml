   <p>Perhaps the foremost position among the outstanding German private banks is taken by the Foreman Bros., 128 - 130 East Washington Street. The confidence of their customers, which the bank enjoys, is expressed in the steady increase of their business. This bank has gained the public confidence, first of all, by its conscientious and strictly just management of business matters, and also by the kind and courteous manners of the owners, which make business transactions with them a pleasure. It is not necessary to mention that the Foreman Bros. are famous as expert and shrewd financiers. The bank is doing an extensive business and has large deposits. It is striving to invest the money entrusted to them in safe and profitable investments. Foreman Bros. do not demand a large share of the profits than is just and legitimate, and this reputation gained by their honesty increases steadily the number of their clientele.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1498.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We may assert that the storms which from time to time rage against the financial institutions of this country, will be impotent against this bank, because of its solidarity and because its management is in trustworthy hands.</p>
