  <body>
   <p>No one wants to be sick. When a person has a headache he thinks he is the most sick person in the world; similarly with persons who suffer from toothache or similar ailments. Each sufferer thinks his pain is worse. But there is a much more serious ailment than headache or toothache. When this sickness is mentioned your blood turns cold, and you feel a chill going through your body.</p>
   <p>It is enough just to mention the word "Consumption", and you see the Angel of Death before you. They call this sickness "The White Plague" and "Proletarian" sickness, because from that sickness your turn pale and thin, and this disease is spread mostly among Workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0765.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The name alone is nothing. It is the conditions in which those sufferers live, that drive them into the arena of "The Angel of Death".</p>
   <p>The hard work, the long hours, the poor living quarters, the under nourishment, and the general environment, shorten the life of the Worker by ruining his health.</p>
   <p>This disease begins with holes in the lungs and ends in general shrinking of the body, loss of weight, and loss of blood. By that time the patient is a candidate for a Sanitarium.</p>
   <p>As a rule, the Worker, particularly the poor-worker, does not take care of his health. So long as he is able to remain on his feet he considers himself in good health. He continues working at his machine until he drops, or he starts spitting blood. Then only, he beings to think there is <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0766.jpg" n="3"/>something wrong with him but by that time it is too late to regain his lost health, and he begins to feel that he is dying gradually, and such suffering is worse than Death.</p>
   <p>When such victims enter a Sanitarium all efforts are made to save them, and if it is not possible at least all efforts are made to lengthen their lives. The patient, naturally, is given the best hopes that he will be able to free himself from the clutches of The Angel of Death. These hopes raise the morale of the unfortunate victim, and he begins to believe in miracles and considers even one hour's life is good.</p>
   <p>Many of these victims suffer many hardships before they succeed in entering a hospital or sanitarium.</p>
   <p>Realizing this, a few women assembled and agreed to organize a Society, whose task shall be to provide for those workers who fall victims of the Proletarian sickness. This was about three years ago. These few women organized that Society <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0767.jpg" n="4"/>under the name of the Chicago Consumptive Society. At first the Chicago Jews took very little interest in the work of these women. Gradually, the Jews of Chicago became more interested in what was being done for the consumptives and began giving donations to all undertakings of the Chicago Consumptive Aid Society. The organization, now has a membership of over a thousand men, women, and children, and the women of this Society are doing admirable work. They have until now served 68 families from gradual-death, by guarding their health before the Proletarian disease has developed.</p>
   <p>For the lighter cases; that is, such cases as where the disease is in its first stage, the Chicago Consumptive Aid Society made arrangements with the Chicago Fresh Air Hospital, to accept all patients that it will send. The Society pays $20.00 a week for each patient, and they receive the best of care there.</p>
   <p>The loyal women of the Society go through a great deal of worry to provide for the victims of Consumption. When the husband is taken to the hospital, they not only care for the husband but they also provides for the family. Food, clothing, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0768.jpg" n="5"/>milk, cream, butter and eggs are bought by the Society at wholesale prices and distributed among the patients and their families, both at home and in the hospital.</p>
   <p>Those patients sent to the fresh-air hospitals come back from there in good health.</p>
   <p>This Society saved a sick woman from being deported.</p>
   <p>The charities wanted to send this woman to the Municipal Tuberculosis Hospital, and from there the woman would have been sent back to the country from which she came, on the ground that she was a burden to the City.</p>
   <p>The Society then took this woman under its care, restored her to health, and saved her from being sent out of the United States.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Consumptive Aid Society is connected with the best physicians and lung specialists in the City who use their best medical efforts to bring their <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0769.jpg" n="6"/>patients back to health. To send patients to the hospital costs a lot of money. The Society finances this institution through entertainments, dance, raffles, picnics, tag-day, and so on. This organization arranged a ball for tonight at the Ashland Auditorium, where it is helped that the Jews of Chicago, especially the Workers, will assist this undertaking, because the consumptive institution was organized by women-workers and exists for the poor workers who are afflicted with the Proletarian disease - Consumption.</p>
   <p>The Society holds its meetings every first and third Wednesday of the month at the Labor Lyceum. Bessie Hirschberg, President, and Mrs. S.Pearlmuter is Secretary.</p>
   <p>The Society is arranging a campaign, to start building a hospital of its own.</p>
