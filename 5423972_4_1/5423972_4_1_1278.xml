   <p>To entertain thirteen million people a year, and to keep the standard of that entertainment at a point of recognized leadership, would seem to be the pinnacle of theatrical ambition.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Balaban and Katz, Chicago Jewish products of the West Side, have long held this distinctive position. Their five big motion picture houses, the Chicago, Tivoli, Riviera, Roosevelt, and Central Park theatres, are known throughout the country as the Acmes in theatrical art, presenting music, pictures, and stage programs that set the pace for others.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1279.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As vast as their prese4nt vogue is, however, the members of this firm find it necessary to build another magnificent auditorium to accommodate the ever-growing demand. The latest addition to their group of theaters, now going up at Broadway and Lawrence Avenues, will be known as the Uptown.</p>
   <p>When one contrasts the standing enjoyed today by these young, daring experimentalists with their start made a dozen years ago in a little place on 12th Street near Kedzie Avenue, hs is struck by the immense opportunities open to such as can recognize them and act. If America is the land of opportunity, Chicago seems to be its center, and more and more each year its fountain-head.</p>
