   <p>The first Chicago Jew to whom Judicial honors were given was Philip Stein. He was elected to the Superior Court of Cook Country in 1892. Philip Stein, the son of Israel and Rosette (Koppel) Stein, was born in Steele Phenisch, Russia, on March 12, 1884. He was brought to the United States as an infant and after receiving a preliminary education in grade school and high school, he entered the University of Wisconsin, where he received his A. M. degree; he then went to Europe and spent two years in the Universities of Heidelberg, Bonn and Berlin, where he continued to study jurisprudence, history and political science.</p>
   <p>Shortly after his return to Chicago he was admitted to the bar and he commenced to practice law. With Adolf Kraus, who was his brother-in-law, he organized the law firm which included Levi Mayer as one of the partners.</p>

   <p>Philip Stein more than justified the honor awarded him by his election to the Superior Court for his reputation as a great jurist with a fine legal mind and a regard for his position was at once manifested. The most intricate and complicated matters that came to the Superior Court were assigned to hom. (The system of assignment was different from the one now in vogue.)</p>
   <p>In 1898, his first term expire, he was re-elected for another term of six years. Shortly after his re-election, the Supreme Court of Illinois assigned him to the Appellate bench where he became a most useful member of that Court. On his retirement from the bench he returned to private practice and continued in that field until his death. December 24, 1922 having served him community to his utmost until the end.</p>
