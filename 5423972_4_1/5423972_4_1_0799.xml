<title level="a">LAND MONOPOLIES</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The monopoly of the natural resources of our land means the unavoidable impoverishment of many people. We are unable to have industrial justice and social welfare because of the existence of the monopoly--the monopoly of land, the monopoly of natural resources, the monopoly of power over other people's lives. The great evil of land monopoly lies in the fact that it tends to increase the number of farmers who are forced to rent land, and also makes it impossible for city people, who have no land, to become farmers. The evil of the monopoly of natural resources is shown in the miserable wages received by those who work in these fields. The natural resources from which coal, copper, silver, and all the minerals are mined, belong to gigantic corporations; they are in the hands of an exploiting class of speculators.</p>
   <p>A few figures will illustrate the fact that all the wealth of the land is <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0800.jpg" n="2"/>concentrated in the hands of the few, and that a small percentage, a few individuals control all the prices [of commodities] and all the wages [of workers] in the country. In 1914 our national income was close to twenty billion dollars. This included the interest on various loans and investments, the profits from various businesses, and wages and salaries.</p>
   <p>According to the income-tax reports, 7,509 persons, each having a net income of $50,000 or more, had a million dollars in 1914, about one-twentieth of the whole national income. There were 357,515 persons who had to pay the Federal income tax and who had a total income of about four billion dollars that year [1914], almost one-fifth of the national income.</p>
   <p>One or two per cent of the population who live in cities, own the largest portion of the land in the big cities. Thirteen families own about one-twentieth of all land in Greater New York. One hundred families own <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0801.jpg" n="3"/>one-ninth of the land of that state; about 5,000 families own about one-half the land, although the population of that state is about 5,400,000, approximately 1,000,000 families.</p>
   <p>The official government bulletin shows that seventeen per cent of the farms in the country comprise more than fifty per cent of the value of all the farms of this country. About five per cent of the population own nearly all the land. Commissioner Davis of the former Bureau of Corporations (sic) reported in 1914 that 1,694 owners to timber land and leased more than one-twentieth of the land in the United States, from Canada to the Mexican border, a sum total of 105,600,000 acres, and, at the same time, sixteen people own nearly half of this sum total, or 47,000,000 acres.</p>
   <p>The steel corporations of the United States control about sixty per cent of the raw materials of the land and about one and one-half per cent of the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0802.jpg" n="4"/>stockholders of the United States steel corporations own fifty-seven per cent of the stock. The Standard Oil Company last year owned eighty-eight per cent of all the oil in this country.</p>
   <p>This concentration of land resources does not permit the people at large to benefit by them. What can be done about this how can we break this monopoly?</p>
   <p>A good means of breaking the monopoly of land resources would be to impose heavy taxes on these corporations. But big capitalists have various ways by which can evade the payment of taxes, so the only way left is to have the government itself take control of this monopoly, and buy out those who now control them, paying them for their investment.</p>
   <p>Many people who bought land at a low price sold that land, and then rebought <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0803.jpg" n="5"/>it, making millions of dollars. We can take the wind out of their sails by imposing heavy taxes upon these people.</p>
   <p>Economic equality in this land will be attained only when the soil of this country, the industries, and all the natural resources will be worked and controlled by all the people of this country.</p>
