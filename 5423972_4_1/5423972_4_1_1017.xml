   <p>Editor, Daily Jewish Courier.</p>
   <p>Sir: We have been much interested recently in some letters in the Courier from young Jewish college girls. As school teachers, we have associations with some of the most cultured young Jewish girls in the city; and although almost all of them are teachers, they are good-looking, fashionably dressed, interested in sports, athletics, etc., and all are under twenty-two years of age.</p>
   <p>Although we are far from being snobbish, we consider that it would be a waste of all our training and hard work at school to choose as our associates young men who have not had as good a training as ours; yet it is practically impossible for us to meet the kind of man with whom we should like to associate. The clubs that are formed in the temples seem to be frequented by dance-crazy boys and girls in whom we are not at all interested, although we too like to <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1018.jpg" n="2"/>dance. Our attempts to organize a college people's club at our temple have been unsuccessful. The men do not attend. Tell us, dear editor, are our young Jewish doctors, lawyers, and other professionals too busy to enjoy the company of girls who are not only pretty but also intelligent or are they, too, too much interested in the flapper to notice us? We should like to know.</p>
   <p>Very sincerely,</p>
   <p>Some Young Schoolma'ms</p>
