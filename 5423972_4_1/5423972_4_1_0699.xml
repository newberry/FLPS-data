   <p>Nearly one-half of the American citizens neither vote nor want to vote, not because they are not entitled to, but because they are too lazy and are not interested.</p>
   <p>You must not forget that the United States is a free country, a democratic Republic, where the people do the governing through their representatives.</p>
   <p>And yet, half of the citizens remain home and do not vote, and it cannot be said that only citizens who came here from foreign countries do that because they are not accustomed to the American ways, and not interested enough in the political questions of the country. If to "boycott" the election and not to vote is a crime, then the many born in this country are more guilty of that crime than the new citizens. Here is proof. If <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0700.jpg" n="2"/>the twenty-seven million that vote are American-born, there still remains twenty-one million American-born citizens who do not vote. They are more guilty of this crime than the citizens who are not American-born.</p>
   <p>Why is it like that? Why do the American-born citizens show such little interest in the elections?</p>
   <p>This question is now being discussed in the Chicago press. It is also under debate at the conferences of various societies that take upon themselves the task of combating this situation. It is said that the citizens may be forced to vote; it is suggested to penallize those who boycott the election. A special educational campaign is under way to show the citizens the necessity of participating in elections and the importance of their helping elect such a government as will best represent the interests of the people. Special clubs and committees are being organized for that purpose. It seems that these methods, will bring very little results, let alone the resolution to force the citizens to vote by penalizing those who fail to do it. This is <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0701.jpg" n="3"/>something that must not go through, for it will do more harm than good. To vote, to participate in the election, is a right, but not a duty. A citizen may, if he finds it is urgent, take part in the work of the legislative body, but he is not forced to do so. It must be a voluntary act rather than an imposition, and even the other methods, education and propaganda, will hardly help. To us it seems that, aside from the general causes of political indifference which restrain the most important elements from the ballot box, we have to deal with more important obstacles, clean American obstacles which European citizens know nothing about and which are chiefly responsible for the vast number of non-voting American citizens. One of these obstacles is that elections take place on a weekday instead of on a day when the public is free, as is the case in Europe, where elections are held on Sundays, so that the workers may not lose time from work while they go to the ballot box.</p>
   <p>That is one of the hindrances that makes it hard for millions of farmers, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0702.jpg" n="4"/>laborers, and independent tradesmen to vote. Time is money in America; particularly the weekday when men have to work, is considered money.</p>
   <p>The second and most important reason why one half of our citizens refrain from voting, lies in our election laws.</p>
   <p>In America, as well as in Europe, to be a citizen is not sufficient to be able to vote. It is also important that the citizen's name be placed on the list of voters of his or her district. This is required by the government, which employs special men whose duty is to supply such lists and enter all changes of addresses, new additions, as of new citizens coming into their districts, all who move out of the districts, and those leaving this world. These lists are public, so in case any one fails to vote, this can be corrected by calling on that individual. In such case, the citizen will go to the polls once, and that will be on a Sunday. But the bad feature of it, is that each citizen must register on the so-called "registration day," also on a work day with the resulting loss of time <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0703.jpg" n="5"/>from work. If he fails to register, he cannot vote on the next election; and, as if that were not enough, he must register again for the primaries and vote at them if he wants his candidate to be nominated.</p>
   <p>All this requires much time, and it is hard to expect the average citizen to become interested in politics, and permit himself the luxury of losing so much time.</p>
   <p>If we want the millions of citizens, who now stand aside and do not vote at election, to become interested enough, not to be lazy to go to the ballot-box, we must first of all abolish all obstacles in the way, and make the election act as plain and as easy as possible.</p>
