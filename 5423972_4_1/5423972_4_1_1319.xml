   <p>I suggest to the Jewish Courier, if it really wants to do something for Jewish workers [who wish to own their own homes], that it call a meeting of twenty-five people who have from $1,500 to $2,000. The money should be deposited, under the supervision of the Jewish Courier, in a bank which these people will select.</p>
   <p>A meeting should be held to decide in what district of the city these twenty-five people wish to build their homes. Very likely they will select a site near a car line or elevated station. Together, they will purchase twenty-five lots. Each lot will belong individually to a single owner, but twenty-five lots will be purchased collectively. In this way, we will get the lots much cheaper and we will build co-operative houses. Each house will be charged to a separate account. The cost of the lot, material, and labor will be footed by each individual home owner. Workers who wish to build homes will find <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1320.jpg" n="2"/>plenty of bankers who will be willing to loan the required sum of money at low interest rates.</p>
   <p>I have spoken to six people who are willing to invest $12,000 at any time in this project. I am willing to offer my services and counsel absolutely free.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Jacob Barlokov.</p>
