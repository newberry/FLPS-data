   <p>The nearer the elections the more clear it become to those who have eyes to see that both capitalist parties cannot be distinguished from one another.</p>
   <p>The difference between them is no more that that between "For Thy Salvation I Hope", and I Hope for Thy Salvation".</p>
   <p>Every candidate on the Republican ticket, with the same "Principles", could also run on the Democratic ticket. Every Democratic candidate could also, pass as a good Republican without finding it necessary to change his social, or even political views.</p>
   <p>A small minority of the American voters dealt intelligently, which the majority deal in a ignorant fashion with their voting power. They notice, as the party bosses command them, and their minds do not function, he does not consider it as a fault contrary to but he does consider <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0064.jpg" n="2"/>that it is in complete harmony with the capitalistic democracy, and with the American two party system.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, no wonder that we see Republican politicans working for Democratic candidates and vice versa.</p>
   <p>Naturally, if Democrats are working for Republicans, or vice versa, they organize clubs to help the candidates. Such is the situation now prevailing in Chicago, where fifty Republicans have organized themselves as a committee to elect the Democrats. Michael L. Igoe for States Attorney, Francis I. C. Busch for County Judge, Michael Rosenberg, Carr and Sullivan for Sanitary Trustees.</p>
