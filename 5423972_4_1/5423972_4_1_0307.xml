  <body>
   <p>Abel Davis, has made a name for himself as the best recorder Cook County has ever had. He is the present recorder of Cook County and is a candidate for re-election. He is well known to us as the son of Mr. Pesach Davis, may he rest in Peace! As a child, Abel Davis came to Chicago. He is the proper type of future American Jews. He graduated from the School of Law of Northwestern University, by studying evenings, and earnings his livelihood in the day.</p>
   <p>At the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, Abel Davis enlisted as a volunteer in the First Illinois Infantry. In 1902, he was elected as Assembly man in Springfield. There too, he proved very conclusively, that a Jew is honest and labors earnestly for the common good.</p>
   <p>In the office of Mr. Abel Davis, many Jewish families are employed. His re-election means the continued existence of these families.</p>
