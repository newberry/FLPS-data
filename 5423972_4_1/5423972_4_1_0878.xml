   <p>The experience of ages has proven that the charity which is of most benefit to the recipient is that which aims to prevent its need.</p>
   <p>Our Jewish community is supporting, in a most generous and noble manner, many worthy institutions designed to relieve poverty and sickness. We have never been known to turn a deaf-ear to the cry of the orphan, the widow, or the helpless among us. But are we doing anything for those who need our assistance and cooperation, in accordance with the more modern and broader view of charity? Are we doing anything to prevent the need for charity? Yes! We can answer in the affirmative. As we look back upon the progress made in charitable efforts, we cannot fail to be sensible of the great change that has come about. More and more is being realized that social efforts should mean the endeavor to improve the material well-being of our fellowmen, and not to be content with alms-giving alone.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0879.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute is endeavoring, in so far as its means will permit, to offer opportunities to the foreign-born and the people of the neighborhood to become better citizens, better able to earn a comfortable living, and through its educational and social facilities, to develop a higher culture and to live a better and happier life.</p>
   <p>It cannot enumerate here the many ways in which the Institute is accomplishing the desired results. We would rather our friends came to the Institute and saw for themselves how much real good is being done under one roof, and that, without anyone receiving charity, as that term is understood. For everybody pays for whatever benefit he derives. But an educational institute of this kind cannot be expected to be entirely self-supporting. One-third of our revenue comes from those who make use of, and benefit by the Institute; for the other two-thirds we must depend upon those among us who can realize and appreciate the necessity for helping along a Cause that aims to prevent misery and suffering, which we are all ready to relieve after it has gained a foothold.</p>
   <p>The immigrants who come to our shores from a land of persecution and oppression, will seek to live amongst themselves, even under the wretched <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0880.jpg" n="3"/>conditions, without the fellowship of others, without social organizations, and without the higher social contacts. They will, out of necessity, become the products of environment. But! Bring them in contact with the more fortunate, the refined, the cultured, the strong, under wholesome influence, and you will find that unconsciously they have taken one step on the road to self-betterment.</p>
   <p>Permit him to remain under his own environment and you will find him a spirit suppressed, without self-reliance, and frequently without self-respect, having all that is conducive to all kinds of diseases of mind and body.</p>
   <p>Not charity, not pensions, is the need, but for us who are better situated, to recognize fully and frankly, the claims which those people have upon us, and to understand our relationship to the dependent classes. The Institute is endeavoring in every Department of Activity, to prevent the need of becoming dependent. I cannot give statistics as to the number the Institute has helped; our work is in the building of the future, and to prevent causes for wrong and evil. I want to say, emphatically, that the Institute is not a sentiment but a <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0881.jpg" n="4"/>great social necessity. Have the Jews of Chicago responded to the call of the needs of the Chicago Hebrew Institute?</p>
   <p>Here is the report of the Board of Directors at a meeting held Tuesday, February 10th: "The Institute faces a deficit of $6,000.00, to cover expenses for the year ending April, 1914. In view of this fact, each Director was urged to assume part of the responsibility, to go out and solicit members; March 10th to be known as Institute-Day, when each member of the Board of Directors will go to his or her friend, and others, and interest them in our Cause, and raise the needed amount to cover the expenses. We need $40,000.00 for this purpose. We hope to have interested you sufficiently in what we are trying to accomplish, to answer our call and help to carry on the work. Do not stay away from us.</p>
   <p>"Those who stay away from such work lose the most, for nothing so stunts the power of enjoyment as the keeping away from the opportunities of helpfulness, and the ignoring of the starvation struggle, mental and physical, of those dependent upon us. If you have longings for a better, fuller life, then use your <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0882.jpg" n="5"/>faculties for the betterment of your fellowmen. The Institute is in full sympathy with the trend of our age toward a greater democracy, which multiplies opportunity and strives to make charity more and more unnecessary.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Julius Stone,</p>
   <p>Secretary".</p>
