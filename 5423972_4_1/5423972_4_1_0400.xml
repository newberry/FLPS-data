   <p>There are fifty-two men in federal jails, held there for expression of pacifist opinion during the war. Now a number of prominent editors, college professors, and presidents and state governors implore Harding to set these men free. Among the signatories to the petition is the son-in-law of ex-President Wilson. Certainly, it is time that sentences imposed upon these men be revoked, for all such offenders in England, France, Germany, Italy, and in the other countries which participated in the war have long ago been freed. The signers of the petition disclaim agreement with these political prisoners, but are reported as petitioning that the "United States should not stoop to the methods of old world despotism in suppressing free speech". It is rather late now for this petition to be addressed to the President, but if the Department of Justice and the President can be made to see the justice of the demand, perhaps some mitigation of the lot of the men can result; perhaps they can be freed for believing that free speech was their inalienable right.</p>
