   <p>It is now being said that the women of Illinois have won a great victory by the act of legislature adopting the law through which the women obtained the power to vote for officers who are not mentioned by the constitution of Illinois. The fact that women have now been granted a privilege which they were previously denied is certainly a victory for them. However, the women did not attain the real victory, whereas mankind did...</p>
   <p>Many years will pass before mankind will understand that no one should rule over someone else, regardless of how strong, favorable, and capable the rulers may be, and how weak, incapable, and foolish the ruled may be. The movement, for the universal manhood suffrage must lead to women suffrage.</p>
   <p>Not only have the women triumphed in Illinois, but humanity has triumphed. It is a step forward on the great road of human progress and perfection.</p>
