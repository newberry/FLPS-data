<title level="a">A LIBERTY LOAN DINNER AT THE LAWNDALE CLUB TODAY</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Lawndale Club, which organized a Liberty Loan Committee, has already sold $30,000 worth of Liberty Bonds. In order to bring this sum to the $100,000 mark, a Liberty Loan Dinner has been arranged for this evening in the rooms of the Club, 3322 Douglas Boulevard, to which members and friends are invited.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles Mitchell is the chairman of the committee arranging the dinner; Mr. Samuel Rosenblatt will be the toastmaster and Judge Harry Fisher will be the main speaker.</p>
   <p>The Lawndale Club Campaign Committee was appointed by Michael Rosenberg, chairman of the Jewish branch of the Cook County Committee for the Third Liberty Loan, who is also conducting a house-to-house canvass for the Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michael Rosenberg, who is a well-known West Side businessman and president <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0509.jpg" n="2"/>of the Rosenberg Iron and Metal Company, is devoting considerable time and energy to the campaign to help every Jew in Cook County become a subscriber to the Third Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenberg enjoys the reputation of a man who is usually successful in his undertakings. To him credit is given as a member of the Federated Jewish Charities for the success of its $50,000 drive, as well as numerous other enterprises of the big institutions of the West Side, to which he has contributed substantial sums with a generous hand.</p>
