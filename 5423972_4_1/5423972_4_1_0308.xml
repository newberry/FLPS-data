   <p>The following letter was sent to us by Mr. Henry Greenebaum, the well known philanthropist and Jewish civic leader:</p>
   <p>Dear Citizens and Brothers:</p>
   <p>Some merciless professional politicians, who are interested only in their own gains, are seeking to discredit the re-election for Governor of Illinois of my personal friend.....Charles S. Deneen.</p>
   <p>I consider it my duty, at this time, to say a few words about Mr. Deneen. I have lived in the State of Illinois for many years. I can assure you, as man and brother, that Illinois had no better Governor than Charles S. Deneen. He is honest and just. He has taken away the power of the political bosses, during elections, and has given them to the people. The people can now appoint their own representatives for any vacancies. This the professional politicans can not <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0309.jpg" n="2"/>forgive or forget, and it is the reason why they are doing all in their power to besmirch the name of Charles S. Deneen.</p>
   <p>The politicians are raving about the Governor because he had also introduced many other laws. For instance, the Civil Service Law, where by a person would have to have definite qualifications and pass a rigid examination, which would prevent politicians from getting these jobs just because they are politicians. If for no other reason, this alone should induce every citizen to vote for Governor Deneen.</p>
   <p>Governor Deneen, was elected by a majority during the primaries. This is a clear indication that he deserves the full hearted support of all of us. Let us not be deceived by lies and falsehood. Give honor to whom honor is due!</p>
   <p>Brothers, do not neglect your duties and vote for Charles S. Deneen as Governor of Illinois!</p>
   <p>Henry Greenebaum.</p>
