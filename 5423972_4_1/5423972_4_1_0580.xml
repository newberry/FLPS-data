   <p>Why was war declared by our President? This is a burning question and anybody having enough arrogance to pose it, is looked upon suspiciously. Doesn't our President know what is to be done, and does he not do it for the good of our country? The citizens of the United States have elected him as the highest official of our country, for the sole reason that they have utmost confidence in him as being one of the greatest pacificists in our country. It remains a fact that, during his first term, he kept us out of war, even when our disputes with Mexico reached a high pitch, and we have therefore bestowed upon him the title of Prince of Peace. The situation in which our politics became entangled resulted in our being dragged into the European whirlpool. So, why the commotion? Our radical elements arose, protesting against war; <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0581.jpg" n="2"/>crying that there is no cause for war; that there is no reason for us to commit wholesale suicide. But why these cries? Does Europe know why it is fighting? Why it slaughtered eight million and mutilated ten million of its best sons? A certain scoffer, or perhaps Asmodeus himself, uttered the words "National Honor," awakening the war-patriots, who seized a whip with which they lash the millions of helpless citizens into war.</p>
   <p>And why should we abstain? Why should we not want to take part in that great conflict? Have we then not the same national pride as have the nations of Europe?</p>
   <p>What were we prior to the war? A nation without honorary-sentiment? All of Europe ridiculed us. The stalwart warriors there <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0582.jpg" n="3"/>looked upon us contemptuously and considered us as peaceful hedonists caring for nothing but peace and contentment in our own land. So we wanted to show them that we are not so saintly as they think; that we can also sacrifice millions of lives for the ambitious national-honor.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, brand all radicals who dare denounce war as common traitors. They are traitors because they wish to see the citizens happy and because they have pity on the millions of lives that will perish permaturely.</p>
   <p>Speaking truthfully, what is really more important and more human and democratic: to be rubbed to dust by the fire of a cannon on the battlefield of Europe, or to work on an American farm or in an <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0583.jpg" n="4"/>American factory? What constitutes our whole life? We work and eat, eat and work, until we exhale our last breath, and if we must die, why should we wait until we reach a ripe old age of 75 when a young man of 21 or 31 can attain it [death] instantly in war.</p>
   <p>And how beauteous this death is. Just imagine bands playing, regiment flags flying, soldiers marching in unison, officers leading the regiments, - everything in the finest and most artistic manner. Suddenly there is heard the enemy's music and signs of their flags are seen. Both armies converge face to face. They take definite positions. Orders are issued by the commanders and guns commence to fire, cannons roar, bayonets to penetrate human bodies, and the warm blood trickles down upon the cold earth, human bodies crumble up and fall away dead.</p>

   <p>Finally, the historians appear. They compile the facts, note down the names of the generals and write history for the future generations, with a view to reawakening the national honor for future catastrophes.</p>
   <p>Thus the world goes on from many years; even today in our own country.</p>
   <p>If, however, our radicals want to end this world-history and arrange mass-meetings at which their speakers dissuade the youth from taking an active part in war, they are no more than traitors.</p>
