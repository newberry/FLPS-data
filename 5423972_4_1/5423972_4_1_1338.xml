   <p>Shop Chairmen buy shares for $100,000.00.</p>
   <p>The Locomotive and Engineers Brotherhood Bank will deposit $100,000.00. This is very good news on the eve of the opening of the Convention, and took place at a meeting of thousands of shop-chairmen, executive board-members, and local and general officers of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers.</p>
   <p>Sam Levin, Manager of the Chicago Joint Board, called the meeting to order and announced that at this meeting nothing will be discussed except the bank and the Convention which is to open Monday morning at the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>Levin pictured the spirit of the Amalgamated's great undertaking, and pointed out that every task undertaken in the past was a success, and that the same will be of the bank.</p>
   <p>Levin declared that the Amalgamated wishes that the money reserved by the clothing workers and deposited in the banks shall not be withdrawn by <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1339.jpg" n="2"/>private persons and shall not be utilized for exploitation purposes as is done by private banks.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was the well-known V.A.Thompson, who was the impartial chairman of the Amalgamated in the Hart, Schaffner and Marx Shops after the strike of 1910.</p>
   <p>Mr. Thompson claimed that the Amalgamated Bank will and must be the safest and best bank; but that is not all. This bank will serve the needs and interests of the Amalgamated and the whole labor-movement.</p>
   <p>The administrator of the bank, Mr. Radifer, held a short talk saying that the bank will be the finest, strongest, best and safest, and will give the best services to everyone dealing with this bank.</p>
   <p>Sidney Hillman also gave a short talk, assuring everyone that the bank would be a success, first because the organization is big, and only such members can build a big bank, and, second, because we have experienced bankers to administrate the bank.</p>
