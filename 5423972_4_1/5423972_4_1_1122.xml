   <p>On a small ballot that will be presented to the citizens of Chicago, there is one proposal to be voted upon "Yes" or "No" which we think will go through almost unanimously or at least by a large majority of votes. This is the proposal to issue bonds in the aggregate of $1,000,000 for the purpose of constructing new, and demolishing old, fire stations, where firemen spend the greatest part of their lives.</p>
   <p>As a rule we are not in favor of a city incurring debts. A city government should be run in such a manner that it should have sufficient financial means for everything it might be in need of, except when an exceptional honest expense occurs unexpectedly. City buildings should be erected form a fund which ought to be set aside for this purpose, and instead of contracting debts and paying interest thereon, let us first save enough money and draw dividends on it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1123.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>City governments, however, are not run as we think they should be run; consequently, whenever our expenses soar higher than usual, we must borrow money by means of bonds in order to have enough for special expenses. The municipal government of Chicago now needs money to build an isolation hospital for social diseases; it needs money to build new, and to improve old, fire and police stations. For this purpose the city asks of the state permission to borrow the required sum by issuing bonds.</p>
   <p>Even though many of you may be of the opinion that the police departments should be satisfied with their old stations, we believe, however, that no one should be opposed to the building of suitable fire stations for the firemen who are continuously risking their lives and sacrificing themselves when the property and the lives of citizens are at stake.</p>
   <p>The fireman--who is the first to plunge into the first at the risk of his life in order to save life and property--is entitled to find a decent place if he is fortunate enough to return to his station alive and unhurt.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1124.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The fireman--who becomes an iceberg in winter when fighting fires with water-- is entitled to a warm resting place.</p>
   <p>The present fire stations are old; uncomfortable, and undesirable for human beings to spend their lives in. These stations are intolerable places for anyone who deserves and requires as much rest as firemen returning from fires where they have rendered such noble services to their fellow--men.</p>
   <p>To incur a debt to pay for new fire stations means to pay a debt to the firemen. And every citizen should vote "Yes" in regard to the matter of issuing bonds in order to erect fire stations.</p>
