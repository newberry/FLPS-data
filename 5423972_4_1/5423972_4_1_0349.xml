<title level="a">OIL MAGNATES AND MEMBERS OF THE CABINET IN GRAFT SCANDAL</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In the last few years we heard so much about graft scandal in connection with war jobs and war contracts that the public is indifferent to new discoveries of graft. Yet, it is unbelievable that the report of Senator Caraway, submitted to the Senate yesterday afternoon, and which caused a turmoil in the Senate, will be passed up so easily.</p>
   <p>The scandal the Senator mentioned was powerful enough to arouse the dead.</p>
   <p>Two members of the cabinet are involved; one, the leader, has resigned <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0350.jpg" n="2"/>from the cabinet; the second one still is a member of the cabinet. An assistant cabinet member is also involved and a few Senators and prominent business men were indirectly accused of being parties to the scandal.</p>
   <p>During the time of war, the government developed certain oil wells. The Government at that time needed oil for the Navy, and these oil wells were kept in reserve for the fleet. After the war certain oil magnates began scheming in Washington to induce the Government to lease the oil wells to them. The Secretary of Interior at that time, Albert Fall, without consulting the other cabinet members, signed a contract with the oil magnate, Mr. Sinclair. According to the contract, Sinclair obtained access to the oil wells. The sum that he paid for the so-called lease was very small. One of his partners declared that from this transaction, he <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0351.jpg" n="3"/>will gain no less than one hundred million dollars.</p>
   <p>When it was learned that such a transaction took place, Mr. Fall was questioned, he declared that the Government had no other alternative since the Sinclair firm has an oil field next to our Government wells, and Sinclair was in a position to pump the Government's oil from underground. Experts ridiculed Mr. Fall's explanation. It was said that Sinclair's clique probably tricked the cabinet member into their scheme. Mr. Fall was severely criticized for his lack of judgment.</p>
   <p>It was then learned that immediately after Sinclair had the lease in his possession, Mr. Fall, who had resigned from his office, had one hundred thousand dollars on deposit in his bank. It was also learned that at the time that Fall made the secret deal with Sinclair, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0352.jpg" n="4"/>Mr. Fall's private business operations were improfitable (he has a large ranch in Texas), but with the hundred thousand dollars, he speedily built his business up again. It is understood that these two facts were connected: Fall turned over treasures of oil to Sinclair, and Mr. Fall suddenly became a possessor of one hundred thousand dollars. Perhaps that sum of money has some connection with the turning over of the Government's oil wells?</p>
   <p>An investigation committee was then appointed to look into this matter. When this committee asked Mr. Fall where he got the money, his answer was that he borrowed it from a certain Mr. Mc Lean, a millionaire newspaper publisher in Washington. When Mc Lean was asked if that was true he replied that it was. He was then questioned as to why he gave Fall the money, and why <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0353.jpg" n="5"/>he gave it to him in cash and not by check. The clique faltered in their words. Mc Lean became frightened and withdrew his former statements. The Senate committee called on Fall once more to answer questions, and he claimed he was sick, so they called Mc Lean again but he also claimed he was sick. Both patients are now in Florida and both stay at the same hotel.</p>
   <p>The present Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Denby, and his assistant, Roosevelt's son, are also implicated in this oil scandal. Both knew of this transaction and both approved the contract.</p>
   <p>One of the chief lawyers defending Mr. Fall is the former Attorney-General of the Wilson administration, the famous prosecutor of <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0354.jpg" n="6"/>Socialism and unions, Mr. Palmer. In the speech given by Senator Caraway, he explained that Mr. Fall hired Palmer as his defender in the hope that this will influence the Democratic Senators to be more gentle in their attack. Palmer is influential in the Democratic organization, and the Democratic Senators who are carrying on the fight against Fall fear Palmer.</p>
   <p>The facts emphasized by Senator Caraway in his speech were sufficient to warrant prosecution of the people involved. He urged the Attorney-General, Mr. Daugherty, to submit all these facts to a Grand Jury and demand that every one who is implicated in this scandal be indicted. Here he emphasized that Mr. Daugherty should carry out these demands.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0355.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>For the last three years since Daugherty took office as Attorney-General, he has been convinced that Caraway's opinions are right. When Daugherty first stepped into office in Washington, there were piles of accusations of graft against war profiteers. Many thought at that time that Daugherty would roll up his sleeves and start right in, so that the cases could be disposed of, not that he was so in earnest in fulfilling his duty, but for the sake of political motives. This scandal took place under Wilson's administration. It would have been a victory for the Republican Party if it was shown that the Government was robbed by the Democratic administration. Daugherty did pretend to prosecute the accused. He made attempts, and even brought a few that were charged with minor offenses to court. But gradually it became clear that nothing could be expected from daugherty. Yet, it was not a question involving political parties. By the war graft, all party <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0356.jpg" n="8"/>boundaries were wiped out. The Democratic organization was friendly to the Republican as well as to the Democratic contractors. The Democratic organization allowed everyone to take as much as his heart desired. The thievery was on such a large scale that there was sufficient for all. None of the big grafters was brought to court, and the public gradually forgot the scandalous and shameful episode in our history.</p>
   <p>Will this recent sensation, this exposure of wholesale graft, help awaken this country and spur the people to force the Government to bring millionaire thieves and grafters to justice? This is an election year; a time like this is very favorable for obtaining a little justice from the Government. At a time like this a government cannot afford to ignore public opinion. We are convinced that unless something is done behind the scenes to close the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0357.jpg" n="9"/>mouths of the few Senators who are carrying on the fight, the Republican Party will surely take drastic steps. But we fear that both parties will unite and force the "kickers" in the Senate to hush the graft-scandal, since both parties are equally involved. If the Democrats unveil the graft-scandal of the Republicans, the Republicans will surely not remain silent; nor will they find it difficult to unveil graft of the Democrats.</p>
   <p>It depends entirely on whether the investigating committee is courageous enough not to fear risking political careers if necessary.</p>
