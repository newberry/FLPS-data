   <p>The Hart, Schaffner and Marx agreement with its employes has been renewed. The firm has agreed to give wage increases totaling $1,500,000 within the next three years, the life of the new contract. All the old features of collective bargaining and the provisions for industrial democracy have been retained. In addition, the company has consented to reduce the working hours for the week from fifty-two to forty-nine hours.</p>
   <p>The H. S. and Marx agreement was one of the few industrial arrangements which has won praise from the United States commission on industrial relations. It provides for the so-called preferential shop. When the company desires to employ workers, members of the union are preferred. If none are available, non-union workers must be accepted. In all but the busy season, the "closed shop" is in effect.</p>
   <p>No one may be dismissed from the company's employ without cause. No new working conditions can be imposed without agreement between the union and the firm on the rearrangement. All disputes arising between workers and the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1448.jpg" n="2"/>company are settled by a permanent arbitration board.</p>
   <p>The unusual feature of the agreement between the employer and employes is the distribution which will be made of the salary increases. Instead of the old method of giving the same proportional increase to each employe, the new agreement provides for the appointment of a committee from the union. This committee will work out a plan whereby the lower paid workers will receive far greater increases than the higher paid workers.</p>
   <p>For example, trimmers receiving less than $12 a week will receive an increase of $1 a week, every three months, until their wages are $12. Those whose wages are between $12 and $18 will receive automatic increases of $1 a week every six months until their wages are $18. Trimmers receiving over $18 and less than $20 will receive an increase of $1 a week once a year until the maximum of $20 is reached.</p>
