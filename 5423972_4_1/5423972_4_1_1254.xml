He was born in the town of Dinkelsbuhl, Bavaria. After studying for some time in universities at Erlanger and Munich he graduated with high honors from the University of Wurzburg.</p>
   <p>In 1864 he emigrated to this country and took up his residence in this city. The following year he was chozen as assistant to City Health Commissioner Rauch. After serving his connection with the city, he opened an office with Dr. Ernst Schmidt, building up an enormous practice. It was not unusual for him to spend 20 hours a day in attendance upon his patients.</p>
   <p>Since 1865 he had been at the head of the medical staff of the Alexian Brothers' Hospital. He occupied a similar position at the Michael Reese Hospital, of which he was one of the founders.</p>
