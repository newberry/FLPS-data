<title level="a">THE RUMORS FROM MEXICO</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Who is creating the various contradictory news emanating so frequently and in such quantity from Mexico?</p>
   <p>Here Villa is captured, and there he escapes and is in ambush near the border. Now he is wounded and later he is hidden somewhere in the United States; here a general of Carranza's army is aligned with Villa, and there Mexico is threatening the troops of Uncle Sam. There must be some source from which these rumors flow. It is inferred that the purpose in back of some of this information is to prolong the excitement in the United States, as well as in Mexico, with the hope that eventually it will lead to a real war if the United States would decide to carry out an intervention expedition against Villa. This would mean war.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0625.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Who has any interest in inciting a war between Mexico and the United States?</p>
   <p>There are in this world innumerable things [of whose existence we are aware], although substantial evidence is lacking. Science is for instance convinced that in space, among the millions of stars, there is present ether, the fine gas which is also present in our air. None of our scientists was ever there. No one has seen or felt or smelled it. And yet, they are convinced that ether is present. This cannot be proved by the senses, but by the mind. They know that light is produced by ether waves. This has been proved on earth. And as the stars emit light which also reaches us, they arrive at the conclusion that ether must be there, otherwise the light of the stars would not travel, [and we would not see the stars].</p>
   <p>By the same rational calculation, we can draw the conclusion that somewhere in Mexico, or near the border between United States and Mexico, there is an organization which is interested in fomenting a war between the two Republics, which will ultimately drag us into a war with the European powers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0626.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is certainly difficult to show from whence these reports come and the people who are responsible for them. [It will be no less difficult] to prove where Villa obtained the money to finance his clique or where he receive fresh arms. However, both the rumors and the material support that Villa is getting, originate from people who wish to see a war and will profit from it. This hypothesis, as in the case of ether, must be accepted because [it is the only reasonable explanation].</p>
   <p>The publication of these false rumors worries the administration in Washington, and President Wilson deemed it necessary to admonish the people of the United States not to head these rumors, but to focus their attention on the official reports.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that a war with Mexico does not break out in the present critical moment, and that evidence will be found that will unveil the conspirators who seek to profit through bloodshed.</p>
