   <p>Mr. Edgar Davis, Illinois state factory inspector, lectured at the Chicago Hebrew Institute, 224 Blue Island Avenue, on sweat shop conditions in factories in the Jewish neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Davis is known as a friend of the Jews and we should take notice of what he said. Mr. Davis revealed that the working conditions in the Jewish section were intolerably dirty and a danger to the lives and health of the Jewish workers who work in the sweat shop factories. He revealed that more than 13,000 children who should still be in school work in these factories and break down their health before they have had an opportunity to fully develop body and soul. It is tragic to behold young children, who by force of economic circumstance are compelled to leave their work and play to help their families earn their daily bread. Economic conditions, perhaps, are to blame for the children having to work in these factories, but the manufacturers <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0934.jpg" n="2"/>are to blame for the intolerable and unhealthy working conditions. Those bosses who could easily comply with the sanitary laws and do not, sin not against the state, but against humanity and against themselves, for because of their negligence, many diseases spread and take their toll.</p>
   <p>Statistics on consumption sufferers show that the sweat shops produce the greatest percentage of sufferers of this type. Many other diseases spread because of dirty, close, ill-lighted and ill-ventilated working quarters. Every manufacturer should consider it his duty to limit the spread of these afflictions by providing better working conditions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Davis remarked that many bosses try to hinder the sanitary inspector in his work to better the sanitary conditions of the factory. Many bosses have agreed to notify each other when an inspector appears and thus be given an opportunity to clean up their plants. Immediately after the inspector leaves, conditions are allowed to become as bad as before.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0935.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>America is a land where cleanliness is considered a very important factor in our daily lives. We feel it our duty to prevent disease among workers. This can be done by imposing severe penalties upon violator of sanitary working condition laws. It is the duty of every boss to abide by these laws, and wherever the boss fails in his duties workers should report violations to protect themselves and their fellow workers. Clean shops are equally important to the workers and the bosses. Every effort should be made to have them kept clean.</p>
