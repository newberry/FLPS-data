   <p>A large audience gave a warm welcome to the Jewish grand opera of Chicago, at its debut performances Saturday and Sunday at the Aryan Grotto Temple. A Jewish opera company is something new to the Jewish ghetto. The artists, under the direction of the great tenor Morris Dubin, gave a performance of an opera called "The Jew in Spain," which is actually "The Jewess, " as re-arranged by Mrs. Rosa Dubin-Westgate. Music critics, who are charitably inclined, say that as a first attempt, the performance was a success, to a certain degree, and that the undertaking is a welcome development in our local cultural life.</p>
   <p>The opera company, however, should not need the excuse of a "first performance It takes more than a "first performance" to make a good opera company; it takes good music, well-trained singers and actors, a well-balanced chorus and orchestra, beautiful decorations, but, most of all, the tone, color, and atmosphere of opera are needed. Mr. d undertaking lacked these essentials.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1561.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The music of "The Jew In Spain" is too poor and banal even for a European operetta. For example, an overture which contains tunes from Jewish operettas and themes of German hunting songs, instead of traditional Jewish melodies and the sound of church bells, does not reflect the Spanish Inquisition of the fifteenth century at all. Our friend, Mr. Dubin, is an artist of the first rank but he alone cannot perform an entire opera.</p>
   <p>Esther Parker possesses a trained, well-rounded dramatic soprano voice, which has color and flexibility, but this does not make her a prima donna capable of portraying the role of Rachel.</p>
   <p>Jasha Rosenthal, with his ordinary bass voice, is far from ready to begin a new career as a grand opera singer, although his voice was a surprise to us.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gold, as Prince Leopold, was perhaps the only one who had a dignified stage presence. He sang very sympathetically but his limited musical qualifications would be more appropriate for Jewish operetta.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1562.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The first attempt to present Jewish opera in Chicago was, all in all, not very successful, although Mr. Lemkow tried his best to put some life and fire into the poor music of his small orchestra. Let us hope that the mistakes and defects of this artistic undertaking will be corrected and removed from the next performance of the opera company.</p>
