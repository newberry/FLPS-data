<title level="a">ANTI-WAR STUDENT YOUTH</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The anti-war propaganda spread lately among the student youth of America is now becoming very serious. At a student conference held a few weeks ago by students of the Northwestern college in Evanston, the students protested against militarism and war. A few of the students present, who were war patriots, tried their utmost to make a joke of it.</p>
   <p>In every way they strove to impress the conference that the protest was only a pastime of a few frivolous students who are too young to know what it is all about. The "intelligentsia" claimed that the entire turmoil of the anti-war movement came from a group of "foreigners" who have not the least influence on the American students.</p>
   <p>But when it was seen later that the anti-war movement is much more serious than was imagined, and that it is a movement not by foreigners but by all strata of the American student youth, imbued with pessimistic ideas, these same patriots began to change their tune. Those actually guilty of this propaganda were found to be no other than the leaders of the Third Internationale <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0392.jpg" n="2"/>of Moscow. The Russian young men, among the students in all the large colleges throughout the country, according to the conception of these war patriots, wanted to act as agents for a propaganda which Moscow carries on in America.</p>
   <p>But when "Russian students" are mentioned, we know that no others are meant but the Jewish students, so it is easy to guess where and at whom those poisonous arrows were aimed by those obscurantists who have become terribly frightened about the anti-war propaganda which has so rapidly spread among the American students.</p>
   <p>The few Russian students of the aristocratic college in Evanston were, however, fortunate enough not to remain the "scape-goats" of their colleagues. As luck would have it, an anti-war movement broke out in the theological seminary, which is also a branch of this aristocratic college in Evanston. Those students studying for ministers of the Christian Church made a vow to God and to Jesus to devote their entire life to the great "ideal" of combatting war. They declared themselves against militarism and soldiery in any form.</p>
   <p>And what can the 100-per-cent patriots say now? Whom can they throw <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0393.jpg" n="3"/>the blame on for such terrible treason against this "country?" Again to point out a conspiracy of Moscow is not so easy, to declare that the future ministers are agents of the Third Internationale is more than absurd; on the other hand, to disregard the "scarecrow" altogether is not a practical thing to do, because after all there are enough fools in this world that can be very easily persuaded. One thing is, however, inconvenient; fantasic stories can no longer to told about Russian student; not attending the seminary for the purpose of becoming ministers.</p>
   <p>Well, another pretext is to be sought. They want to prove to themselves, and convince others, that a large number of the student body studying for the ministry are Germans, and that only but yesterday Germany was our enemy. By this we can readily understand that this is no more than an open conspiracy from Germany, in co-ordination with Moscow, to implant sentiments of "disloyalty" and treason in the hearts of the American youth.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, all the reactionary elements in this country have become very active. The American Legion is beginning to raise a rumpus. The country is imperiled! The flag is imperiled! Moscow and Berlin are lurking around. Help! Help!</p>
