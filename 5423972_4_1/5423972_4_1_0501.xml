<title level="a">OUR BOYS IN FRANCE SOLEMNIZED THE PASSOVER CEREMONY IN TRUE JEWISH FASHION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>That our Jewish boys in France feel very much at home and are provided there with everything, even with a genuine Passover ceremony, is to be seen in a letter from a Chicago Jewish soldier in France, Harry J. Green, an army field clerk, to his brother, Mr. Louis B. Greenberg, 3112 Carlisle Place.</p>
   <p>Among the various things which Green describes, how comfortable he feels in France, how tasty the food is and how well he is being treated, and after saying how greatly he would appreciate some Little John Rogers Cigars, which could be obtained at Bartlstein's on Twelfth Street, he describes in the following manner the last Passover ceremony which took place somewhere in France.</p>
   <p>"Last night I had a grand time," writes Green. "About 200 of our boys got together for the "Seder" (Passover rite), which was solemnized in a true Jewish fashion. The city mayor furnished us with a large hall, and the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0502.jpg" n="2"/>Chief Rabbi solemnized the 'Seder'. We were also at the city's synagogue for the services. At the 'Seder' we had plenty of wine and all the Passover delicacies. The mayor and the guests, among whom were some high America officials, made speeches. The 'Seder' lasted until twelve o'clock midnight. I found there quite a number of our Chicago boys. There was also a correspondent of the Chicago Daily News. I personally made a brief speech. The city's synagogue is an impressive structure, magnificent architecture and decorated as beautifully as any in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"A number of Americans, some majors, one colonel and other officials were present. There were also many women and a 'kissing spree'. The city mayor and the Chief Rabbi kissed the lady correspondent of the Daily News after the latter made a speech in French and English. After that, some of the boys started a 'jig', after which we continued with the prayer, bringing it to a close with some English songs."</p>
   <p>Mr. Green also enclosed the menu of various dished which were served at the "Seder."</p>
