   <p>The appointment of Dr. Theodore Sachs as one of the trustees of the new tuberculosis sanitarium which the City of Chicago is about to build, is the finest compliment that Mayor Busse could have given to the Jewish citizens of this city. The mayor couldn't have made a better selection among the Jewish doctors in Chicago than Dr. Sachs. He acquired fame as one of the greatest authoritative fighters against the white plague. He has written much about the dangers and prevention of tuberculosis. He has lectured to great audiences about this terrible disease. He has awakened the public and made them conscious, thus accomplishing a great deal in the right direction. His outstanding work was brought to the attention of the mayor, and he appointed him to the trusteeship of the sanitarium.</p>
