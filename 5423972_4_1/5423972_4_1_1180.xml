   <p>Amalgamated Bank Opened With Big Parade.</p>
   <p>Thousands of tailors came to greet their bank and deposit their money. The bank received over a half million dollars in deposits, the first day of business.</p>
   <p>The first labor bank opened in Chicago yesterday. This is the bank that belongs to the members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union. It is the first union bank in the clothing industry, and the second union bank in America. The first union bank opened in Cleveland and belongs to the locomotive engineers.</p>
   <p>The opening of the Amalgamated Bank took on an atmosphere of business that was impressive. The minute the doors of the bank were opened for business, workers from all parts of the city, were streaming in with their money to deposit in their own bank. When they entered the bank they encountered a feeling of elation. They realized that this was the first time they were <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1181.jpg" n="2"/>in their own bank. Bright lights flickered in their eyes, filled with enthusiasm. On their faces you could read satisfaction, from their lips came a chatter and thankful prayer; they blessed their bank and wished it many years of luck, and with the same happy expression they left the bank with their book in their pocket, feeling that it was not just a bank book. It was of their own bank, the first attempt of the needle workers of America to have a financial institution of their own. It was a pleasant and honest opening of the first labor bank in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the largest tailoring factories in Chicago, came to show that even they have faith in the Amalgamated Bank. Mr. Milton Strauss, manager of the Hart, Schaffner and Marx, did not come just to greet the bank; he also made a deposit of $50,000. A nice start and a good assurance for an excellent future.</p>
   <p>After the bank had been open for a few hours, it gave the impression of a garden of flowers; the bouquets brought by the workers of the Hart, Schaffner</p>

   <p>not be accommodated, the bank expects a very busy day tomorrow, especially since tomorrow being July 4, all the shops will be closed. Those who were not able to be present yesterday, and those who could not deposit yesterday, will be able to open an account tomorrow, with the Amalgamated Bank.</p>
