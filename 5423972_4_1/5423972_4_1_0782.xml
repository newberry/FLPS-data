  <body>
   <p>It was learned through a New York newspaper that the U. S. government is keeping a close watch on foreign language newspapers in order to determine whether or not they are loyal to our republic and the [established] government. It appears that all newspapers in America printed in languages other than English are carefully read and translated by government officials. Such articles as advocate revolution and Bolshevism are clipped and classified. In Washington there is a suspicion that the foreign language press is disloyal to America.</p>
   <p>Certain political circles believe that this press should be entirely suppressed. Naturally such an idea can never be realized since millions of American citizens who came from European countries understand their mother tongue much better than they do English, and have a right to read the newspapers they understand best. What officials can do in this situation is to watch the foreign language press and censor it. A law could be established whereby <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0783.jpg" n="2"/>permission or a license would be required in order to publish a foreign language newspaper. Naturally a license would be issued only to persons who are trustworthy and upon whom the government can definitely depend.</p>
   <p>But it is questionable whether we shall ever reach this stage because government officials find the foreign language press, with very few exceptions, loyal to the United States.</p>
   <p>Of the many Jewish newspapers in this country only three are questionable. Two of them are not even newspapers. They are the organs of small groups and appear so to speak without publicity. Neither the Jewish newspaper public nor the publishers and journalists are aware of their existence. They can be explained to the government in simple terms. Anything said by these local corner sheets does not indicate the stand of the Jewish press in reference to the American government and its institutions. The third Jewish newspaper suspected by the government is, with respect to circulation, a very large <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0784.jpg" n="3"/>newspaper. It is not a Jewish paper but a Socialist one which happens to be printed in Jewish. It does not represent the interests of the Jewish people but of the Socialist Party. Should the government find it disloyal, let the government deal with the Socialist Party and not with American Jews.</p>
   <p>The entire American Jewish press, as long as it is not a class press, is no less patriotic than its American counterpart, and does its share in aiding the government. We maintain that the duty of the government officials assigned to the Jewish Press, is to declare openly what an overstatement it is to assert that the Jewish Socialist paper in America is disloyal and unpatriotic. We find it more conservative than the Socialist newspapers printed in English and that its Socialist principles are economic rather than political.</p>
   <p>In truth the representatives of the Jewish Socialist press concern themselves much more with economic problems than with political ones. Toward problems <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0785.jpg" n="4"/>of politics, national and international, this press has a set attitude which is as old as Socialism itself and is therefore no special attitude at all, for it is too stereotyped and too mechanical. The influence of this press on economic problems has nothing to do with loyalty and patriotism. Its political influence need alarm no one; its political influence may be compared to that of the Quakers. When all is said and done, this fact must be brought to mind; we do not deal here with a Jewish organ but with a Socialist one which happens to be printed in Jewish.</p>
   <p>Since we do not read them all, we can have no definite opinion regarding the patriotism of other foreign language newspapers. Yet we believe that the greater part of them is loyal and patriotic. Only a small fraction of them serves the interests of economic groups which have their own ideas of America and its institutions. On these grounds we maintain that the fight against the foreign language press for the purpose of suppressing it is not an honorable one. Certain circles must have certain interests in suppressing it. We mean to say here that these groups are not motivated by pure American patriotism <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0786.jpg" n="5"/>but rather by selfish considerations. We would not be surprised to learn that reactionary politicians, uncertain of the vote of the foreign-born citizen, wish to do away with his press thinking thereby to retain his vote. Should these politicians be successful in bringing to Congress a bill to suppress the foreign language press, it would not be difficult to prove that their accusations are false and that the exception is being used to represent the rule. By presenting a few radical, irresponsible sheets they attempt to link to them hundreds of newspapers which are absolutely loyal to America and American institutions. It is the duty of the representatives of the foreign language press in America to take the necessary steps to stop this group of questionable politicians from fishing in murky waters. Especially in this critical moment when every country is in a state of turmoil, is it easily possible to sway public opinion. Therefore we must be active and must not permit reactionary politicians to poison public opinion against this press.</p>
   <p>We also hope that from the material now being gathered by government officials <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0787.jpg" n="6"/>the conclusion drawn will affirm the loyalty of the foreign language press to the United States government. The government itself will not permit this press to be suppressed or limited.</p>
