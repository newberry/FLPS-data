   <p>Max Pam, known as one of the greatest corporation lawyers in America died on September 14, at the age of 60. He was one of the lawyers who directed the epoch making organization of the U. S. Steel Corporation. He represented the Deering interests in the formation of the International Harvester Company and handled for E. H. Harriman the merger that resulted in the organization of the Kansas City Southern Railroad. In these enterprises, Mr. Pam blazed trails that American industrial leaders have followed in massing their interests. On his own behalf, Mr. Pam participated with Chas. G. Dawes in the organization of the Central Trust Company of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pam first came to Chicago 58 years ago. He was born in Austria and was on his own resources almost from the day he learned to walk. His work in the public schools finished. Young Pam resolved to become a lawyer. He began by working in the offices of Adolph Moses at $2 a week.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1164.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After working hours he read law and by 1886 he became a partner of Mr. Moses and for 15 years Mr. Pam was one of the most brilliant trial lawyers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He became associated with Elbert H. Gary in 1897 and took over much of the Gary law business. When the steel magnate retired from practice in 1898 a year later he helped John W. Gates and others organize the American Steel &amp; Wire Company. The year 1900 saw the organization of the International Harvester Company. In that great merger, Mr. Pam was a factor too. Later he figured in the formation of the National Packing Company, Allis Chalmers Company, the International Nickel Company, the American Steel Foundries and the Chicago Title and Trust Company.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pam was also the founder of the new school of journalism at Notre Dame University.</p>
