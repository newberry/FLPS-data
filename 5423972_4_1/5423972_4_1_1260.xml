   <p>The death of Gerhard Foreman, on Friday, August 6, was a severe blow, especially to the Jewish community in which he held a high and honorable position. Mr. Foreman was born in Germany, April 30, 1823, and after enjoying good educational advantages in his native land, came as a young man to the United States in 1853, and settled in Illinois.</p>
   <p>He married Miss Hannah Greenebaum, daughter of Jacob Greenebaum, one of the earliest settlers in the city. Shortly after, Gerhard Foreman and Elias Greenebaum, his wife's brother, opened a bank and brokerage business. Selecting 43 Clark street as their place of business, the firm prospered and promised to become the big financial institution of the city, when the fire of 1871 swept their place of business away. Books, valuable papers, and money were saved. Greenebaum and Foreman were the first to open up after the fire. The firm helped considerably to alleviate the needs and sufferings of the victims of the great conflagration. The firm continued business until 1884, and then the partnership ceased. Elias Greenebaum retiring. The institution was then continued under the firm name of Gerhard Foreman and Sons; Edward G., Oscar G., and Henry G. Foreman being admitted to partnership. There years ago, the father retired and the new name of Foreman Brothers was <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1261.jpg" n="2"/>given the institution.</p>
   <p>The funeral was held from the residence, 2901 Michigan avenue, and was attended by a very large crowd. In the abscence of Dr. Hirsch, the final rites were performed by Rabbi Joseph Stoltz.</p>
