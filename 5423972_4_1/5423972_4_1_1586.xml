<title level="a">THE DIRECTOR OF THE CHICAGO SYMPHONY</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>In the Chicago music world, the name of Jack Gordoh, director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, appears among those of the most popular and prominent musicians.</p>
   <p>Outside of Frederick Stock, the conductor of the Symphony, Mr. Gordon, is undoubtedly the most popular musician in Chicago. Stock instructs and gives orders to the orchestra, but Gordon sees to it that all instructions and commands be carried out correctly. When it comes to publicity, Mr. Stock takes Gordon out and introduces him to the public as the great and talented leader he is. It is no wonder that this young Jewish musician is such a success as an orchestra leader, as a musician, and especially as a great violinist. Gordon has many good <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1587.jpg" n="2"/>virtues in addition to his musical talent. He was born lucky. His parents were wealthy business people in Odessa, Russia, where he was born. His whole life consisted of hard work and much ambition. His parents selected for him a musical career, the violin. But no sooner did he get to his senses than he began to realize that he could not depend upon his ingenuity alone, but that he should get out in the world and study the art of music.</p>
   <p>He was six years old when he was admitted to the Imperial Conservatory of Odessa. His teacher, a famous musician, Franz Stoopka, soon discovered the talent of the youngster. He then decided to devote more of his time to him.</p>
   <pb n="3"/><p>At the age of 13, he graduated at the conservatory with high honors, receiving his first prize. At the age of 14, he went to Germany for advanced studies. He studied there for a time and went to France. At 16 he and his parents came to New York.</p>
   <p>American began to smile at him from the very first day he landed. While here he continued his studies with still greater energies.</p>
   <p>The famous musician Franz Kwaizel was his teacher. Gordon was the first to start folk concerts in New York Socialist schools. Wherever her performed, he received encouragement and inspiration. This was especially the case when he became acquainted with the editor of the Daily Forward, Mr. A. Cahan, who encouraged him a great deal.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1588.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He later toured the United States and Canada, appearing in concerts in many large cities. In 1919 Gordon, with the New York Symphony Orchestra, traveled in Europe. He gave concerts in France, Holland, England, Belgium, and Italy, where he was greeted with great honor. He spent three years with the famous Berksier quartet. He also played with the well-known artist Harold Bauer and with Eno Waisievitz.</p>
   <p>Among Mr. Gordon's colleagues are the violinists Heifetz, Elman, and Zeidel, whom he is proud to call comrades.</p>
   <p>This is Mr. Gordon's first season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, of which he is concert leader. He is also engaged in many other musical activities being conductor of the Sinai Symphony Orchestra and head of the violin department of the American Conservatory in Kimball Hall.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1589.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As all accomplished musicians, Mr. Gordon is not conceited. He is just a modest Jewish young man who makes a very sympathetic impression upon everyone he comes in contact with.</p>
   <p>He has reached the apex, the greatest success, yet he never forgets those who are still climbing. He subsidized many artists who have not as yet reached success, and always extended them a glad hand. His closest and most beloved comrade, with whom he shares his feeling and inspiration, is the rare Stradivarius which he recently bought at a price of $15,000. This rare violin, in years gone by, belonged to a certain musician, Maria Shuman, who was a close relation of the famous German composer, Robert Shuman.</p>
   <p>"In these secrets of the violin, which cannot be duplicated," he said, "I now seek the secret of life and inspiration which drives and forces man to climb higher and higher."</p>
