   <p>A shrewd psychologist and hypocritical egoist, who has enough understanding to free himself from mental bias which confronts him from time to time, will always be able to take advantage of everything for his personal interests, even though they may appear, at first sight, to be opposed to his interests.</p>
   <p>Take, for example, the case of women who have now obtained political equality to a certain degree, in our state and in many eastern states. It was believed, and some still believe, that the women would first of all invade the saloons and other drinking spots which are of no benefit to society.</p>
   <p>The beer and whiskey manufacturers really feared the women and, therefore, they did not support political equality. But when the current could no longer be resisted, there were many shrewd heads among the whiskey and beer dealers who declared that the woman proper is an aid to the brewers.</p>
   <p>The American Brewers Review, a monthly journal, thinks that we can and must enlighten the woman so that she should enter the saloon together with the men. They need only keep the saloons in good order, clean and decent. The American woman, in their opinion, should show that she is independent and should not feel ashamed to spend her time, drinking a glass of beer or whiskey, among a crowd of men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1057.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But it is certain that the saloons will have to change their appearance and become real entertainment places before the woman will have enough courage to go there. And this, too, will be a great victory in favor of public decency and better manners, even if it increases the income and salaries of the alcohol dealers and alchohol producers.</p>
