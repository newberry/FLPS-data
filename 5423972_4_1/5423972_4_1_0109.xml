<title level="a">THE AGITATION AGAINST CHICAGO'S FRANCHISE IN THE STATE</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The politicians upstate have begun to agitate in order to limit the number of representatives from Chicago in the Illinois State Legislature. The politicians have the audacity to declare that the citizens of Chicago do not deserve to have a proportionately equal share of representatives in the legislature as compared with the citizens from the rest of the state.</p>
   <p>This scandalous insult to the citizens of Chicago is also an attempt to violate one of the fundamental principles of the American Constitution--the right of all citizens to have a voice in the government. This attempt cannot be too strongly condemned by all liberal-minded people. Such an agitation is a dangerous threat, not only to the citizens of Chicago, but also to the entire country.</p>
   <p>The danger consists not only in the possibility that such an un-American activity <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0110.jpg" n="2"/>by the "one-hundred-per-cent" Americans may be successful, but in the fact that they have dared at all to come out with such propaganda; a few years ago, the worst reactionary would not have dared to do so. The very appearance of such agitation is alarming. It shows how far we have come from the spirit of the American traditions of freedom and equality, and what a bitter fruit the propaganda of chauvinism has produced.</p>
   <p>This un-American plan of the upstate politicians should be considered only in connection with the "one-hundred-per-cent" drive against freedom that has been going on for the last few years, and that is even now being conducted in various forms. It is the old story about giving the devil a finger. Sooner or later, he wants to grab the entire hand. Once we have allowed ourselves to begin to limit and prohibit the exercise of political and personal rights, there is no end to the limitations which we may attempt.</p>
   <p>Anti-immigration, prohibition, the attempt to limit the freedom of expression--these all result from the "one-hundred-per-cent" drive that now reveals itself in the plan of the politicians and hypocritical reformers upstate. Chicago is a <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0111.jpg" n="3"/>city of foreign-born people. As a great, modern, cosmopolitan city, it is more progressive than the other parts of the state, where the majority are farmers who are strongly influenced by the country clergy and the country politicians. These people find it easy to convince the simple farmers that the Chicagoans are not as good and as fine Americans as they, themselves, are, and, therefore, should not have an equal voice in the government of the state. But is this against the principles of freedom and equality? Well, we should not be too fussy about those principles. If it is right to suppress another person's opinion when it does not agree with ours, if it is right to close the gates of the country to the oppressed and persecuted people of other lands, if it is right to deprive the majority of their personal freedom at the wish of a minority--it is also right to deprive the citizen of one of the largest cities in the world of their right to a voice in the government of their state, a state that has become rich and powerful through the efforts of that city.</p>
   <p>There is an old Jewish saying: "One sin causes another". A violation of one of the old American principles causes a violation of another, and so on, ad infinitum. The progressive elements within the country should protest not only against this <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0112.jpg" n="4"/>attempt to rob the citizens of Chicago of their rights, but should also energetically demand a return to the old traditional policies that have made America famous as the land of true liberty. Only a speedy and a radical retreat to the old way of freedom can put an effective end to the various conspiracies of the fanatics and hypocrites against the rights of the majority.</p>
