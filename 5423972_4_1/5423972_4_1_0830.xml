<title level="a">WHAT SHOULD MOTHERS DO WITH THEIR CHILDREN?</title><title level="a" type="sub">By Becky Vazon</title></bibl>

   <p>Rather than from a mother whose children encircle her on all sides, each of them demanding a different thing, which she cannot afford, the complaint of children being a nuisance comes from government circles in our large city,--Chicago.</p>
   <p>The children, it is claimed, are a terrible nuisance. They are always in unwanted places, block the sidewalks, and make terrific noise with their roller skates. This, however, can be to a certain extent tolerated, but there is something else far more serious. They fly through the streets on their roller skates, exposing themselves to the automobiles. The danger is grave. And so, what should be done?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0831.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There is nothing left for the children to do but vacate the streets.</p>
   <p>Our boulevards and immaculate streets are expressly for those who ride around in automobiles, just as if it would be their private property.</p>
   <p>Ninety-nine out of one hundred drivers do not care about a human life. To them a human being and a chicken are much the same. That the children's lives are imperiled is something left unmentioned.</p>
   <p>But we might ask this question, who should vacate the streets? Should we keep the children locked up in the schools until pitch dark and in the narrow rooms of their homes a whole night, in order to extend the use of the streets only to the privileged auto drivers?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0832.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We will probably be told that the children will then acquire more knowledge. This may be true, but it can only deceive the American mothers, not the Jewish.</p>
   <p>Our Jewish mothers, who come from Eastern Europe, know full well the meaning of this. The Jewish mother conjures up in her memory the old Jewish Cheder (Hebrew School), where the mind was developed without any regard for the physical being.</p>
   <p>One of the most praiseworthy topics of America is the freedom that is enjoyed by our children. And here a movement is being perpetrated to deprive them of this freedom.</p>
   <p>We want to drive them away from the streets.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0833.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The truth of the matter is that it is too hazardous for the children to be playing on the streets. But do the children have sufficient playground space in Chicago?</p>
   <p>For a positive answer to this question, visit and catch a glimpse of the nearest playground when children are not in school, and if you find enough space there to accommodate a larger number of children, I will suppress my question.</p>
   <p>The playgrounds are so few in comparison with the exigencies of the children, that we can safely say that there is hardly any playground facilities.</p>
   <p>And as long as there will not be a playground in every block, then the children will have to run freely about the streets. In the meantime, let the automobiles cede the streets to the children.</p>
