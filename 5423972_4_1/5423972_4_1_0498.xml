   <p>They want to know--the boys who went into it with their bodies and souls, giving their strength, their courage, even their lives, voluntarily and magnificently--they want to know: Do you stand behind them? You, who live in pleasure and comfort, whose security they are defending against the foe; you, who enjoy liberty and freedom which they gain for you with their lives--will you enter into this great world conflict exactly as they have done--until the last step? Stand by them, men and women of America, show these heroic, self-sacrificing brothers of yours that you are with them; lend them a hand--they are waiting for it.</p>
   <p>They give the noblest that they have. Do you do the same? Do transports arrive as fast as they should? Do provisions reach them in as great quantities as they require? Will they have warm clothing? Will they have enough ammunition? Can they depend upon your ability to compare the value of your <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0499.jpg" n="2"/>money against [the value of] their lives?</p>
   <p>The time has come when the boys on the battlefields want to see what kind of Americans you are. The Third Liberty Loan is the test. Everything is ready for you [to enable you] to affiliate yourselves with the rest of the family.</p>
   <p>Don't remain a traitor to the American soldier. With one blow you can win this struggle against your selfishness and smugness. Give your dollars, as the boys give their lives,--wholeheartedly in this war--show that you stand by them. More transports! More provisions! More clothing! More gratitude!</p>
   <p>The Third Liberty Loan wants every free dollar you have! You are giving the money to the boys there across the water, who are fighting your battle. Lend them a hand--and that means: give until the last dollar--subscribe now--buy United States Government Bonds of the Third Liberty Loan!</p>
   <p>Adv. paid for by Frank Sampson, Chairman Exemption Board, 81st Division.</p>
