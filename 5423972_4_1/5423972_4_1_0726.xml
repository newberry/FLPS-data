   <p>In the Florida Legislature a bitter struggle is now being carried on over a bill to abolish physical punishment to prisoners.</p>
   <p>The bill is a result of the disclosure of the dreadful brutalities which have been committed against prisoners on the plantations. The masters of the plantations, rich and prominent men of the South, "hire" these prisoners and work them like slaves. The "overseers" torture the prisoners to death, seeking to extract more labor from them.</p>
   <p>The debate on this bill is characteristic of the South, which has still not forgotten its tradition of slavery. A large majority of the lawmakers of Florida oppose the bill, defending the sacred institution of flogging and, particularly, condemning the propaganda against the brutalities committed on the plantations, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0727.jpg" n="2"/>a propaganda intended to "pollute the good name of the South".</p>
   <p>This language is the language of slaveholders of fifty years ago, which is now being repeated by their grandchildren and which shows the world that the spirit of their progenitors still lives in them. It is just these grandchildren of the former slaveholders who "pollute the good name of the South".</p>
