</bibl>

   <p>Our own Levi Mayer, the well-known corporation lawyer, himself encumbered with several hundred thousand dollars, spoke to the Chicago Association of Creditors. He explained that the new American income tax meant a higher tax than even that levied upon the citizens of the European soldier-ridden countries.</p>
   <p>In his speech, Mr. Mayer explained that he does not oppose the principle of a tax on income, and it matters little to him that 99 1/2 per cent of the people can force payment on one-half per cent of the people, the payers of income tax. What he is concerned with is that a man whose income is but $1,000,000 a year will have to pay the large sum of $59,700 tax to the national government, and, if we add the taxes assessed by the state, county, and city, we can see that in America a man is uncertain of earning even $1,000,000 a year.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0131.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Setting aside this supposition, Mr. Mayer gibes at our lawmakers, saying that they may (Heaven forbid!) go still further, leading to the state where one earning a mere half-million dollars will also be uncertain of his income, and be fleeced by the government.</p>
   <p>It was a beautiful speech. The creditors applauded their great lawyer, but, with all its beauty the speech was neither new nor original. This theme was heard by our great grandfathers. When the 99 1/2 per cent of the people sought to tax the land that belonged to the one-half per cent, the one-half per cent was able to evade the tax while the 99 1/2 per cent paid and paid until they became dissatisfied with the tax of the one-half per cent that took away their land, their livelihood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mayer must also know that taxes are collected by governments to defend private property not human lives. Remove from government the duty of protecting and developing private property and the government ceases to be a patron spender. It is no more than right that those who benefit from this protection of the government should pay for its defense.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0132.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is hardly believable, but it is a fact that even the greatest defenders of the interests of the plutocrats today have no better arguments than in the past....Send a Levi Mayer to Congress and you hear the same arguments as those heard from Louis XVI in his time.</p>
   <p>One-half per cent of the people have no right to make millions that 99 1/2 per cent must protect, or else they must pay for that protection.</p>
   <p>This is the error of the Levi Mayers, when they believe that the people do not understand the situation. The masses progress slowly, but they go constantly forward. The income tax is just one move by the 99 1/2 per cent against the one-half percent, but it is not the last one.</p>
