   <p>Windsor, June 3.</p>
   <p>Editor of Jewish Courier: Since you are the official Jewish organ in Chicago, I request a favor of you which I hope you will grant. Before I left for Windsor, I heard that a Red Moggen David (Shield of David) had been organized to aid Jewish legionnaires who had gone to win back the Jewish land for the Jews.I regret to say however that nothing has been heard from Chicago of a Red Moggen David. We have many activities going on here, such as arranging for a hall where the boys can spend their spare time, arranging for courses in Hebrew, as well as lectures about Palestine. But we need money for all these things. I am not trying to create the impression that we haven't the means. [Far from it.] New York and many other smaller cities will gladly provide us with all the necessary requirements. But what I do mean is that Chicago should also be represented here. I must admit at this point that sometimes I have been ashamed to say that I came from Chicago. So small a city as Milwaukee, Wisconsin, [in contrast to the Jewish <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0456.jpg" n="2"/>population of Chicago] floods us with questions as to how they may serve us; yet Chicago remains silent.</p>
   <p>I hope that you will pardon me for expressing myself thus. I am from Chicago and I know that Chicago Jewry is heart and soul for the Jewish Legion. Therefore I want Chicago to be represented here. I do hope that you will place us in contact with the Red Moggen David.</p>
   <p>With legionnaire greetings, I remain,</p>
   <p>Morris Tropf,</p>
   <p>Jewish Battalion.</p>
