   <p>When it was announced that mail is being delivered by air-ships, everyone thought: it will take a long time before such a thing will materialize. No one wanted to believe in the possibility of such a wonderful event.</p>
   <p>When, however, men actually started to carry mail from Washington to Philadelphia and Pittsburg, people began believing that it was a fact. And when it was announced that pilots delivered mail from New York to Chicago, then people became interested in this phenomenon and asked: "Who is the great man that thought of such a way to carry mail, that will in time revolutionize the entire Post Office system in the United States?" And the answer was: "A Jewish young man born in Chicago by the name of B. B. Lippsner, first superintendent of the Air Planes of the Post Office Department."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1404.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When it was made known that a Jew was at the top of this undertaking, people began having more faith in the matter. Capt. B. B. Lippsner is thirty-two years old, was born in Chicago of poor parents. His father, Max Lipshiltz, resides at Taylor and Paulina streets, and is a salesman of miscellaneous articles.</p>
   <p>As a small boy, he had an affection for mechanical problems and he was always interested in machinery. Mr. Lippsner graduated from a technical school and received his first position in the Texas Oil Company. He soon gained a reputation as an inventor, technician and specialist in motor transportation.</p>
   <p>In 1917, he enlisted in the Army and rose to the rank of captain. On July 15, 1918, he resigned from the Army, accepting an appointment as the First Superintendent of the United States Aerial Mail Department.</p>

   <p>When the Assistant Post Master General, Mr. <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>le, became aware that Capt. Lippsner was selected for this office, he stated that the Captain was one of the best authorities on <gap unit="chars" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> transportation in the country, and as the Government would eventually take over the air mail service, Mr. Lippsner would be the right man for the position. In the short time that Mr. Lippsner has been Superintendent, he has made many improvements in the work of sending mail by air planes.</p>
