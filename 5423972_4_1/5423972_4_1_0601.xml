<title level="a">THE RESULTS OF THE ZIONIST CONVENTION IN CHICAGO</title>.
<title level="a" type="sub">(EDITORIAL)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Twenty-first Annual Convention of the Zionist Organizations of the Middle West did not change the position of the prominent Zionists as to a program for the betterment of the Jewish masses.</p>
   <p>Zionism became a weapon against justice and peace, on account of its association with politicians of this country. It is no accident that the leading political reactionary, the editor of Halsted Street (Courier) is the chairman of the Zionist Executive Committee. It is also in the spirit of the new course of political Zionism that of the three Chicago vice presidents, one is a judge, who has given out injunctions against strikers, and another, is theworst enemy of organized labor and radicals in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0602.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There is also no doubt that the Zion leader of Chicago, whom Jack De Haas promises to send to rule Palestine will belong to the political machine of Halsted Street.....an enemy of the Jewish working masses and a defender of reaction.</p>
   <p>The Zionist Convention spoke much about the posterity of Palestine, but hardly anything about the present condition of the Jewish race. Can they demand national equality for the Russian Jews now? Can they adopt a program of Jewish public schools, high schools and institution for higher education in America? And here is where their spirit is shown to be bankrupt. For the present, the Zionist leaders of Chicago Avenue, with very few exception, thoroughtly assimilated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0603.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>They neither teach their children Yiddish nor Hebrew. Their entire Judaism is limited to the reactionary periodical, in Yiddish, through which they seek to buy and sell the Jewish vote in times of election.</p>
   <p>They are not interested in the afflictions of the poor. The high cost of living does not concern them. They do not sympathize with the poor masses, who are not weeping in the midst of world destruction, they build their fortunes upon graves and publicly show their joy with the present condition, from which they procure their spiritual and material power.</p>
   <p>The common people who go to hear words of redemption, the beautiful sermons of Schmarya Levin and M. Schenkin, will be bitterly disgusted when the spirit of the present convention will die and their suffering will begin anew.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0604.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Then the wall of Zionism will be the greatest bulwark against the labor organization.</p>
   <p>On one side of the wall stand those who are in midst of idoltry of the bloody angel and the golden calf, and on the other side stand those who strive for the sacred spirit of justice and peace.</p>
