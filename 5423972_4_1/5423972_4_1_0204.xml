   <p>Leonard J. Grossman, is the non-partisan candidate for alderman of the fifth ward. Grossman has tried and won important cases as assistant corporation counsel for the city of Chicago. When the zoning law, which went into effect four years ago, was first attacked, it was Leonard Grossman who was charged with its defense in the first test case.</p>
   <p>The Herald and Examiner's tribute to Grossman's victory in the zoning fight bears the caption, "Official Trust Justified.....Chicago Useful Zoning Law is Saved to City by Court's Ruling."</p>
   <p>Mr. Grossman was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1891, and came north in 1897. He has spent most of his life since then in Hyde Park. While employed by Sears, he studied law at night at the Chicago Kent College of Law.</p>
   <p>In 1908, he won the state interscholastic contest at the University of Illinois, and also the interscholastic contest at Beloit College. He received an entrance scholarship to the University of Chicago in 1909.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0205.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among the organizations with which Mr. Grossman has been affiliated for some years, are the Chicago Bar Association, Lawyers Association of Illinois, and B'nai B'rith, (president for two terms.) He has also been chairman of the Chicago Central Committee.</p>
