   <p>After a long illness, Simon Fish, who for many years was president of the L. Fish Furniture Company, passed away last Monday night. The funeral will be held tomorrow forenoon at half past ten o'clock from Furth's Chapel, 635 E. 47th Street to Mount Mayriv Cemetery. Besides relatives and friends of the deceased, the employees of the company will also attend the funeral.........</p>
   <p>The deceased came, at an early age with his father, David Fish, from St. Louis to Chicago, and took a lively interest in local politics after he grew to manhood. He always was a Democrat and an intimate friend of Carter H. Harrison the older. His father bought a two-story frame house on the northeast corner of Wells and Madison Streets after coming to Chicago, and opened a furniture store, which was transferred to 19th and State Streets after the great fire.</p>

   <p>When the founder of the firm died in 1906, Simon Fish became his successor, and from the small store he developed one of the largest furniture stores in Chicago. The company has a capital stock of $2,000,000 and five big stores.....</p>
