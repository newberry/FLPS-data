   <p>When it became known at the bank that the concern would be put into the hands of a Receiver, the small army of depositors who were to draw out money, and had been told that they could not get,it, looked a little blue about the gills, so to speak, but the more intelligent of them had little to say, except that they believed Mr. Greenebaum had done the best that he could; that they were sorry for him, and especially for themselves, and that they had no doubt the best thing that could be done for the bank was to turn it over to a Receiver, and let him wind it up. There were others among them who couldn't understand it. They appeared to be a good deal dazed, and sat around on the hard benches, or stood up in little knots around the room, asking each other what it all meant. By-and-by it began to dawn on them that the bank would pass out of Mr. Greenebaum's hands, and into the hands of the Court.</p>
