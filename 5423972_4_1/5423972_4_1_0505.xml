<title level="a">FUNERAL TODAY FOR SERGEANT BEN LHEIT</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Chicago Jews will bury today, with a big parade, Sergeant B. Lheit, who died in the service of Uncle Sam at his post at Fort Mason, California.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Lheit descends from a noted family. He was a graduate of Medill High School and, as a devoted patriot, was one of the first to answer the call of President Wilson to volunteer for the defense of American liberty against the bloodthirsty German Junkerdom, which compelled America to draw the sword.</p>
   <p>His body was brought to Chicago for burial and a committee was organized to give him an impressive military funeral to which he is entitled.</p>
   <p>The funeral will start at 1 P.M. sharp from the residence of his mother, 1415 Millard Avenue, where the big gathering will assemble and from where it will march to the Marks Nathan Orphanage Synagogue, where the following program will be carried out.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0506.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The chairman will be Mr. Charles M. Herron; Rabbi A. B. Goldenson will deliver the elegy of lamentation, and Cantor Titelman will say "E1 Moleh Rachmim" (a Hebrew prayer for the dead). Mr. Max M. Korshak will deliver the main speech.</p>
   <p>As sergeant, he is entitled to a military escort of twenty-two soldiers. Captain Bell selected yesterday twenty-two soldiers and placed them under the command of Corporal Green. These troopers will be the active pallbearers, who will fire several gun salutes at the open grave, as a token of the last military honor accorded Sergeant Lheit.</p>
   <p>Besides the troopers, the following will take part in the parade: The cadets of Medill High School, the Marks Nathan Orphanage Band, the Lawndale Club, and the Neighborhood Committee of the State Council of Defense.</p>
   <p>The marshal will be Mr. Max M. Korshak, and the committee which arranged the funeral consists of the following:</p>
   <p>Michael Rosenberg, Alderman John Toman, Alderman Joseph Kestner, Samuel J. Rosenblatt, Judge Harry M. Fischer, Emil N. Zola, M.M. Korshak, Charles Mitchell, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0507.jpg" n="3"/>Morris Goldsmith, Dr. Jacob Gortenstein, Paul Rissman, J. L. Rissman, Frank Sampson, Dr. Louis Miller, Sol Roderick, Philip Kahn, I. Kahn, and B. Kahn.</p>
