  <body>
   <p>Leopold Pfalzer, one of the most renowned Jews in Chicago, died Saturday evening in the St. Luke's Hospital after a brief illness. Mr. Pfalzer was sixty years old and was a candidate on the Democratic ticket for nomination as member of the Board of Assessors in the forthcoming primary election. Just five days ago, when his campaign had actually just begun, he became ill and before the doctors could operate, he died.</p>
   <p>The deceased was a successful businessman and a brother of the former Assessor, the late David M. Pfalzer. He came to Chicago from Boden, Germany when he was a young lad. For the last few years he was the general agent in Chicago of the Eliel and Loeb Insurance Company. He leaves his widow, Rettie Hirsch Pfalzer; one son, Myron; and one daughter, Hortense. Funeral services will be held tomorrow at Temple Isaiah, where Dr. Joseph Stolz will deliver the elegy. Burial will be in the Temple Isaiah Cemetery.</p>
