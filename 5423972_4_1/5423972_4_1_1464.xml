   <p>The well-known Bankers, Mr. Ginsburg &amp; Sons, 635 W. 12th Street, who, during the last twelve years have achieved a high reputation for their honest dealings with the public, wish to announce that they will begin to pay 3% interest on saving-deposits on January 1st, 1912.</p>
   <p>Interest is to be paid on July 10th, and on January 10th of every year. The bank makes loans on mortgages, and deals in steamship transportation to all parts of the World. Our safety-deposit vaults are as safe from fire and theft as any in Chicago, and the charge is only $3.00 per annum, and no deposit for vault keys. The vaults are open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, except Saturday.</p>
   <p>We forward money for you to all parts of Europe, and we guarantee a reply in 28 days.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1465.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Bank offers the services of a Notary Public, and the making out of all legal-papers in all languages, at a very reasonable cost to the patrons.</p>
   <p>M. Ginsburg &amp; Sons Savings Bank</p>
