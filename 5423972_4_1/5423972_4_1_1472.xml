   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>As the only Jewish paper in Chicago which is being read by all Jews, I request that you print the following notice to peddlers, and by so doing you will get the thanks of many poor peddlers living in the Jewish district in Chicago. This is adressed to the peddlers:</p>
   <p>Every worker understands how bad the conditions are of those who have just arrived from Russia, Poland, or Galicia. They cannot get jobs so easily, and some who can get employment are forced to work on Saturdays which is against their convictions. They, therefore, have to resort to peddling as the only alternative. So, most of them are forced to take a bundle of brooms on their shoulders, or an assortement of porcelain <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1473.jpg" n="2"/>dishes, and go out on the street to cry their wares. Those who know anything about peddling also know the miserable life of a peddler. Most of the time peddlers have no money even to buy bare necessities, so they have to resort to barter and exchange. They offer their customers the things they have in exchange for things they need. Thus they buy old clothes and old shoes, and when Sunday comes around, they go out on Jefferson street to sell their accumulated goods. But the customers coming to Jefferson street are poor themselves, so it can easily be understood how sad the lot of the peddlers must be.</p>
   <p>However, bad as it is, it has become even worse, for the store keepers on Jefferson street, who sell the same second hand clothing and shoes, have organized themselves and have sent a petition to the city, claiming that the peddlers, who come there on Sundays to sell their stuff are ruining their businesses, and, therefore, they petition that the peddlers be chased away from that district. As a result of this act, police from <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1474.jpg" n="3"/>the Maxwell Street Station are patrolling the district and are aresting all peddlers who try to sell in the Jefferson street neighborhood. They arrest as many as six or seven peddlers each Sunday, and they have to pay a fine for peddling on the street without a license. Those who are unable to pay have to stay in jail, and their poor wives and children are left to starve.</p>
   <p>So pay attention broom and granite peddlers. It is high time that you look out. Watch your step, for they are going to arrest you everytime you will try to sell something there. Why don't you organize to fight this evil? Get together anywhere, in a synagogue or in a hall, and decide to do something to improve your sad lot!</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>A. Broom Peddler</p>
