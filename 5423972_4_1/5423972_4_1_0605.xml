   <p>Picture the scene of a terrific fire breaking out at your neighbor's, destroying his property and the lives of his household, and the wind blowing the flames to your house and burning sparks flying over your roof--what sort of thought would then enter your mind and fill your heart? What would then concern you most?</p>
   <p>It is a clear matter that if you were in no position to extinguish your neighbor's fire, you would, first of all, seek means to protect your property and those living in your household.</p>
   <p>Also picture that the fire marshal in your city is a competent man capable of protecting your house against fire; that he employs all means that fire fighters can possibly improvise so as not to permit the flames and sparks to <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0606.jpg" n="2"/>attack your home; that he covers your roof with damp covers, and puts on the hose full force in order to consume every betraying spark that invades your home--under such circumstances would you think of dismissing the fire marshal and put in his place another one of whose heroism you are not certain?</p>
   <p>If the fear and excitement of the moment would not rob you of your common sense, you would certainly not do it. To make such an exchange in a moment of such danger would be sheer insanity and contrary to every natural instinct of self-defense. It would be in direct contradiction with the saying: "Look out for your life."</p>
   <p>Is not the present situation of the United States similar to the situation of a man whose property and household are imperiled by the flames and sparks coming from his neighbor?</p>
   <p>And is not President Wilson the able fire marshal who has till now, under extreme complexities, proved himself capable of protecting the United States from <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0607.jpg" n="3"/>the betraying flames sweeping to its shores?</p>
   <p>Yet, there are people who tell us that we should remove President Wilson in the midst of the great danger and replace him by Mr. Hughes, of whose heroism as a fire fighter we know nothing.</p>
   <p>Even to listen to such a proposal is purely nonsensical.</p>
   <p>We have witnessed, in the last two and one half years of the war, how one nation after another has been dragged into the bloody caldron and how they are wrestling with death; we have seen how the flames sweep over to our shores, and more than once has the United States stood in danger of being ignited by the tempestuous fire. Until now we have, thank God, been saved from the horrible cataclysm, because we have in the White House a man with a clear head, with the cautiousness, calmness, and intelligence of a true scholar; in him we have a man whose instincts are against bloodshed and against brutality, unless they are imperative for the safety of the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0608.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Just listen to the words of Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Hughes, who are seeking flaws in Wilson's foreign policy! Do you think for a moment that if Mr. Roosevelt or Hughes were now in the White House instead of President Wilson and [that] if they would act as they claim President Wilson should have acted--at a time when nations arise against each other, endangering their own existence and the lives of their millions of inhabitants and are armed to the teeth--do you think that the United States would be able to live in safety and enjoy the prosperity which it has?</p>
   <p>Do you think, perhaps, that your sons and your brothers and your husbands and your fathers of small children would now have been in the circle of your families?</p>
   <p>If you think so you are mistaken.</p>
   <p>Should the United States be dragged into the flames which sweep from Europe, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0609.jpg" n="5"/>then everyone who is capable of bearing arms will have to go. England, a country which is as free as America, was forced to establish compulsory military service. America would be forced to do it, too.</p>
   <p>Are we afraid? No! We Jews have proven in the present, as in previous wars that we are loyal and do not fear death, if it is necessary. But is it necessary? What has the United States to gain by being dragged into the war? Why lead the youth of America to slaughter, when America is not being attacked?</p>
   <p>They speak of honor just as if Mr. Wilson has not proven how sensible hs is in all matters concerning the honor of the United States. He is, however, opposed to the honor of cheap sports who act like bullies in order to display their strength.</p>
   <p>The danger of the flames is now as threatening as it has been for the past two and one half years. It is senseless to exchange an experienced fire marshal for an inexperienced one in the midst of a fire.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0610.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Common sense prefers Wilson.</p>
