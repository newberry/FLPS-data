<title level="a">TWELVE HUNDRED PERSONS AT THE RED SHIELD OF DAVID CELEBRATION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>More than twelve hundred persons gathered yesterday evening in the gymnasium hall of the Hebrew Institute for the Red Shield of David celebration, which was a gigantic moral and financial success. Especially beautiful and impressive was the unfolding of the service flag in honor of the one hundred Jewish heroes of Chicago, who enlisted in the Jewish Legion.</p>
   <p>The honor of unfolding the service flag was awarded by the sale of votes at one cent a vote, and Mrs. Glickerman received the greatest number--seventy thousand. Next was Mrs. P. Lubin with forty thousand votes and the other candidates received about twenty thousand. The sale of votes brought in the sum of three hundred dollars [sic]. The flag, which is very beautiful and of artistic design, was made and presented to the Red Shield of David by Mrs. P. Lubin, mother of one of the Chicago Legionnaires, and <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0482.jpg" n="2"/>will remain in the hall as an historical souvenir. Mrs. Glickerman then walked to the platform at the head of more than thirty Legionnaires who were present at the celebration, and unfolded the service flag dotted with one hundred "Shields of David". The assembly was deeply moved by this ceremony, and heartily applauded the heroes of Zion and Mrs. Lubin who presented the flag.</p>
   <p>The evening was opened with a brief address by chairman Dr. I.Marcus, and a few beautiful violin solos by Master Reuben Davis. Appropriate speeches about the Jewish Legion and the Red Shield of David were made by Leon Zolotokoff and Professor Nachum Slustch. The audience was particularly impressed with Madame Pruson-Halpern who sang several compositions by Wagner, Kreisler, and Rafheld. Madame Pruson-Halpern was almost last on the program but, as the saying goes, last and best.</p>
   <p>In recognition of the participation of Madame Pruson-Halpern in the celebration, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0483.jpg" n="3"/>the Red Shield of David presented her with a beautiful bouquet of flowers,which was first raffled off and then given to the famous opera singer. Mr. S. B. Komaiko paid the highest price, twenty-five dollars, for the flowers.</p>
   <p>One of the Legionnaires who will leave Chicago this evening for Canada is Harry Cohn, a native of Jaffa, who fought under the British flag at Verdun and was wounded twice. He was honorably discharged from the service over a year ago, and came to Chicago where he at once enlisted in the Jewish Legion.</p>
   <p>"You can't imagine how I feel," said Legionnaire Cohn. "I was exiled from Jaffa and enlisted in the British Army in Egypt, and now I am going back to my motherland to fight--fight for the liberation of the Jewish people."</p>
   <p>The Red Shield of David will distribute presents to the Legionnaires on their departure. The Legionnaires will assemble in the afternoon at the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0484.jpg" n="4"/>office of the British Recruiting Commission, Marquette Building, whence they will march to the train.</p>
