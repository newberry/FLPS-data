   <p>Mrs. DeVou, head of the National Organization of Women Voters, had many better comparisons to make, rather than to remark about the Russian immigrant. If she wanted to expose, in forceful lingo, the ridiculousness of the antagonistic contentions against women's sufferage, she could have said whatever she wished in words that were true, logical, and right. Instead she sarcastically remarked that the figure of a Negro or a Russian immigrant should have been designated as an emblem of freedom rather than the figure of a woman who has no political rights, and therefore cannot appear as an emblem of freedom.</p>
   <p>This means that Mrs. DeVou believes that if such people as Negroes and Russian immigrants may have civil rights, then women surely ought to have them. We shall let the Negroes defend themselves and also give the non-Jewish immigrants of Russia the choice of doing or saying whatever they <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1055.jpg" n="2"/>wish about this most untactful and indecent utterance from the leader of the suffragettes. As far as we are concerned, we are merely interested in the reflection cast upon Jews. And if Mrs. DeVou means to say that this which is undoubtedly the literal interpretation of her words:</p>
   <p>"If the Russian-Jew has the right to vote, then women surely ought to have that right," i. e., the Russian Jew is the lowest type of person.. This is not only a slander and a naive, silly, and beastly remark, but the most indecent foolishness which brands the president of the National Council of Women Voters as unpractical in politics and unable to gain the sympathy of the male and a great majority of the female public for her demands for general rights.</p>
