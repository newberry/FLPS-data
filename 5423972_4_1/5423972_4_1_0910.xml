   <p>It has been my pleasure to speak with workers who feel that a longer working day is more profitable than a short working day. My opinions are of course to the contrary. I believe that a short working day is more profitable to the worker than a long one.</p>
   <p>Experience has shown us the following: In those countries or sections of the country where the worker operates under a shorter day, the standard of living is higher than where the worker operates under a longer working day. Workers can better their conditions through a shorter working day in the following ways:</p>
   <p>1. - One is to shorten the day without any wage decrease.</p>
   <p>2. - To receive higher wages for each working day.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0911.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As in known, owners pay their workers only a small portion of the profits resulting from their labors in wages. The remainder is retained by the boss as personal profits.</p>
   <p>If, let us say, the owner pays the worker one-half of the profits resulting from the work of the worker for a ten-hour day, then it is apparent that the worker works five hours for himself and five hours for the factory owner. Workers can lessen this exploitation of their labors by, 1 - a shorter day, let us say, shortening the day from ten hours to eight hours with no reduction in pay, thereby lowering the exploitation of his labors from five hours per day to three hours per day, or, 2 - by continuting a ten hour day but demanding higher wages thereby lowering exploitation, since the boss makes less and the worker more, for the same work.</p>
   <p>The simplest thing to do would be to accept the policy of most of the Trade Unions, which is - to fight for better and shorter working days.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0912.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For, when the working day is shorter, the workers work less and naturally produce less. Therefore, the bosses require more workers and the greater demand there is for workers, the less competition there is among workers themselves, and naturally wages go up.</p>
   <p>One can follow this reasoning a little further. Where workers work longer hours they earn less because of labor competition and an army of unemployed is created. These unemployed have lost their purchasing power, thus cutting consumer demand and those who are employed become unemployed because there is no demand for what they produce.</p>
   <p>But, when we have a shorter working day, there are fewer or no unemployed and these people have a large purchasing power, thus creating a demand for <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0913.jpg" n="4"/>goods, thus giving still more people employment. This should convince all workers that it is in their best interests that they fight for a better and shorter working day.</p>
   <p>Longer hours lead to depressions and depressions wipe out the earnings of both the middle class and the labor class. Where purchasing power exists, crises can be averted.</p>
   <p>How long will it be before workers in Chicago and workers throughout the world will realize this accomplished fact? How long before the slogan of an eight-hour day will become the slogan of all workers in all trades?</p>
