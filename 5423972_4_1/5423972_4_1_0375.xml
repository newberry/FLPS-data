   <p>More than two hundred men and women want to do the city of Chicago a great favor by discarding their own business to become overseers of the city. Everyone of these men and women, if you should question him or her, will tell you that he or she is a candidate for alderman, not because he or she is in need of the job, but because the city needs his or her services and consequently, as good patriots, they must sacrifice themselves for the good of all.</p>
   <p>We know that Chicago could stand a great deal of improvement. Chicago is naturally endowed with many beautiful assets, and to keep it in good order competent men are required who are capable of being good officials. Unfortunately the city doesn't always succeed in having these competent men. Regardless of how the circumstances may be, the result is that the personnel of our city Politicans is not altogether what it should be. The <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0376.jpg" n="2"/>excuse given for this is that the city has many expenses because it does not get enough work from its employees.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that Chicago is not clean enough physically and morally. We have too much dirt and filth on the streets in the different districts of the city; it is said that life and property are precarious in Chicago; that the city does not direct enough attention to protecting the health of its citizens; that it does not offer ample protection against fire, against thieves and burglars; that it is hazardous for a young person, especially a young lady, to walk unescorted outdoors; that the water is unbearable; that the prices of utilities are much too high; that transportation is so poor that it pays better to walk any distance; and so the city is being continuously criticized.</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that guilty of all these things are the politicians whose duties are to attend to the city affairs. These affairs are neglected <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0377.jpg" n="3"/>because the politicians are either incompetent to act in their capacities or it may be of advantage to them to have things run as they are. To the citizens it makes little difference whether the aldermen are incompetent or grafters. They know that things are not in order, and they seek men who should be both competent and honest.</p>
   <p>However, in time of nomination and election of city officers, there appears in the race an army of more than two hundred men and women about most of whom nothing is known, They come to the citizens recommended by themselves, honoring themselves with great and outstanding titles. And on election day the average citizen stands confused. All candidates look alike to him. The "Campaign literature" which he receives daily only tell him of the good qualifications of the candidates, and it seems to him that everyone of these patriotic citizens, who forsake their business, and some go as far as forsaking their own families because they are simply sacrificing themselves for the good of the city, is certainly the most suited candidates. It is only hard for him to prevail upon himself to do one thing. He is permitted to <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0378.jpg" n="4"/>vote for only one person and here are so many good people. His heart begins to ache when he must strike out many good names.</p>
   <p>But his pain, caused by striking out the others, becomes still worse each day after election. He discovers that, instead of selecting the best, he had as usual selected the worst. He arrives at the above conclusion because he sees that his alderman does nothing to mend the defects underlying the city, that he doesn't even intend to introduce order in the most decrepit corners of his ward. And he thinks, i.e., this innocent citizen, that if he only had used common sense and voted for his opponent, it would have been much better.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it so happens that at the next election, two years later, he votes for the other candidate. But when this other candidate is elected to office, the innocent citizen discovers that he made a more deproved exchange. He, then, gives up, thinking that there is not one righteous one. He condemns the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0379.jpg" n="5"/>whole order, adopted by America, of running the governments of the city, state, and nation.</p>
   <p>The citizens, however, forget one thine, viz., that the order is not to be blamed, but they are. If an average businessman is to hire a common clerk, he wants some recommendations. He will not rely upon the clerk's braggadocio. He will find out whether the clerk has any experience in that particular type of work. The businessman will be bent upon having assurance for the honesty and decency of the applicant. Thus is the conduct of every businessman when hiring the most insignificant worker. Now the question of hiring a manager to act in official capacity appears. Then the matter is gone through slowly. Everything about this manager's past is thoroughly investigated. An accurate account of his abilities is sought. His general knowledge of business is not so much questioned as is his specific knowledge of the sort of business he is to be engaged for, and even then, when everything is to the satisfaction of the businessman, he first <pb n="6"/> begins to probe his prospective manager. Only then, when he shows his practical abilities when being probed, will the businessman draw up a contract for his services for a period of two years.</p>
   <p>The very same businessman makes a contract for two years with an alderman, not even knowing his name. He relies entirely upon the virtues of any candidate as described in campaign literature or newspaper articles. He makes up his mind that he will vote for John because John would occasionally greet him in the morning. He elected Tom because the latter sent him a personal letter in which he strongly praises himself.</p>
   <p>The citizen, if he should be earnest, can not say that it is impossible for him to find out the qualifications of a candidate when he is in a race with more than 200 people. The fact is that more than 200 candidates are running in 35 wards on four different tickets, and let us say, for instance, that the Democratic citizens of a certain ward would sincerely like to have an alderman who should be devoted to his office and city, they would
    <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0380.jpg" n="7"/> find it easy to nominate such a person with only a little effort.</p>
   <p>The truth of the matter is that the leaders of a ward are very much like its citizens. If a candidate praises himself skyhigh, then the citizens of that ward, where such an alderman is elected, when a sudden wave of reformism overtakes them, will shout reforms, but will do nothing about inaugurating these reforms. They will not give time, money and energy to see that their ward be represented by a capable man. To carry out these things there is nobody home, because they are as sincere in their reforms as is their alderman in his election promise.</p>
   <p>The moral of this is that the more than two hundred candidates who want to sacrifice themselves for the good of all, will only be such "righteous men" so long as all will be like them. When the citizen will be what an alderman should be, then such sacrifices will not be accepted. There is a remedy for having good aldermen and that is by having good citizens.</p>
