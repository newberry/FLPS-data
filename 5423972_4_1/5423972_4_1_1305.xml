   <p>On next Monday, an event of interest to Jewish as well as financial circles will take place, when Foreman Bros. Banking Company becomes a national bank, dividing into two organizations, the Foreman National Bank, and the Foreman Trust and Saving Bank.</p>
   <p>This great banking house has long been a major factor in financial affairs, and its members have always typified Jewish ability and integrity at their highest. Of even greater gratification to those who hold the Jewish welfare dear, has been the constant and unvarying activity of the Foremans in communal matters. They are a pleasing exception to the many, who, after attaining worldly success, forget their origin and people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1306.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago, in common with the great host of non-Jewish friends of the institution and family, rejoice at this forward step, and wish for them a continuance of the progress which their service to Chicago and their people merit so richly.</p>
