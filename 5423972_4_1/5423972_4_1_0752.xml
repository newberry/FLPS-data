   <p>The Sweat Shop Disease is Appearing Again in Our Big Unions.</p>
   <p>By Morris Ziskind.</p>
   <p>We have two big unions in the same industry, and both are suffering from the same ailments. These are the International Ladies Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. Both unions suffer now more than ever before. This slack season for both is caused by the weather, changing styles, and other various factors. Something has developed of late, in both Trades, which draws the attention of the leaders of both unions. Outside shop - This means that the largest firms, want to run away from the large industrial centers, where the unions are strong, and are preparing to move their shops to small towns bringing along foremen from Chicago, and promising inexperienced workers in the small towns, to teach them the trade, knowing that the help from these farm countries, not being interested in unions, are satisfied with whatever little pay they get and that long hours will not hinder them, especially in the learning of a trade.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0753.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In these small towns there are a good many of these cloak and mens clothing factories. This has caused both unions to start a strong campaign, as both unions are suffering the effects of these factories in the small towns. These new factories are being protected by the rural government, to such an extent, that it is impossible and dangerous for an organizor to enter the town with the intention of organizing the new workers.</p>
   <p>Many of the union workers, unable to stand the slack, were obliged to go to work in these small town factories. They left the unions on the ground that they were not given work, then it is hard to get them back into the union. At the last convention, both of these large unions determined to spend a large sum of money, for an organizing campaign in the new unorganized places, that have developed in the last few years. The Joint Board of the Chicago Amalgamated has now organized the non-union workers of Rock Island, Aurora, Hammond, and other small towns, where the manufacturers opened shops and are sending work, formerly done in Chicago, to shops employing non-union workers. These <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0754.jpg" n="3"/>workers are under the protection of the Chamber of Commerce and the Employers Associations, which are united to protect the open shop movement. The Joint Board of the Chicago Cloak Makers Union are doing likewise.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, much of the work is being done on the top floors of large tenement houses, and in buildings in the rear of lots where they are concealed by houses or store structures in the front part of the lot. Part of the work in these concealed places is done by the contractors who smuggle it into a union contract shop for still another part of the work to be done or finished. The workers must help rid themselves of these hide-out shops if they don't want their trade demoralized and the foundation of their union destroyed.</p>
   <p>Here is another problem which will become very serious if the cloak makers do not look into it. Style is one of the greatest factors in these trades, especially in the Ladies Clothing industry. Now the Mens Clothing manufacturers have taken up the habit of making coats and sport coats for women. The Ladies Cloak and Suit manufacturers are beginning to feel the competition.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0755.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is true that the manufacturers of these coats for women are at the beginning of the period, nevertheless, the competition is being felt very strongly by the market, and for these reasons, so long as there is a demand for these coats, and the manufacturers of Mens Clothing are able to make these coats cheaper and better, then there is no power to stop them. They make these coats with the same system and on the same basis as they do men's clothes. The manufacturers of these coats feel safe in turning them out, because ladies go into mens clothing stores to buy them whereas men do not go into a ladies cloak store to buy men's clothes. In consequence, the ladies clothing cannot make mens clothing to compete with their competition.</p>
   <p>This problem is a very important one for the Cloakmakers to solve. The Cloakmakers Union will no doubt look into this matter and will discuss it with the other union, in order to come to an understanding. The time is coming when there will not be much difference in the process of manufacturing clothes for men or women.</p>
