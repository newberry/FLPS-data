   <p>Thirty-five years ago in a poorly furnished room of a wooden frame structure on Canal Street, Chicago, the now famous pianist, Moissaye Boguslawski, professor at the Chicago Music College, was born.</p>
   <p>His father was a musician who played at Jewish weddings. His earnings could not even supply the family with porridge, because he only received from three to five dollars for his services and there were no weddings every day. Thus, in the two rooms of his parents, poverty was a permanent guest.</p>
   <p>When Moissaye reached four years of age, his mother bought him a piano for five dollars. She had no more money. The room was too small for such a large article, so the table was discarded and the piano served both purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1568.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The four-year-old child soon neglected his food and sleep. The piano became a part of his life.</p>
   <p>Two years later, Moissaye began to take piano lessons, since as his parents were unable to spend more than fifty cents a week, he took but one lesson a week. The family, friends, and neighbors advised the parents not to bother with any piano lessons for Moissaye.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile young Boguslawski did not neglect his school work. He graduated from the Foster School on O'Bryan Street at the age of fifteen.</p>
   <p>A few years later his father took him to weddings and parties where he played the piano. Everybody was astounded at the young lad's talent, but nobody hastened to pay him. His father would have to do some tall talking before the lad would get paid.</p>
   <p>Soon after his Bar Mitzvah (Confirmation), Boguslawski secured a job in a <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1569.jpg" n="3"/>Jewish vaudeville theater patronized by peddlers and junk dealers. He always wanted to play the classics by the great musical composers, but the audience would prefer Oriental and popular selections and his musical soul rebelled. He left the theater and accepted a job in a dance hall, where he was compelled to play so many hours that blood would gush from his fingers.</p>
   <p>During his leisure time he gave lessons--a thing which he would always do for the love of his fellow men rather than the compensation, which went toward his own study. He would often give as many as twelve lessons a day, and the total sum at fifteen cents each did not pay for one of his own lessons.</p>
   <p>At the age of sixteen, Boguslawski decided to play before a famous pianist in order to get the latter's opinion. At that time Ossip Gabrilowitch was giving a recital in Orchestra Hall, and Bugoslawski decided to play for him.</p>
   <p>Accompanied by his devoted mother, he went to see the noted pianist, who, <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1570.jpg" n="4"/>after hearing him, commended his ability. Gabrilowitch said Boguslawski could play but was not a born genius and had not studied enough to create a sensation throughout the world.</p>
   <p>With broken hearts and tears in their eyes, both mother and son went home. For a few days they did not utter a word. They were silent and in meditation. Suddenly Boguslawski cried out: "Mother! I will continue my study until Gabrilowitch will have to admit that I am a good pianist!"</p>
   <p>Boguslawski studied day in and day out; took lessons from great music professors, and after a recital he gave a few years ago in New York, Gabrilowitch entered his dressing room and said, "No price will be too high to have an artist like you as soloist in my Detroit Symphony Orchestra!"</p>
   <p>Boguslawski was offered a director's position in a European conservatory, but he declined, stating that he wished to remain in the country where he was <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1571.jpg" n="5"/>born and devote his talents to the residents of the city in which he was reared.</p>
   <p>Together with Professor Felix Barowsky and Leopold Aver, violin teacher of Misha Elman, Haifetz, and others, Moissaye Boguslawski occupies the post of professor [of music] at the Chicago Music College.</p>
