   <p>Miss Adele Lewing, of this city, is meeting with great success in her concerts at Boston. At her last recital in Mitter Hall, in which she was assisted by Mrs. B. Humphrey-Allen, Miss Lewing presented a dozen of her own compositions. The Boston Journal said: "That Miss Lewing is truly musical is evident from her playing, and it is pleasant to say, still more evident in her work. Not only was there intelligence felt, but one could distinguish entirely in vain. The author sounded real depths of feeling in, at least, three of the songs and as many piano pieces."</p>
   <p>The Liebling amateurs gave a concert last evening at Kimball Hall. The club on this occasion was assisted by Mr. Frederick Hess, violin celloist; Miss Suzanne Ella Wood, soprano; Miss Louise Huggins, accompanist; and Mr. Emil Liebling. An attractive program was presented in a very creditable manner.</p>
