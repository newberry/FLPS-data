<title level="a">THE GREAT SUCCESS OF THE AMALGAMATED BANK</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In the financial world, as well as among the public at large, the great success of the Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank, 371 West Jackson Boulevard, is admired and respected. The bank is regarded as a sacred institution. Banks whose reputations are several generations old and who have vast resources, may truly envy the moral height that the Amalgamated Bank has reached.</p>
   <p>Why is the Amalgamated Bank so highly respected? It is because it is distinguished from other banks both in form and in substance. It is a people's bank, established by the masses, in the interests of the masses. It is a bank that has a soul; a bank whose ethical standards protect the bank's interests more than the written law requires or demands.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated Bank belongs and is controlled by the members of a workers' organization, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union; it is the first and only labor bank in Chicago. Individuals or a group cannot seize control from the <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1316.jpg" n="2"/>majority of stockholders because the shares of the bank are distributed exclusively among thousands of Union members in good standing who have, above everything else, the interests of the bank at heart.</p>
   <p>The officers have had many years of experience, and are honorable men. The highly responsible board of directors, which consists of prominent labor leaders of the Amalgamated Union, manages the business of the bank conscientiously. The treatment [accorded customers] and conditions [in the bank] are democratic and liberal. The system and methods [of banking] are strictly conservative and cautiously regulated.</p>
   <p>The bank is under the supervision of the state government and is a member of the Chicago Clearing House Association, an organization of banks possessing more than a billion dollars in resources, which gives supervision and full protection to its members.</p>
   <p>All in all, the Amalgamated Bank represents the most powerful financial fortress <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1317.jpg" n="3"/>of the masses, and offers its depositors full protection. It is, therefore, small wonder that in the short time of its existence, it has attracted more than six thousand individual depositors from every locality of the city, whose deposits amount to more than one million and a half dollars.</p>
   <p>The officers of the bank are: Samuel Levin, chairman; D. L. Redheper, president; R. S. Davis, cashier; A. D. Mariam Petro, assistant cashier; the directors are: Sidney Hillman, Frank Rosenblum, W. A. Cuneo, A. D. Mariam Petro, Stephen Scola, Peter Sussman, Joseph Schlossberg, J. Karl, and R. D. Redheper.</p>
