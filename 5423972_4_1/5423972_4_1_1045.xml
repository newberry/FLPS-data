   <p>"The fate of women is likened to the fate of the Jewish people. In all countries, both are struggling for their human rights, and both are forced to endure all sorts of stupid and false accusations." I made this assertion fifteen or sixteen years ago, in an article on woman suffrage, which, by the way, was the first article in this city written in Yiddish on that question.</p>
   <p>As long as women were confined to their housework and to the raising of their children they could not adapt themselves to anything else but the kitchen, but as soon as they proved that they were as capable and qualified as men they took to education and science and invaded the domain of men. Now that women overrun the schools, colleges, and universities, a new accusation has been fabricated by the men, namely, that the educated woman <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1046.jpg" n="2"/>is not qualified for home duties and therefore cannot make a good wife and mother. This slur has, in the past few years, assumed a new character, that is, the educated woman does not have the opportunity to marry, and if she does marry, she refuses to become a mother.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Laura Drake Jiel, president of Sevany College For Women, has made a few brief remarks to prove the falseness of these accusations. She maintains that whereas the educated girls marry somewhat later than their non-educated sisters, they nevertheless marry, - numerically speaking, - in the same proportion, have large families, and do better housekeeping than the non-educated women.</p>
   <p>We need not be biased to conceive of this as being true. Even the professional woman who has studied for the purpose of earning a livelihood and thereby be independent, even this woman, takes care of her house and family equally as well as any other woman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1047.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The assumption that educated women do not want to become mothers has definitely no place in the present generation, a generation in which woman has just awakened from her lethargy and is seeking her correct station in life. Not wanting to become a mother is now an epidemic, a transition that will last a long period and then take its normal course. The real enlightened woman knows that it is her duty, above all, to preserve the human race. She also knows that there is no other pleasure in life to substitute for the pleasure a mother derives from embracing her little baby.</p>
   <p>But Mrs. Laura Drake Jiel has said one thing that will be contested by everybody. She made a notable revelation by her assertion that educated women give birth mostly to boys.</p>
   <p>For hundreds of years scientists have been endeavoring to unveil certain sexual mysteries, and the more they search the more convinced they <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1048.jpg" n="4"/>are that it is beyond the reach of man to foretell whether the child to be born will be male or female, and that every spoken or written sentence about this is unfounded.</p>
   <p>But to maintain that educated women, or college women as Mrs. Jiel calls them, have found the secret of giving birth to males instead of females, is being too overwrought by the newspapers today.</p>
