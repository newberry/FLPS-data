   <p>That the revolt against the gang ticket is strong and widespread is shown by the fact that many organizations, non-political in character and which do not feel now that they are taking a part in politics, have declared against it. For instance at a meeting of the United South-North and West Side Hebrew Merchants' Association held Wednesday, it was unanimously agreed upon to send the following address to every merchant in the city: Our association having the welfare of the city at heart has decided to throw party lines aside in the coming municipal election and join the movement in favor of the election of a non-partisan business ticket. The business interests of all of us have suffered from the unbusinesslike administration of the city by party politicians. A great municipality like this cannot prosper if old time politicians are at the head of affairs. We owe it to ourselves and to the whole community to exert all our energy in behalf of the business man who is a candidate for Mayor on the Citizens' ticket. This great city must be redeemed from the hands of the gamblers and toughs who are planning to fatten at the public crib.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
   <p>Louis Frank, Secretary.</p>

   <p>By the head of the Peddlers' Detective Association the following letter has been sent out: To the Peddlers of Chicago! Now is your time to better yourself if you want protection from abuses. I wish especially to call the attention of rag and junk peddlers, who are frequently stoned and maltreated during the peaceful pursuit of their business, that they are not being protected by the police. To vegetable and other peddlers I would say that by helping to elect the entire "non-partisan Allerton ticket" you will protect yourself by having the ordinance in reference to peddlers and peddlers' licenses strictly enforced.</p>
   <p>Knowing that we were imposed upon and compelled to go to an expense to have our ordinance passed by the present administration and knowing that the ordinances have not been enforced, it has worked to our detriment. All residents and those who have families have been obliged to comply with the law, while all renegade non-residents and aliens have escaped without obtaining a license.</p>
   <p>Therefore I urge you to vote the entire "non-partisan Allerton ticket," as I have the promise that all will be equally protected and their Sunday privileges returned.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0051.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Bear this well in mind and I will stick to you and keep good the promise as I have tried to do in the past. Remember the Harrison party is promised to our enemies.</p>
   <p>Most respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Gilbert M. Fitch, President</p>
   <p>Peddlers' Protective Association</p>
