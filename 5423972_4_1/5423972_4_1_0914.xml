   <p>A fight has been going on for sometime to have 10 hour work day for women. This is one of many cause for which the organized workers have been fighting with their employers for sometime past. This is one of the basic conflicts that is now going on between capital and labor. The workers, on the one side, who furnish all the work possible in order that we may exist, the workers, who furnish all the work possible in order that we may exist, the workers, who are compelled to sell their hands, strength, and health for but a small piece of bread. They who are forced to send their small children to work in factories, their poor weak women to their task of work, they are ones now carry on the fight to better their conditions.</p>
   <p>The fight is for higher wages, shorter working hours, better sanitary factories, and also for better conditions in general to lighten the better conditions in general to lighten the burden of the workers so that they may live happily with these objects in view, the workers are organizing themselves into all kinds of <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0915.jpg" n="2"/>different trade unions, to fight with all their might and right for their interests as workers. Now, on the other side, one finds the employers, the owners of all kinds or different factories, who are becoming richer and more powerful day to day. The employer's existance and success is built from the profits they make from workers, for it is to their interest, that the workers produce more and pay as little as possible. In other words, the employer are resorting to all kinds of schemes to keep the workers down.</p>
   <p>The present fight is the 10 hour work day for women. All details of this fight already has been published in the Daily Jewish Courier, and we here repeat that this demand for a 10 hour work day for women is one of the most justified demands that has ever been made from any manufacturer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0916.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The fight that started here in Chicago has developed into a fight to a finish for a 10 hour work day, which is agitated by the Federation of Labor and the Women's Trade Union League. This fight has been going on for years. The fight was mainly carried on by the Women's League, who constantly put up a stiff fight, single-handedly for a 10 hour work day. This league worked hard, and finally succeeded in organizing all women workers of all different trades into unions. They also carried out plans for forcing the Legislature of Illinois at Springfield to pass the laws for the betterment of the conditions of the laboring public.</p>
   <p>The Legislature passed the necessary laws governing labor and its laws provide a factory inspector, whose duties are to look after the welfare of the workers, and to see that all laws governing labor shall be enforced to the better.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0917.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The most important of all these laws as the enactment of the 10 hour a day law for women workers in factories. A factory inspector was immediately appointed and he has already made two arrests of manufacturers, who did not comply with the new labor laws. It is our opinion that all the workers in the Jewish Ghetto should stand fast to their convictions, by organizing into unions. For by doing so, they will always be ready to fight for their interests. Unions are the only hope for their future good treatment by the manufacturers, for after all the power is in the hands of labor, as the sympathy of the general public is with the workers.</p>
