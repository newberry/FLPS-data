   <p>The problem of compelling citizens to fulfill their duties at the ballot box is an old problem, which usually comes to the fore on the eve of every election campaign. Various plans have been proposed, but up to now none of them has been taken seriously.</p>
   <p>Judge Michael L. McKinley, of the Criminal Court, has come out with a new plan. It is an interesting plan, although it is not to be expected that his proposal will have better luck than all the other plans have had up to now. Judge McKinley has proposed a law that citizens who have not voted in any election over a period of two years, and have had no good reason for not doing so, shall lose their right to vote for another two years. The Judge has also proposed another law, if this law is considered too severe. This law would automatically reduce the taxes of a citizen who fulfills his duties as a citizen at <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0099.jpg" n="2"/>the ballot box.</p>
   <p>We do not think a law severe which denies the right to vote for two years to people who, over a period of two years, have not taken the trouble to enter a polling place for a minute or two and vote. The second proposal may be more effective in reminding neglectful citizens of their duty. It may be, however, more advisable to reverse the law: to increase the taxes of those who are too lazy to vote, instead of decreasing the taxes of those who vote. Instead of rewarding those who do their duty as citizens, it may be better to punish those who show so little interest in their citizenship.</p>
