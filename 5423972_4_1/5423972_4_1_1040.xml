   <p>Woman's talent, ability, and equality to man are recognized theoretically, but in spite of it, when it comes to the application of this theory to practice, a male doctor or obstetrician is preferred to a female doctor or midwife.</p>
   <p>More so than men, women themselves are against engaging a woman physician. They themselves thus lower their own status and make themselves small. This, however, is the result of the idea that woman is intellectually inferior to man. If we women stop thinking of ourselves as equal and lose confidence in our own ability, how can we expect others to do so?</p>
   <p>How can we demand equal rights when we underestimate ourselves, when we do not trust a woman with the care of another woman lying in?</p>
   <p>This is excusable among the Russian muzhiks, who due to superstitions, instead of engaging the services of a graduate physician resort to all sorts of obscure healing tricks.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1041.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is high time for us women to realize that skill in medicine is not heaven-made. If a young man of 22 or 23 can complete a course in medicine, - and in most cases they are men of average calibre, - why could not a woman do the same?</p>
   <p>The degree given to a man does not differ from the one given to a woman. The professors of a medical faculty are impartial; they do not discriminate against woman. It is not only in electoral matters that we women should show our equality to men; self-confidence and faith in our potentialities in the fields of science are just as important. If women are entrusted to teach our children, why not trust them to deliver the children at birth and attend them when they are sick?</p>
   <p>It is only then, when we shall have confidence in ourselves, that men will also have confidence in us; then alone shall we obtain equality and be worthy of the endowed privileges.</p>
