<title level="a">ELECTION TODAY FOR JUDGES IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Today is election day. The polls are open from six o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon. All citizens are urged to vote. Six judges of the Superior Court and four judges of the Municipal Court are to be elected. The citizens also have to express their opinion about the proposed bond issues to finish building some bridges and for more and better lighting, as well as on the question of the annexation of Main Township to Chicago.</p>
   <p>You will receive three ballots. One ballot is for the Superior Court judges. The Courier recommends voting for the six candidates for the Superior Court who are indorsed by the Republican and Democratic organizations. The names of five of them appear in the Democratic column, and they are: Charles A. McDonnel, Democrat; John J. Sullivan, Democrat; Joseph Sabath, Democrat; Martin M. Greedley, Democrat; William E. Dever, Democrat, and William P. Stephen, Republican. The only name which appears in the Republican column <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0107.jpg" n="2"/>is that of Alderman Stephen.</p>
   <p>Ignore the party circle and draw an X in front of every name. Men and women, if they are properly registered, will be able to vote.</p>
   <p>The second ballot is for judges to the Municipal Court. The Courier endorses the following: Emanuel Eller, who is running as a Republican; Peter H. Schwab, a Democrat, and John Phillip and Newton Gilmor, Independent Republicans.</p>
   <p>The third ballot is for the bond issues and the Main Township annexation. Vote "Yes" on all propositions.</p>
   <p>Citizens, men and women alike, can vote for the Municipal Court judges and for the proposals.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0108.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Go to vote early and be sure that you vote for Judge Sabath to the Superior Court and Emmanuel Eller to the Municipal Court.</p>
