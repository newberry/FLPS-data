   <p>Chicago Rabbis appeal to the Jewish people to pray for the hundreds of thousands of Jews in the war ridden countries who have not yet perished by the sword.</p>
   <p>In every Jewish synagogue memorial services will be held the last day of Passover in memory of the dead fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers, and also for those Jews who were murdered, slaughtered, burned or strangled to death.</p>
   <p>Jews are soft hearted; they will shed tears, grunt, and sign over the death of their relatives and all dead Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0647.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But what about the living? At present, in the war ridden countries, like Lithuania. Poland, Galicia and Hungary, to each one dead, there are ten living who would rather be dead than alive, - Jewish daughters who were brought up in luxury, and are now searching for bread crusts in garbage cans and cannot find it; wealthy men who have fed and clothed thousands of poor, are now going around half starved, almost naked, and barefoot. Jewish daughters sell their pride for a piece of bread to feed their younger brothers and sisters; their fathers, dead or captured in the army, their mothers sick and starved, lying in the street, and the children playthings in the hands of the soldiers, - that is the present situation of thousands of Jews in the war ridden countries.</p>
   <p>What do we, the Jews of America do? We, who are fortunate enough to be here in a blessed country where we can not only feed our families, but also supply them with more or less luxuries? Will we satisfy ourselves <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0648.jpg" n="3"/>with just offering prayers for the dead? Will our hearts turn into stone and not sympathize with our unfortunate sisters and brothers in the war ridden countries?</p>
   <p>Jews of Chicago! - come to the synagogue the last day of Passover - pray for the hundreds of thousands of Jewish boys left living. When you pray for the dead with a tear, pray for the living with a contribution. When the Jewish sacredness, the scroll of Jewish law, is surrounded by us Jews, in America, who have everything we desire, do not forget the Jews who gather around the Jewish scroll in the war ridden countries, who lack everything. Contribute for those who see the enemies invade our synagogues, destroy our sacred literature, and who do not even possess the strength to defend that, which is dearer to them than their own lives, their wives and children, and the virtue of their daughters.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0649.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Jews have nowhere to look for sympathy, except to God, and to their brothers and sisters in America; and we believe that God helped us, so we may help them.</p>
   <p>Therefore brothers, help! - with whatever you can. In the name of God and in the name of the Jewish people, we ask you again, help, and help, and help. Give your contribution when you pray for the unfortunate brothers in the war ridden countries.</p>
