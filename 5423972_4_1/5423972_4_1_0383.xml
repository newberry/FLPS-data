   <p>Rabbis of Jewish Synagogues in the Nineth and Nineteenth wards are coming to the aid of the election board, in its efforts to unearth the wholesale frauds committed at the primaries August 8. Their appeals to members of their congregations to answer fully and truthfully the queries of the investigators now in the district, are expected to overcome the terrorism to which Jews of the district have been subjected. During the first days of the investigators' work in the ward, it was found impossible to get admissions from many Jews, who feared the retaliation of the political bosses of the wards.</p>
   <p>Orthodox Jews, who were known not to have approached the polls, although their names had been voted, refused to sign affidavits to that effect, or to make statements that would aid the investigators. The Daily Jewish Courier also has taken up the battle for the exposure of the frauds, and has urged the subscribers to do their part in punishing those guilty of them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0384.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Affidavits now have been procured from many residents of the wards whose names were voted. The names of men who had approached them prior to the primaries, and ascertained that they did not intend to vote, also are in possession of Attorney F. D. Ayers of the election board.</p>
   <p>The investigation of the two wards promises to be an extended one, that will necessitate the attendance of seven-eights of the primary day officials, and many of the political leaders of the wards in the County Court.</p>
   <p>It is known that the judges and clerks of election were familiar with the identity of scores of men whose names were voted. The other flagrant violations of the primary law, which have been collected by officials of the Taft and Deneen ward clubs, also will be gone into by the election board attorney.</p>
