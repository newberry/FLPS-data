   <p>There are many people who must be supported. Sickness, or other misfortunes, causes the breadwinners incapable of providing for their families, but some families would rather starve to death than allow themselves to be placed among the ranks of the charity beneficiaries. Anyone who is acquainted with these conditions can point out several families whose children go to school hungry, because there is no bread in the house; the father who is slightly ill, is neglected and is expected to remain sick for the rest of his life, because there is no way to cure himself; the house is improperly heated and the children are exposed to scarlet fever and diptheria. But they would rather suffer than extend their hands for relief.</p>
   <p>The neighborhood vereins are the true saviors to these families. They can help in such a manner that the down-trodden, themselves, do not know that they are being assisted on account of compassion. To lend a few dollars to a neighbor is not considered a donation. To permit a neighbor's child to play in a home where it is warm and offering a meal to the child is certainly respectable as is also extension of medical aid to the sick in an informal way, etc. Such work by the neighborhood women vereins cannot be over-estimated. But the help that these noble women dish out is very limited - temporary. Most of them are mothers of families, whose husbands barely make a living. And they, themselves, are exposed to identical conditions should any accident occur to their bread-winners.</p>

   <p>To assist these neighborhood societies in rendering more help than their limited methods can provide, is one of the objects which the Federated Jewish Orthodox Charities has in view. With the unlimited sums of money of which the Federation will soon be in command, the neighborhood societies can be transacted into modern saviors, whose doors will be open to the unfortunate and needy.</p>
   <p>But before the Federation can do this, they must know who and where these neighborhood societies are. They must become acquainted with these noble, active women in order to contact them whenever necessary, and therefore it is the duty of every woman, who is active in any charitable affair, to respond immediately to the call of the Federation, whose workers seek to become acquainted with all good women in order to organize them so that the work which they render shall not be temporary.</p>
   <p>Every women, regardless how small her activity in the field of charity is, must respond to the call of the Federation. She must submit her address and the addresses of the women who assist her. If possible every neighborhood society should call a meeting, elect a representative who shall speak in behalf of the society, notify the office of the Federation and then attend the Federation's meetings which will be held for this purpose.</p>
