   <p>For the last ten years a vigorous movement has been going on to abolish child labor. At its inception, this movement had chiefly concerned itself with investigating the matter. In due time, however, when it became known the extent to which child labor prevails in this country, means were sought in order to abolish it.</p>
   <p>The greatest step taken by this movement was the introduction in Congress of a bill prohibiting the interstate sales of merchandise made by children under fourteen years of age.</p>
   <p>In order that this bill be passed an extensive agitational campaign has been carried on among the people of various sections of this country, urging them to send petitions to Congress imploring that this bill be recognized by all congressmen.</p>
   <p>Upon considering this matter rationally, it seems as though we ought not to <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0862.jpg" n="2"/>agitate for the adoption of such a bill, since everyone knows that small children should, and must, not labor because it undermines their health and arrests their development. We are aware of the conditions that prevail in the factories throughout the country, and if conditions in factories are almost intolerable for adults, how would they affect minors?</p>
   <p>More than anything else, labor corrupts the mental condition of the child. It is like a poison seeping into the young soul and demolishing childhood. Besides, by depriving children of school and forcing them to go to work, they lose the opportunity to attend school and develop their minds. Instead of letting them attend school, they are brought into the atmosphere of dark factory walls, where their youth withers as a flower in autumn.</p>
   <p>Everyone should realize the danger of child labor, yet there are 1,752,118 children in this country, between the ages of 10 and 16, who work in various industries.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0863.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This shows that child labor is nation-wide and that notwithstanding the fervent agitation carried on for the past ten years to abolish it, we still have nearly 2,000,000 minors working. We must take into consideration that these figures exclude farming, in which activity a vast number of children are employed, especially in the cotton fields, where five-and six-year-old children can be seen working from early morning until late at night.</p>
   <p>And these children are the future citizens; they are the generation in whose hands will lie that fate of this land.</p>
   <p>It certainly cannot be expected that anyone from whom we rob his youth can develop into a normal being, possessing all the qualifications a man should have. Hence, child labor becomes a burning question. Apart from committing a moral crime by robbing children of their youth, child labor imperils the economic and political future of this country. Today a worker loses his vitality in his twenties on account of starting work too early in life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0864.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>And in order to be a citizen, one must have, above everything, will and pride. How can we expect good citizenship from anyone who has not been trained for it?</p>
   <p>Due to this alone, it is of the utmost importance that child labor be abolished so that society may develop better in political and economic aspects.</p>
   <p>There is, however, a cause and as long as it remains untouched, child labor will not be abolished. England reached the greatest peak of ruination through child labor.</p>
   <p>First of all, we must understand that child labor is the result of want and hunger. No parent will send his child to work for the mere sake of working. Wherever parents send children to work, life is unbearable.</p>
   <p>And if a law should be passed prohibiting such children from earning an <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0865.jpg" n="5"/>honest livelihood, we then face a greater danger. These children will be forced, through dire need, to seek a livelihood in a criminal manner, and juvenile courts will be overcrowded with minors from the poor districts, where poverty is indescribable.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, there are always people desirous of child labor because child labor is cheap, and these people will find a way to evade the law.</p>
   <p>Therefore, some provision should be made in this bill to alleviate the plight of the parents who are forced, against their own will, to send their children to work.</p>
