   <p>Funeral service for Dr. Joseph M. Hirsh, noted chemist, were conducted Friday, February 14, at Rosehill Cemetery Chapel. Dr. Hirsh was eighty-seven years old.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsh was graduated from Prague University in Austria and from the university at Munich. Upon coming to America, he taught chemistry, at the Cooper Union Institute, New York. At the time of the Civil War, he discovered the process of producing sugar and syrup from corn for which he was awarded the medal of the American Institute at the 1876 Centennial at Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>Upon coming to Chicago in the late sixties, Dr. Hirsh entered Stein, Hirsh and Company, a starch and dextrine firm, and later manufactured albumin from blood.</p>

   <p>Among other discoveries attributed to him was that of a fluid, which applied to documents scorched in the Chicago fire, made writings legible in white. He was credited with the discovery that bicarbonate of soda could be used as an antidote for poisoning bichloride of mercury. According to his son, Henry, of 5532 Everett Avenue, Dr. Hirsch interested himself in his laboratory experiments almost until his death.</p>
