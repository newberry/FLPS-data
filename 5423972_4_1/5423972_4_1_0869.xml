   <p>It is pitiful and heart-breaking to be unemployed and hungry. It is unpleasant to witness how women and children are exposed to hunger and cold. But to become comedians and appear on the stage is absurd from all points of view.</p>
   <p>Unemployment is found not only among Jews, but also among all nationalities. It affects the entire population of this city. Do you ever hear of such complaining among any part of the population other than by a few hundred unemployed Jewish workers? Has anyone even given a thought to the absurdity of demonstrating in the downtown section, thereby exposing himself to derision and mockery? No one has acted in this way, except our unemployed Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>Unemployment is a plague of the present social order. As long as such a social <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0870.jpg" n="2"/>system exists, as long as classes dominate, there will be unemployment; hence complaints and demonstrations definitely cannot help create work for the unemployed.</p>
   <p>The only thing that remains to be done is to alleviate the sufferings of the unemployed. At present there are no radical methods. Neither the city, state, nor federal government can solve this social question unless they change the present system of production.</p>
   <p>If complaining does not help, why resort to it? To demand by force that Jewish philanthropists help more than they are, is utterly ridiculous. You can't dig into their pockets or transplant a new and sympathetic heart into their bodies.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0871.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is understood that those who are to provide for the unemployed have been doing everything within their means, but they can do nothing if the public does not respond warmly. It is, perhaps, a crime, but you can do no more than either gnash your teeth or execrate those who have brought on such a condition.</p>
   <p>In accordance with a resolution passed at its last meeting, the United Hebrew Trades has declined to do anything for the unemployed. We would probably have nothing to say about this decision as the United Hebrew Trades did not do anything, anyhow. It gathered no funds, and it did not permit men to aid the committee, which did do something (except Mr. Shapiro, the secretary). However, in spite of everything, we think it is a crime on the part of the United Hebrew Trades to have erased this question from the agenda. It is true that it can <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0872.jpg" n="4"/>do very little at present, but it could have done something for the future. The United Hebrew Trades should have brought this up before the unions which were represented there, supplementing it as a trade union question.</p>
   <p>Since a union protects the interests of the workers, why should it not protect them during unemployment? Unemployment affects workers just as much as a strike does. Therefore, unions should have a crisis fund just as they have a strike fund, Naturally, this would involve higher dues, but if the workers knew that this would make it easier for them in times of unemployment, they would gladly pay such contributions. If the unions would do this, a great deal of humiliation endured by union men, who must demand assistance from others could be done away with. It is a burning question. May the unions consider this matter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0873.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Sam Cohen, temporary secretary of the Independent Painter and Paper Hangers' Union, submitted the following news about their union:</p>
   <p>With the beginning of the season the Independent Union is becoming active in its organizational work. For a long time it has held this as its task. This can be seen by many facts. First, they have sent Mr. Shapiro to New York to see if it is possible to join the International. Secondly, a resolution was passed to distribute 50,000 circulars appealing to the public not to hire any paper hanger or painter who does not have a union card.</p>
   <p>Also these important questions were transacted at the last meeting, namely; the raising of wages by next season, the hiring of a permanent business agent and organizer, and the increasing of the admission fee from one to three dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0874.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>These points were decided in order to enable them to continue with the work of agitation.</p>
   <p>To what extent the organization has grown can be seen by the fact that the hall was not large enough to accommodate the members who attended the meeting. Therefore, it was resolved, that due to its rapid growth, the organization be divided into locals. A beginning was already made by the establishment of Local No. 1, Independent Paper Hangers' Union.</p>
