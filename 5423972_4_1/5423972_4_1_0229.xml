   <p>The whole coalition ticket for Superior Court judges was elected yesterday. The five Democratic judges were re-elected without any difficulty. The Republican candidate, Walter P. Stephen, ran about six thousand votes behind the Democrats, all of whom will now serve their second term.</p>
   <p>Alderman Stephen defeated Harry B. Miller by a plurality of 45,000. Miller was supported by the Thompson machine. The votes which Miller received were written in the ballot because his name did not appear on it. 43,547 votes were written in for him.</p>
   <p>Judge Joseph Sabath received 94,854 votes, the highest number of votes received by a Superior Court judge. Judge McDonald was next with 90,773 votes, followed by Dever, Sullivan, and Gridley who received 8,852 votes. All these votes were given in 2,150 precincts. There are 2,222 precincts in the entire county.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0230.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Peter Schwaba, Emmanuel Eller, Thomas Piden, and Galana were elected to the Municipal Court. Emmanuel Eller is the son of Morris Eller, Sanitary District Trustee.</p>
   <p>All the winning candidates were endorsed by the Courier. They received a tremendous number of votes in the Jewish wards.</p>
   <p>All the bond issues were approved. The people voted for them. The people also voted for the annexing of Main Township to Chicago. The Courier agitated in favor of these propositions.</p>
