   <p>Alderman Emanuel M. Abrahams, of the Twentieth Ward, was suddenly striken after he had concluded a speech before council judiciary committee, Tuesday in favor of an amendment of the ordinance which forbade peddlers to carry their wares in the streets. He was taken to the University Hospital, where he died.</p>
   <p>He had been active in politics for about twelve years, and had served two terms in the state legislature. He was the leader of the Hearst- Harrison faction of the Democratic party in his ward.</p>
   <p>When investigation of the Maxwell Street market was started about a month ago, Alderman Abrahams was criticized by the press, but those who were associated with him asserted that his activities were for the best interests of the peddlers.</p>
   <p>Alderman Abrahams was born in Chicago on July 7, 1866.</p>
