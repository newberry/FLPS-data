   <p>Roual Berger will make his Metropolitan debut at Orchestra Hall on February 16. Although born in Russia, Berger was reared in Chicago's Ghetto and sold newspapers to earn enough money to pay for his first violin lessons.</p>
   <p>At the age of 24, he is the head of the Violin Department of the University Conservatory of Music in Austin, Texas. He reached his goal despite his father's insistence that he become a civil engineer.</p>
   <p>Berger has been playing throughout the southwest in concerts and has been the recipient of much praise from music critics of every city in which he has appeared. His early training in Chicago was at the Jewish People's Institute, Crane Technical High School and the Columbia School of Music.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berger's accompanist will be Adolph Ruzicha, head of the Piano Department at the Austin Conservatory of Music. Mr. Ruzicha is also a Chicago product and a graduate of the Master Class at the Bush Conservatory.</p>
