   <p>The secretary of the Tenants' League, Mr. A. Walsh, held out a ray of hope for the unhappy Chicago tenants who find themselves between the devil and the deep blue sea at the present time. They cannot pay the high rent that their landlords demand and they have no place to move. The secretary of the Tenants' League declared that the landlords will soon be compelled to lower the rents because a great many tenants have taken a strong stand and are determined not to sign any new leases.</p>
   <p>This is good news and we wish it were true. Unfortunately, we cannot depend upon it. Anyway, it is very unlikely that any benefits will be derived by the great mass of tenants of the poorer classes, who are the chief sufferers from high rents, at the time when the incomes of the workingman and the small businessman have been considerably reduced.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0759.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even if rents were soon to become cheaper (in many cases rents have already been reduced), the reduction will affect only the apartments of the rich people, who can afford to pay a monthly rent of a hundred and fifty dollars or more. Even now there is no shortage of such apartments. The rents for many such apartments have already been reduced for the simple reason that the number of people who can afford to pay such high rents is very limited. It is very likely that the rents for such apartments will soon be further reduced, and the rich class of tenants, to whom an increase or a decrease of twenty-five dollars a month in rent does not mean much, will benefit thereby.</p>
   <p>But what good will this do the poor tenants, to whom the rent problem is the most difficult problem, and to whom the monthly rent is a heavy burden upon their limited budget? We are sorry to say that it will do no good at all. The shortage of dwellings within the reach of the pocketbook of the worker, small businessman, or clerk is just as big as ever at the present time because the new buildings that are being built in Chicago are designed for the rich class only. As long as this shortage of dwellings exists and as long as the "right" of the landlords <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0760.jpg" n="3"/>to skin their helpless tenants is unrestricted by law, there is small prospect of cheaper rents for the cheaper kind of apartments.</p>
   <p>The claim made by the Tenants' League that rents are going to be cheaper can do more harm than good to the great mass of suffering tenants. It will mislead them by false hopes and will divert their attention from the agitation for effective means to make an end to the robber appetite of Chicago landlords.</p>
   <p>The only effective methods of fighting high rents are: a strict law against high rents and a plan for the co-operative or municipal building of a great number of modern dwellings that could be rented out at moderate prices. The latter remedy is the most important and, if it could be realized, it would destroy the appetites of the extortionist landlords.</p>
   <p>A very fine example of municipal dwellings for the poorer classes is given us by the city of London, England. For many years they have had whole blocks of comfortable tenement houses that were built by the city government (London County</p>

   <p>hundred million dollars in building model tenement houses, in which the apartment shall be rented out at a price not exceeding nine dollars a month per room. This means that a comfortable apartment of four rooms will cost no more than thirty six dollars a month for rent, while an apartment like that in Chicago rents for from sixty to seventy-five dollars a month.</p>
   <p>The Insurance Company, which is a business corporation, will not lose anything by that undertaking but will receive a moderate and sure dividend. A large corporation can be satisfied with a five or six per cent return on its invested capital while a private landlord is not satisfied even with a ten or fifteen per cent return on his investment.</p>
   <p>That which New York has done, Chicago can certainly do. Chicago will do it when large numbers of Chicago tenants will conscientiously fight to free themselves from the chains of conscienceless landlords and will not delude themselves with false hopes that the rent crisis will be solved by itself, without any effort on their part.</p>
