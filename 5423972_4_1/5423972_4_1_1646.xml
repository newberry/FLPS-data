   <p>GOLUB, AS A COMPOSER AND INTERPRETER OF JEWISH MUSIC. By Morris Rosenfeld, editor of the musical division of the Chicago Daily News. (Golub is of Chicago).</p>
   <p>Many musicians are of the opinion that Jewish music does not exist and that there are no Jewish composers. This is a false assertion, because both exist, without speaking here of Mendelsohn, Meyerbeer, Goldmark, and Molar, who have created amazing masterpieces. They have, intentionally, or unconsciously, created masterpieces, in which no racial characteristics are reflected. They sought to hide and escape their national sentiment. (They consumed no Jewish titles and these titles were elaborated according to the style of other great composers.)</p>
   <p>A renaissance was noticeable in the last few years, a glorious awakening of the young, intelligent Jewry. These young people have found out that there are worthy incentives for poetical and musical importance. A small but enlightened society has shown for the past decade an inclination to create a poetic, plastic and musical art, which not only surprised the Jews, but <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1647.jpg" n="2"/>also should leave a deep impression upon the cultural world.</p>
   <p>Mr. Solomon Golub, to whom I am so indebted for revealing to me this magnificent field, showed me how much is to be learned about the modern Jewish music. He told me that a movement was begun ten years ago in Petrograd by a group of Jewish musicians. This group strived to assemble a treasury of Jewish folk-songs and old Jewish melodies, which have, through certain tradition, with-held their original beauty. Great effort was made to develop and cultivate these species of Jewish music and to create a national literature from it.</p>
   <p>You will clearly note in the music of Solomon Golub a national and racial foundation, which greatly reflects our race and our nation, as great and as clear as Grieg's music reflected Scandinavia, as Tchaikowsky's music reflected Russia. Of the one-hundred-sixty songs that Mr. Golub has until now written, (not speaking of his Hebraic songs and operas) are three which expose the individual ability of this young composer: "Lamentation," and "The Wine Cup" are the most typical and they reflect Mr. Golub's musical <pb facs="5423972_4_1_1648.jpg" n="3"/>talent and his great imagination. The composition "Tanchum" by Golub, evinces not only a poetical imagination but also a strong dramatic instinct. This song creates a dramatic background on which legend is based. "Lamentation" is a more sincere masterpiece. The words are by Abraham Raisen and the music by Mr. Golub. It pictures how the Prophet Jeremiah laments the destruction of Jerusalem. "The Wine Cup" was originally written in Russian by Prug. Peretz translated it and Golub composed the music to it. We can note here that the composition was suitable to the dramatic contents of the text. Every phrase has its suitable musical expression.</p>
   <p>Mr. Golub's songs are so comprehensive, so impressive that a different atmosphere is created in each song. The beautiful tenor that Mr. Golub possesses, his clear diction, and aristocratic phrases, not only furnish much pleasure to listeners but also express an intellectual interest.</p>
