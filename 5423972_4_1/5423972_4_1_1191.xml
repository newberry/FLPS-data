   <p>Jacob C. LeBosky died this week. Mr. LeBosky was born in Chicago in 1879, and had practiced law for seventeen years. Following his admission to the bar, he joined the firm of Altgeld, Darrow and Thompson. In 1914 he severed his connection and organized the firm of Le Bosky and Levine.</p>
   <p>In 1913 he was appointed State Fire Marshall. He resigned from this office after a few months to become an attorney for the West Chicago Park Commissioners.</p>
   <p>In the hearings before the War Labor Board in Washington last summer, Mr. LeBosky won for Chicago Traction employees, whom he represented, the largest increase in wages they had ever received.</p>
   <p>The deceased was a member of the Press and Covenant Clubs, the Lawyers' Association, and the Illinois State and American Bar Associations. He was also a Mason.</p>
