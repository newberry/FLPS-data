   <p>During every election time the old and already tedious question is discussed, "Is there a Jewish vote?" This question can have two meanings. First, it can mean that the American Jews have political interests which do not concern America whatever, like many German-Americans; second, it can mean that the Jews in this country have special Jewish interests, which can cause them to vote for this or that party. Regardless of the significance of the question, "Is there a Jewish vote?" it must be answered with an emphatic "No!" There is no special Jewish vote, because there is no Jewish sovereign state in which the American Jews could be interested, and even if there should be a sovereign Jewish state, there still won't be a Jewish vote in America, because a Jewish state can never be in contradiction with the interests of America, or cause the American Jews, who are tied with a thousand threads to this country, to combine pure Jewish with pure American interests. The Jews in this country <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0119.jpg" n="2"/>vote, not as a group of a certain race or religion, but as American citizens with American interests exclusively. A Jew may be a Republican, a Democrat, or a Socialist, and yet be a hundred per cent American.</p>
   <p>From a pure Jewish standpoint, a Jewish leader or publicist has no right to urge the Jews, as Jews, to vote for a Republican or Democrat.</p>
   <p>What the American Jews, as a group, have a right to say, is: "This political personality is fine and idealistic, progressive and liberal and therefore, we, a liberty-loving race with ancient liberal and progressive ideas, desire to vote for this personality, who is not less patriotic than the other opposing personality, but who is more liberty loving and more efficacious for the progress of America and for the progress of the world."</p>
   <p>This is not a Jewish vote, but a liberal vote, because not as Jews, but as progressives, the American Jews are casting their votes for this personality. At the helm of this mighty Republic stands a man, who proves through his <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0120.jpg" n="3"/>entire dealings that he is a Messianic figure. Since the existence of the world, no sovereign of such a powerful country as America has ever spoken such Messianic words, or tried to realize the ideals of our prophets of truth and justice, as President Wilson. His various speeches, since America's entry into the War, are true Messianic tidings--the tidings of justice throughout the world, of equality for all nations, and of a lasting just peace.</p>
   <p>President Wilson is near to us Jews, not because he belongs to this or that party, but because he is close to the ideals of ancient Judaism, to the ideals of the Prophets, for he himself is a prophet to the nations, informing humanity of a glorious future, of a just peace and national prosperity. If Woodrow Wilson was not now the president of this mighty Republic, we would have honored him as we have always honored the great benevolent sages of the world; but as he is now the President of the United States, and is in a position to realize his high ideals, we would be disloyal to our own great ideals of peace and justice, if we don't give him the opportunity to realize <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0121.jpg" n="4"/>his ideals by not responding to his appeal of sending men to congress who will support his policies.</p>
   <p>But the truth is also that President Wilson is the representative of the Americanism of the twentieth century, and not Senator Lodge or the other reactionary politicians. Therefore, when Jews vote for the group that is controlled by President Wilson, they vote for a progressive liberal Americanism. In the conclusion it appears that, while President Wilson is so close to the ideals of our ancient Prophets, he is also close to us as an American, and vice versa.</p>
   <p>The Jews, who will cast their votes for the group which President Wilson controls will thereby help in the realization of high world ideals of which our fathers dreamed and will, no less, aid a progressive American policy. Voting for Wilson's group, they are not voting for a political party machine, but for an idealistic political program and for an idealistic statesmanship personality that is friendly toward us Jews and willing to help us, because <pb facs="5423972_4_1_0122.jpg" n="5"/>this personality possesses world ideals.</p>
   <p>For us Wilson is the zenith of American idealism and, therefore, we Jews will vote for his group, which will support him in the realization of his ideals.</p>
