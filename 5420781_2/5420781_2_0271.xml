   <p>A reporter of the Chicago Daily News writes from Amsterdam, that the decision of the Department of Commerce at Washington to send a representative to the Dutch East Indies, fills the Netherlanders with hope of a return of American commerce. For a year past, the United States was not officially represented in the Dutch East Indies, commercially. There was fear, according to the correspondent, that on account of the strong influence of Germany in the Indian trade world, that the United States would turn cold shoulder to the Dutch East Indies. An official in the administration of the colonies told the correspondent that information concerning conditions in the East Indies was many times exaggerated and that the truth is not as told, but the opposite, that the Netherlands government is awake to the danger of German domination of the East Indian trade.</p>

   <p>This official also mentioned that confidence in the credit of the Dutch East Indies is growing stronger abroad. As proof of this fact, in the United States, there was subscribed $25,000,000 recently for Dutch East Indies obligations; in connection with this news, it was mentioned that organizations as the Netherlands Chamber of Commerce and the Netherland America Foundation, both situated in New York, are making all efforts to work together to make the Netherlands and its colonies better known in the United States.</p>
