   <p>Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>To appear before you this evening to offer you the second annual report of our division, affords me much pleasure and I trust, it will be the same to you. If many had expected, that our division would have ceased to exist, that thought, luckily was not confirmed; just the opposite, according to all indications, it has come to stay. Compared to human life, our division has reached the age, in which one learns to walk. But you know, how the child at that time needs the aid of other.... Taken as a whole, the year 1906, for us, can be successful. The board has been able to convene regularly each month, and the minutes can prove to you, that not alone through faithful, attendance, but also through earnest consideration, it has indicated that it has the welfare of our division at heart. Two open, and two ordinary meetings were held in the past year. The first open meeting took place on April 17, in the First Christian Reformed Church 14th Street. The speaker for that evening was Rev. Broekstra of Englewood. He made a beautiful speech on the subject: "lasting relationship with the Dutch race is necessary for those of Dutch descent in this country to be a blessing for the American people".... The second open meeting was held on August 31 (Queens day) in the First Reformed Church on Hastings street. The President, then, gave us an <pb facs="5420781_2_0127.jpg" n="2"/>historic resume of the house of Orange, and sketched for us the meaning of that day for the Dutch people and for us. The main speaker, Rev. Breen, after that, spoke on the topic: "The influence of the Republic of the Netherlands on that of the United States of North America," The speaker said, in a way all his own, that, although language and grammar, make it look as though every thing here is inherited from England, this in truth is not the case, which is plainly shown by the following oppositions: in England, rule by the Aristocracy, here equality; in England, church ruled by the state, here division of Church and State; in England a difference in election, etc. etc. After that he pointed out, what an influence had gone out from the Netherlands, and reminded us of the Union of Utrecht, the stay of the Puritans in the Netherlands, etc, and ended with the assertion; that the union of the different peoples here, is fulfillment of the prophescy of the union of the people on earth.</p>
   <p>On the regular meeting, held on June 12, an interesting debate was delivered by Messrs. De Boer and Dr. Birkhof, the subject: "We must maintain our distinctive nationality here, as long as possible;" and on the regular meeting of October 30, a debate was also held between the Messrs. Holstein and Emmering on the Topic: "A seat of learning for the Dutch language in our universities is necessary, so that we may know our American institutions." Added to this, there were held on the above mentioned meeting some recitations by the Messrs. Ottenhof.

Through the medium of the executive board, we received a gift from Queen Wilhelmina of fifty Florins, which gave momentum to the establishment of a Wilhelmina - Library, for which the first shipment of books can be expected soon. Correspondence with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce at New York was had, with the view of organizing such a Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, but the Board considered it necessary not to go into such an undertaking for the present, on account of the many hardships connected with it. The correspondence with the executive Board has been regularly kept up and was always of a friendly nature. Lately there has also been correspondence with the Book committee. From the West - Indies we received an inquirey about conditions in the United States for the benefit of a very promising and brilliant young man. We also received a letter from Denver - Colorado, for information concerning a certain branch of trade, and from Asia fro information and help for the building of a factory for the manufacture of Cotton - seed oil. A report of the Chamber of Commerce of Smyrna was sent to us, and one from Haarlem of the Colonial Museum, which is located there. From the executive Board we receive monthly, propaganda numbers of Neerlandia. (Official publication of the General Dutch League). They also mailed us 25 pictures of H. M. Wilhelmina, which were gratis and 25 at our request, for the low price of 30 Dutch cents, a piece. Besides every member having received one, the picture also decorates the walls of the Theological School in Grand Rapids, the Theological Seminary at Holland, Mich., and the Christian <pb facs="5420781_2_0130.jpg" n="5"/>and the Christian Schools 104th Street and Englewood. From this you will get an idea of some of the work we seek to accomplish. Our membership, which last year had mounted to 30, is now increased by 8, that would be a membership of 38, but during the past year 4 resigned and 2 were scratched by the Board. Thus the members in good standing actually count 32. The By - laws were amended so that the Board has control over the acceptance of all new members. In 1905 we were exempt from contributing to the general fund, but this year we did not take advantage of that privilege and sent our share to the executive Board. Even then the Treasurer's book closed with a net balance. From the outside we were treated royally. The use of the Churches was gratis and the singing school and men's choir served us gratis. Looking back on the year just passed, we have reasons to be thankful and that gives us courage to face the future hopefully. Naturally we have not yet reached our goal, but in the Division itself, signs of life are beginning to show, and if I am not mistaken, these signs are an assurance for the acquisition perfection.</p>
   <p>H. Jacobsma, Secretary.</p>
