   <p>About two and a half months ago I traveled to Budapest to inspect the work of our Holland-American Society and to see if there was room for improvement...........During my stay in Holland I, gathered wool and needles, but the amount was not nearly sufficient. The box which I took from Holland was not nearly enough, to give each girl wool enough to make one pair of stockings. I asked Capt. Jos. Pedlow, see of the American Red Cross, to permit him to become acquainted with the work of our society and to see if he could help us supply wool and knitting needles. Captain Pedlow testified: Miss Kuiper, your society is doing really splendid work and I will do whatever I can for you. And the well liked Captain Pedlow kept his word and opened for us the horn of plenty. Sixteen boxes containing 1,300 K. G. wool; 2,000 yards flannel; 100 cartons toothpaste; 1,000 comfort bags, which serve as <pb facs="5420781_2_0040.jpg" n="2"/>work bags; 100 cartons of buttons and a large collection of binding.....We came to the conclusion that we had wool enough to knit a sweater and a pair of stockings for each child and enough flannel to make a dress or suit for each child. After that Pedlow made a tour of inspection, and signified his satisfaction saying: "Well, Miss Kuiper, your children and mothers have really done the best they could. Do you know that these dresses are all so well made and show such good taste that in Wall Street, New York, they would be glad to sell them, and they would get a pretty high price for them, too.."</p>
   <p>We want to mention by name those who have worked so hard in the gathering of money for this good cause; Dr. &amp; Mrs. Van Sonkhwsen, Prof. Volbeda, Dr. H. H. Meiter and Mr. J. Buiten.......The following is a testimonial of the good work done by the Holland-American Society for poor children in Hungary:</p>

   <p>Miss Catherine M. E. Kuiper:</p>
   <p>I had the pleasure of visiting a luncheon given by your Holland-American Society for the poor children in Hungary and would like to testify to the splendid work you are doing. I was really surprised at the quality of the meal and when invited to join I think I enjoyed the food quite as much as the children did. It was not only a commonsense meal but also a really appetizing one. I hope you will continue the good work. I will esteem it an honor to assist you in any was you may permit me.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours.</p>
   <p>Jos. G. Pedlow</p>
   <p>Capt., American Red Cross.</p>
