   <p>Both large meetings- picnics, we might say - held by the Dutch people on Monday (Labor Day), were, in every respect, a success.</p>
   <p>The Leagues of the Young Men's Associations, and the Reformed School Associations came to Palos Park in 11 railway-carriages, which held about 1500 people. According to a rough estimation this meeting brought in over $300.00 in net profit.</p>
   <p>The Mission celebration at Riverside Park, organized by the Men's Mission Association of the First Reformed Congregation, was also a success. Considering that it was the first meeting, the number of participants was larger than could have been expected. The proceeds were about eighty dollars, which will be for the good of the Mission.</p>
   <p>Yet, from different sides voices were heard that next year these two meetings should not be held on the same day. To make both a success, they have to take place on different days.</p>
