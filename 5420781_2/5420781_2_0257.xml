  <body>
   <p>How little knowledge some writers have, who set themselves up as authorities on subjects in which they themselves are in the dark, is shown again in the recently published work of Miss Frances Kellor: " Immigration and the Future," in which the author of Experimental Socialogy, Out of Work, Straight America, etc. makes the following ridiculous remarks: " So naive is much of the effort of foreign countries to keep in touch with their nationals, that it is not surprising to find the Dutch Government, through the Netherlands Immigration League, proposing in all good faith to establish bureaus, not only to protect our immigrants after their arrival but to see that they reach their destination without molestation, and that they maintain the good reputation of those already here; but it is also planning to relieve the American somewhat of his Americanization work, by urging its immigrants to stay in America, to learn English and to become citizens; and for this purpose it will make their repatriation more difficult. If America in <pb facs="5420781_2_0258.jpg" n="2"/>in the future is to receive immigrants at no expense to itself, and is to have them protected and Americanized at European expense, it must be that immigrants in America are considered to be a good investment. Unquestionably the requirement of certain standards of protection, with reference to working and living conditions in immigrant countries is to be an important consideration in determining what countries will be favored with immigration. Certain countries are already carrying heavt burdens, not only on account of the physical condition of their returning immigrants, but also because of financial burdens, due to their failure to succeed in new countries, a situation often due to prevailing conditions of employment. The Dutch Government has under consideration a plan for calling a conference of European States to consider this very question. This conference, when held, will doubtless raise the whole question of the desirability of having a system of protection which will take care of the immigrant from the time he leaves his home until he arrives at his final destination in the immigrant country.</p>
   <p>It will doubtless take into consideration, also, what will constitute standards of protection in immigrant countries and the best means for starting and maintaining them alike in all countries.</p>
