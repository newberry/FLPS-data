   <p>The Women's Missionary Union of the Christian Reformed Churches of Chicago and vicinity. On December 8th, 1925, delegates of the Women's Missionary Societies of the Christian Reformed Churches of Chicago and vicinity met to organize a union of women of our Church group and their friends, who were interested in mission work. Great interest and spirit was shown at this meeting. Dr. Henry Beets explained the why and wherefore of such a missionary union, and took as his topic: "Why Our Women Ought To Organize A Missionary Union."</p>
   <p>An organization was soon created, and all looked hopefully towards the first meeting.</p>
   <p>(The above was sent to us by Mrs. Gilmer Kuiper, together with the announcement of the first meeting, on Thursday April 15, - The editor.)</p>
