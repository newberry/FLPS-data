   <p>Again one of our oldest settlers has passed away. Rlaas Rol is no more. Last Saturday morning, February 5, --just two days after his 85th birthday--he died at the home of his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. D. Van Reenen, 6438 May Street, with whom he resided after the death of his wife, who died last summer.</p>
   <p>Rlaas Rol was born at Middelstum, province of Groningen, on Feb. 3, 1825. There he married his now deceased wife, with whom he celebrated his 60th wedding anniversary, a privilege which is not bestowed upon many people.</p>
   <p>In the year 1867 the couple came to America and settled in Chicago, where they lived for about 37 years in the same house at 503 W. 16th Street. They leave one daughter, two children-in-law, and five grand-children.</p>

   <p>Mr. Rol was a thrifty man. He served the first Christian Reformed Church, of which he was one of the founders, as sidesman (sic), and later as elder. As an advocate of parochial tuition, he served the Parochial School as one of its directors. In the last years of his life, especially after the death of his wife, he was weak in body and mind and was longing for death so as to be with Christ.</p>
   <p>The funeral took place Tuesday, with Dr. S.S. Van der Heide officiating. His body rests now near that of his wife at Forest Home cemetery.</p>
