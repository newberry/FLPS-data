   <p>It was a solemn moment when the Reverend E. Breen, beloved pastor of his Congregation, and respected by all who knew him, said farewell to his Congregation on Tuesday night. His sermon was taken from, Peter, 5:10 and 11. An overflowed crowd filled the church building, for a last farewell and a handshake.</p>
   <p>The addresses by representatives of societies, as by the chairman of the meeting, Mr. H. Jacob, were in earnest and well meant. Mr. Joe Boer represented the consistory, spoke also.</p>
   <p>The pastor as a last farewell thanked the audience for their cooperation. Then the congregation under the leadership of the Band, sang the well known hymn, "God Be With You Till We Meet Again, many wiped their tears away.</p>
   <p>The Reverend E. Breen, who will serve the Coldbrook Congregation, at Grand Rapids, has been pastor of the First Christian Reformed Congregation, for 6 years.</p>

   <p>Besides all the work in his own congregation, he was very active in the Jewish Mission's work in Chicago, as in other territories. He was ordained as a minister in 1889, and for 18 months was a home missionary. He served at Firth, Nebraska, and Orange City, Iowa, until 1903, when he came to Chicago.</p>
