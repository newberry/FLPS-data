   <p>The inscription "In God We Trust" on our money pieces, as we observed a couple of weeks ago, does not appear anymore on our new ten-dollar gold pieces. This has lead to quite a discussion in the last few weeks.</p>
   <p>No one else than President Roosevelt himself ordered the omission of these words. Several important people, especially theologians and newspaper men, did not like the change. In their opinion there is too much unbelief in these days, and it would be very good if the people in handling the dollar were reminded that the nation has trust in God.</p>
   <p>The President, however, was of the opinion that these words were not to be printed on the new coins.</p>
   <p>If ever President Roosevelt made a mistake, this is one. A more beautiful motto for the people that the serious vigourous binding, holy words, "In <pb facs="5420781_2_0076.jpg" n="2"/>God We Trust" cannot be found. That motto is a sign that the prosperity we enjoy comes from God.</p>
   <p>Today we are celebrating Thanksgiving Day, a day proclaimed by the President as a national holiday. How Satan would have enjoyed himself had President Roosevelt not only done away with the motto In God We Trust, but had also withdrawn our national Thanksgiving Day.</p>
   <p>The President was wrong in omitting these words from the coinage. Give God the honor that this nation trusts in him. "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's."</p>
