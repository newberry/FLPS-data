   <p>This useful organization of a Dutch character, which meets on the first Tuesday of every month in the Hotel La Salle, had a very interesting meeting there on June 7th, at which Mr. Harvey Bierman was the principal speaker. Mr. Bierman, who is a lawyer and also secretary of the Holland Building and Loan Association, told the members and their wives of some of his experiences during the Spanish American War, illustrating his forceful speech with beautiful lantern slides of that time, which showed the camps, transports, and military equipments, as well as some fine views of Cuba and Porto Rico. The talk had a personal note, but the application made by the speaker was that the United States should always be prepared for any national emergency, and not be caught napping, as it was in the Spanish American War, when the nation desired to liberate Cuba and Porto Rico, but lacked even the most rudimentary elements of modern warfare. The audience concurred with the speaker, who received an enthusiastic applause. Similar talks are given monthly by members of the Society, which now has over a hundred members.</p>

   <p>Some sections of the city are not well represented as yet, however, and the great West Side is but sparsely mentioned on the membership role. I think that the number of members could be doubled or tripled, if only every Holland-American in Chicago, realized this fine opportunity to combine the love of the old country with that of the new. In unity there is strength.</p>
