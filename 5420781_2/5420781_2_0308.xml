   <p>Who was Charles Vander Cook? He was one of our oldest settlers. Mr. Vander Cook was born May 20, 1819, at Pittstown, N. Y., from Dutch stock, and settled in 1833 at Chicago, where he lived continously for 73 years. He was married to Miss Harriet E. Demmon, now his widow.</p>
   <p>He was a member of the voluntary fire department in 1847, and owner of the first stove factory in this city. In 1881, he built the Chicago, Harlem and Batavia Street Railway, which was later sold to the Northern Pacific, who broke it up. Vander Cook is survived, besides his widow, by two sons, Henry R., 4153 Beekly avenue, and John B., 213 South Park avenue, Austin; the same home where the old people resided. Mr. Vander Cook died as the result of an accident. Last Friday he was run down by an Oak Park elevated train at the Park avenue crossing in Austin, and a short time later succumbed in the St. Ann's Hospital, at the age of 87.</p>
