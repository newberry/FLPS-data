   <p>As usual, the meeting of the above mentioned organization, held last Thursday evening in one of the halls of the Hastings Street Church, was scantily attended. But we can say that those who were present, enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>
   <p>The Reverend N. Boyer, gave a beautiful reading about the poet Bilderdijk, and Mr. T. H. Koopmans one about Jan. Pieter Heije especially as a Children's poet, according to the recently celebrated 100 year birthday of the less known, but greatly appreciated poet. Both of the speakers held their audiences spell-bound, and it was evident that it came from the heart, when the meeting sang, with Mr. Allebrandt at the piano, the well known national anthem by Heye: "Vea Beautiful Colors of Netherlands Flag!"</p>

   <p>The question of whether or not it would be possible or advisable, to celebrate the coming Hudson celebration, (September) commemorating the settlement of the Dutch in New York, also in Chicago, was assigned to the administration and Mr. Oosterheert, as the sponsor of the motion was himself made an advisory member. Attempts will be made to interest all Dutch societies in Chicago for this purpose.</p>
