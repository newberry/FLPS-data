   <p>Again one of our oldest settlers has passed away. Rlaas Rol is no more. Last Saturday morning, February 5, just two days after his 85th birthday, he died at the home of his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. D. Van Reenen of 6438 May Street, with whom he lived since the death of his wife, last summer.</p>
   <p>Rlaas Rol was born at Middlestum, in the province of Groningen, February 3rd, 1825. There he married his now deceased wife; they celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary, a privilege which is not bestowed upon many people.</p>
   <p>In the year 1867 the couple came to America and settled in Chicago, where they lived about 37 years in the same house at 503 West 16th Street. He leaves one daughter, and five grand-children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rol was in life a thrifty man, and served the first Christian Reformed <pb facs="5420781_2_0307.jpg" n="2"/>Church, of which he was one of the founders, as sidesman, and later as elder. An advocate of parochial tuition, he served the parochial school as one of the directors. In the last years of his life, especially after the death of his wife, he was, however, weak in body and mind. And he was longing for his death, to be with Christ.</p>
   <p>The funeral took place Tuesday, from the house of mourning, under the guidance of Dr. S. S. Van der Heide. His mortal body was carried and it now rests near that of his wife at the Forest Home Cemetery.</p>
