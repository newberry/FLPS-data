   <p>Monday evening, May 24th will be long remembered by the members of North-western congregation. The Sunday-School administration had called the members and their friends together to witness the jug-breaking which was to take place that evening. We were also glad to see such a large audience gathered in the Church auditorium on that occasion. And because of the fact that the steering committee had provided a good program, fitted to the occasion in which young and old partook, the meeting was a complete success; and to us is a proof of the progress of our congregation. And although we are at present without a pastor, we had the pleasure of having in our midst Mr. Rotschafer of Holland, Michigan, who will shortly travel to the Missionary field of India, who gave us a few glimpses concerning the missionary work in that country.</p>
   <p>The jugs yielded the sum of $42.33. We pray that God may bless the Sunday-School of the North-West Church, so that it may accomplish more and more for the missions.</p>
   <p>N. Fisher.</p>
