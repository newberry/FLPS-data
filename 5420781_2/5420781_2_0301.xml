  <body>
   <p>Last Friday afternoon, Justice Frederick R. De Young, recently chosen as Judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, was the guest of honor of the Knickerbocker Society, together with some others who were invited to attend. As Netherlanders by birth or descent, the Knickerbocker Society deemed it proper, because of the choice of the people, to elevate Judge De Young to one of the highest positions in the state, and to honor him with a luncheon. More than thirty distinguished guests took part in this affair. After an interesting speech by the president, Mr. Gilmer Vuiper, the floor was given to the Netherlands Consul General Hon. John Vennema, who pointed out the high spots in the life of Judge De Young, whom he had learned to know a quarter of a century ago as a young lawyer, and the progress of whom as a public official, he had followed with great interest.</p>

   <p>Prof. John C. Penn made a short speech in which he pointed to the relatively large number of professional men of Dutch name in Chicago headed, as it were, by Judge De Young. He was followed by L. Holstein, who without preparation and in a fascinating way, told the listeners that it is an honor to belong to the citizens of Holland blood. One of the city's aldermen, Wiley W. Mills, of Dutch descent and graduate of Hope College, in a beautiful way praised the guest of honor, after a few words had been spoken by a representative of this paper. Finally, the chair was given to Judge De Young, who heartily spoke his appreciation of all the compliments and for the luncheon. He said, among other things, that he was thankful that his fellow citizens of Dutch race, appreciated that one of them was elevated to the office that he now takes at Springfield. There were a couple of pleasant hours which in the annals of this club, next to those of other pleasure gatherings also held in the City Club, will be held in happy remembrance.</p>
