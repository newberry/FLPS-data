   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Kindly take up in Onze Toekomst the following report of the last held meeting of the Chicago Missions Festivity Committee.</p>
   <p>The meeting was very important. It was determined that the general Missions Festivity would be held again on Labor Day this year.</p>
   <p>For the first time all Reformed Congregations in and about Chicago were represented through joining the Chicago's eldest congregations, Norwood Park and Irving Park, so that now fifteen congregations are working together. The following Board was elected.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_2_0188.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Theo. Koopmans, President; C. Ettema, Vice-President; J. C. Bovenkerk, Jr., Secretary; Theo. Landstra, Treasurer; J. Fischer, Deputy Board-member.</p>
   <p>Our last Missions' Festivity, notwithstanding the rains nearly washing all our profit away, showed a credit balance of $300.00 for the Missions.</p>
   <p>The Committee decided to take an active part in the "World in Chicago" concerning the lodging for those of Reformed religion, who at that time want to visit Chicago..</p>
   <p>New bylaws were carried. The Committee enters its second year with the outlook, that the united Reformed Congregations in and about Chicago will do this Missions work with a will.</p>
   <p>Really, a Committee of thirty sticklers can do something for the Missions. The meetings will be held in Englewood I.</p>
   <p>J. C. Bovenkerk, Jr., Secretary.</p>
  </body>
