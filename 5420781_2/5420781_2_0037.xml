   <p>On May 24th, we ladies were busy with our "Tag Day." Our Holland Home had gathered $2,655.52 on that day, so our efforts were crowned with success. It is not true that the thirty-seven homes divide everything equally; each home gets, what is collected by its group and you can believe that. The part that is evenly divided between the thirty-seven homes, is all the counterfeit money and false checks. Our bill on that day was $5.25. On June 3rd we had our "Tag Party" in the evening. A large crowd was present and some of the ladies told of their experiences on that day some of which were comical. A small program, some games, refreshments and time went fast.</p>
   <p>Before we knew it, the ladies got ready to go home. Many of the ladies came from the far West and Northwest side. All in all, it was an evening full of pleasure. Over 200 ladies were present. A word of thanks to all who helped. In name of the committee: Mrs. P. Roosma, Mrs. M. Otto, Mrs. J. De Young, Mrs. G. Smit.</p>
