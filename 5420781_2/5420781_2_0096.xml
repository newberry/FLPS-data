   <p>The annual general meeting of the General Dutch League, took place last Tuesday evening, in the Church of the First Reformed Congregation on Hastings Street. Even, though at the beginning the meetings were tedious, and the attendance so small, that hardly a quorum was present, when the annual report of the Secretary was heard and it was discovered what was actually accomplished by the Division, that condition underwent a considerable change, and the attitude became more cheerful, even though we were reminded by that report of the death of the former President Dr. D. Birkhoff. To publish that report would require too much space.</p>
   <p>We are happy to say, that the Division now counts with 43 members, which is an increase of 6 members over a year ago. The meeting elected the following officers for the current year: H. Jacobsma, J. Oeboer, L. Holstein, Th. Koopmans, and Reverend N. Boer. The three first mentioned had several full terms and were re-elected, while the last two took the places of the former Dr. Birkhoff, and of Reverend E. Breen, who will leave Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_2_0097.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After the retiring President, Reverend Breen, had thanked the division for the faith in him, Mr. Th. Koopmans also gave to him a word of thanks for the energy and devotion with which he had served the Division.</p>
   <p>To Mr. Oosterheert went openly a word of thanks for the large amount of work, done by him in connection with the petition for a Chair at the Chicago University, for the teaching of the Dutch language, History and Literature, of which he did the lions share.</p>
