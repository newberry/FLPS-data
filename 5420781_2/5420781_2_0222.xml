  <body>
   <p>Last Tuesday, at the ripe old age of ninety-two, Adrian F. Van Hulst, who for a period of thirty years has been connected with the St. Ignatius College at Twelfth and May Streets, passed away. Although Pastor Van Hulst had not been strong recently, his death did not come as a result of sickness, but was due to an accident. He had arisen to light the gas in his room, but the effort had evidently taxed his strength to such an extent that he had to hold on to the gas cock which broke, and then he fell down unconscious. Another priest in an adjoining room detected the odor of gas, opened the door to Van Hulst's room and brought the unconscious old man outside. Although a physician was called immediately, and Father Van Hulst regained consciousness so that extreme unction could be administered to him, he died about an hour later.</p>
   <p>Father Van Hulst was born in the Netherlands, September 17, 1817, and was supposedly the oldest Dutchman in Chicago. At the age of twenty he came to America, and at the age of thirty he was ordained to the priesthood at the <pb facs="5420781_2_0223.jpg" n="2"/>University of St. Louis (sic). He worked for twenty years at the University of St. Louis, first as a professor, and later as director of the Home of the Good Shepherd, a charitable institution to which he dedicated his whole life, and which he continued to serve here in Chicago. He wore the garb of a priest for sixty-two years.</p>
