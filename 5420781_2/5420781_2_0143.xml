   <p>The visitation of Jews, in their homes or places of business is part of our work. In this, all missionaries participate and, on the average, we pay about sixty visits per month. We do this work systematically. For this we have a "card index"system. For each family, whom we visit, we write a card on which is written the name, age, and the nationality of the members, whether they are orthodox, modern, or unbelieving Jews, whether they own a Bible, and in which classes and meetings in our mission, the various members of the family participate. As soon as one of us comes in contact with a new family, a card for that family is written. To get acquainted with a new family we must have a medium. In our city, we find the doors to the homes of those not known to us mostly locked. Now the medium we often find in the children, who visit our classes. We also find our medical work, a very good medium to get more intimate with new families.</p>

   <p>If someone has had help from us, once, then he stands ready as a rule to let us in later, when we knock at his door. We consider this work very useful.</p>
   <p>We not only get to know the peculiar characteristics of the Jews, their habits, religious understanding, and their normal life, but we also get better acquainted with those who attend our mission from time to time.</p>
   <p>This is necessary if we want to acquaint ourselves with their spiritual needs. If we with to speak to a person, according to his ability to understand, then we must know him. In this "house visitation" we often experience much that is discouraging, but sometimes encouraging. Another time we hope to tell something about our experiences.</p>
