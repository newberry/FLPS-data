   <p>Arousing extraordinary interest, the burial service of Herman Teninga took place Thursday afternoon in the Bethany Reformed Church. The auditorium was large enough to hold only a small part of those who attended. The pastor of the congregation, Dr. J. R. Mulder, led in prayer and made a short speech, after which Reverend Dr. E. Kreuzenga of Holland, Michigan, spoke about the deceased. The speaker mentioned among other things the courage which the deceased had displayed at all times. The speaker would not make a long speech, because, as he explained, this would run counter to the simplicity which was Mr. Teninga's in life.</p>
   <p>One of the largest delegations present was that of the Cook County Real Estate Board, of which Mr. Teninga was president. The church was full of floral pieces, and many others were brought to the hospital, located across from the church. Fred Wood sang two beautiful tenor solos.</p>

   <p>Many preachers of the Christian Reformed church, as well as of the Reformed church, besides scores of prominent business people from all parts of the city, were among those present. The Dutch consul general, the Honorable J. Vennema, was also present to pay a final tribute to the deceased. A large crowd went to the burial place at Mount Greenwood Cemetery, where the interment took place.</p>
