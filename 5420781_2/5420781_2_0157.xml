   <p>We, the undersigned, have for a long time pondered over the question of a desirable burial place for the Netherlanders who live on the West Side, as well as for those who live in the western and southwestern suburban districts. After investigation we declare in unison, that the most ideal burial place for our deceased loved ones should be in Mt. Auburn Cemetery, and for the following reasons: Mount Auburn Cemetery has set aside an entire section named the Holland Section, to be used entirely for the burial of members of Dutch families.</p>
   <p>The Holland section is situated close to the main entrance and not in the rear of the cemetery. Mt. Auburn Cemetery is an old and well established cemetery. It is one of the most beautiful burial parks in Cook County.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_2_0158.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Aside from the natural beauty, there are broad, winding, paved roads and perfect drainage system. The ground is entirely sand, which gives the owner of a lot the certainty that the graves will always be dry, regardless what season of the year. In our minds, it is the most ideal last resting place for our dead. Mt. Auburn is ideally situated. The cemetery borders on West 41st Street and South Oak Park Avenue. It can easily be reached by automobile, over paved roads, or by the use of the elevated or surface lines. The route runs west to South Oak Park Avenue and then further along the yellow bus line of the Chicago and West-Town Railways Company, straight to the entrance to the cemetery.</p>
   <p>Family lots in this beautiful Holland section are being offered for a short time, at very low prices. The cemetery company offers you an opportunity to select a lot on very easy conditions, by paying a small sum on the closing of the contract and the balance in small payments. The lots are tax free.</p>
   <pb facs="5420781_2_0159.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In our opinion, Holland families of the West Side will do wisely to make use of this opportunity to select a family lot. The cemetery company provides free transportation in case you want to inspect the place, without obligation on your part. Each family ought to realize the necessity to buy a lot. Signed Rev. H. Van der Naald, Rev. J. O. Vos, Rev. Herman Bel, Elder G. Bossenga, Elder D. Boersema, C. Leenhouts.</p>
