   <p>Nominated as candidate for the office of City Collector, Jens Olsen, needs no recommendation from us. It is far more necessary and important to urge his countrymen to work for his election. We are not now going to decry the regrettable fact that the Scandinanians as a whole take such a halfhearted, passive attitude in the political life of the city. But we do consider it proper at this time to remind them of their political duty as citizens on election day; and also to remind them that if they neglect to cast their vote for him, Jens Olsen's excellent chances for election may be ruined.</p>
   <p>They should not rest assured that the candidate's fine qualities are in themselves sufficient to lead him to victory. The Norwegian Republicans who are so numerous in Chicago ought to make themselves more felt in the city politics. To be content with one representative (H. L. Hertz) in the city convention is almost ridiculous. Such modesty is entirely out of place in politics.</p>
