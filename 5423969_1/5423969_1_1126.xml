   </div>

  <body>
   <p>p.2.................Charles O. Sethness is one of the newly appointed members of Chicago's School Board and will be the representative of the Norwegian colony in this body. Mr. Sethness was a member of the board during the administration of Carter H. Harrison, Sr. (father of the present mayor) and is well qualified for the duties of his position.</p>
   <p>The appointment of Mr. Sethness came mainly as a result of the demands of "Dovre," the Republican Club of the 27th Ward. The mayor has previously decided not to appoint a Norwegian member but the insistence of "Dovre" backed by several other organizations brought about a change of attitude and the Norwegian group will have the representation to which it is entitled.</p>
   <p>In addition to finally obtaining an objective through this appointment we also enjoy a bit of comedy in that Mr. Sethness, being an out and out Democrat was sponsored by a strong Republican club. This could only have been brought about by his popularity and the "Dovre" Club's interest in Norwegianism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_1127.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Scandia exhorts Mr. Sethness to put forth more effort in promoting the interests of our people during the coming term than he did during his previous term; with new schools going up in Norwegian districts why not have one named Ibsen, Bjornson or Grieg in recognition of our Norwegian American citizens who are helping supply the funds for these institutions.</p>
   <p>Our Danish people were recognized by the appointment of Dr. Max Henius as a member of the library board and in our opinion a better selection could not have been made.</p>
