   <p>The Times-Herald of yesterday charges Governor Tanner with "refusing protection to the negroes." Here is the argument presented in support of the accusation:</p>
   <p>"Several weeks ago, when the situation brought on by the miners' strike at Pana, Illinois was beyond control of the sheriff, that official wired the facts to Governor Tanner and asked that the state troops be sent to aid him in preserving the peace and preventing the wholesome [sic] assassination of the negro miners who had taken the places vacated by the strikers. Instead of furnishing the desired aid the governor wired back a lot of demagogical claptrap about his alleged opposition to imported labor, and lectured the sheriff for using the force at hand to protect the negro miners--the persons whose lives were endangered.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0827.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Since then the situation has grown worse steadily, culminating in a series of outbreaks and making it necessary to place the working miners in a stockade, while their assailants are parading the streets armed with rifles and threatening violence. Businessmen have appealed to the sheriff, but he has no force adequate for their protection. On Thursday the sheriff called again on the governor, who has ordered state troops from Galesburg to proceed to Pana and protect the lives and property of citizens, but under no circumstances to aid the mine owners in operating their mines.</p>
   <p>"Whether the troops will be of any assistance to the sheriff in preventing the mob of striking miners from attacking the negroes remains to be seen. Under the orders they have received from the commander-in-chief they are prohibited from protecting the only lives in danger.</p>
   <p>"Under what law or constitutional provision does Governor Tanner conceive it to be his duty to protect only the lives of white men and leave inoffensive <pb facs="5423969_1_0828.jpg" n="3"/>colored workers at the mercy of armed mobs? Not even in the South, when race prejudice was strongest, was there a more inhuman and lawless procedure on the part of the state authorities.</p>
   <p>"It is incomprehensible that John R. Tanner, who boasts of having fought to free the slaves, should in such a crisis, deny colored men the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the state of which, by misplaced suffrage, he is chief executive. But it is true."</p>
   <p>It is incomprehensible that a newspaper boasting of its independence should be so completely enslaved by the demon of vindictiveness as to admit such a batch of malicious misrepresentations to its columns.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that the charge preferred by the Times-Herald lacks even the semblance of truth. Governor Tanner has not "refused protection to Negroes."</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0829.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He has made no discrimination whatever between white and colored men. He has stated that he is unalterably opposed to the importation of labor by employers who disagree with their men, because this traffic is injurious to our own workers and prejudicial to the best interests of the state. The Times-Herald brands this as "claptrap," but the taxpayers and workers of Illinois and all fair-minded and sensible people in all walks of life will uphold Governor Tanner.</p>
   <p>While he is opposed to the importation of labor, black and white, he has shown that he is ready to afford protection to imported workers, black and white, if necessary by the military arm of the state. But he knows his duties too well to prostitute the national guard by permitting the troops to aid embarrassed mine-owners in running their mines. He was clearly justified in calling out troops three weeks ago, as he was justified in resorting to this extreme measure on Thursday.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0830.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>His instructions as to the use of the troops are exactly what the constitution and the dignity of the commonwealth and sound common sense demand.</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven has at times felt called upon to criticize Governor Tanner's actions; but in this matter he is all right, while the Times-Herald is all wrong, and discreditably wrong at that.</p>
