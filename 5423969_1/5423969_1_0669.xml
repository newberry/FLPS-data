   <p>"I do not believe that there is a single trust in our country," said Senator Mark Hanna in a brief speech delivered recently in Chicago. Most people probably considered this statement a jest; others probably thought that Mr. Hanna deliberately was stating a falsehood; while others, again, had to agree that he was right.</p>
   <p>In a later address Mr. Hanna informed the public that his Chicago speech had been incorrectly reported by the newspapers. What he did say was that in the legal or commercial sense of the term, there is no trust in existence in the country.</p>
   <p>Is Mr. Hanna right? He is, in so far that the great commercial combinations <pb facs="5423969_1_0670.jpg" n="2"/>are no longer trusts in the legal sense of the term. The earliest trusts were organized in such a manner that various corporations which engaged in competitive or related business activities were placed under a common directorship and were then operated in behalf of the public interest. They were trusts in the legal meaning of the term; the term "trust" was rightfully applied to them. This, however, was an illegal form of industrial activity, and after the courts had declared them illegal, these trusts were dissolved. Several years have passed since the last of them was dissolved; even the Standard Oil corporation is not a trust.</p>
   <p>The great corporations, however, have merely changed their appearance and names. The modern tendency toward great industrial enterprises cannot be stopped by law. One road may be blocked, but there will be other roads that can be traveled. This has been proven also in the United States. The first consequence of the war against trusts has been not <pb facs="5423969_1_0671.jpg" n="3"/>less, but greater centralization.</p>
   <p>The corporations which could not be legally operated under a common board of directors were simply reorganized into one single corporation. This was perfectly legal. There is no legal limit to the amount of capital that may be owned and used by a corporation, or to the number of factories operated by such a corporation.</p>
   <p>By "trust in the commercial sense" is meant a corporation which holds a monopoly of the market in its particular branch of industry. According to Mr. Hanna, there are likewise no trusts in this sense of the word in our country.</p>
   <p>Whether he is right or wrong on this point is a question not easily decided. Mr. Hanna is a man of wide acquaintance with the business life of our country, and for this reason he ought to know the subject he is <pb facs="5423969_1_0672.jpg" n="4"/>discussing. Skandinaven is of the opinion, however, that Mr. Hanna is wrong. It may well be that there is not one single corporation whose monopoly of the market in its particular field is absolute; but there can be no doubt that many corporations have a practical monopoly of the market for the goods they sell, a monopoly quite adequate for the purpose.</p>
   <p>It appears to the Skandinaven that the American Cotton Company deserves the name "trust" in the commercial sense of the term. The corporation in question has a capital of seven million dollars, of which three million dollars are in preferred stock at eight per cent. The company owns the only existing machine for the packing of cotton into round bales. The company does not sell its machines but leases them at a high rental. Every producer of cotton and every dealer in cotton is compelled to lease one or more of these machines and to pay the fee demanded by the company.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0673.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>There is of course no law against the invention of better machines for the purpose of packing cotton. Until such a machine has been invented, however, the American Cotton Company is a virtual monopoly which, in the opinion of Skandinaven, makes the company a trust in the commercial sense of the word.</p>
   <p>Trusts in the legal sense of the term no longer exist in the United States; in this we do agree. The centralization of industry did not cease with the dissolution of trusts. On the contrary, there is greater centralization than ever before.</p>
   <p>According to the now prevailing usage of the term "trust," the word simply signifies a very large business with considerable influence on the market in its particular field. The trend is decidedly in the direction of continued <pb facs="5423969_1_0674.jpg" n="6"/>centralization in every country, including our own. As easily might a law make water run uphill as bring a halt to centralization in business....It is our task to direct this development so that the centralizing tendency may be of the greatest possible benefit to the people as individuals and to society as a whole.</p>
