   <p>If Alderman Stanley Kuntz and Joseph Kostner have their way, every man and woman in Chicago will be compelled to register with the police, and the police will keep an official record of the moving of persons from one locality to another. This plan of Prussianization is offered as a method of lessening crime. Two million honest law-abiding citizens are to be subjected to police surveillance in order to control a few hundred criminals. "In Germany the plan is a complete success," declares Alderman Kuntz.</p>
   <p>It is a singular recommendation to a people who have just finished the job of whipping Kaiserism. Did we send two million men to Europe to overthrow autocracy only to turn about and adopt for domestic use one of its oppressive methods? Police power in Germany was an integral part of the system we helped to destroy. It is a strange thing, but a seeimgly true thing, that America, who gave herself wholeheartedly to the liberation of Europe, should now find it <pb facs="5423969_1_1047.jpg" n="2"/>necessary to be on guard against reactionaries who are attempting to put democracy at home under restraint and supervision.</p>
   <p>The edict in New York that no Socialist may be a public school teacher; the suspension in Washington of a teacher who was sufficiently intelligent to define bolshevism as something other than anarchy; the interference of Burleson with publications that have dared to print opinions contrary to those that are harbored by his parochial mind--these are all symptoms of a spirit that America must resist for her own safety if for no higher reason than devotion to liberty. And this proposal to Prussianize Chicago in order to lessen crime is another symptom of the same dangerous tendency.</p>
   <p>The crime situation in Chicago is serious. It has always been serious. But the remedy is not found in giving the police department, which cannot keep track of a few hundred criminals, the task of keeping track of two million citizens. The remedy is to be found in a complete overhauling of the inefficient police department, in its separation from politics, in capable leadership, and in <pb facs="5423969_1_1048.jpg" n="3"/>increased strength under nonpolitical, vigorous command.</p>
   <p>The Kuntz-Koster plan would put in the hands of the police, and through them in the hands of politicians and persons with private ends to serve, a power that could be abused most viciously and would be abused as long as human nature remains what it is. Instead of operating for greater efficiency in preventing crime, it would operate to employ the police for numberless insignificant matters and intolerable interference. An efficient police department knows its criminals, their methods, their hangouts and associates. It keeps ceaseless watch upon men and women who belong to the underworld. It is immune to persuasion, political or otherwise. Nobody gets protection but the honest citizen, and he is protected because the dishonest are constantly pursued. The police department that follows this program does not need to keep tab on the law abiding.</p>
