   <p>As we have informed our readers before, General Miles has changed his opinion on the question of the army canteen. A year ago he was strongly in favor of the canteen, using all his influence to prevent the adoption of the anti-canteen law. In his latest annual report he supports the present arrangement, however.</p>
   <p>General Miles presents statistics for a number of years in support of a statement that the abolition of the canteen has neither decreased the number of applicants for entrance into the army, nor increased the number of desertions from the army.</p>
   <p>A Washington correspondent points out that officers who favor the canteen find little proof one way or the other concerning desertions in General Miles statistics. They assert that a considerable part of the statistics <pb facs="5423969_1_0281.jpg" n="2"/>refer to the army in the Philippines where desertion is difficult under any circumstances, while desertions in the United States are said to have been more frequent during the past year than earlier.</p>
   <p>Among the prominent generals of the army we find, then, that Shafter and Miles are against the canteen. The probability is that due to the difference of opinion among the leading men in the army, a proposal to discontinue the present law would not be adopted. It is to be hoped that no attempt will be made at present to effect a change. One year is too brief a period for the testing of a law such as the one under discussion. Let the law be given an opportunity to prove what its effects are in a manner that cannot be disputed. Only then can it be decided reasonably whether the law ought to be continued or abolished.</p>
