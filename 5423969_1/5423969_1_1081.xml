   <p>The debate in Sleipner's Hall indicated opposition to the charter law.</p>
   <p>A lively debate on the proposed charter law took place in Spleipner's Hall last night. The meeting was the regular club meeting and the charter law had been chosen as the topic for the evening's debate. Attorney Olaf E. Ray gave some information about the complicated proposal for a charter and called attention to many of its weak points. Lars A. Bergan and several other followed suit. There was very little sentiment for the charter.</p>
   <p>The most important objections to the charter concerned the abolition of referendum, abolition of direct primary, and the increased taxes which will be the result of the clause about streets and paving, which Mr. Ray characterized as sly and deceitful. Also the new ward districting was found unsatisfactory. The meeting was very interesting. If the attitude shown at the meeting in Sleipner Hall is a true indication of sentiment among the Norwegians in general in this matter, the proposal for a new charter law will not receive many votes from that group.</p>
