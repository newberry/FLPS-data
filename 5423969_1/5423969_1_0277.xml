   <p>According to a Washington correspondent the prospect of a renewal of the contest in Congress over the army canteen exists.</p>
   <p>"There is," he says, "a strong sentiment in Congress against prohibition, and unless the temperance argument is made, as it was last session, by overwhelming pressure from the women of the country, the enlisted man seems to stand a fair chance of getting back the right to enjoy the canteen as of yore. The policy of the War Department is to let the matter rest and make no effort to influence legislation in regard to the canteen this winter. In the meantime, the working of the prohibition will be studied carefully and reported on in the army."</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the policy of the Department of War will prevail, and <pb facs="5423969_1_0278.jpg" n="2"/>that the present law will be left undisturbed until it has been given a thorough trial.</p>
   <p>In common with a large majority of the newspapers of the country, the Skandinaven, judging by the light of past experiences, opposed the anti-canteen law as an unwise and ill-considered measure. But it is even more resolutely opposed to a repeal of the new law at the present time. To make laws rashly is bad enough, but to make a law one day and repeal it the next is even worse. This is true as a general principle of legislation and especially whenever a moral principle is involved, as in the present instance. Whether it shall be shown to be good or bad, the anti-canteen law expresses the earnest conviction of a large number of sincere and well-meaning people. They may have been mistaken; but the evidence submitted thus far is conflicting and by no means conclusive. If, after a thorough trial, it should appear to the satisfaction of all open minds that the law has been harmful to the soldiers and the best interests of the army, it should be repealed and the canteen restored. If, on the other hand, it shall be shown that the law has not been harmful, it should remain on the statute books, <pb facs="5423969_1_0279.jpg" n="3"/>even if it has not resulted in greater sobriety or a better morale among our soldiers. For the army canteen is not, under any conditions, a boon in itself; it is justified only as a means of preventing greater evils.</p>
   <p>A renewal of the canteen war at the present juncture would be deplorable from every point of view. In the absence of clear facts the contest would degenerate into a war of fanaticism, bitterness, and mutual recriminations. It would, moreover, result in nothing but sheer waste of precious time. For if the women of the country were strong enough to compel Congress to enact the present law against the better judgment of a majority of the law-makers, they will certainly be strong enough to keep it on the statute books until it shall have had a thorough trial. There is a mountain of pressing and important work before Congress. It cannot afford to waste any time on efforts to repeal laws that should be left alone.</p>
