   <p>At last! The School Board of the city of Chicago has decided to add Norwegian to the languages taught at both Carl Schurz and Tuley High Schools.</p>
   <p>Much careful work has been done to bring about this concession by the board. To Charles O. Sethness, Norwegian member of the board, go most of the honor and the heartfelt gratitude of our Norwegian colony for making possible the study of Norwegian to our children.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, president of the board, was strongly opposed to the movement from the beginning. The Daily News and Record Herald thundered away at it in their editorials, to the extent that our leaders had to work with care and thoroughness. Mr. Sethness managed to keep the question open until he had assured himself that a majority of the board would vote favorably. When the time came the proposal was approved by a vote of 12 to 4.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sethness was ably aided in his campaign by Consul Haugan, Pastor Gullixon, <pb facs="5423969_1_0140.jpg" n="2"/>Judge Torrison, Justice Sonsteby, Swedish Consul Henschen, Berger Osland, Thor Benson, and others who, as a committee, repeatedly spoke for the cause at meetings of the board. The Dovre Republican Club supported the movement and L. B. Bergersen, president of the Club, was a member of the committee. It is now up to parents to see that their children sign up for classes.</p>
