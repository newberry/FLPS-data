   <p>Education has done much to elevate mankind, but in its present advanced stage it does not improve man's morals, as the innumerable heinous crimes perpetrated nowadays more than prove. Take for instance murders and suicides that are increasing so rapidly. Look at our corrupt and vicious city administration, run and controlled by boodlers and bribers. Ignorance is not to blame for these maladministrations. Immorality and every conceivable vice are rampant. And all these evils are thriving under the very walls of the highest educational institutions of the land.</p>
   <p>In the homes of science and learning you will see the modern nabob's palatial residences on the one hand, and on the other the slum district where humanity has sunk so deep in vice and iniquity that they are below the most abject savage. We might go on in this way, but the above illustrations will do.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0090.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the face of such glaring facts, what are you going to say for your higher education? No, I maintain that the higher education does not qualify a person for all the practical sides of life. On the contrary, as experience has shown, it disqualifies him or her. Take the man with only the common rudiments of learning and brains, whether he be a private businessman or a public officer, and you will find that he is the man that is most successful, whether in a city office or the office of President of the United States. We have had men holding the last-named office that had no schooling at all, comparatively speaking, and yet managed the affairs of the office very well.</p>
   <p>We all admit that knowledge is power--that without education and the means of acquiring it, the world could not progress as it does. But those who have not had the chance to become highly educated must not be thrust aside. The idea some seem to have, that no woman has a right to marry unless she has been a teacher, is preposterous. If that were true I would say, "God pity the men."</p>
