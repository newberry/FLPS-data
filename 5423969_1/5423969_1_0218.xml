   <p>The Theological Seminary of Morgan Park, Illinois, is located in a beautiful village, fourteen miles from the Chicago business center, it is located on a long hill or ridge, perhaps the highest natural point for more than twenty miles south of Chicago. Here we find the Morgan Park Academy, also the Dano-Norwegian Seminary as well as the Swedish-Baptist Theological Seminary. The Dano-Norwegian school as well as the other schools referred to, are now in organic connection with the University of Chicago, each with a dean or head.</p>
   <p>Professor Hendrick Gunderson is the present dean of the Dano-Norwegian Baptist School. He came from Norway in the year 1887 to take up the work as an associate of Professor N. P. Jensen, was then dean of this school. After the death of Professor N. P. Jensen, Professor Hendrick Gunderson was made dean in 1895, having served as acting dean for two years during the former's illness. The history of this school dates back to 1884 when Professor N. P. Jensen was appointed head and Professor Edward Olsen, P.H.D., associate of a Dano-Norwegian <pb facs="5423969_1_0219.jpg" n="2"/>Baptist Seminary. The school opened on October 1, 1884, with eleven students. Since then 170 Norwegian and Danish young men have enjoyed the privileges of this school. Twelve of the gradutates of this school are now actively engaged as pastors in Norway, one in Africa, several in Denmark, and more than fifty in the United States and Canada. At the present time the school has about thirty students enrolled with Professor H. Gunderson as dean, and Professor C. J. Olsen and N. L. Lawndahl as associate teachers. The course mapped out extends over a period of four years. During the first two years the student is required to take up and reach a certain standard in English and Dano-Norwegian grammar, geography, bible chronology, history and elementary Greek. During the last two years at school the student must attain a certain standing in systematic theology, New Testament, Greek, philosophy, logic, church history, church policy, pastoral theology, homiletics, and antiquity. To aid the students a rather comprehensive library, kept well up to date with English and Dano-Norwegian works of literary and practical value, is placed at the disposal of the students in Walker Hall.</p>

   <p>Frequent lectures are also given to the students by men who are well versed in subjects valuable to the students. Besides this the students have for many years kept up a very efficient literary and debating club for the proper developments of their mental and oral potentialities.</p>
