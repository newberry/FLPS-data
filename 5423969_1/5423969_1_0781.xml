   <p>Again the "Knights of Labor" come into the limelight. Much speculation and discussion regarding this organization are going on among the people.</p>
   <p>Now definite information is at hand about this more or less mysterious group. The Knights of Labor was organized in Philadelphia in 1873. At that time it was a secret organization, and for several years remained unknown to the public. Only after four years of its existence did it come out in the open in the guise of a "Brotherhood."</p>
   <p>It seems that the cloth and linen weavers in Philadelphia were the first to conceive the plan of the organization. The stronger the organization became numerically, the stronger it became organizationally, and the more progressive it became.</p>
   <p>In the seventies labor struggled against low wages and long hours, and <pb facs="5423969_1_0782.jpg" n="2"/>unemployment. So it was natural that the Knights of Labor should grow and become strong. The membership is now about eighty thousand although in 1878 it was twelve thousand. This shows a remarkable increase in four years.</p>
   <p>The "Knights" are nonpartisan; at one time they indorse the Democrats and at another the Republicans. However they only indorse the best candidates, and always the friends of Labor.</p>
   <p>Lately they have resolved to try to have their own people nominated and elected. If they are successful, we can see that it will strengthen the position of the workers and cause a decided change for the better, both in wages and hours. [The principle demand of their program will be of course more jobs.]</p>
