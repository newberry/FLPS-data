   <p>Editor of Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: In this world of ours, where the wheat and tares grow up alike and together, it becomes hard for us to know what is right, and it is impossible to go by the examples of others. Now can we judge? What one pulpit condemns, another upholds. Members of the same church differ in regard to many questions. Now, how are we to know on what to build our foundation? Should we say then that there should not be a difference of opinion? No, that would not do. We young people live under conditions different from those under which our parents and grandparents lived, and for this reason our wants and desires are different.</p>
   <p>Let me say, give every person credit for his own opinions, and if you see <pb facs="5423969_1_0366.jpg" n="2"/>they are wrong, try to persuade them to think differently by kindness and firmness and wrath [sic]. Try to replace the bad with something good; do not rely upon force. Here is where many parents and even preachers of the gospel make a mistake. They try to drive out the evil without filling the place with good.</p>
   <p>A young soul cannot be empty. Young blood flows fast. Where there is youth there is life. Where there is life there is motion. Where there is motion there is force. Let this force be directed in the right way and there would not be so many occasions to bring up complaints against the young people. Very few young people deliberately go to work and do wrong just because they wish and want to do it; but the fact is, there is nothing better for them to do.</p>
   <p>I remember of reading about a foolish farmer who made up his mind to keep his field free from weeds. He worked very hard, and after he had succeeded in killing every weed, he went home contented, and felt proud of his work.</p>
   <p>After two weeks time the farmer went to his field again and what did he find?</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0367.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The field was covered with weeds again, but he repeated the work with no better success. His friends advised him to plant something in the field and the weeds would disappear. This he did and to his surprise the weeds were checked and the farmer reaped a good harvest. If we wish to reap good fruits, we must not leave our hearts vacant.</p>
   <p>Our western farmer boys and girls have to work too hard as a rule, even to take in a few pleasures to rest themselves a little. Here in Chicago it is somewhat different; here our youth has more time, therefore we should give them good healthy amusement.</p>
   <p>A youth harnessed to labor like an adult is never happy. Still, at the same time, a youth ought not to be happy without some work, and when at leisure, he is entitled to all the pleasures that can be had. The end and aim in this world ought to be happiness. What is heaven but a home of happiness? Everything we do ought to lead to happiness, and when our lifework is done, we <pb facs="5423969_1_0368.jpg" n="4"/>are allowed eternal happiness if we prefer it.</p>
   <p>Pleasure does not always lead to happiness. A drunkard takes pleasure in drinking, a gambler in gambling; and a dancer takes pleasure in the whirl of the dance, etc., etc. But such pleasures are sins and lead to nothing but wretchedness. Good reading is a pleasure that builds up character and gives the youth that discipline which nothing else can give. Good company is even more essential than good reading. Dancing, card playing, and gambling, are pleasures which lead to evil and are sinful in themselves. Tobacco using and drinking are both sinful and harmful, yet they are regarded by many people as an unavoidable pleasure. Hunting, fishing, riding, swimming, games on the school grounds, and games of the fireside are harmless and helpful exercises. Every youth ought to take pleasure in these, for they will rest and strengthen him, and if he does not, he ought to wear a long gray beard and be what he is--an old man.</p>
   <p>Our young people's societies ought to take pleasure in doing something good.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0369.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Our young people's society here has undertaken to paint and paper our church. We do it because we take pleasure in it. How can we raise the money? Working for it. Yes, we have started to work and have been very successful, and at the same time have derived much pleasure out of our work. In June we had a little party netting us thirty dollars. In July we had an ice cream social and raised over twelve dollars. That is the way to work, and I am sure we have reaped both pleasure and happiness from it.</p>
   <p>Some people take great pleasure in backbiting and talking evil about their neighbors. This is a very dangerous and wicked pleasure and ought not to exist. I remember reading in mythology about an old hag who took her greatest pleasure in being miserable. I hope a character like this is not to be found in our country; yet I know people who hang their heads and look at the dark side of everything,and to whom life seems to be a pain instead of a pleasure.</p>
