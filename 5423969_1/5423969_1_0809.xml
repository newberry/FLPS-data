   <p>"We have discovered after a careful examination of the points at issue that, as usual, mistakes and misunderstandings underlie the troubles at McKeesport, and we reach the conclusion that it will be to the advantage of all parties concerned to start the Wood's mill with the other employees on next Monday morning, April 22, 1901;and it is further agreed that the contract in reference to working conditions in the mill and scale matters shall be observed until July 1, 1901, and in the meantime Mr. Smith and Mr. Holloway shall have a meeting to adjust all difficulties which may exist between them.</p>
   <p>"T. J. Shaffer, President,</p>
   <p>John Williams, Secretary,</p>
   <p>For the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers.</p>
   <p>"John Jarrett,</p>
   <p>For the American Sheet Steel Company."</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0810.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every employer and every leader of labor ought to frame this sensible agreement and place it on his desk or in a conspicuous place in his workshop. It has prevented a gigantic struggle that probably would have involved all the mills and all of the two hundred thousand men of the United States Steel Corporation. Such a stupendous war would have been a frightful calamity to the mills and their workers and to the country at large.</p>
   <p>The first lesson taught by this common-sense settlement is that whenever employer and workers attempt to adjust differences in a spirit of conciliation, a satisfactory settlement is liekly to be reached. "We have discovered that, as usual, mistakes and misunderstandings underlie the troubles." That is true in nearly every conflict between capital and labor; and it is equally true that a careful joint examination of the points at issue will reveal the misunderstandings and pave the way to harmony and peace.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0811.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The agreement is also of great importance as an indication of the attitude of the greatest trust of the country toward its employees. The trouble at McKeesport is the first clash between the billion-dollar trust and a group of its workers. In the words of President Shaffer, the workers were treated fairly. The trust officers did not hesitate to make concessions when they learned upon investigation that the men were right.</p>
   <p>The happy outcome of the ominous-looking conflict justifies the view held by many labor leaders and recently concurred in by Prince Kropotkin, the noted Russian anarchist, that the great trusts are not a menace to the man who works with his hands. It indicates that the organization of industry and labor on broad lines has a tendency to steady the wheels of industry and the relations between employer and men; to emphasize the community of interests between capital and labor; to accentuate the tremendous responsibility of the leaders of the industrial forces of our modern society; to secure stability of production and employment, and thus cement the alliance between the unions and trusts for the maintenance of industrial peace.</p>
