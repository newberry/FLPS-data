   <p>The Cook County Republican Convention is meeting today. If the Convention does solid, intelligent work, the Republican party will probably win an easy victory in the fall. But it may also happen that the Convention will present the people with a ticket which will be difficult to elect.</p>
   <p>As a necessary condition for victory, the Convention must present a ticket which will promote harmony instead of strife. The majority must recognize the minority if dissension is to be avoided and happy collaboration be secured.</p>
   <p>Second, the ticket must be composed so as to represent the elements, the aid of which the party needs in order to win. Skandinaven is primarily considering the Norwegians, the Swedes, and the Germans in this connection, since these groups constitute the majority of the Republican army in Cook County.</p>
   <p>The Swedes are well represented on the State ticket, and for this reason will <pb facs="5423969_1_1166.jpg" n="2"/>probably be reasonable in their demands as regards the County ticket. The Germans have no representation on the State ticket; sagacious and just politics will dictate, therefore, that the German group be fully represented on the County ticket.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians in Chicago have not been overindulged politically. It is a long time now since they have been represented in a manner corresponding to their strength at the polls. They are very patient, yet they are beginning to smart under the continued disregard. Their demand is not unreasonable. Mr. Peter M. Balken is a candidate for County Commissioner. This is a modest office, but the Norwegians do not demand any more from the present Convention.</p>
   <p>Mr. Balken is the right man for County Commissioner. He is one of our good early settlers and has passed the greater part of his life in Chicago. He is thoroughly acquainted with the city and the county. He has studied their growth and development; he knows what is needed to maintain their growth unhindered. As County <pb facs="5423969_1_1167.jpg" n="3"/>Commissioner he would be the right man in the right place.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the Convention will recognize the reasonableness and justice of Balken's candidacy, and that his name will be found upon the ticket as finally presented. He is well known and well liked, not only among the Norwegians but also in wide circles of other groups of the population. His nomination would be greeted with satisfaction, especially among the Norwegians, and this is of considerable importance, since the Norwegians hold the balance of power in Cook County. A ticket which can win the approval of the main body of Norwegian voters is quite certain to win with votes to spare.</p>
