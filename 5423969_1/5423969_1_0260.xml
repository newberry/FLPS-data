   <p>It seems that during this winter season the Norwegian population of Chicago was more active than at any time before. Meetings, meetings, meetings of all sorts--it was only a question of choosing which to attend.</p>
   <p>There were two preachers from Norway, Peder Svensen and Ludvig Hope; these two men know how to appeal to the masses. And then there was something very special--the big meeting of the United Lutheran Church, Center Avenue and Huron Street. When there is a gathering which includes Ludvig Hope and all the ministers of the United Church, one might well wonder if anybody would even remember the Hope Mission meeting in Humboldt Park. Yet there were about one hundred and fifty people present, and the meeting was most successful. The Jubal Male Chorus, under the direction of Otto Olsen sang four numbers very beautifully and with excellent harmony. It was truly a pleasure to listen to them.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Emily Hill gave a good and instructive lecture on the harmful influence [of liquor] on both the inner and the outer man. She conclusively proved the necessity for total abstinence and prohibition, and she tried to make the audience learn the names of all the prohibition states....She also urged the audience to work faithfully to get Illinois to join the ranks of the prohibition states.</p>
   <p>The Jubal Chorus was invited to sing in the coming temperance parade. Mrs. Hill is the president of the Cook County Women's Christian Temperance Union. There are fifty White Cross societies in the county.</p>
