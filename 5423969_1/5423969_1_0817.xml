   <p>The large batch of true bills found by the Grand Jury against rioting strikers will prove a blessing in disguise to organized labor in Chicago and throughout the whole land. This eleventh-hour assertion of the power of the law cannot but make the strike leaders pause in their mad course of lawlessness, as it must open the eyes of those of their misguided followers who are still amenable to reason.</p>
   <p>Unionism, as it has manifested itself in Chicago during the present troubles, has become a positive danger to society, especially to the large body of honest and industrious workingmen. Its aim is to be a law unto itself. It has defied the laws of society as recklessly as it has trampled upon the rights of honest toil. No one believes that the large body of unionists in this city are lawless men, but they cannot escape the responsibility for the lawless acts that <pb facs="5423969_1_0818.jpg" n="2"/>have been committed in their name and ostensibly for their benefit. The labor leaders have been chosen and invested with their dangerous power by the majorities of their respective unions. If the majority of union men have been misled, it is their misfortune, but this fact does not absolve them from responsibility. Nor can they plead ignorance. It has been plain to all men of average common sense that union labor in Chicago has been unscrupulously exploited by a gang of officeholders who have been using their power in the unions for what there was in it. These self-seeking schemers are the authors of the troubles, but they are supremely indifferent to the want, misery, and suffering that have saddened the hearths of so many thousands of happy homes.</p>
   <p>Sober workingmen must now have come to understand that during its present leadership, unionism in Chicago was rushing headlong to destruction. The "leaders," drunk with the sense of their power, may have harbored the insane delusion that, because a cowardly and demagogic administration cowed before them, nothing could withstand their assaults. They have now discovered their mistake.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0819.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Whether the large body of union men have seen the error of their ways is, now-ever, a matter of greater importance; for upon this very point depends the future, not to say the existence, of organized labor. There cannot be a shadow of a doubt that if it is to pursue a course of intimidation, terrorism, violence, and riot, unionism will be crushed and wiped out altogether.</p>
   <p>Organized labor has done much for the advancement of the toiler, if not as much as it has done for the numerous slick talkers who prefer to live upon the fruits of other men's toil rather than to toil for themselves. Organized labor is needed as an educating force, as a steadying and regulating factor in our industrial development. But if it is to exist, it must keep within the pale of the law and not interfere with the rights of any toiler to work as he pleases.</p>
   <p>This plain lesson organized labor must learn and adopt for its future guidance, or it will go down. Labor is great, but law is greater. Labor is the dominating economic force in society, but the true welfare of labor, organized or <pb facs="5423969_1_0820.jpg" n="4"/>unorganized, depends upon its recognition of law as the greatest and supreme force of the land.</p>
