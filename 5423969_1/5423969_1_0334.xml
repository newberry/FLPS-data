   <p>The defeat of Congressman Volstead for renomination has not plunged the country into mourning. Volstead was the author of the bill which made the country dry a year ago. Flushed--in his case it would be libelous to say intoxicated--with his success, he attempted to pass another bill which would have made free speech even more of a mockery than Palmer has succeeded in making it. His constituents accepted his first "reform," but rebelled at his second.</p>
   <p>It was ever thus: Give a calf rope and he will choke himself. Give a "reformer" a fair chance and he will reform himself into what Grover Cleveland called innocuous desuetude. But the price of rope nowadays is high.</p>
