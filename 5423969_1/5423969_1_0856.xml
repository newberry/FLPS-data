   <p>Editor of Skandinaven</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"If you cannot on the ocean,</p>
   <p>Sail among the swiftest fleet,</p>
   <p>Rocking on the highest billows,</p>
   <p>Laughing at the storms you meet,</p>
   <p>You can stand among the sailors,</p>
   <p>Anchored yet within the bay;</p>
   <p>You could lend a hand to help them,</p>
   <p>As they launch their boats away."</p>
   <p>Times are never so hard, lack of employment is never so great, that we cannot <pb facs="5423969_1_0857.jpg" n="2"/>always find something to do.</p>
   <p>But it takes a great mind to do work for others at little or no compensation, and thus we have as a result a great multitude of people who do not want to do anything unless they receive a good big salary. As a rule these people do not succeed. Many among our day workers would rather be idle a whole year than work for meager pay. This is wrong and it is also the reason why the poor suffer. Pennies saved make men rich, as Benjamin Franklin says. It is not the great things in life that count. It takes many small things to make up great things. "Mange Baekke Smaa Gjor En Stor Aa." (Many small brooks, make the great river.)</p>
   <p>Then have patience. Be satisfied with little. Then some time, some day, you will have reached the goal which you sought. But by neglecting the smaller things you will be and continue to be like a "rolling stone, that gathers no moss."</p>
   <p>What one needs is patience, perseverence, a firm will, taking the time needed; for Rome was not built in one day. This will enable us to occupy our time always <pb facs="5423969_1_0858.jpg" n="3"/>with profit.</p>
   <p>The youth often thinks that if a job is not liberally rewarded it is better to give it up. But remember this, that if you are faithful in work that is meagerly paid, you will by your faithfulness steadily gain the appreciation of your fellow men, who in turn look for just such a man to fill places of trust.</p>
   <p>In order to do these small things and be satisfied until better times come, we must make ourselves humble and simple. Another great fault is wanting to be among the "big," thus losing our fellow men's confidence and love. Humbleness is the greatest word to be found in the book of all books. Humbleness is the greatest education. It makes us feel smaller, as Milton says: "My learning is only like a drop of water compared to a large ocean." Humbleness reveals to us our weakness and thus teaches us to rely on divine providence. Humbleness is the clothing one must have while mounting the road that leads to success.</p>
   <p>Many of our young are, however, devoid of this virtue--we may call it a blessing-- <pb facs="5423969_1_0859.jpg" n="4"/>and leave simple work to find something greater, leave the farm for city life. There no one wants them, and so they conclude to idle their time away waiting for greater work.</p>
   <p>This is wrong, young friends. You must not be idle; there is so much to be done.</p>
   <p>Do not stand idle, waiting for some greater work to do.</p>
