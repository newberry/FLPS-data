   <p>p.4.............The Democrats won Tuesday's election. Carter Harrison became mayor for a plurality of 17,000 votes over Prof. Merriam the Republican candidate. However, no special harm comes from the change in party rule; the difference between the two parties being infinitesimal. As far as the ordinary "John Voter" is concerned our gang eats as much as the other.</p>
   <p>The Republican emphatically claimed they alone could and would give Chicago an efficient administration though they seem to have forgotten the fiasco that resulted from their winning with Busse and his cohorts four years ago. Even three of Chicago's big dailies published accusations that this much touted administration had misappropriated twenty-three million dollars of the taxpayers cash.</p>
   <p>Now that Harrison is to occupy the mayor's throne the price of gas is to be reduced to seventy cents per thousand cubic feet. In the meantime we are patiently waithing to see what the quality of the gas will be and whether our gas bills will <pb facs="5423969_1_1068.jpg" n="2"/>be reduced. If there is any truth in the saying, "Everything comes to him who waits" we will eventually be able to elect an honest and efficient administration in Chicago.</p>
