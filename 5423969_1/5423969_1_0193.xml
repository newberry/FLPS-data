   <p>In view of the struggle that marked the beginning of Luther College and the subsequent struggle to keep it going, it is of interest to all of us to know more about the College. At the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the College, Professor Ludvig Hektoen, of the University of Chicago, spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"As the representative of the Alumni Association of Luther College, I bring a message of jubilant congratulations from the alumni to the Alma Mater on this auspicious celebration of its fiftieth anniversary, and on the significant step completed this day toward making her foundations more secure. I bring a message of deep gratitude to the donors of the endowment fund, and one of sincere satisfaction in the part taken by fellow alumni in raising this fund!</p>
   <p>"I know that the sentiments of the alumni of Luther College are interpreted correctly when I say that we look upon this fund and the manner in which it was created as the most sincere endorsement, by friends far and near, of the College and its work. For do not the friend of the College hereby attest that it <pb facs="5423969_1_0194.jpg" n="2"/>has fulfilled its functions in the years gone by, that it has been a faithful agency of high purpose, that it has impressed them with this aim, that it has been loyal to the welfare of its students and to high standards of character and efficiency?....</p>
   <p>"If one were to ask, What are the special elements that give to this College such recognized strength and such promise of great value for the future that it has received a permanent endowment? different answers would be made depending on different points of view. In addition to the character of the student body of the College, and to the earnestness and inspiring devotion of the faculty, I regard it of the greatest importance to its progress that there has been no uncertainty as to its purpose.</p>
   <p>"Luther College was founded and is maintained 'in order to provide a liberal and thorough education for young men who intend to enter the service of the church,' but it has not avoided the responsibilities and duties placed upon it with respect to those students who for various reasons select other vocations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0195.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>'It welcomes any youth who desires to avail himself of its advantages.' The aim has been to give a broad, scholarly training and to develop moral strength and character in all its students, this being regarded as the best preparation for their life work, whatever its nature may be. It has placed character above intellectual attainment, and it has held fast to thorough and scholarly courses of study. This steady pursuit of what always must be the enduring ideals in education has created an atmosphere or spirit which guides the students and influences all who come into relation with the College, giving it stability and strength and reflecting itself in the character of its graduates.</p>
   <p>"As one of the results of this steady pursuit of its clearly defined purpose, this college from its beginning has been a faithful and powerful agency in preparing us to take a worthy part in the building of this country and its civilization, in preserving in our race in America its peculiar and desirable qualities, and in preventing an untimely submergence with loss of identity and influence in the great melting pot into which we have been thrown. That Luther College has been consistently loyal to the common welfare from this point of view should appeal with peculiar force to Norwegians everywhere; that it has not <pb facs="5423969_1_0196.jpg" n="4"/>failed of appreciation by men of light and leaders outside of our own ranks, as illustrated by Mr. Hill's generous gift, is worthy of special emphasis.</p>
   <p>"It is natural that we, as grateful alumni, rejoice that an endowment fund has been established. The College will be better able to provide adequate opportunities for its teachers whose task of awakening and properly developing the possibilities that slumber in youth requires thorough training, clear vision, and competent scholarship. We must not lose sight of the obligation that rests on colleges to do what they can to promote the growth of knowledge. They do this best if their teachers are able to detect early those students who are endowed with the instinct for a life of quiet and continuous study, who have talent for research, and are able by proper methods to lead them on to do the work for which they are specially fitted in order that the torch may be placed in hands fit to carry it forward.</p>
   <p>"We alumni rejoice also because this fund comes not only as the result, but also as a reward for the thorough, faithful, and unassuming performance of duty that has marked the work of the faculty of Luther College since its establishment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0197.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>May the example and inspiration of duty thus performed ever continue in the College.</p>
   <p>"The developments at Luther College are not to stop with the completion of this endowment fund. Further growth and expansion in various directions are destined to follow.</p>
   <p>"No matter how satisfactory and admirable the courses of instruction may seem at present, they cannot remain fixed and unchangeable. Modifications, readjustments, and additions must be made from time to time. These are steps that require careful planning and deliberation. While there is danger in becoming so wedded to the traditions of the past as not to grasp the realities of the present, there is danger also in mistaking mere alteration and novelty for progress. 'All true development and progress are out of and because of what has gone before'. On the basis of this consideration, I venture to mention, as an example of the needs of the College, that for some time it has seemed to me and no doubt to many others that general biology should be represented just as chemistry and physics have been for many years. Whatever the future career of the student <pb facs="5423969_1_0198.jpg" n="6"/>may be, a well-planned and thorough introduction to biology will be of interest and advantage in giving him a clearer insight into the practical significance of the developments in the science which includes both physiology and medicine. A knowledge of the fundamental facts of biology would be of particular value to clergymen and teachers in dealing with the problems of health that come up for consideration in their daily work. It would aid also in driving our quackery and humbug, which, I regret to say, succeeded long ago, in fastening their evils on our countrymen. At present the situation at Luther College, so far as concerns the natural sciences, offers an inviting opportunity for the donation of funds for buildings, equipment, and endowment.</p>
   <p>"On days such as this, the past seems near; the dust of the passing years is blown away, and we see clearly, more clearly than before, the large significance of the services of the founders of the College, of its many supporters from pioneer days down to the present moment, of the members of its faculty, and of its first president, faithful, venerable, revered by all and beloved by those who have come under his immediate influence. The influence of their work and of their aspirations continues because of their loyalty to a high aim, because of the <pb facs="5423969_1_0199.jpg" n="7"/>living faith in them, and because of their unaltering faithfulness to the highest ideals of conduct and to high standards of scholarship even in the days of small things. Small things? Yes, in some ways, perhaps, and according to certain criteria, but in other ways those were days of great things because the founding of this College fifty years ago, and the successful conduct of the institution since then or meager resources, but with steadily increasing influence and without the sacrifice of a single fundamental principle, constitute an achievement of the largest significance by Norwegians in America.</p>
   <p>"I feel confident that I voice the sentiments and hopes of all the alumni of Luther College when I urge upon its friends to see to it that nothing is done that will tend to restrict or divide the natural field of its usefulness and its sources of support, but to continue in firm and genuine unity to increase its educational facilities and resources in order that it may serve its purposes in still larger measure.</p>
   <p>"And finally a word to those in whose hands rest the future of many hopes. Students of Luther College! As you stand at the foot of the long hill, amid the glorious tints of the morning, before the dew of youth has dried off, eager <pb facs="5423969_1_0200.jpg" n="8"/>for the journey to proceed, we who have gone before you, and are now looking back, salute you! Aided by vigorous physical health, may you feel that clear, keen joy in your work which drive away the shadows of annoyance and langour. Live neither too much in the past nor in the future, but let each day's work of your college years satisfy your widest ambitions and absorb all your energies. For your very admission to this College....demands of you now that you develop and organize your resources of spirit and mind into the effective service of high aims."</p>
   <p>Professor Preus received a letter a few days ago from Mrs. Brunsdal, with a check for $10,000 for the endowment fund. Mrs. Brunsdal has two sons attending Luther College.</p>
