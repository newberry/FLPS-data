   <p>Chicago citizens marched yesterday in protest against the saloon evil, against crooked politics, and against the "red light" district. The pouring rain did not dampen the ardor of the marchers....</p>
   <p>First came the Chicago mounted police; next, a large Salvation Army band; next--and most imposing of all--virtually all the preachers in Chicago, marching six abreast and arm in arm; then, a number of fraternal groups and organizations, all with floats and banners.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian group seemed to draw the most applause. The float representing a viking ship, with Thor and his hammer, was thunderously applauded. Several groups in Norwegian folk costumes looked very splendid. The Norwegian group assembled at 14th and Michigan, and led the third division. Following the two marshals on horseback leading the group, came a standard-bearer carrying a large banner with the inscription, "Thor and His Hammer," and with a likeness <pb facs="5423969_1_0340.jpg" n="2"/>of Thor very artistically embroidered on the banner in colors. Then came the float "The Viking Ship" mentioned above.</p>
   <p>We saw such slogans as: "We are a law-abiding people. We demand clean men as lawmakers and officials"; "We want our children shielded from the saloon evil"; "Norway has gone dry. Norwegians will help make Illinois dry"; "The liquor interests should take care of their victims"; and "Norwegians will help smash the liquor traffic."</p>
   <p>One old man proudly bore a banner with the slogan, "Swear off cigarettes".</p>
   <p>Groups of Danes and Swedes were seen with their national flags and banners, inscribed with many original slogans.....</p>
