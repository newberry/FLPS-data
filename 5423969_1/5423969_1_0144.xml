   <p>Peer O. Stromme, Norwegian-American editor of Minneapolis, Minnesota, in a lecture, delivered at a meeting of the Norsemen's League in Christiania, made a statement to which Scandia takes exception, most decidedly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stromme states,"American born Norwegian youth stands on shifting sand and without root and must of necessity look to Norway for its aesthetic nourishment."</p>
   <p>This may possibly be the case in isolated communities in rural districts where there are only Norwegian churches and schools and such places are very few. The statement in general is, to say the least, absolutely misleading and unjust. Take Chicago, as an example, where not one child in a hundred reads Norwegian or cares anything about it. Everything it sees and hears is in the English language - business, schools, church, music, play.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0145.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Scandia is naturally in favor of having the Norwegian language made accessible to our youth. in those of our high schools where our people are gathered in sufficient numbers to justify it. We are intensely interested in everything Norwegian, and we advocate the use of Norwegian at all Norwegian functions as far as is possible and practical, even though we have serious doubts as to the interest that would be shown in Norwegian classes by our boys and girls.</p>
   <p>It would be far more practical, in our opinion, to provide a course in Norwegian in our universities and other higher educational institutions. Youth of university age are more able to comprehend the advantage of being able to study the masterpieces of Norwegian music and literature in the original language rather than in a garbed, poorly-worded translation to English. The works of Ibsen, Bjornson and other Norwegian authors can not be truly and satisfactorily translated into English, the beauty of these works is entirely lost during the transition.</p>
   <p>To the Poles, Italians and Germans, the teaching of their languages means much in <pb facs="5423969_1_0146.jpg" n="3"/>assisting them to become ever more and more clannish. Our Scandinavian people are more adaptable to Americanism and absorb the principles and standards of our adopted country more readily that any other foreign group and we feel that this fully explains what appears to be antipathy toward Norwegianism.</p>
