<title level="a">POLITICS IN CHURCHES</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Olaf E. Ray</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>I am trying to call attention to a type of politics which all of us may be able to agree upon when we belong to the same society or the same church... I maintain that there are phases in politics which may be developed to considerable advantage without the danger of bringing in elements of enmity into the churches or societies, and that this kind of politics is productive of advantages and respect for our people as a whole.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Doe exclaims that I am merely looking for monetary advantages in my call for political action, for the political "bones" which might be thrown our way. Of course it is so, and why not? Is it so that we have to relin-quish our claims to political positions in order to maintain a high aes-thetical attitude?</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_1153.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Let me present, in this connection, a few of my reasons for urging our people to stronger political activity. The other week one of the highly respected members of the Norwegian United Lutheran Church on Grand Avenue, came to my office on business, and during his stay the conversation turned to the subject of taxes of about eighty dollars per year levied against the church property on Grand Avenue. I expressed my surprise at the amount of the assessment, knowing as I did that the Roman Catholic Church at Ohio and Sangamon Streets is paying no tax on its property there, although it covers a considerable area, and includes the cloister building at 186 North Peoria Street. I told my friend that we Norwegians are permitting ourselves to be bled while the Irish and others escape untouched. I also told him that our church people must not take a "hands off" stand in regard to the political life in our city, for taxes and other burdens must be borne by our people under any circumstances, and more so if we have no political influence.</p>
   <p>Together with my friend, I then went to the official responsible for the levying of taxes, and we were not defeated in our efforts here; the Norwegian church was granted the same tax immunity as the Catholic church mentioned.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_1154.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The matter of this church on Grand Avenue is only one of the many cases of similar kind with which I have had to deal.</p>
   <p>About one year ago it was decided to pave West Erie Street, and our Savior's Church (Norwegian Lutheran) was assessed $1084.35 on this occasion. By chance some of the younger members of that church mentioned the matter to me, and I took steps to find out if the assessment was equitable. Finding that the amount the church in question had to pay was unreasonably high, I got in touch with the city authorities emphasizing that a church ought not to be assessed a heavier tax than Irish saloonkeepers who were owners of similar corner properties. My arguments and my political bluff in the matter moved the city tax assessor, who was a Catholic, to consider seriously the high assessment given this Norwegian church, and a reduction was made from the $1084.35 to $810.20, which is a reduction of $274.15....At the time when this matter was up some members of this church considered it inadvisable to complain....and expressed to me their desire that nothing be done about it. In spite of this I continued my work for reduction in the assessment, with <pb facs="5423969_1_1155.jpg" n="4"/>the favorable result as mentioned....</p>
   <p>I repeat that I wrote in the Skandinaven on September 2: "Through the intelligent exploitation of our church associations and our secular societies we may be able to bluff our way to political preferences through alertness, without having to make political speeches from the pulpit or from the speakers platform at our socials.</p>
   <p>There is no need for standing idly by while our people are being cheated out of their rights in public affairs.</p>
