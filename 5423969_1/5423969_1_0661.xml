   <p>What will probably turn out to be one of the most famous trusts in the country has just been organized by the undertakers and liverymen in Chicago. These gentlemen who minister to our wants at important stages during our journey from the cradle to the grave, have formed a compact organization for the purpose of enhancing the value of their service. It includes all undertakers and liverymen in the city except twenty-five who are left to choose between going into the trust or going out of business.</p>
   <p>To begin with, the prices for livery service at christenings, weddings, and funerals have been increased materially, from twenty-five to forty per cent; but as the trust is master of the field there is no telling when the increase will stop.</p>
   <p>Opinions may differ as to the merits and demerits of trusts in general, but <pb facs="5423969_1_0662.jpg" n="2"/>there can be no reasonable doubt as to the dangerous character of the undertakers' and liverymen's trust. In point of wealth it cannot be compared with such giant combines as, for instance, the United States Steel Corporation; but as it affects the spiritual as well as the material welfare of the people, it is a greater menace to society. Just think of it! While we send out missionaries to convert and baptize heathens, a monopolistic coterie of fellow citizens have decreed an all but prohibitory tax upon baptism of our own children! Our swains and maidens show a growing disinclination to marry because they think they cannot afford to enjoy the bliss of marriage; and in the face of such a serious condition the cost of weddings is increased! And what shall we say about funerals? They were already so expensive that only well-to-do people could indulge in the luxury of up-to-date funeral arrangements, and yet forty per cent is to be added to the price of decent burials.</p>
   <p>But this is not all. Following in the footsteps of other famous combinations, this odious trust is likely to extend itself at both ends as it were. We <pb facs="5423969_1_0663.jpg" n="3"/>may expect the midwives to form an affiliated body, while cemetery owners and sextons will not be slow to organize at the other end--thus adding to the perplexities of entering the world and to the difficulties of leaving it. It is perfectly clear that under such conditions only rich people can afford to be born and to die. But let us hope that the eventual decrease of business may check the greed of the trust and that rival concerns may enter the field and save mankind by salutary competition.</p>
