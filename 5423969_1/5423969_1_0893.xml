   <p>The National Congress of the Scandinavian Socialist League was recently held in the Danish Brotherhood Hall [now the Workers' Lyceum], 2733 Hirsch Street. Delegates from every state in the Union were present. Mr. N. F. Holm called the meeting to order; the secretary then read the proposed agenda for the approval of the delegates. Mr. A. W. Malmquist, of Chicago, was elected chairman of the Congress.</p>
   <p>Newspapers represented included Svenska Socialisten (The Swedish Socialist), official organ of the Scandinavian Socialists, represented by the editor, J. A. Halden; Gaa Paa (Forward), Minneapolis; and Revnen [The Gap], Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Congress lasted three days, during which time much business was transacted. Twelve Chicago branches were represented: among them the well-known and militant Karl Marx Club, represented by A. W. Malmquist and Thorwald Jensen; and the Scandinavian Socialist Agitation and Propaganda Committee, composed of <pb facs="5423969_1_0894.jpg" n="2"/>N. F. Holm, Steffen J. Christensen and Joel Christensen. As will be remembered, Joel Christensen served five years in Fort Leavenworth because of "militancy," but he and Dr. Carl Sandberg were framed at the trial. That, however, is past history.</p>
