   <p>Our candidate favors measures for the restriction of immigration, says the platform adopted on Thursday.</p>
   <p>Tom Reed will lose nothing by this declaration. Politicians are prone to assume that adopted citizens are indiscriminately opposed to any restriction of foreign immigration; hence they prefer to dodge the question lest they may offend the "foreign vote."</p>
   <p>The politicians are mistaken, and would better save their cowardice for use on some other occasion. Generally speaking, adopted citizens are good citizens and are ready to support any measure which is calculated to promote the common welfare. Look at Ellis Island teeming with thousands upon thousands of ignorant and degraded paupers from southern Europe! Can any <pb facs="5423969_1_0538.jpg" n="2"/>sane man hold that the country will be benefited by admitting people of this class in large numbers?</p>
   <p>This parrot-like chatter about the alleged prejudices of foreign-born citizens is a gratuitous insult and is becoming very tiresome. Let our statesmen and politicians be men and stand for principles like men and they will be respected by all citizens without regard to nationality or place of birth, and will receive such support as they deserve.</p>
   <p>Thomas Brackett Reed has strengthened himself with the great majority of our adopted citizens by the frank statement of his position on the question of immigration.</p>
