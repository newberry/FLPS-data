   <p>In regard to the doctrines preached by this group, we doubt if the final consensus of opinion will be very favorable. Booth's Christianity is an "enmasse" application rather than the Biblical individual regeneration. It is based on an appeal to feelings and emotions rather than to understanding and moral conviction and marks on the lower instinct of mankind by stimulating the desire for noise and sensation.</p>
   <p>That this new method has worked on the masses and enabled the Salvation Army to out-do all other organizations in increased membership is evident. It has also enabled the Army to obtain its horns, drums, tambourines, guitars, banners and uniforms, its knee drill and hand clapping accompaniment to the singing. The system has also affected other organizations who have copied the methods in carrying on revivals; even the staid Church of England has its church army and critical Denmark has its "Kors Haer" (Army of the Cross). These organizations are true copies of the Salvation Army in method and set-up; the only difference being in the uniform and in the fact that they are headed by members of the clergy of the State Church.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0432.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The whole system is a sign of the increasing sensualism of religious movements and of a newer cult that is constantly spreading. It is not a step forward or upward but a reversion toward the old barbarism.</p>
