   <p>Chicago is approaching the limit of delay in the street railway matter. Some of the franchises expire next year and all of them within four years. Unless wise, prompt, and decisive action is had we shall speedily drift into a condition of hopeless chaos. The utter inadequacy of the present service is becoming more apparent every day, and no improvement is to be expected until definite action shall have been taken by the city.</p>
   <p>The City Council has wrestled with the problem for some time. Much good work has been done, and some progress towards a settlement has been made. But progress has been slow, partly for the reason that too much politics has been injected into a question which at best presents many difficulties even when reduced to its simplest proportions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_1089.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The proposition that the forthcoming street railway ordinance be submitted to a vote of the people for approval or rejection, sounds well; and it may work well, or it may work harm. The popular instinct is generally sound on the question of right or wrong. But to expect the average voter to grasp and solve,wisely and well,after a brief and noisy campaign, questions taxing the highest engineering and financial skill, seems well nigh akin to leading the people into temptation. It is to be feared that the demagogue would become the principal popular instructor in such a campaign. Or, if not confused, the voters would hesitate to express an opinion, and the result would be no valid legislation and more delay. In the light of past experiences such an outcome would appear more than probable.</p>
   <p>Let the Council promptly adopt an ordinance on broad and fair lines, safeguarding the rights of the city and the people, and insuring the best service that is to be had, and the great majority of the people will be satisfied <pb facs="5423969_1_1090.jpg" n="3"/>. Hobbyriders and politicians have had their say. We cannot afford to trifle any longer with a matter of such vital interest to Chicago and her people. Let us proceed to business at once.</p>
