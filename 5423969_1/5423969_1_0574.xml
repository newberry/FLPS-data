   <p>Olof E. Ray, prominent Chicago attorney, contributes the following: "Your last issue of Scandia contained an article signed 'An old Republican,' who advises us to continue in the Republican method of handling the trusts. The result of this method is that the big trusts have been split up into smaller sections still ruled by one head, and that instead of holding directors meetings, the managing personnel now gather for afternoon lunches.</p>
   <p>"The prices of Standard Oil products have been raised, and the Standard Oil stocks have reached the highest price in history since the Standard Oil Trust was busted. What, I ask, has been won in the way of benefits to the general public by this side-splitting political farce?</p>
   <p>"The entire maneuver boils down to a drastic change in the bookkeeping system of the monopoly; the play is so obvious that a blind man can feel it with his cane.</p>
   <p>"The Progressive party offers the only safe and sane remedy, while neither <pb facs="5423969_1_0575.jpg" n="2"/>the Republican nor the Democratic party has a single constructive idea to offer. In our Progressive platform we demand the appointment of a Federal commission, with an adequate knowledge of business methods, empowered to act in matters concerning trusts and monopolies in business; this commission to work along the same lines followed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in handling railroad matters. In this manner, monopolies in goods of prime necessity will be done away with, and the head of the trust-serpent crushed without everlasting legal red tape and beating about the bush.</p>
   <p>"Not long ago our railroads set up a cry of failure and bankruptcy because of the cut in passenger rates from three and four cents per mile to two cents per mile, but the trains still run on schedule, the service is just as good, and the roads are making money.</p>
   <p>"The accomplishments of the I. C. C. is ample proof of benefits to be obtained by the appointment of an honest and intelligent group of men to handle the trust question.</p>
   <p>"The Democratic party's hands are tied by their plank, labeled 'State Rights,' <pb facs="5423969_1_0576.jpg" n="3"/>and they can do exactly nothing without discarding it. They are helpless, too, for the reason that Woodrow Wilson is an academician full of untried theories, as compared to Theodore Roosevelt, the practical man and the born fighter."</p>
