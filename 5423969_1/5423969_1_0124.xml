   <p>Much has been written regarding the teaching of the Norwegian language to our children; it has even been suggested we organize our own school for this purpose.</p>
   <p>As a rule, when a student enters high school he usually chooses some foreign language in addition to the rest of his curriculum. In many cases Latin is chosen - a "dead language" - from which he or she later on in life will derive very little benefit. Other languages chosen are German and French. Unless the student comes from a German or French home, where he has been able to acquire some proficiency in either of these languages, the few years in high school will not give him any kind of command over these languages, unless such student should continue his language studies in college.</p>
   <p>Children of Norwegian parentage have as a rule quite some knowledge of Norwegian when they enter high school. Many are able to both read and write it; with such knowledge as a foundation, a student should acquire in comparitively short time, a good command of the Norwegian language, than a student who <pb facs="5423969_1_0125.jpg" n="2"/>tackles an entirely foreign tongue. This knowledge and ability to handle a foreign tongue will be of great practible help, regardless what field of endeavor he chooses, therefore, Norwegian parents should urge their children to choose Norwegian as a study in thehigh school.</p>
   <p>If the Norwegians of Chicago wish to have their language included as a study in the local high schools, they must themselves support this cause. One cannot expect American teachers to boost it; usually such people have no idea of the practical or cultural value of the Norwegian language.</p>
