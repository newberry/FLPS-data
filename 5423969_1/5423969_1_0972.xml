   <p>The Norwegian Republicans held a protest meeting yesterday at 235 Milwaukee Avenue, because the Scandinavian newspapers of Chicago scratched part of the Republican ticket and substituted Democratic candidates in the columns of the aforesaid papers. Many felt incensed, and therefore called a protest meeting. About 120 persons responded. A chorus provided musical entertainment. Peter Backes was named chairman. He criticized the Scandinavian press, which has endeavored to destroy the Republican party in Chicago at a time when the Republican party is making efforts to obtain such a plurality that the South and its ideology would have no chance for survival. The conduct of the Scandinavian press was particularly deplorable, considering that our present municipal administration fired every Swedish and Norwegian office holder. He appealed to the people, to remain forever faithful to the Republican party. We should not be misled by the Swedes because the papers proposed an independent ticket composed of candidates from both parties. It was said the action was taken because <pb facs="5423969_1_0973.jpg" n="2"/>Scandinavians were not represented on the Republican ticket. Such a demand should have been made at the convention when candidates were nominated. As this was not done, no one would be justified in claiming now that the wishes of the people were ignored. This would be no reason to change the ticket.</p>
   <p>Boyeson was the second speaker. He said that no one should forsake the party just because it failed to comply to an individual's wishes. He, for instance, may have favored free trade, but the Republican party preferred a tariff; but that would be no reason for leaving the party. There were many other questions decidedly more important. This should be considered before changing one's affiliation. Such a case was presented here. The action of the Scandinavian press was inexcusable. There papers did not express the true sentiment of the Scandinavians. He regarded as traitors the Scandinavians who would vote the independent [split] ticket at the coming election. The Democratic party would use every chance to win. The impending county election would be of national significance, as the next presidential election would be influenced thereby. The Democrats should not gain the upper hand as long as the South persisted in its <pb facs="5423969_1_0974.jpg" n="3"/>threatening attitude, which disregarded the rights of the whites and blacks alike.</p>
   <p>The speaker then explained why no Scandinavians were nominated. It was because so many Scandinavian candidates were offered and their respective constituents refused to support any man other than their own nominee. The Germans and other nationals acted more sensibly. They came to the convention fully organized, and if one of their men had been nominated, he would have been given support by all factions.</p>
   <p>Gilbert Olsen was the third speaker. He attacked the Scandinavian press vigorously and considered it an insolence that these papers intended to foist a ticket on the Scandinavians which the people did not want. But the Scandinavians were not the kind of people who would vote any sort of ticket advocated by the press.</p>
   <p>Mr. Backen was the next speaker. He said that the Scandinavian press offered a <pb facs="5423969_1_0975.jpg" n="4"/>fusion ticket without having held a political meeting to consider the will of the people. He believed Republicanism was so firmly rooted among the Scandinavians here that none would forsake it. He was of the opinion that, as far as the papers were concerned, in this particular instance the views of the people were not sufficiently considered. But this was not done intentionally.</p>
   <p>By this time, the committee which had been named to draft a resolution had finished its work; the resolution was read to the assembly, which adopted it. The procedure of the Scandinavian press was criticized, and the people were urged to object.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. Matson spoke. He said that the Scandinavian editors did not use their heads. It was expedient under the circumstances to oppose the machinations of these newspapermen. It would make a bad impression if the people who were at the Republican convention and adopted the platform should now withdraw.</p>
   <p>The assembly conveyed the impression that the Norwegians would vote unanimously for the Republican ticket.</p>
