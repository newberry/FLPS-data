   <p>A mass-meeting will be arranged by the Norwegian temperance societies.</p>
   <p>Within the Leif Erikson lodge of the Norwegian I. O. G. T., the question has arisen of late, as to what to do to effect a decrease in the sale of intoxicating liquors on the West Side, and also on the Northwest Side.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, a committee was appointed to prepare the matter. On a motion from this committee, a communication was sent to all the Norwegian temperance societies in the district, asking them to take up the question for study and discussion, to discover, if possible, the best way or ways <pb facs="5423969_1_0267.jpg" n="2"/>of approach. The communication was received sympathetically by the Norwegian I. O. G. T. lodges, and on Thursday, Oct. 3, a mass-meeting will be held in the hall at 915 to 917 W. North Avenue to discuss the subject.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a motion will be presented to select a joint committee, with representatives from all the Norwegian temperance societies, to take further steps in the matter.</p>
   <p>The results of this meeting cannot be predicted. The problem which the Norwegian Good Templars have taken hold of is intricate and difficult.</p>
   <p>But they have shown courage in taking up the matter, and they are sure of having support from many people outside of the temperance groups as well.</p>
