   <p>The free public evening schools are opening tomorrow. They give immigrants a good opportunity for winning a future. The activity of the evening schools fall along three main lines as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Instruction in the language of our country for immigrants who have not mastered this language. These courses are of course chiefly for adults.</p>
   <p>2. A continuation school for boys and girls who for one reason or other had to leave the regular public schools before having completed their courses.</p>
   <p>3. Vocational training in various trades.</p>
   <p>The value of the evening schools is admitted by all. Investigation of the results attained so far show that for society as a whole, the evening schools have been of great importance, but especially so for immigrants.</p>
   <p>An immigrant may have had good training in his homeland, but unless he learns the American language, he cannot make use of his training here.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0069.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even the ordinary laborer has difficulty in finding employment and still greater difficulty in getting decent wages unless he knows our language at least as far as his work is concerned. He must understand the orders given. And experience shows that as a worker qualifies better in English, his chances for better earnings increase.</p>
   <p>At the Norwegian employment office there are cases again and again of young men missing good chances for building a future simply because they do not have command of English.</p>
   <p>Of vocational courses which may be of special value, the following may be noted: Bookkeeping, Stenography, Typewriting, Drawing, Cabinet-making, Housekeeping. Then follows a list of the schools where free instruction is given, evenings.
