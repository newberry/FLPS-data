   <p>"This is your campaign," said Judge Hanecy in addressing the magnificent meeting of the Norwegian Republican Club at Wicker Park Hall, "and no matter how competent and faithful I may be as Mayor of Chicago, I can accomplish nothing unless I have behind me just such a constituency as I now see before me. These meetings are delightful, and they inspire us with the hope that a better day has dawned for our people. But the most enthusiastic meetings will not save us unless we all get out to the polls April 2, and vote the right ticket, and get others to vote it too."</p>
   <p>The constituency Judge Hanecy had before him was made up of Scandinavians. If they were less demonstrative than some of the many audiences he has addressed during this memorable campaign, they were probably more earnest listeners. And they may be relied upon to vote and to vote right. As taxpayers they have contributed their share of the vast funds that have <pb facs="5423969_1_0953.jpg" n="2"/>been squandered or stolen by the Harrison administration; as citizens they have suffered in common with all other good citizens under the reign of thuggery, theft, and vice which has made Chicago a safe place for criminals, but unsafe for honest people. They will not fail to do their part in redeeming the city. Look to the Scandinavian precincts for the heaviest blows to gang rule.</p>
