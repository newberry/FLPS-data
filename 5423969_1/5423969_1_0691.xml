   <p>It must be obvious to everybody that it is out of the question for American shipowners to compete with Europeans who operate their ships twenty-five to fifty per cent cheaper; and it is this difference in sailors' wages, building costs, etc., which the country is requested to pay in subsidies.</p>
   <p>The advocates of subsidies assert that many more American sailors will find employment, and that this will make up for what the country pays in subsidies. But this is far from being certain. Americans will not hire out as sailors as long as they can make more money in other lines of business. American shipowners will hardly pay higher wages than they are compelled to, and if they can get foreign sailors a trifle cheaper than natives, they will probably take them, and the majority of the sailors on American steamers will be foreigners, as now. All that we should get for the five or ten millions a year expended <pb facs="5423969_1_0692.jpg" n="2"/>would be the satisfaction of seeing American goods shipped under the American flag.</p>
   <p>While protection may build up the manufacturing industry and other interests for the home market, we have never heard that a high protective tariff will enable American factories to produce goods for European and other foreign markets. We do not believe that many politicians would dare to advocate this kind of protection.</p>
   <p>But to subsidize American steamships in order to enable them to compete with European ships in the European trade is no more absurd than to impose high tariffs in order to help American factories gain a market in Europe. It may not be impossible; modern engineering may even compel the stream to run uphill. The question is merely whether you are willing to pay the price.</p>
