  <body>
   <p>Now we have a hired girls' union, a union the policy of which, so it avers, is to fight for the rights--it rhymes--of the poor downtrodden cooks, maids, nurses, housemen, gardeners, etc., working in private houses. This union has been organized by a group of Scandinavians. We have had the pleasure of reading the minutes of the union, in which we found the grievances of the members recorded. Below we give you a few; they are of high literary value!</p>
   <p>"Because always we serve Herring and Potatoes, I am leaving my job, I am afraid to get potatoe sickness, where the missus wants more work, less friendly association. "Sine Carlson."</p>
   <p>"To Grievance Committee: The master is fine, good, and easy to get along with; but the mistress she is a hex [Witch]. I quit. "Anne Larson."</p>
   <p>"Committee: The reason I quit is that the master is very big go-getter, he is <pb facs="5423969_1_0746.jpg" n="2"/>always pushing and pinching me all over. And the son, now he starts from the same beginning. For the second time, I quit. "Josefine Graven."</p>
   <p>This union seems to be composed entirely of Scandinavian members; if so, why don't they have a class in English? Then one might get the full meaning of all the letters written to the grievance committee.</p>
