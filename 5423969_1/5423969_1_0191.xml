   <p>The festival at the opening of the Norwegian Lutheran Seminary last night was the gala event of the year. Seminaries, colleges, synods, and churches throughout the entire nation were represented. The festivities began at ten o'clock with a procession of the faculty and the invited guests..... The president of the Seminary, Reverend N. F. Weitser, D. D., LL. D., gave the address of welcome. The financial secretary, Reverend H. W. Roth, D. D., gave a brief sketch of the history of the Seminary as follows:</p>
   <p>The Seminary, now twenty years old, used to be located at Clark Street and Sheffield Avenue. The ground on which the Seminary was built was a gift from Reverend William A. Passavant, D. D., who also had the honor of planning the buildings.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the general council in 1869, it was decided to build a <pb facs="5423969_1_0192.jpg" n="2"/>seminary in Chicago..... The Seminary was dedicated on October 1, 1891.</p>
   <p>Reverend Samuel Wagenhals made the dedication speech on that occasion. He spoke, in part, as follows:</p>
   <p>"We do now set apart these buildings, with their appurtenances and grounds, to be the Theological Seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Chicago, Illinois; and we do solemnly devote and dedicate them to be sacred to its faith and its uses. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen."</p>
   <p>Professor Alfred Ramsen then read an address given at the dedication of the oldest seminary in America, at Gettysburg, in 1826.....</p>
