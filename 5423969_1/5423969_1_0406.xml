   <p>"Editor of Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>"I see there is at least one who appreciates our worth, and I hereby render Mr. Thompson my thanks. Many seem to think that the schoolma'ms are not of much consequence outside of the schoolroom; but let them try us once, and we shall see.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Thompson thinks there is a lack of education among the girls. I think the girls are just as well educated in my part of the world. I do not think there are many girls growing up now, even in the country, who cannot both read and write.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0407.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Mr. Thompson says that a boy with reason has a right to expect a well-educated wife. But a girl with a good education demands a husband on her own level, and she has a perfect right to. Why should she marry a blockhead? If she should be so unfortunate she will regret it all her life.</p>
   <p>"We schoolma'ms have no use for boys without education. I am glad there are not enough schoolma'ms to go around. Mr. Thompson appreciates our worth; but at the same time he thinks that any boy with reason has a right to demand one of us. Schoolma'ms, beware!</p>
   <p>"I do not think there are very many schoolma'ms who are candidates, because they can make their own living anyway.</p>
   <p>"A Norwegian Schoolma'm."</p>
