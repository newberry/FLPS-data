   <p>The tax assessment in Greater New York for 1909 presents us with the following millionaires: Andrew Carnegie, $5,000,000; William K. Vanderbilt, $1,000,000; John D. Rockefeller, $2,500,000; Clifford V. Brokaw, $1,500,000; Ida Hagler, $2,000,000; Lilla Gilbert, $1,500,000; Margaret O. Sage, $5,000,000; Florence G. Sotterwhite, $1,000,000; Alice G. Vanderbilt $1,000,000; Gladys Vanderbilt, $1,000,000.</p>
   <p>Everybody knows that the above statements of wealth are incorrect. New York has a far greater number of millionaires, and the rich people mentioned own far more than they have reported. Here we find, as elsewhere in the country, that the people who own the most are the worst tax dodgers. If the rich <pb facs="5423969_1_0611.jpg" n="2"/>people in this country paid their proportionate part of the tax burdens, then would all the cities and all other municipalities have plenty of money for their undertakings, and the large fortunes would not grow so dangerously large as is the case now.</p>
   <p>Only ten millionaires in New York, four men and six women! This proves among other things that the women are not as devoid of a sense of duty as are the men. The God-fearing John D. Rockefeller owns no more than one half as much as Margaret O. Sage! Things must have moved rather badly for the old man of late. Of course he has an income of forty million dollars per year merely from his shares in the Standard Oil Company, and besides he is probably earning a few pennies here and there on odd investments. But his report to the tax assessors shows that his slight income does not help him much. Our sympathy to the poor old man!</p>
