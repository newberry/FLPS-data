   <p>The Prohibition paper, Reform, Eau Claire, Wisconsin, writes:</p>
   <p>"Last week the Skandinaven brought a somewhat coarse article against Woolley and Dickie, The New Voice, and the Prohibitionists in general. Not the slightest touch of argument is to be found in the article, and with the exception of a plain falsehood to the effect that Messrs. Woolley and Dickie have been expelled from the Methodist church (or from a Methodist conference, as the paper has it) there is nothing to take hold on. The article simply consists of coarse expressions and it shows how low a paper may sink when the question is to attack political opponents. This attack by the use of falsehoods against Woolley and Dickie gives us occasion to mention the church attachments of these two men. Since Skandinaven made its attack, we have investigated the matter carefully, so that we know whereof we speak.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0353.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Professor Samuel Dickie is a member of the Methodist Church. He was a lay delegate to the past general conference held in Chicago; was chairman of the temperance committee, and at present is a member of the standing temperance committee of the Methodist Church. The assertion that Mr. Dickie was expelled from the Methodist Church is contemptible nonsense. No layman is more highly considered in the Methodist Church than Professor Dickie. Since, in an earlier article, Skandinaven designated Mr. Dickie as "Reverend", it may be well to state that before Mr. Dickie was chosen chairman of the national committee of the Prohibition party he was professor of Astronomy at Michigan State University; in other words, he is not a minister.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Woolley is not and never was a member of the Methodist Church. After being converted in New York about thirteen years ago, he joined Dr. Deem's church, an independent organization, although Dr. Deem was a Methodist. On account of this people used to call Mr. Woolley a Methodist, and as his parents were Methodists.....he permitted people to think him a Methodist too....</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0354.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"But what about a paper such as Skandinaven which permits itself to lie about an opponent in order to hurt him. Will the paper apologize? We shall see. If it does not, then we can but conclude that a paper which is willing to lie for one purpose may do it for other purposes too, and can no longer be counted a reliable paper.</p>
   <p>"Skandinaven tells us that Mr. McKinley (in contrast to Mr. John G. Wodley) never has been sleeping in the doorways, either in Minneapolis or in other cities. But Skandinaven seems to be forgetting that it was while he was a Republican that Mr. Woolley slept in doorways--not while a Prohibitionist. When Mr. Woolley had finished sleeping in doorways, he had also finished with the Republican party. The license policy of that party causes some citizens to land in the doorways, or worse....But how Skandinaven can blame us Prohibitionists for the fact that some Republicans are sleeping in doorways--that is beyond our comprehension."</p>
   <p>Skandinaven is going to look into these matters. The "lies" which Reform <pb facs="5423969_1_0355.jpg" n="4"/>has found in Skandinaven are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Mr. Dickie has not been a minister; instead he used to be a professor.</p>
   <p>2. Mr. Woolley is not a Methodist. To be sure, he has moved among the Methodists and has permitted people to think him a Methodist; in fact he is a Congregationalist.</p>
   <p>3. Messrs. Dickie and Woolley have not been expelled from any Methodist conference.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven had its information on this point from a source which it believed reliable, and which it considers more reliable than Reform. But if, on investigating the matter, Skandinaven finds itself in error, then it will correct its statement. Such, then, were the "nasty lies".</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0356.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As the reader will see these assertions concern merely side issues. It does not matter much whether Skandinaven did make mistakes here. Why did Reform overlook the main issue, and why does the paper accuse Skandinaven of attacking the Prohibitionists in general? The paper knows that Skandinaven has simply attacked the Prohibitionist leaders and the methods of electioneering of the latter. The attitude of Skandinaven here may be clearly seen from the perusal of the following section of the article criticized by Reform, which that paper forgot to quote:</p>
   <p>"The Prohibitionist party, that self-appointed representative of all that is pure in home and in society, is conducting an election campaign on such a low level that it would constitute a disgrace in any country....These two men, Messrs. Dickie and Woolley, the latter the presidential candidate of the Party, are defaming the president of our country as if he were the worst among criminals. They even surpass the Democrats in distorting what the Republican party has done and is now doing. Of late they have begun flinging <pb facs="5423969_1_0357.jpg" n="6"/>their filth against the whole Methodist Church because a majority of the leaders in that church are supporting Mr. McKinley."</p>
