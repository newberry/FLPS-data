   <p>The school board of Chicago is considering the possibility and advisability of providing facilities for the study of the Norwegian language in our high schools. There has been quite a bit of publicity and effort to bring about the establishment of classes in Norwegian, and a special meeting has been called for next Friday, at the offices of the school board, to discuss the question fully. Mrs. Young and Mr. Sethness will be the main figures in the discussion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sethness represents the Norwegian colony of Chicago, having recently been appointed to membership on the school board by Mayor Harrison. He is very interested in seeing that our Norwegian language is placed on a par with German, French, Spanish and Polish, all of which are being taught in certain high schools.</p>
   <p>The beauty and value of Norwegian literature and art cannot be properly appreciated without a knowledge of the language, and translations are otherwise extremely weak.</p>
