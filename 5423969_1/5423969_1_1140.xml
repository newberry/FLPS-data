   <p>The Scandinavian voters in Chicago are anything but pleased with many of the actions at City Hall. Mayor Busse's latest appointments have further opened their eyes to the fact that they belong in the "not-wanted" class, and several interested Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes have come to realize that sitting still is not the way to make their influence properly felt in Chicago. The Scandinavians constitute about twenty-five percent of the voters in Chicago. They have, however, not played a role proportionate to their number. The men at City Hall have regularly found it convenient to overlook the Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>The following figures show the strength of the Scandinavians in the various wards:</p>

   <p>In spite of these 51,788 votes the Scandinavians have but one man in the City Council, none on the Board of Education, none on the Library Board, and none <pb facs="5423969_1_1143.jpg" n="4"/>on the Board of Local Improvements.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians have come from countries where graft is unknown, where corruption in public life does not exist. They have seen with sorrow and disgust how carelessness and waste are rampant in the city government.</p>
   <p>They believe that a better government could be achieved if they made fuller use of their right to vote.</p>
   <p>As we know, most of the Scandinavians are Republicans, and it is within the Republican party that they must make their influence felt.</p>
   <p>Many believe that the time has come for the Scandinavians to act in a manner that will open the eyes of the professional politicians to their strength and their right. These men believe that, in order for the Scandinavians to show what they can accomplish toward better city government, the Scandinavians ought to put a Scandinavian into the foremost place in the city government, a <pb facs="5423969_1_1144.jpg" n="5"/>man who can fill this place adequately.</p>
   <p>The matter has been discussed back and forth for a while, privately and at meetings of lodges and other societies, until some people from Austin, lead by Dr. J. M. Axelson, took the initiative and proposed the nomination of Congressman Frederik Lundin. These men believe that a man of the experience and a bility of Mr. Lundin would have a better chance of being elected than anybody else who would be available. To emphasize this, they point to the fact that at the last election Congressman Lundin received more votes in the Seventh District than any other candidate for office, not excepting President Taft. Although the Democrats used all kinds of tricks to gain votes for their candidate, Mr. Lundin received more votes than any previous congressman in that district.</p>
   <p>The history of Congressman Lundin is well known to the readers of the Scandinaven. He is a man who has gained his position through intense work. He is of Swedish descent, and Norwegians and Danes will surely support him if he is the candidate of the Republican party for Mayor.</p>
