   <p>The most Important Element in Culture is Culture of the Heart: -</p>
   <p>Cultured is frequently the designation attributed to every one who employ "cultured" language, is nicely dressed and behaves in accordance with the accepted rules. And yet, this is at best merely a surface culture.</p>
   <p>Next, he is usually called cultered who has attained the state of a trained mind, who has acquired facility of expertness among one or more lines. He has gained culture of the mind or thought.</p>
   <p>The most important element or factor in the human being is, however, neither the exterior, or surface, nor the capacity for thinking or reasoning. The most basic elements in man are his feeling or emotions, and his will. The most important culture consists therefore in the training of these elements or capacities for the good, the beautiful, the just. This is the culture of the heart.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0230.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The present era is so greatly occupied by appearances, the mere forms; and the question of the culture of the heart is in danger of being forgotten. But in hours of quietude the question pushes to the fore, "What is the use of all this struggle?" And the answer comes through the stillness, "It is only to gain pleasure and advantage for myself!" But to gain pleasure and advantage, only a minimum of either thinking or niceties of forms is required. And for this reason we find that in the midst of the relentless scurrying for "culture" a condition of retrogression both as to thinking and as to social forms is present today.</p>
   <p>The "cultured" people of our era pride themselves in understanding art and literature, and yet their understanding here is inferior to that of earlier generations. To the large majority, of the "cultured" people of today, the great works of art are closed books. Even if they know the languages in which the works were written, they do not understand the contents of the books. Ibsen is the heaviest thinker they dare tackle......</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0231.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The European culture of old was nurtured under the influence of Christianity. The bible has been the book of study for the giants of culture, Luther, Shakespeare, Goethe, Darwin, even Byron..........The individual of today needs to follow these people. He needs to train under the leadership of the "the fairest among the sons of men" getting knowledge from the "book of books." Then he may attain to the stature of possessing the cultured heart........</p>
   <p>Many of the so-called common people, men and women in the plain walks of life have gained insight in life and practical wisdom by the means here indicated. But many of our wealthy people for all their study and travel, remain on the level of the mere surface culture, not understanding that which they have learned.</p>
