   <p>The Norwegian Republican Club of the Twenty-eighth Ward meets tonight at Mewick Hall, Milwaukee Avenue and Rockwell Street. The Club has not met during the summer because there has been nothing of importance in local politics. Now fall is here with the customary political upheavals.</p>
   <p>The laws of the Republican organization in Cook County require that:</p>
   <p>1. There is to be one Republican club in every precinct.</p>
   <p>2. Election of officers in these precinct clubs is to take place on the third Tuesday of November each year.</p>
   <p>3. In order that one may have the right to vote at the elections in the precinct clubs it is necessary to have been a member of the club for at least one month preceding the election.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_1028.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(Since the third Tuesday in November this year falls on November 19, it is necessary to have joined the club not later than October 19 (that is, tomorrow).</p>
   <p>4. A member of the precinct club is automatically a member of the ward club also.</p>
   <p>5. The election in the ward clubs takes place on the last Tuesday in November, that is, one week after the election in the precinct clubs.</p>
   <p>All of this should be kept carefully in mind by those who want to see our government in the hands of the best people possible. Go to the secretary of your precinct club today, or tomorrow at the latest, and join the club so that there can be no valid objections against your right to vote in the club. Then be sure to be present at the club election on November 19.</p>
   <p>Do not forget that participation in this part of our public life is as <pb facs="5423969_1_1029.jpg" n="3"/>important, if not more so, than is participation in the final election of public officials. When precinct clubs and ward organizations in Chicago are administered by the best people of our citizenry, then good representation and good public officials will become a matter of course. As long, however, as the majority of the voters keep aloof from this kind of organization it will be of but little use to complain that frequently the public officials are not of a desirable type.</p>
   <p>Every American citizen should, therefore, join his precinct club and his ward club; in these organizations he should do the best work which he is capable of doing. If a citizen keeps aloof from these clubs, he cannot truthfully claim to have done his full duty as a citizen.</p>
