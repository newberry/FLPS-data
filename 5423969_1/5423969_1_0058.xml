  <body>
   <p>The editorial in Skandinaven last Sunday smells of both powder and bullets. Now, we are willing to admit that when the editor of Skandinaven goes on the warpath he is usually right, and up there in the peaceful editorial office one may detect more than one scalp. Once in a while, however, even the best may make a mistake, including the editor of Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>Like all citizens whose children attend the public schools, I am interested in reports of the acts of the Board of Education; I am also interested in criticisms of the acts of the Board.</p>
   <p>As we know, the Board of Education consists of twenty-one members, of which the belligerent group, the so-called Dunne members, constitutes a minority of <pb facs="5423969_1_0059.jpg" n="2"/>five. In a body like the Chicago Board of Education, whose members are not elected by the people, but are appointed by the Mayor, it is certainly well to have an active minority ready to scrutinize the undertakings of the Board. And when such a minority consists of only five members, as against a majority of sixteen, it would seem impossible for this minority "to prevent the Board from executing necessary business" if the majority members are reasonably aware of their duty and are present at the meetings.</p>
   <p>It was the present minority on the Board that started the attack on the Board of Education book trust. This trust compelled the parents of Chicago school children to pay high prices for the same books which, in the neighboring state of Indiana, were sold at considerably lower prices. The committee set up by the Board of Education to take care of this matter consists, as is known, of Mr. John J. Sonsteby, chairman, and Messrs. Schneider, Dawes, Kohn, and Urion.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0060.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Further, it was the protests of the same minority against a five-year contract with the Commonwealth Edison Company for electric light and power which led the Board to study the contract more closely. The drainage canal board awakened the hope that in the near future it could supply all the schools with electricity at a rate of two cents per kilowatt-hour, while the contract with the Commonwealth Edison Company stipulated a price of three cents per kilowatt-hour. The final result was that the new contract with the Commonwealth Edison Company, effective after the expiration of the old contract, may be terminated at any time on sixty days' notice; the Board is no longer compelled to bind itself for a period of five years to a contract stipulating a high price [for electricity]. Thus, the Board of Education will be able in the future to buy electric light and power from the drainage canal board whenever this should prove advantageous.</p>
   <p>This, then is part of what the "bickering" minority has accomplished. When Skandinaven complains that the leader of the minority in the Board of Education <pb facs="5423969_1_0061.jpg" n="4"/>is a Norwegian-American, and especially when the paper refers to the last [Board] meeting, which only nine of the sixteen majority members found it convenient to attend, so that the meeting lacked a quorum when four of the five minority members left the hall, I believe Skandinaven has pronounced a judgment which it is unable to defend.</p>
   <p>As appears from the statements in the Skandinaven, the minority insisted that the report from the previous meeting was incomplete, since the original committee report on the Commonwealth Edison contract was not included in the report of said meeting. When the majority refused to accede to the minority's request for the inclusion of the contract, four of the minority members left the meeting. Mr. Sonsteby did not leave, however, and, as appears from the reports in the various papers, he even tried on request to persuade the other members to remain and take part in the business of the Board.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0062.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Sonsteby was appointed a member of the Board of Education as a representative of the Chicago Federation of Labor. He was not appointed because of any support on the part of his countrymen. But his appointment certainly does not hurt the Norwegians....</p>
