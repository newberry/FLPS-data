   <p>Some of the ablest and severest denunciations of the crime of Czolgosz have appeared in Scandinavian newspapers. The Skandinaven holds that the question of whether the assassin had accomplices or not is a secondary matter. It holds that the creed of anarchy is in itself a conspiracy--that anarchy seeks the life of society and should be met with the weapons of war rather than with those of peace. In the opinion of the Skandinaven only the swift sternness and vigor of "war justice" will afford society full protection from the menace of assassination and anarchy. These utterances are typical of Scandinavians everywhere. The hardy and industrious men and women whose ancestors were bred among fjords and mountains of the Scandinavian peninsula have no sympathy with lawlessness in any form. There are no Danish, Swedish, or Norwegian anarchists. These people have been lovers of freedom since the days of the vikings and Norsemen, but the insane idea that there can be liberty without law or government never has appealed to them. The habits of industry and of <pb facs="5423969_1_0904.jpg" n="2"/>sound and sensible thinking acquired on the rugged soil where the race was reared, have fitted these people to become valuable American citizens. Their ingrained love of order is among their most constant and conspicuous traits. Any community in which Scandinavians predominate is pretty sure to be free from mob violence or any other infractions of the law on a large scale. Anarchist agitators can find no encouragement among the immigrants from that part of Europe or among their descendants.</p>
