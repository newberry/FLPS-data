  <body>
   <p>We are now experiencing the coldest and in many ways the most difficult winter in many years. Cold and unemployment are causing great suffering and privation among the poorer people, and the unemployment phase presents a real problem. We have already no less than 125,000 unemployed men and many of these are homeless, while the municipal lodging house can only accomodate 400, and at night long lines of hungry men await their turn to receive their hand-out of bread and a cup of warm coffee at the free coffee wagons. There is certainly something radically wrong with a social set-up <pb facs="5423969_1_0853.jpg" n="2"/>that permits such conditions to exist.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison and the city council have appointed a commission to investigate conditions and to determine the causes of this excessive unemployment throughout Chicago. We cannot but think that unlimited private ownership has failed, and that the present unemployment problem is a direct result of it.</p>
   <p>Our Norwegian colony is much interested in the matter and will join the entire city in thanksgiving if the commission accomplishes the task of locating the real responsibility for such a crisis.</p>
