   <p>A very sad tragedy is the garment strike in Chicago. The usual business activities of important lines of industry are paralyzed, thousands of people who need work and crave it are forced to remain idle, and their homes are dark and cheerless under a pall of misery and want. When the strikers march through the streets, the people at large get glimpses of the privations these men and women are suffering: the wan, hopeless faces of underfed mothers, the frail bodies of overworked girls, and the sinister gleams in the eyes of desperate men from a picture that must needs appeal to all who feel for their fellow men, a picture appalling in its portents to all who can see and think. And yet, the most heart-rending sights are not seen in public, but in the barren, desolate homes where children shiver from cold and cry for a crumb of bread.</p>
   <p>Mayor Busse will make another attempt to end the strike by arbitration. That is well and good. As matters stand, arbitration is probably the only road to a reasonably fair settlement of this deplorable contest, and the city government <pb facs="5423969_1_0790.jpg" n="2"/>should use its good offices to help restore normal conditions to the garment industry. Everything within reason should be done to bring the contending parties into line for arbitration. Once the controversy is submitted to the arbitration of a body of public-spirited men, a fairly satisfactory adjustment may be looked for, and peace will be restored--for a time at least.</p>
   <p>However, the garment workers' walkout is a fresh and forceful illustration of the self-evident truth that the time for arbitration in labor disputes is before the breach, not after. In other words, the best remedy for the ills that follow walkouts and lockouts is not arbitration, but conciliation and mediation. Prevention is also better than the cure in treating ills of the body politic. To compel contestants inflamed with passions of strife, and spurred on by false pride, to make peace is very difficult and often impossible, and if it be forced upon them the peace thus established is not likely to be lasting. But to nip a quarrel in the bud is comparatively easy, and, moreover, the adjustment of relations is then left in the hands of the parties directly concerned; prejudice is allayed; peace is maintained; and strife, with its attendant ills <pb facs="5423969_1_0791.jpg" n="3"/>of bad blood, losses, and misery, is prevented.</p>
   <p>Conciliation and mediation interfere less than does arbitration with a man's right to sell his labor or run his business to suit himself. Society cannot say to employer and employed, "Thou shalt not quarrel". But it can and should say to them, "Thou shalt not quarrel without cause," and it may properly compel them to invoke the peacemaking agency and aid of disinterested parties and public opinion, before they are permitted to start an industrial war. Practical provision for compulsory conciliation and mediation would prevent most labor controversies, and make it unnecessary to resort to compulsory arbitration. No time should be lost in providing this most effective of safeguards of industrial stability and social peace.</p>
