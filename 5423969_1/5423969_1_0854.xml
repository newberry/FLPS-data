   <p>The youth is often confused when asked: What trade or profession do you want to take up? Most young fellows seem to want to learn a trade, while the young women usually want to become teachers.</p>
   <p>The first thing a young man should do is to find out just what trade or, profession he would like. Is it overcrowded? What are the qualifications? How much money can be made? I have personally worked as a smith, as a painter, as a carpenter, and as a mason. Now, what did I find out about these trades? First, every one of them is seasonal; second, each is fairly well paid; third, each involves fairly pleasant outdoor work.</p>
   <p>Some of our city youth, may want to be farmers; as a profession it is one of the most healthful, but the pleasures are few, if any.</p>
   <p>The scale of wages varies. Carpenter work pays from a dollar to a dollar <pb facs="5423969_1_0855.jpg" n="2"/>and a half per day, other trades pay in proportion. There is plenty of work and plenty of opportunities. Shops, factories, and stores are always hiring; the building trades, the railroads, the streetcars, and even lake shipping are in need of men; but the main thing is, pick the work for which you are best suited.</p>
   <p>I want to sound a note of warning to the women who seek work in department stores; the wage is small, the hours long, and there is no future. One thing you must think about: What future is there in certain jobs? Look for promotion, and you will be a success.</p>
