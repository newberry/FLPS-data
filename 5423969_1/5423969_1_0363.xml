   <p>Editor of Skandinaven.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: A writer in the Skandinaven of October 6, 1897, thinks that girls ought to be glad to associate with boys who drink and use tobacco. I think that Christian girls ought not to associate with young men who make fools of themselves for others. Do you really think that young girls, sixteen years old, and old maids care so much for all the boys who come and see them and are drunk so that the alcohol smell comes ten miles ahead of them?</p>
   <p>I'11 just tell you what kind of a husband I would have. He shall not drink liquor nor use tobacco and be a fair dancer, because I like dancing myself. And he must be neat in dress and always polite.</p>
   <p>Sten Berg says that Christian girls ought not to use corsets. But I say that <pb facs="5423969_1_0364.jpg" n="2"/>when they do not lace they can wear corsets. I think Mr. Berg does not know very much, or else he is too smart to talk about the boys. There are some boys who lace just as much as girls. If he did not know it before he will know it now.</p>
