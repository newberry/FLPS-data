   <p>The special committee appointed by the Chicago Federation of Labor to report on the proposal for a new charter for the city presented a long report to the Federation at the latter's meeting last Sunday. In this report the charter is attacked from every side. According to the report there is nothing in the new charter which the Federation of Labor can support; the new proposal is simply the old charter rehashed and is inconsequential and devoid of sense and contradictory to the basic principles of self-government. The aldermen, says the report, will be elected for four years under the new charter, and this will give them plenty of time to execute whatever rascality their bosses may find profitable to them. The division of the city into wards is characterized as a rotten gerrymander, giving thirty-two wards to one political party, fourteen to another, and four to the people. The mayor's power under the charter is described as monarchical.</p>
   <p>Other points of the charter found fault with by the Federation are its <pb facs="5423969_1_0770.jpg" n="2"/>provisions concerning civil service, taxation, and the school committee.</p>
   <p>The Federation resolved to send representatives to the meeting to be held on this coming Sunday by the Jefferson Club, at which meeting the intention is to select a large committee to lead the opposition against the charter.</p>
