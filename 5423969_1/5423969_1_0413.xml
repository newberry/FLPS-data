   <p>A perusal of the department for the Scandinavian youth reveals the fact that our young people take much interest in social questions. This is well and should be encouraged as much as possible by parents.</p>
   <p>The greatest of all social questions is that of marriage. The majority of the young people of our commonwealth and of the world enter the state of matrimony to live either an ideal life of happiness and bliss, or to drag out a miserable existence in what might be termed an earthly hell. This being true, the young people cannot be too frequently urged to consider and reconsider the subject which is of so great importance to their future well-being, before it is too late. A vast number of homes all over the land are not as they ought to be, as a glance at the life of many married couples will <pb facs="5423969_1_0414.jpg" n="2"/>reveal. There we find daily fuss and fume, and much serious trouble. Now, why is this? Is it not because genuine love did not predominate during the engagement, much less after marriage, or because they, previous to their marriage, did not become really acquainted with one another? Certainly.</p>
   <p>The writer has witnessed cases in which so-called shrewd parents brought about a union of their son and daughter for the sake of worldly gain. Resistance may have made itself apparent, but the strong will of the parent soon overcame that. But with what result? An unhappy union, in which the misery and tears greatly eclipsed the financial gain. In other cases the young beauty, fearing that she may become an old maid--which in her opinion is something terrible--will accept the first young man who offers himself, although she does not love him.</p>
   <p>Therefore this advice: Under no circumstances should you enter the matrimonial state when love is not present. Furthermore, do not let your affections <pb facs="5423969_1_0415.jpg" n="3"/>get the better of your reason. Study the character of your love so as to know all of his or her traits, and if you find things which you think would be unendurable when in daily contact with them, follow the dictates of your reason and do not let your affections lead you blindly into misery. Your thoughts will sooner or later center around someone who possesses the qualities of a more suitable mate, and you will forget your former object of admiration.</p>
   <p>If the young people were more careful in the selection of their life partners, there would be more happy homes in our glorious land.</p>
   <p>It may be said that it is not easy to brave the battle of life singlehanded, but in most cases it is much easier to do so than to sail on the matrimonial sea with one who falls short of the imagined ideal.</p>
