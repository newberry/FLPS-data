<title level="a">THE TRACTION QUESTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial in English)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The followers of Carter Harrison present but one argument in support of his re-election: his record on the traction question. What is this record? Has he enforced the existing laws against the traction companies? Has he secured a cent for the city from them? Has he compelled them to abate the intolerable nuisance of overcrowded cars? Has he done anything else to secure better service for the people? No, his supporters will admit he has done none of these things, but he has saved the streets by his firm opposition to pernicious franchises.</p>
   <p>Who were the most ardent champions of these franchises? Was it not the very men who put Harrison in the City Hall and have kept him there? Yes, that has to be admitted. And who blocked the unsatisfactory legislation? Was it <pb facs="5423969_1_1104.jpg" n="2"/>not the better element of the Council made up of a majority of Republicans and a minority of Democrats who are not of the Burke-Harrison machine? This too is undeniable.</p>
   <p>The truth is that Mayor Harrison has unblushingly appropriated the credit for what others have done in this matter. He has done nothing himself to further a desirable settlement of the traction question, but he has managed to use it as a means of advancing his personal interests. His traction record is a fabric woven by a clique of Harrison shouters, and he struts and poses before the people in the marvelous garment, like the emperor of the fairy tale in his new suit. The courtiers vied with one another in praising the wonderful suit until a little child, too innocent to be deceived, exclaimed: "But he has nothing on him, he is naked!" The plain people of Chicago have, likewise, found out at last that the record about which they have heard so much does not exist. The true Harrison record is one of duplicity and deception, as is forcibly illustrated in the present campaign. The same machine that nominated <pb facs="5423969_1_1105.jpg" n="3"/>Harrison has dictated a series of aldermanic nominations that could not have been worse. While Mr. Harrison is posing as the people's champion, the whole power of his machine is used to elect a Council that would sell everything, including the City Hall.</p>
   <p>The common-sense view of the traction question as it presents itself to the honest independent voters is this:</p>
   <p>We have nothing to expect from Harrison. He has done nothing except to play politics for four years; he has not even enforced existing laws against the traction companies. If he has deceived us in the past, why should we believe him now? Victory for Harrison would mean the election of a corrupt council; and even if his intentions were the best he would be powerless to effect a good settlement.</p>
   <p>Judge Hanecy knows the laws and how to enforce them. His election would give <pb facs="5423969_1_1106.jpg" n="4"/>us a strong and honest man for Mayor and a better Council. His decision in the Rogers Park water case, now affirmed by the Supreme Court of the land, shows him to be on the side of the people in their struggle with public service corporations. That decision is his record and guide in the matter of the traction problem. He could not disregard it if he would, nor would he if he could. It is a fixed precedent, a firm bulwark for the protection of the rights of the people in Chicago and all other cities. He has promised a prompt, just, and fair settlement. That is what the people want, and we have every reason to believe that he will be able to keep his word. His platform is all right, and he has the ability, force, and independence necessary to compel the traction companies to come to terms. If he entertains political aspirations, so much the better. While a policy of obstruction has been to the political advantage of Harrison, Judge Hanecy can win public favor only by demonstrating his ability for prompt and wise construction.</p>
   <p>That is the situation and its possibilities. The path of the independent voter <pb facs="5423969_1_1107.jpg" n="5"/>is plain. He must come to the rescue of Chicago. The ambitions of puny politicians must no longer be permitted to obstruct her progress. A speedy settlement of the traction question on just and broad lines is a matter of life and death to the city. Chicago owes her existence and rapid growth largely to her superior transportation facilities. Modern rapid transit will stop her progress unless she promptly secures the very best and cheapest service within her own boundaries. This is no longer a question of merely saving the streets; it is a question of saving Chicago.</p>
