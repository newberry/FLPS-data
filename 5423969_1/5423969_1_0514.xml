   <p>The Luther College Club of Chicago held a festival in the Auditorium, in honor of the men and women graduates of the College.</p>
   <p>O. W. Torrison, the chairman of the evening, opened the festival with a few words, welcoming those present. The first speaker was professor Larsen, who spoke about the success of the College. He mentioned that twenty-three were graduating and two hundred and sixty were left; these were expected to graduate in the fall. The college has produced one hundred and thirty ministers, fifty-five teachers and a great number of lawyers, doctors, editors, etc. Reverend A. Bredesen spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"I have not had the honor of writing the history of the Norwegian pioneers; but I may say that I have lived that history. My earliest recollections <pb facs="5423969_1_0515.jpg" n="2"/>cluster around men and things in a struggling frontier settlement in central Wisconsin, more than forty years ago. I have known the Norwegian pioneer long and well, and in my appreciation of him and regard for him, I yield to no one.</p>
   <p>"It is meet and proper that the Norwegian pioneer should have recognition at a festive gathering of the loyal sons of Luther College. Our Alma Mater and her alumni owe him a great debt of honor and gratitude. Who was it that thirty-five years ago, in a frontier hamlet, called our Alma Mater into existence? Not, I trow, some multimillionaire in the East, some merchant prince, coal baron or oil king, but the horny-handed Norwegian pioneer on the prairies and backwoods of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota. Who, but the Norwegian pioneer, has been the best friend and patron that our Alma Mater ever had? His good will was for many years her only endearment. Very little of material or moral support did the struggling college receive from any other source. The Norwegian pioneer of the past and the present has contributed cheerfully and liberally from his hard earnings to establish, equip, and support our Alma Mater.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0516.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He has sent hundreds of thousands of his brightest boys to fill her classes. Luther College is the college of the Norwegian pioneer, and stands today, and will ever stand, a noble monument of his sincere devotion and heroic endeavor in the cause of "Scientia vera et fides pura" [True knowledge and pure faith].</p>
   <p>"The Norwegian pioneer deserves honorable recognition also at the hand of the whole American people, for the splendid service which he has done in the advancement of civilization throughout the West and Northwest. If there is anything to which Americans of Norwegian birth may well point with pride, it is the Norwegian pioneer and his achievements. I do not know that the Norwegian-American has been a conspicuous and dismal failure in any respect--unless it be as a Democratic campaign shouter. His record as a thrifty, law-abiding, intelligent, and patriotic American citizen is very good. His percentage of pauperism, crime and illiteracy is as low as the lowest. In the trades, in the learned professions, in business, and in politics he his been reasonably successful. He has dotted the whole Northwest with his churches, schools, and charitable institutions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0517.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He is an excellent farmer. He is the American sailor of today, and, whenever Uncle Sam wants to beat the Britishers in a sailing match, he calls his Norwegian sailor boys to do it for him. If, perhaps, in some respects the Norwegian American has done only passably well--as a pioneer, he has certainly been, as was to be expected, a splendid success. The typical Norwegian is a born pioneer. With his passion for ownership of land and a home, and his decided liking for adventure, combined with physical stamina, courage, and endurance, he is the stuff that pioneers are made of. And of this he has given abundant proof.</p>
   <p>Sixty years ago (1837), when immigration from Norway began, Chicago and Milwaukee were rough frontier towns, and the great Northwest was an almost unbroken wilderness, the haunt of wild beasts and wilder men. Many of the Norwegian pioneers settled here, by the great lake; lived here; struggled here; died here. And still, today, some of them are here to tell us the story of Chicago's growth from a small frontier town to a metropolis. As by a miracle, in the brief space of sixty years, this vast wilderness has been transformed into a splendid galaxy of wealthy, enlightened and <pb facs="5423969_1_0518.jpg" n="5"/>progressive states. In the face of bloodthirsty savages and prowling beasts, blizzards and drought; dangers, difficulties, and hardships of every description, a grand army of brave, sturdy pioneers, men and women, has advanced civilization from the shores of the Great Lakes to Puget Sound.</p>
   <p>"To that noble army the Norwegian American has furnished far more than his quota of men and women; and they have not been camp followers, but have marched in the forefront, and borne more than their just share of toil, hardships, and dangers. On our Western and Northern frontiers, after the fur trader, with his 'Indian goods,' or the prospector, the timber thief and the cowboy--they were the first settlers to come. They were the harbingers of civilization, usually some were brawny descendants of the Vikings with their worthy helpmate and a half-dozen tow-headed children. The history of every state from Wisconsin to Washington, will, I believe, bear me out in this. The last national census shows that the Norwegians have been least given to huddling together in villages and in the great centers of population.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0519.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Though newcomers as compared with other nationalities, as owners of farms and homes, they already outrank all other elements of the population, the native American included. It is safe to say that this country never saw, and never will see more hardy, pushing, plucky and successful pioneers than the sons and daughters of old Norway.</p>
   <p>"Such is the stock that helped build our Luther College. Without them we would not have been able to build. We, here in Chicago, have done a small share in keeping the college going, but the main credit goes to the sons and daughters who have graduated from Luther and gone out into the world to sow the culture of Norway among the people. Our ministers are many, and they have done much to lighten the hearts of the people, living in the small towns, on the prairies, and in the forests. All hail these pioneers of our Lutheran faith. May our college keep up the good work of educating our people, and may it send them out to help those who need us. Long live Luther College."</p>
