   <p>Mr. Keating's criticism of Dr. Andrew's list of books for supplemental reading was timely and in the main well founded. The difficulty with Dr. Andrews is that he does not follow his own precepts. He has truly said: "The pages of history must be opened to the maturing pupil, and he must be taught to draw therefrom the lessons that are to serve as his guide in full manhood." But his list does not appear to be made up in accordance with this principle; it does not "open the pages of history," but only part of them. It is, as Mr. Keating said, deficient and partisan from a broad historical view.</p>
   <p>Nothing could be more self-evident than that the histories of all nations ought to be accessible to American children, especially those of a cosmpolitan and many-tongued city like Chicago. The time is past when the intellectual American horizon of the modern world disclosed nothing but America and England.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0086.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our country has at last taken its place as a world power and nothing pertaining to the world at large is foreign to our people.</p>
   <p>We have come to touch elbows with the Orient and must do our share in solving its problems and developing its resources. This great task will tax the wisdom and energies not only of the American of today, but also, and to a large extent, of the American of tomorrow. Our schools should teach the lessons "that are to serve as his guide in full manhood." Books on the resources and peoples of the Orient, and the possibilities of development in the great world looking out upon the Pacific Ocean, should be placed within easy reach of our bright boys.</p>
   <p>Then there is the great expanding empire, Russia, with its mission. Our relations with Russia will become more and more extensive as the years roll by. She offers a constantly widening field for American enterprise and an increasing competition in the great marts of the world. The rising generation should be prepared to deal intelligently with many problems Russia will present for its solution.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0087.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In the list of histories of nations suggested by Mr. Keating he omitted not only Russia and the Orient but also the Scandinavian countries. This was probably due to an oversight. Scandinavia is the cradle of what is known as Anglo-Saxon liberty and institutions. The folk moot, certain essential features of the jury system, and other root principles of the common law had their origin among the hardy Norsemen. Norse expansion and enterprise during the Viking Age exerted a decisive influence upon the history of Europe. Everywhere in the British Isles the Norsemen founded settlements, some of which developed into powerful communities. Part of eastern England was for a time under Danish sway, and Dublin was for three centuries the capital of a Norwegian kingdom in Ireland. The Normans who conquered England were Norsemen in the fourth generation. In short, the Norsemen have left their impression upon every page of British history and indirectly upon the history of America. The Scandinavian countries of today rank with the most enlightened and progressive nations of the world. A study of their institutions, art, literatures, and development is instructive in many ways. If the list of books for supplemental reading in our schools is to include histories of all nations, as it should do, it would be "deficient <pb facs="5423969_1_0088.jpg" n="4"/>and partisan" were fairly complete histories of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden to be omitted. For the histories of these three nations of the North are, in fact, initial and supplementary chapters of British and American history.</p>
