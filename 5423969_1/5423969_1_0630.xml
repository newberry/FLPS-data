  <body>
   <p>For several months now, representatives of the Chicago Telephone Company and the appropriate committee of the City Council have been working on a new ordinance to extend the franchise of the Company, and to determine its rights and duties. They have now agreed upon an ordinance, and a digest of the regulations contained in it has recently been published in certain newspapers at the expense of the company.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Telephone Company is one of the worst monopolies which the people of the city have to contend with. The cost of telephones could, and ought to, be comparatively low in Chicago, where it is easy and inexpensive to construct lines, and where the Company has secured an immense business which shows a marked increase every year. But instead of being inexpensive or reasonable, the telephone service here is more expensive than in most localities. The fact is that the company obtained the franchise it desired; <pb facs="5423969_1_0631.jpg" n="2"/>a pliant City Council said "Aye" and "Amen" to everything the Company asked for, and the latter was not modest in its demands.</p>
   <p>The plundering of its customers by the Telephone Company during all these years has been the object of general anger on the part of the people. But what could be done? The ordinance tied the hands of the people, and the Company could do as it pleased. Patiently people have waited for the time when the Company needed a new franchise, hoping that a more equitable arrangement could then be made. The present franchise will expire soon, and a proposal for a new franchise, as we have stated above, is ready for consideration by the City Council.</p>
   <p>We hope that the City Council will take its time in considering the proposal. The Company and its agents are trying to convince the people that an ordinance such as that proposed will bring about a great decrease in expenses for all those who have telephones. But the decrease in expenses is merely apparent. In fact, if the proposed ordinance is passed, telephone service will be far more expensive than at present in many cases, especially for the poorer <pb facs="5423969_1_0632.jpg" n="3"/>classes. To adopt the ordinance as proposed would be unjust to the great majority of telephone users in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Under no circumstances should the proposal be adopted in its present form. Most of the aldermen voting for the ordinance as proposed would thereby sign their own political death warrants, for it will not take long for the people to find out what it really means and what its real purpose is.</p>
   <p>There is no hurry in this matter. Of course, the Telephone Company is anxious to get the matter settled. The old franchise is about to expire, and the Company is anxious to get a new strangle hold on the people's throats. But there is no good reason why the people should be in a hurry to get strangled. There is plenty of capital in Chicago for telephone installation at reasonable rates. Let the matter rest. After a while, it will be found that the present telephone company will be eager to get a new franchise on conditions which will secure reasonable rates for the people.</p>
