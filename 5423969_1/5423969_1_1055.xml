   <p>There is no reason to believe that the voters in Cook County will leave it to the bosses, republican or democratic, to appoint the fourteen important judges this coming month.</p>
   <p>It is true, of course, that the war and matters connected with the war occupy most of the thoughts of the people these days, but it would be very much to be lamented if the serious conditions under which we are living were to bring as a consequence, rule by the political bosses in regard to such important local affairs as the election of judges. It cheers us,therefore, to learn that the president of the Chicago Bar Association announces that also this year, the association will hold its primary to recommend the candidates whom it considers suitable for the position of judge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_1056.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This resolve on the part of the Bar Association will, of course, create a jarring note in the play of the republican and democratic bosses who had counted on the association to join in with their plans, and, therefore, not to hold a primary on judges this year.</p>
