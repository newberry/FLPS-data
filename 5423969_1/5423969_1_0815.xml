   <p>Efforts are now being made to carry into effect the plan for strike settlement which was suggested by the Skandinaven some weeks ago. Professor Graham Taylor has made some telling speeches along the same lines, and the public generally appears to be favorably impressed with the proposed plan for a reconciliation.</p>
   <p>It must be plain to all thinking men by this time that normal conditions can now be restored only in two ways: by the complete exhaustion of one or both of the contending parties or by a settlement enforced by public opinion. The community has already suffered grievously from this inexcusable war; it cannot afford to have it prolonged a single day if it is within its power to restore peace.</p>
   <p>Let public opinion assert itself with practical unanimity and sufficient force, and the warring parties will be compelled to lay down their arms. The right <pb facs="5423969_1_0816.jpg" n="2"/>of the public to interfere is plain. It is the third party to, and the heaviest sufferer in, any labor war; it has a better and stronger right to command and enforce peace than have either employers or workmen to precipitate an industrial war.</p>
   <p>The people cannot speak except through a delegate body. In order to be truly representative in character and able to speak with sufficient authority, such a body must represent all shades of public opinion. This is the main point to be considered in making up the prospective committee of conference and conciliation. A committee speaking with the voice of Chicago will end this foolish and disastrous war.</p>
