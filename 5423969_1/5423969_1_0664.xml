   <p>Colonel Bryan and all the rest of the Democrats seek to make people believe that trusts are a result of the protective tariff; that the Republicans are protecting the trusts and that the Democrats would demolish the trusts if only Colonel Bryan could be elected president. If anybody feels inclined to believe any of this, let him take a look at the list given below of corporations which in everyday conversation are called trusts. The list shows the time of organization of the trusts in question, and also their capital in shares and bonds. Only corporations having capital of ten million dollars or more are included. The list is as follows:</p>

   <p>Here are thirty-seven great corporation trusts with a total capital of more than one billion dollars. As the list shows, all of these were organized before McKinley came to the helm. Three of the trusts were functioning when Cleveland first became president; seven were organized during his first term; thirteen during his second term; and most of these while the Wilson law was in force.</p>
   <p>Colonel Bryan needs to explain why the Democrats did not do anything to abolish these trusts during the eight years when they were at the helm. He cannot excuse his party by saying that these trusts are better than the others. Several of them are just the kind of corporation which is most obnoxious to the little fellow....Mr. Bryan need also explain how it happens that trusts were organized while the Wilson law was in force, since the Colonel insists that free trade is the antidote to trusts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0668.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Bryan will reply, perhaps, that he is not responsible for Grover Cleveland, and that he cannot be judged on the basis of Mr. Cleveland's acts. But in such case, Mr. Bryan needs to explain why he himself did not get after the trusts when he had the chance. Most of them were in full activity when Mr. Bryan was a member of the Congress. As a lawmaker it was Mr. Bryan's duty to do what he could to rid the country of the trusts if he found them bad. There is, however, nothing in the Congressional Record to show that he raised a finger for such purpose. Mr. Bryan is an eloquent man, and he could have opened the eyes of the people for the trust danger if such danger there be; but Mr. Bryan remained silent--completely so.</p>
   <p>Now he promises to do wonders in the matter. But if he is to make the people believe his words, then he needs first of all explain why he and the Democratic party did nothing when they had the power and the opportunity. Unless he can explain this inactivity, the people will naturally conclude that his words and promises in the matter at the present time are sheer humbug.</p>
