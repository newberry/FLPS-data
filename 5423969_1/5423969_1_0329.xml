   <p>The conditions here in Chicago, as well as throughout the United States, are terrible when it comes to liquor and vice.</p>
   <p>Much was disclosed at the National Prohibition Convention held in New York. The Temperance movement is gaining headway throughout the Nation, and will be a great factor in the next election. Every day, here in Chicago, one can see drunken men and women, and often children staggering down the street.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, there are too many saloons. We feel that one saloon per thousand inhabitants is more than enough, and even less would be still better. In a town which is growing as fast as Chicago there should be better control along these lines. Saloons should close at midnight, and not be permitted to remain open all night, neither should minors be allowed on the premises. We believe that imprisonment and not fines should be the <pb facs="5423969_1_0330.jpg" n="2"/>punishment for violation of these laws.</p>
   <p>The houses of prostitution which flourish near saloons, and cater especially to drunks should be closed. Opium dens which have sprung up like mushrooms all over the city also flourish near saloons and brothels.</p>
   <p>Ninety per cent of the murders in Chicago have been committed by persons while drunk. It is the duty of the State to abolish, or at least regulate this vicious trade. This, of course, can only be done if we elect Prohibition party candidates. We should bear this in mind at our next election.</p>
   <p>The recent National Prohibition Convention is the foundation for a broader party, the Prohibition and Home Protection party.</p>
