   <p>The traction workers on the North and West Sides rejected, by an overwhelming majority, the proposal for an agreement presented by the negotiations committee. This overwhelming rejection came as a surprise to everybody except the workers themselves. The agreement or proposal for a new wage scale was the fruit of careful study and negotiations between the representatives elected by the workers and the officers of the traction companies.</p>
   <p>There is no reason to believe that the representatives of the workers did their best to further the cause of the workers. They were convinced that they had gained all that the companies were willing to concede at present, and they expected that the proposal would be ratified by the workers nearly unanimously.</p>
   <p>The new wage scale offers considerable advantages to the men who have been in the service of the companies for a long time; and something less to those who <pb facs="5423969_1_0795.jpg" n="2"/>are new in the service. It seems just, however, that experience and training should be rewarded in the work of the traction lines. Hitherto, there has been too slight a difference in pay between the new men and those older in the service. A man of experience is worth far more than a new, untrained man, not only to the traction companies but also to the patrons of the streetcars, and that means practically the whole population of the city, not to speak of the large number of visitors.</p>
   <p>The newer men evidently have a majority in the unions of the traction workers, however; this is made clear by the large majority against the proposed wage scale. Everything possible will be done to preserve peace. But the younger traction workers desire a strike at any cost, it is said, and it is hardly probable that it can be avoided.</p>
   <p>The situation is a new one in every way. Usually, it is the leaders of the workers who are the most radical in their demands; and it is they who generally <pb facs="5423969_1_0796.jpg" n="3"/>bring on the crisis, while the great majority of the workers go on strike only with great reluctance.</p>
   <p>This time, however, the situation is reversed. The leaders have shown moderation and a spirit of conciliation, while the workers themselves are determined to strike unless the companies accede to all their demands.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the workers will consider matters carefully before taking the decisive step. They cannot hope to win in the struggle unless they have public sympathy on their side, and they cannot expect public sympathy for their cause if they refuse to negotiate with the other side, but, instead, blindly plunge into a fight which will cause their fellow men all kinds of trouble.</p>
   <p>It is also to be hoped that the traction companies do their very utmost to meet the demands of their men, in order that the city may escape a destructive conflict. A general streetcar strike would constitute a calamity for the city <pb facs="5423969_1_0797.jpg" n="4"/>and its people, while it is most doubtful whether it would benefit anybody. Experience shows that the fights between employers and employees will, as a rule, harm everybody and help nobody.</p>
