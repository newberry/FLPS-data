   <p>The fiftieth anniversary of Luther College will be celebrated tomorrow. Luther College, the "Heart of the Synod," was formally opened on October 14, 1865; in 1889 the College was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt and dedicated on October 14, 1890; Larsen Hall was opened on October 13, 1907 and the Synod's Theological Seminary, [Madison, Wisconsin] was dedicated on October 14, 1876. Luther Seminary [Hamlin, Minnesota ] was opened on October 14, 1899. The Teacher's Seminary, [Sioux Falls, South Dakota ], the Grand Forks College, the Pacific Lutheran Academy, and the H.A. Preus Lutheran Academy were all dedicated on October 14, 1899.</p>
   <p>The College has much to offer its students in the field of education. "Multum in parvo" has been used as a motto. "Non multa sed multum" has also served as a motto.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0190.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The average annual enrollment during the last fifty years has been about two hundred--a figure that is quite imposing in this day and age.</p>
   <p>The oldest teachers, some of them Chicagoans, include L. Larsen, 1861; F.M. Schmidt, 1861-72; Lyder Siewerts, 1863-77; Knut Bergh, 1869-74. Professor C.K. Preus, the present president, J.B. Torrisson, and C.A. Fjeldstad are Chicagoans.</p>
   <p>Our Chicago colony has done a great deal to keep up these colleges, because we feel here that schools using our language are especially needed in the theological and teaching fields. We should have more recognized colleges such as those mentioned above. This is the only way we can promote Nordic culture, which we must keep alive among our own people.</p>
