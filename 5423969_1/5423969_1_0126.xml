   <p>The press quite frequently reports of progress made in the study of Scandinavian languages and literature in the public schools. The number of high schools where one or more of the Scandinavian languages are included in the school's curriculum, this also included several of our largest universities.</p>
   <p>At the University of Illinois Dr.George T. Flom is in charge of this work, where several classes are in progress graded according to the students abilities. These studies cover Norwegian, Swedish and Danish languages; modern, medival and ancient as well as the polygraphy of these languages. All Scandinavian writers and poets works are studied and to prove the progress made by these students. The school's two most popular societies, The Adelphic and the Illiola, have produced several Norwegian plays and with great success.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0127.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The university's Scandinavian department is in possession of a large library and is from time to time recepient of valuable additions to its collection of Scandinavian literature, poesy and prose.</p>
