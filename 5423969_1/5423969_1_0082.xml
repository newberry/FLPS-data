   <p>Go to school! That is the best thing that Norwegian and Danish youths can do during the winter evenings.</p>
   <p>The evening schools are open to all, young and old. At these schools there is a good chance to learn to read, to speak, and to write the English language. A knowledge of English is a necessity in this country; nobody can advance far or find a chance for the full development of his abilities unless he knows the language of our country. This is true not only in regard to people seeking business positions, but in regard to ordinary workers and servant maids as well.</p>
   <p>At the Northwestern High School interested youths may get instruction in any course taught in our high schools. Here is an excellent chance for young men and women to acquire useful and necessary knowledge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_1_0083.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As is generally known, the evening schools are free. They are open to all; there is no fee charged for the instruction. Their main objective is to serve the immigrants who wish to take advantage of the opportunities offered. Many seize these opportunities; unfortunately, however, many more continually neglect this chance of securing an education.</p>
   <p>The ignorance prevalent among a large number of our people, whether immigrants or those born in Chicago, is most regrettable. Many young men and women do not realize that it is not of much help to them here that they came from a country where the educational standard is high. They forget the necessity of getting acquainted with conditions in America. Both men and women among the Norwegians are backward in regard to this matter. There are rich opportunities to learn for those who will use their brains; but these opportunities are left unused, and the result is that many of our young people live in a state of ignorance which is astonishing. Such ignorant people can never rise above <pb facs="5423969_1_0084.jpg" n="3"/>the level of hewers of wood and drawers of water for others.</p>
   <p>Go to school! For it is better to pass the evening at the evening schools than to lounge at the bar in the saloons. Buy books instead of cards! Read instead of drinking beer and brandy! Learn English and other useful subjects!</p>
   <p>Anybody can advance in this country if he wants to. But the ignorant people will get nowhere. If you want to get somewhere, go to school, and start now!</p>
