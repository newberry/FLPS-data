   <p>It is a well-known fact that: the immigration law, was ratified for two years only, and it expires June 30, 1924. When Congress opens its session, around December 4, 1923, the revision of the present immigration law will be discussed, and we can surely foresee the introduction of a new law.</p>
   <p>It is also well-known that the certificates for incoming relatives, to be valid, must not be older than six months. Therefore, if the present law is not in force in 1924, if a new law is enacted, all certificates which have been issued up until to-day, or which shall be issued until the introduction of the new immigration law, that is until the beginning of January, 1924, will be void for the immigration period of 1924.</p>
   <p>All Certificates for 1924 must be made up after the introduction of the <pb facs="5422062_5_1480.jpg" n="2"/>new law, that is after January, 1924.</p>
   <p>The certificates that are now being made for 1924 will be completely void.</p>
   <p>The formalities required for the certificates of 1924 will be entirely different from those required for the present immigration.</p>
