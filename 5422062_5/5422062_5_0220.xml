   <p>According to the decision taken by the historic meeting of the communities of our colony, in which our communal problem was settled, a Central Committee is being launched in which all communities of our colony in Chicago are to be represented under the presidency of the Archbishop.</p>
   <p>This Central Committee is to be the Central Community, so to speak, and is to be utilized as the uniting link of our whole communal action. So gradually will be evolved a single community of Chicago without offense to the independence and separate existence of the various communities. To use a more vivid expression, it will partake of the nature of the Congress of the United States, to which the representatives of the several States go to discuss and decide about matters concerning all the States.</p>
   <p>By this we mean to convey an idea of the importance which we attribute to the purpose and the mission of this Central Committee, and of how much we expect from it for the progress of the great Greek settlement of Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0221.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We attribute so much importance to this Central Committee because it is in itself the beginning of the cooperation of all communities, a thing unusual for us Greeks, who do not realize as yet the possible advantages of cooperation and mutual understanding. We still keep on believing that by working alone each one by himself can make better headway, whereas in times like these big combinations and unions are the only systems by which vast undertakings are completed, and various purposes are accomplished.</p>
   <p>For these reasons do we attach such importance to the formation of this Central Committee....</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, as things in our community stand to-day, no far-reaching decisions can be considered now. On account of long-continued dissension mutual confidence has been shaken, and the spirit of cooperation has vanished.</p>
   <p>It was, consequently, imperative to have the foundation of cooperation first laid down, and we have full confidence that the Central Committee will accomplish, with the consent of all concerned, things that cannot even be discussed now.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0222.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The decision taken in regard to placing the responsibility of the presidency of the Committee on the Archbishop was best. It offers us the serious cooperation of all communities, whose supreme coordinator will be the Archbishop, owing to his position and title, and thus the cooperation of clergy and laymen is assured, something which is needed, and the lack of which is greatly felt for the regular, normal functioning of our communal organizations. And it is so much better to have Father Athenagoras as Archbishop, who by his actions so far has shown us that he fully understands the needs of our colony and is animated by the best intentions for our communal reorganization, and most important of all, he diagnoses perfectly the character of the Greeks of America.</p>
