   <p>The Chicago Democratic Union, in expanding its activities outside the limits of Chicago, had initiated, last Sunday, another branch in South Bend, Indiana. Our fellow countrymen of the small but very patriotic community of South Bend, animated by democratic sentiments, organized a political gathering, in which Mr. S. Strategos presided and, by a very enthusiastic speech introduced the president of the Democratic Association, Mr. John Mantas. Then Dr. C. Karaflos, Mr. John Vasilopoulos, secretary of the organization and Mr. S. Kotakis, journalist, were introduced, who explained the object of the organization and the need that the Greeks have for democratic views and sentiment.</p>
   <p>The result was the launching of a branch in South Bend with more than a hundred enthusiastic members. An executive committee was elected composed of Messrs. S. Strategos, president;  and Jacovidou, secretary.</p>
   <p>A resolution was voted upon, regarding preservation of the Democratic institutions in Greece. Telegrams to the Greek Government, and newspapers <pb facs="5422062_5_1624.jpg" n="2"/>in Greece were sent asking them to support the above resolution.</p>
