   <p>p. 2- Mr. Bratsolias wishes to announce to the public and to Mr. Kontaxis, a restaurateur, that he is not responsible for debts incurred during the recent ecclesiastical convention. Here is the situation. The members of the community selected Mr. Kontaxis' restaurant as an ideal place to hold their convention. He agreed, and from 8 in the morning till 2 the next morning he closed his restaurant to the public and lent all services to the fifty delegates, keeping them well supplied with food, drinks, cigars, etc.</p>
   <p>Now the question arises, who is going to pay, Mr. Bratsolias, Mr. Kontaxis or the community? Of course, Mr. Bratsolias, who saw that all arrangements were carried out, won't pay, neither will Mr. Kontaxis who had nothing to do with the convention, and neither, as a matter of fact, will the community because it has no money in its treasury. The matter stands!</p>
