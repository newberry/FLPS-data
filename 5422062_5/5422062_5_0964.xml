   <p>p. 1.- Since the Athenian army has decided to rid Greece of all undesirable elements, it is not a bad idea for the Greeks of America to follow the example. Our undesirables are non other than the priests, who hide behind the cloaks of holiness.</p>
   <p>The duty of a priest is to look after the spiritual needs of his flock. This does not mean that he must be present at every social gathering of the city, eating and drinking till early in the morning. Nor does it mean that he must eat chicken on Wednesday and Fridays, while he preaches that these should be fast days.</p>

   <p>He collects a monthly salary from the church but thinks nothing of charging heavily for extra service such as weddings, funerals, and so forth.</p>
   <p>We believe in priests, but we want our priests to be clean and honest as their profession denotes. We want them to help the sick and poor. We want them to be less mercenary and more priestly. In other words we want them to "practice what they preach."</p>
