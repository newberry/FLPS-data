   <p>Not very long ago an important looking envelop containing a letter was delivered to me by the mailman. I recognized the signature, at the bottom of the letter, as that of one of my Greek subscribers. The contents of the brief letter irritated me, but it was my duty as a publisher to gratify the wish of my fellow Greek.</p>
   <p>How can I answer the question asked, was a real problem for me for this reason, I went to seek the advice of a friend of mine who is known as a Greek of my cane. The door was opened by the Greek Philosopher's. attendant, and I found the wise man sitting by the fire place. My anxiety to find an answer to the question in the letter urged me to be brief and to the point. He read the letter, and commanded me to take notations of his answer. In a few minutes, thanks to my knowledge of shorthand, I pocketed an answer.</p>
   <p>My return to the office was rewarded with further success. My secretary, knowing in advance that my mission to the Greek Philosopher would be successful, was waiting for the answer to prepare it for publication.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1459.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The next day we read the letter of the subscriber and the answer of the Philosopher.</p>
   <p>The question in the letter: "Why are the Greeks scattered all over the Globe?" The answer of the Philosopher: "Mankind was created in the Tropics. Paradise is not a myth, but a reality; the sociologists admit that today. Paradise was a place of green vegetation, beauty and color, with a mild climate. Our departure from Paradise is owed to the discovery of fire. With fire Man could survive under any climate and with fire, Man was able to eat what he wanted."</p>
   <p>"We may correct the Jewish Bible a little in one place. Man was not put out of Paradise, as the Jewish Bible tells us, he left himself."</p>
   <p>"Having fire, Man had the world. With the torch in his hand, Man left Paradise to see and conquer the World"</p>
   <p>"It would have been a terrible thing for Man if he would have been compelled to stay in Paradise in one environment, to eat only raw fruit and vegetables.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1460.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Humanity in Paradise would have died from monotony, from living in the same clinic, in the same environment all the time, eating the same food, etc. The Tropical Paradise would not have been large enough to accomodate the multiplying Sons of Eve, who would have been so numerous that no standing place could have been found for them. It would have been impossible to solve the problem of an overpopulous Paradise. Therefore, it was necessary for them to leave Paradise in order to perpetuate life. What a pity, if humanity in Paradise, would have been compelled to find itself, year after year, century after century, with only fruits and vegetables to eat."</p>
   <p>Eating raw vegetables and fruit, our organic system eventually would have been similar to cows and sheep and eventually we would have proceeded milk from some part of our body. Thank goodness, we left Paradise."</p>
   <p>"If Man hadn't left Paradise it would have been impossible for us to be eating chestnuts and drinking Greek brandy this minute; while Nick, the Greek cook, is preparing nice juicy, tender, lamb chops, asparagus tips with mayonaise and custard pudding for our further enjoyment. The departure from Paradise with the torch in hand, made Man today, omnivorous."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1461.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"After all," I said, "I wonder how in the name of Jupiter, mankind today"--bla, bla, some more about the myth of Eve, the apple, the snake, the sin, and the fall of Man.</p>
   <p>"What a pity for those who can not think," said the philosopher. My dear Greek Publisher, in epitomizing we see that the Man was not chased out of Paradise, but he left after he had fire, and went out to conquer the world and did conquer it. So the Greeks living in Paradise-like environment, and being fed up and tired of that same old place, with its same old education, arts, culture, and civilization, not being able to live in bounded Greece, took the torch of all these Virtues in hand, and went to the four corners of the Earth to conquer the world. That is why the Greeks are scattered all over the Globe."</p>
   <p>"Now, my dear and esteemed Publisher, after eating those juicy lamb chops, would you like to have a demitass? Not "a la' Paradise, of course."</p>
