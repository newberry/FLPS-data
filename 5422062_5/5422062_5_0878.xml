  <body>
   <p>The central committee of the Greek parishes of Chicago, composed of the three parish priests, the three Board presidents, and representatives from the three Church Councils, has been holding frequent and efficient meetings. The Saloniki is happy to inform the Greeks of Chicago, that due to the sincere efforts of this committee, the unification of the Churches is now an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>The names of the members of this committee will be engraved in gold upon the records of the Greek Churches of Chicago. They solved a problem that seemed insurmountable to former committees. Their efforts mean the building of a firm foundation for a future Greek community; and that, in itself, is a public service, the value of which cannot easily be realized. Because these individuals have rendered such a valuable service, we take a great pride in printing their names for all to see. They are: Reverend Leon Pygeas, of the Holy Trinity Church, who was chosen president of the central <pb facs="5422062_5_0879.jpg" n="2"/>committee; Constantine Loumos, vice-president of the Board of the Evangelismos, and vice-president of the committee; John Agriostathis, secretary of the Holy Trinity Board and secretary of the committee; John Pappas, president of the Board of St. Constantine; Reverend C. Hadzidimitriou of the Evangelismos Church; Reverend I. Prousianos of St. Constantine; B. Georgakopoulos, president of the Board of Holy Trinity; A. Mazarakis, president of the Evangelismos; Peter Kourlas, treasurer of the Evangelismos; T. Sperison, vice-president of the Board of St. Constantine; George Kokkinis, of Holy Trinity; Michael Petropoulos of St. Constantine.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary for us to laud these men to the Greek community; their actions speak for themselves. However, we are holding back most of our words of praise until the work has been completed.</p>
   <p>The committee has worked out eight steps for the development of its program. They are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Complete auditing of the books of the three Churches with a public listing <pb facs="5422062_5_0880.jpg" n="3"/>of their respective debts and pressing obligations.</p>
   <p>2. Purchase of a burial ground to be put at the disposal of the three churches, to be used for Greek people only.</p>
   <p>3. This union to be the defender and supporter of all activities that will aid the entire Greek community in its efforts to better and uplift itself. It will also endeavor to improve the status of both the Greeks and American people.</p>
   <p>4. It will maintain the consolidated school of the three churches; and see to it that high teaching standards and the best environment are maintained at all times.</p>
   <p>5. The building and organization of a high school having dormitory facilities. The school to be open to all Greek students in the United States. It shall be, of course, a Greek-American school; and preferably, it shall be located in the country, and not in a large city like Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0881.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>6. The creation of a fund for the benefit of needy Greeks.</p>
   <p>7. Eventually to build and finance a Greek hospital, to care for the sick of our race.</p>
   <p>8. To endeavor to provide or create all the other things that may be needed for the future progress and development of the Greek community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The knowledge of the plans being made for this School for Greek children, fills us with great joy. It should be good news to all the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>The efforts of the Saloniki have not, therefore, been in vain. The Saloniki has seen one of its dreams become a reality; and hopes that some more of its so-called dreams will also become facts.</p>
