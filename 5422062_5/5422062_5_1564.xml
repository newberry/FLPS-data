   <p>Much has been written about the evil of immigration. The Greek press of Chicago as well as the press of Athens, Greece is aroused by the planned wholesale transmigration and emigration of so many thousands of young men from Greece. In this article, we intend to analyze the entire immigration problem from the Greek point of view for the benefit of the vitally interested Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Star knows well that this subject should be thoroughly discussed because it affects the life and welfare of every one in this community. Most of us know that the young men of Greece leave their homes and villages because it is very difficult for them to win a livelihood in our fatherland. We will herewith attempt to explain the many reasons why they cannot do so.</p>
   <p>According to a generally prevailing opinion, any further encouragement of immigration should cease for various reasons, and especially because of the fact that <pb facs="5422062_5_1565.jpg" n="2"/>conditions in America are not what they were when our first Greek immigrants arrived here quite a few years ago. Thousands upon thousands of immigrants of other nationalities are pouring into America, who are better prepared and better equipped than we are. However, in spite of the easier adaptability of the latter, and in spite of the fact that they are accustomed to the ways of the great American urban centers, it is astonishing how easily they fail to make a go of things and, so, are forced to return to their homeland.</p>
   <p>We have seen statistics relative to this same matter in many outstanding American newspapers, which are sounding a warning that the continuous arrival of huge caravans of immigrants from Europe constitutes a grave peril for America and will inevitably create serious problems in the immediate and distant future.</p>
   <p>This is wise and sincere advice which comes from a thorough study of the entire situation. Here we have proof that the American press has no ulterior motive or prejudice against the European newcomer.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1566.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>These same newspapers remind us that at the present time America is experiencing a widespread and serious financial panic. There is no doubt that the hard-working laborer is the greatest victim under such circumstances. The railroads are laying off thousands of workers every day, while many factories are also dismissing additional thousands of technicians and workers in every type of work. In general, the personnel of every business has been reduced to a minimum. For example, formerly a factory employed one hundred workers, but now uses only twenty-five. The other seventy-five have been layed off and are now forced to tramp the streets of our big cities in the midst of the winter. Why so? Because there is an acute scarcity of jobs; there is a widespread standstill in all kinds of businesses and industries. This situation is destructive to the working class, who have not enough savings to fall back on. Now, only God knows what will become of so many workers--many of whom have families to support.</p>
   <p>Those in Europe and especially, our own countrymen in Greece who are thinking of immigrating to this country, should know about the laboring and economic conditions in this country. Let them think beforehand where they are to go and what <pb facs="5422062_5_1567.jpg" n="4"/>they will do on leaving Europe. On coming to America they must struggle hard against thousands of other men whose bread they seek to take away.</p>
   <p>The Greek Government must act swiftly, not with half-measures, neither with legislative acts. The government must work like another Hercules to clean up the rotteness of Greek politics. It must remember that the Greek immigrant is not to blame for leaving the country without workers, farmers, the indispensable man power. It is the fault of the Greek Government because they are doing hardly anything to improve the conditions of the Greek people's lives. They have given little thought to the fact that Greece is being rapidly depopulated. Our leaders have shamelessly compromised the future welfare and interests of the people without being, in the least, affected by their conscience. Coming into power, they only think of how to satisfy their personal passions and hatreds; how to get revenge. Then begins a systematic persecution of all their enemies, who in the face of threats of imprisonment, dishonor, and death take the road to America, unmindful of their future fate. They are happy to have escaped the horrors of political persecution which hung over their heads like a Damoclean sword.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1568.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>No one wants to leave his country, home, parents, friends, and the place of his childhood memories. These memories are too sweet. Many a Greek immigrant is forced to flee because of the inexorable wrath of politicians, unbearable taxation, and the lack of encouragement and opportunity to invest any capital.</p>
   <p>A few years ago, perhaps the Greek business men were justified in raising the prices of commodities because there was considerable difference in the rate of exchange of the drachma and the franc. The franc was then equivalent to one drachma and seventy-two lepta, so, there was some reason for a business slump and high prices. But now when the drachma is on a par with the franc there is no justification for this rise in prices, for this speculative orgy. Life in Greece has become a heavy burden; bread costs a drachma and twenty lepta; the cost of clothing and other necessities is so high that one must be a Rockefeller, a Morgan, or a Vanderbilt to be able to live decently in Greece.</p>
   <p>These and many other evils are the causes for the continuous flow of immigration into America. Many villagers as well as city people leave a curse behind them <pb facs="5422062_5_1569.jpg" n="6"/>and depart for the unknown. They want to forget Greece because her atmosphere is so depressing. When he comes to America he finds that prices are cheap, the atmosphere is bright, the environment is better and more attractive, business and industry are normally in demand of help, and life generally is rather comfortable. All is different here. The prowling tax collector and the hungry law enforcement officers are not to be found here. There are no tax-exempt Shylocks here who drain the life blood of the poor farmer and worker.</p>
   <p>Besides these, we have in Greece a horrible and highly inadequate educational system which is expected to enlighten and properly educate the people. Those who have studied in the Greek Gymnasium (Trans. note: the Greek equivalent of our high school) are almost good-for-nothing.</p>
   <p>Introduce administrative reforms, destroy the devastating spirit of compromise, reform the internal political system, control Greek business and finance, as the American Government does, force them to sell at low prices without depriving them of a reasonable profit, and then be assured, dear friends, that the huge <pb facs="5422062_5_1570.jpg" n="7"/>flow of immigration will decrease.</p>
   <p>Yes, this growing gangrene of the Greek nation will disappear because an excessive rate of immigration drains the nation's life-blood. It deprives a nation of its best and finest asset, the young manhood of the farm, town, and city, leaving behind the old, the unproductive, the useless elements of the population. Another factor is contributing to swell the tide of immigration, and that is the Greek Transatlantic Steamship Company, maintaining extensive offices in Chicago. This company has been making huge profits by inducing and helping Greeks to come to America. It has become a regular racket. Through its agents and ticket salesmen, thousands of our countrymen, who would otherwise be afraid to leave their country and sail across the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean with other European immigrants, decide to make the long voyage on a Greek steamship and in the company of friends and members of their own nationality. These Greeks know that they will be among Greeks not only on board ship but also in their wanderings across the American continent in search of work. Naturally, many cannot resist the vivid and glowing description of <pb facs="5422062_5_1571.jpg" n="8"/>the wonders of America and the unlimited opportunities which are awaiting the ambitious and eager-eyed immigrant. The steamship company can bait the simple immigrant very easily. Just a few figures speak eloquently of this thriving steamship business. On its second voyage to America one Greek liner had 1,740 passengers; on its third trip it transported 1,391. God only knows how many more will be brought to this land in the future on this and other liners.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to harm the interests of the Greek Transatlantic Steamship Company; we merely wish to remind it that any further increase in the number of Greek immigrants to America harms Greece and plays great havoc with the economic welfare of our country. This same company is sending one Mr. Moroitis to Chicago for the purpose of encouraging and organizing the immigration service. May we remind the steamship agents that the Greeks of Chicago would like to discourage the flow of immigration at least for the time being for very good reasons.</p>
   <p>It is one thing to encourage immigration but another to go through the adventures, hardships, and perils that the immigrant has to experience upon arriving <pb facs="5422062_5_1572.jpg" n="9"/>in the land of Columbus.</p>
   <p>Our fellow countrymen in this city have been through the mill. At this time, when America is weathering a severe depression and when labor opportunities are scarce to propose further immigration is to do harm both to ourselves and to those who will come here.</p>
