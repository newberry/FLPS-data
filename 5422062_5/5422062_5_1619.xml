   <p>The question of our political institutions in Greece was recently the subject of a long discussion by the Greek Professional Men's Club of Chicago. The conclusion which they reached was the only logical one; namely, they declared themselves unanimously in favor of the preservation of democracy in Greece.</p>
   <p>The opinion which we have repeatedly expressed in these columns, that the Greeks in America are democrats, and that they could not be royalists, was vindicated at the last meeting of the Club; for no one declared himself a royalist, or dared to appear as such.</p>
   <p>Differences of opinion sprang up only in the composition of the resolution, which was constructed so as to satisfy all sides and was finally adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p>We extend our heartiest congratulations to the professional men of our community and recommend them to the rest of our organizations as an example to be followed; for they should all express their opinion on so important and vital a matter as civil institutions, especially since they are now living in America.</p>
