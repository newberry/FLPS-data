   <p>For over thirty years, Mr. J. P. Bafakos has been in America and a resident of the city of Chicago. He sailed from Greece on September 15, 1899 and reached Chicago on October 26.</p>
   <p>At that time there were 1,500 Greeks in Chicago. Most of their Greek news was obtained from the Atlantis newspaper which was published three times a week.</p>
   <p>Business in Chicago had very few openings for Greeks or other new-comers. It was hard to become established. The cost of food, clothing, and shelter was high. This added to the misery of the immigrants Mr. Bafakos solved his problem by raising crops.</p>
   <p>"I am more than satisfied with America," he says, "Because she has given me many things I could not have acquired in Greece."</p>
   <p>I advise the Greek-American youth to honor and hold high the two most wonderful flags in the world-the flags of America and of Greece."</p>
