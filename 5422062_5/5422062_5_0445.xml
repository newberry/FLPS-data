  <body>
   <p>p. 1.- Representative Modes put the question, the other day, before the body of the Greek Parliament, regarding our Ecclesiastical problem, and the validity of the rites performed by the irregulars.</p>
   <p>This inquiry sprang up on account of a report of Greeks from America to the Parliament asking for a solution of our church problem. Numerous reports, memorandums, and telegrams were sent to the Government, the Holy Synod and the Parliament. Nor is this the first time that an inquiry has been presented to the parliament upon this famous question. However, no attention was paid to it, nor will it be resolved in the future, apparently, so long as a solution is being sought by reports and memorandums.</p>
   <p>Former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Michalacopoulos, who was entrusted by the Government with the solution of the problem made the statement in a press report sometime ago, that our Ecclesiastical question was a thorny one and it would be advisable for the Greeks of America to solve it by themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0446.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In addition it was said that inasmuch as all the Greeks of America are Americans, the question is American and the Greek Government cannot interfere! All of which means that Mr. Michalacopoulos, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, who undertook to solve the Ecclesiastical question, did not even know what it was all about, because if he had he would not have made such a statement. As it seems, he was ill-advised by clever individuals, so that he formed a one-sided opinion and did not bother to acquaint himself with the point of view of the opposite side.</p>
   <p>Now then, in such a case, when the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who, supposedly, investigated the matter more than anyone else, acquits himself in such a fashion, how is it possible for the Greeks of America to expect from the Greek Government and Parliament the solution of their problem by means of reports, memoranda and telegrams?</p>
   <p>The only correct thing that Mr. Michalacopoulos said is that the question is a thorny one, and he who would undertake to solve it would have his hands torn, because the clever and perverse exploiters of it, the renegades and apostates, dividers of the Greeks of America, who for the sake of thrones <pb facs="5422062_5_0447.jpg" n="3"/>and dollars are indifferent, as to whether churches and communities crumble, so long as they can fatten themselves. So far they have succeeded in entangling the whole question so badly it will require long and persistent work in Athens, in order to enlighten the Greek Government as to the real situation of community church affairs here.</p>
   <p>Reports and referendums are not sufficient to lift the yoke which Priests, Bishops, Consuls, and even Ambassadors have hung on to the neck of the Greeks in America.</p>
