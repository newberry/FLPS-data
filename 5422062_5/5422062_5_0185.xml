   <p>p. 1.- In our last issue we expressed our opinion regarding plans laid out by communities in New York, and which are to be submitted to the Congress of Greek Communities, Nov. 16th.</p>
   <p>We also dwelt in length on the "Mixed Council" plan, which we considered the most important for the communities, because it is the one through which the whole administration of the Archdiocese and its relationship with the communities will be regulated.</p>
   <p>Next to this regulation, however, comes the by-laws of the churches and the communal councils, in other words, the common constitution which the Archdiocese was expected to lay out for all the Greek communities of America.</p>
   <p>The plan that was sent, however, is anything but a constitution for the communities and, therefore, does not bear the importance attached to it by the many.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0186.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is simply a set of by-laws for the churches which we publish, here-with, for the satisfaction of those who thought that the Archdiocese would assume the administration of the communities and also to convince those who were expecting the Archdiocese to lay out such a constitution, that such a thing is impossible.</p>
   <p>The communities are corporations in themselves and have their own constitution. Whatever change in them is necessary must be done by the communities themselves, and not imposed upon them from the Archdiocese, nor even by its general congregation.</p>
   <p>The only thing that has to be done, as we see it, is the addition of a few articles in the communities' constitution in which its relationship to the Archdiocese is defined.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, such thoughts have prevailed, also, in New York, and wholly for this reason the "Church Rules" were accepted instead of the constitution.</p>
