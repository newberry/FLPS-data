   <p>We have had another occasion to censor those priests who are using, without sufficient reason, the English language in the performance of the Sacraments. A priest went as far as to have not only the English language used in a ceremony of marriage, but even to eliminate the use of "Stephana."</p>
   <p>Although we do not desire to scratch open old wounds, we are compelled to remind the same priest, that it is about time to cast off his old habits and let the English language alone, the more so, since he is not acquainted with it.</p>
   <p>We have been motivated to record the above facts on account of a marriage that took place, last Sunday, and in which there were three priests, who delivered speeches, the last speaking in English before an audience purely Greek and within the walls of a Greek Church.</p>
   <p>The Greeks speak and hear the English language everywhere, and the only chance they have to speak and hear Greek, is in our homes and churches. If, therefore, we do not give them this chance to hear Greek spoken, then in <pb facs="5422062_5_0261.jpg" n="2"/>what manner are we to preserve our language? The priests must be the first ones to set the example for the preservation of our language instead of themselves substituting English for Greek.</p>
   <p>Let us hope, however, that the new ecclesiastical regime will place many things where they belong, and that they will also do something about the priests who do not want to behave.</p>
