   <p>Pious Clergy, Honorable Presidents of the churches and all the Greek Orthodox people of the Dioceses of Chicago and San Francisco.</p>
   <p>With joy I inform you of the mandate by the Ecumenical patriarchate regarding the change of the calendar. A telegram was sent to the Chicago Episcopate, by His Holiness The Patriarch stating it was decided that beginning March 23rd the old calendar will be adjusted to the new one, and that specific details will follow in an encyclical.</p>
   <p>Simultaniously the Greek Legation in the United States was commanded by the Secretary of State (minister of foreign affairs) to inform me that The Church of Greece is abiding by and complying with the decision of the Ecumenical Throne, and consequently our National Holy Day of March 25th will be celebrated according to the new calendar.</p>
   <p>Christmas and all other holidays of fixed dates that is like St. Basil, Epiphany, John the Baptist, the Three Hierarchs, St. George, St. Demetrius, Koimisis tis Theotokou, St. Nicholas, and other similar holidays will be held in accordance with the new calendar.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0682.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Exceptions, will be made in holidays of unfixed dates as Easter and others depending upon Easter's date as Penticoste, Ascention, etc. which will be celebrated according to the old calendar.</p>
   <p>We are certain that the mandate of The Ecumenical Throne will delightfully be greeted by the Greek people in America, who were very anxious for such exchange</p>
   <p>The Grace and Mercy of God in trinity be with us all.</p>
   <p>Chicago's Philaretos.</p>
