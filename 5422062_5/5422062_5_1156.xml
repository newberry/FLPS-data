   <p>P.2--Under the supervision of G. S. Dixon, who was appointed by Judge Kavanaugh as commissioner, the election of the Greek community has been held, and the administration of Dr. Papaeliou was defeated all the way through.</p>
   <p>Comments of the city press are many, various, and rather critical and humorous. Except for many disqualifications of voters on both aides, the election was unmarked by any important incident. The defeated president was arrested and fined $300 for refusing to comply with the Court's order to turn over the community's books to Mr. Dixon. The ex-president has turned over to Mr. Dixon all the books except the bank book and the cash book, and for this delinquency he was leniently fined the above sum.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1157.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The newly elected officers and council are as follows: Dr. A. I. Sanitsas, president; K. Karelopoulos, vice-president; I. Stephanou, secretary; Syr. Demas, treasurer. Members of the council are: Dem. Hominakis, I. Procos, N. Mazarakos, Tryphon Argyropoulos, Dem. Flores, I. Crophanopoulos, Paminodas Petropoulos, Dem. Constantinou, St. Spyrakis. All the newly elected officers and members of the council are of the ecclesiastical party which defeated the progressives.</p>
   <p>With the election of the new administration we hope that the turmoil in the Greek community will and, and that Draconian measures will be taken to prevent the recurrence of the unpleasant condition which has prevailed during the three-year administration of Dr. G. Papaeliou and his clique. Hope is eternal; we shall see.</p>
