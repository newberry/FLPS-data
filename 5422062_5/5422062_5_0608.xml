   <p>The vigilant eye of the Vatican's propoganda during the Eucharistoc Congress, was turned to the press, and its desired purpose fulfilled.</p>
   <p>From every part of the land, the publicity was abundant. The Cardinals, from all the Continents, wearing their showy attire, and their expensive gems, were the center of all eyes and activity. A chinese Cardinal who is considered (if any one believes the publicity) the Rockfeller of China, participated in the magnificent ostentention.</p>
   <p>Well done indeed. The Pontifical Prince of the Eucharists was in constant contact with His Holiness the Pope during the four days convention. The Pontif never stopped during the four day Congress, sending daily blessings to Chicago, for its reception and interest in the Eucharistic congress. Very wisely, methodically and mechanically, the Pontif was introduced to the other dogmas, to be acclaimed and recognized as the only representative of Christ.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0609.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At the time the Papal nuncio here was deifying Roman Catholicism and urging other Christians to come and receive the blessings of the Pontif at the celebration; the Pope blazoned to the four corners of the earth that a Greek Patriarch, who came to Rome for that purpose, received his blessings.</p>
   <p>In our previous edition we wrote with authority, about the false annoucement of the Pope.</p>
