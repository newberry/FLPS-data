   <p>p. 1.- Last Saturday four of our countrymen were found dead in a gas-filled room of a cheap boarding house. It is evident these poor men had taken the easier way out. This supposition was strengthened by the lack of any money or valuables in the room. A collection of 50 $ from each Greek was used as funeral expenses. Wouldn't it be better for this collection to have taken place before these unfortunate men had ended their lives? This is a very serious problem which few Greeks are aware of. This tragic accident has brought it close to us that we must do something to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>
   <p>We believe this should be the job of the Greek consulate in Chicago. Many poor, ignorant Greeks come to Chicago, the big city, to earn a living. They are confused and bewildered by everything which is strange to their eyes. They don't know how to find work, they don't know where to go, or what to do.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1545.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It isn't a hard job for the consulate to hire a man who will supply all the needs of the new immigrant. Coffee-houses can be opened which will make the stranger feel at home in a strange land among people who speak his own tongue.</p>
   <p>We owe it to these four, discouraged men to see that future visitors to our city will be well taken care of and protected from the forces which undermined the courage of the four martyrs.</p>
