   <p>[A proposal has been made to centralize control of the various parishes of the Greek Orthodox Church in America, with the following objectives in view:]</p>
   <p>1. To regulate wages of priests in all the parishes.</p>
   <p>2. To prevent an undesirable priest, who has been asked to resign from one parish, from being accepted by another.</p>
   <p>3. To rearrange the parishes so that the entire city may be covered and no section be without a parish.</p>
   <p>4. To standardize the ritual, and to settle certain questions which cause trouble among the parishes.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0836.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If the Holy Synod of Greece, for reasons either religious or political, does not see fit to send us a bishop to govern the hundred Orthodox churches in America, why shouldn't the governing boards of the churches themselves attempt to improve matters? Today, governments are established by the people. Of course the religious aspects are supposed to be taken care of by those "on high". But, since we await help from "on high" to no avail, it is our duty to insure the life and progress of our Orthodox Church to the best of our ability.</p>
   <p>By this I mean that the one hundred parishes in America should have a centralized control which would determine policies and regulate use of certain sacred rituals. Certain priests take advantage of the present disunited condition of the churches, and aid in the formation of cliques and groups which, by fighting against one another, prevent unification and agreement. When these priests become unwelcome they simply exchange places with some other priest. If the churches were united, this could not happen. A priest doing anything wrong in one parish would be forbidden to wear the robe, and he would be judged by a central council.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0837.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A regulation salary would prevent certain priests from making the rounds of the churches in order to discover the most lucrative parish. An example of this sort of conduct can be found in the case of our own Reverend A. Mandilaris, who left Chicago and went to Kansas City, and from there to Salt Lake City; we do not doubt that he will have completed his tour of America within five years. Unification of the parishes will prevent such a thing from occurring. Each priest will be assigned to a parish, and will not be answerable merely to himself or to the parish for his actions. He will be directly responsible to the central group...</p>
   <p>When this centralization takes place, a great burden will have been lifted from the shoulders of our people.</p>
   <p>We editors of Saloniki are trying to illuminate this condition, not because we are scandalmongers, but because our hearts ache for the plight of the Greek churches.</p>
