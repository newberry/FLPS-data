   <p>Washington, D. C. November 4, 1923.</p>
   <p>The corpse of George Dilboy of Massachusetts, declared by the United States War Department one of the world's greatest heroes, will be buried with full military honors in Arlington Cemetery.</p>
   <p>Officers of the Army and fellow soldiers will participate in honoring the memory of George Dilboy, to whom Congress awarded a medal of honor for distinguished courage. He was killed in action at the battle of Belleau Woods in France.</p>
   <p>George Dilboy lost his life in the Belleau Woods. His body was sent to his parents' place of residence, Alasata, Turkey, where the Turkish soldiers removed the American flag and dishonored the dead body. This incident caused <pb facs="5422062_5_1259.jpg" n="2"/>diplomatic friction between the United States and Turkey. The corpse of George Dilboy was sent to be buried in the United States at the request of his parents.</p>
   <p>To-day the War Department submitted its plans for the burial ceremony with the following note:</p>
   <p>"The history of the heroism of this young soldier of Greek descent is glorious. The squad to which he was attached was under the constant fire of German machineguns to such an extent that the second lieutenant could not see any way by which they could reach the machine-gun nest. A lad with an automatic pistol in hand jumped up and said,</p>
   <p>"Lieutenant, may I have the honor of wiping out that nest?"</p>
   <p>This young man, who was no other than Dilboy, lay prone upon the ground and so advanced by crawling [toward the nest], killing many machine-gunners with his automatic pistol. In his advance he was twice wounded by the Germans; he did not stop to think about himself but kept on going. When he reached his <pb facs="5422062_5_1260.jpg" n="3"/>destination, he found that two Germans remained alive.</p>
   <p>As he rose the continuous shooting by the German cut off his right leg. Again he fell prone and advanced, assisted by his left heel. He turned his head and shot the remaining two Germans.</p>
   <p>Lying on one side and raising his right hand, he gave his squadron the signal to advance and died with a smile on his face.</p>
