   <p>P-1. In our previous article we stated that since the diplomatic relations between the United States and Greece are not in a condition to warrant the arrival of the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs, the proposed visit of Mr. Michalacopoulos to this country is entirely unnecessary.</p>
   <p>On the other hand there are many reasons to warrant visists by other Greek Ministers for the purpose of investigating and studying matters which are of great concern both to the Greek nation and to the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>Some of these matters are; economic and racial problems relating to the preservation of the Greek race in America.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America, ever since the beginning of their emigration, have been as they are today, a great economic factor for Greece. The people of Greece <pb facs="5422062_5_1746.jpg" n="2"/>are well aware of this fact, and in many Greek circles these remittances made by the Greeks in the United States to the people of Greece are evidently a topic of frequent discussion.</p>
   <p>Hellenism in America has been productive soil for Greece. This soil has bountifully yielded rich fruit for Greece without Greece's applying the least effort to its cultivation.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately Greece has not yet realized that it is essential to take measures to prolong and increase these frequent remittances from Greeks in America, which have contributed immensely to the stability of the Greek nation.</p>
   <p>The only effort made by officials and by private citizens of Greece has been to sanction the collection of contributions for various causes. But the collection of contributions is not the alpha and omega of our economic policy.</p>
   <p>It is evident that the remittances made to Greece for various purposes <pb facs="5422062_5_1747.jpg" n="3"/>by the Greeks in America have considerably diminished, and it is about time for the people of Greece to study this most important and serious problem and to discover ways and means to cultivate this fruitful colony, which is known as the "Hellenism of America". This soil of American Hellenism is not capable of spontaneously bearing fruit forever, and before long it will cease to be an economic factor for Greece. This problem which requires serious study, should be taken up by the Minister of Finance and not by the ministry of foreign affairs.</p>
   <p>It is preferable therefore that Greece should send another minister, the Minister of Finance, so that he may properly study the economic problems of the Greeks of America, - a matter of great concern to Greece.</p>
   <p>There exists, at present, another important reason for a visit of the Minister of Finance to the United States.</p>
   <p>This is the fact that the Government of Greece will be represented at the <pb facs="5422062_5_1748.jpg" n="4"/>international exposition to be held in Chicago in 1933. This matter which requires serious study, falls under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Finance and will be an important factor in increasing Greek commerce with the United States, and this increase in commerce would indirectly augment the remittances to Greece.</p>
   <p>Of what use will Mr. Michalacopoulos' be in these matters, which are entirely foreign to his activities and do not fall under his jurisdiction?</p>
   <p>We wish to emphasize the fact that the economic problems of the Greeks in America are a serious matter and require the attention of the proper minister, who in this case is Mr. Vurloumis , not Mr. Michalacopoulos.</p>
   <p>To judge by the sentiments of the Greeks in America, Mr. Michalacopoulos is of all people the person least adequate for the study of these problems.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1749.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>He is a man of grave temperament, who does not like to mingle with the masses, whereas Mr. Vurloumis is a man of more sympathetic nature, better adapted to deal with the Greeks in America, who in their present environment have developed a type of mind which could not be reconciled to the aloofness of Mr. Michalacopoulos.</p>
   <p>American politicians, especially government officials of high rank are simple and democratic, in contrast to our Greek officials, who still abide by ancient customs and endeavor to impose their superiority on people of ordinary rank. On the other hand the Greeks in America, in spite of their feeling of independence and their political liberty, are ready to render all due honor and respect to a minister, regardless of the fact that he too, is a mere mortal.</p>
   <p>For the reasons stated above, we believe that the long postponed visit of the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs to the United States will produce no practical results. Mr. Michalacopoulos, who merely wishes to find an excuse to <pb facs="5422062_5_1750.jpg" n="6"/>visit America for his own satisfaction, has from all indications been inspired by the "supreme governors" of the Order AHEPA, a Greek fraternal organization existing in the United States, which recently visited Greece, and presumed to express not only the sentiments of the Greeks in America but also those of the United States Government! Perhaps it was these officials who made him believe that the entire population in this country is waiting to welcome him with open arms. How else can we interpret Mr. Michalacopoulos' ardent desire to visit this country and the grief which he has so many times expressed that he is "again forced to postpone his trip to the United States because of other business?"</p>
   <p>One of the motives which prompted our present comment on the proposed visit of Mr. Michalacopoulos in the capacity of Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs is, our desire to assure him that there is no apparent reason for his anxiety about his oft-postponed trip- the postponement due to "other business" - because the fact is that the present state of diplomatic relations between the United States Government and Greece does <pb facs="5422062_5_1751.jpg" n="7"/>not warrant a visit by the Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs. There are however,other matters that would justify the visit of a minister of Greece, but these matters are not under the jurisdiction of Mr. Michalacopoulos; therefore, even if he postpones indefinitely his proposed visit to the United States, no loss will ensue. It is a farce, if we may so express it, for a Minister of Foreign Affairs to contemplate visiting a foreign nation withoutany apparent reason.</p>
   <p>Aside from all this, however, we wish to assure Mr. Michalacopoulos that when at last he relinquishes his important "business duties" and decides to visit us, the Greeks in America and we, above all will feel gratified and honored by his visit because we steadfastly believe that Greek government officials, besides attending to their regular duties, should make it a point to visit the Greek populace of America and to study its problems.</p>
   <p>In our next article we shall comment on another Greek minister whose presence in this country, in our opinion, is indispensable.</p>
