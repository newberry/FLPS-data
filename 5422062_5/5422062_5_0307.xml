<title level="a">THE QUESTION OF THE RETIRED HIERARCHS OF AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>p. 1- The definite appointment of the hierarchs of America to positions in Greece has been postponed again by the Holy Synod for a purely legal reason, namely, that hierarchs who do not belong to the Church of Greece cannot be assigned to Greek metropolitan areas. In order that the retired hierarchs may be appointed to metropolitan areas in Greece proper, this rule must be abrogated, and this can be done by legislative enactment.</p>
   <p>According to information from Athens some way will be found to overcome this obstacle .. but we do not think that this is a reason serious enough for long postponement of the departure of the hierarchs from America and suspension of the definite settlement of our church question.</p>
   <p>The Church of Greece, in order to facilitate matters, promised long ago temporary appointments for the retired bishops, and we have not the slightest doubt that what was promised will be carried out, but at the same time we believe that the doubt expressed regarding the fulfilment <pb facs="5422062_5_0308.jpg" n="2"/>of the promises once the legal barriers are removed is equivalent to showing bad faith toward the Government and the Legate, not to say that it amounts to disobedience, for it is a fact that the bishops have been ordered to leave America, and when they, superior dignitaries as they are, do not obey the orders of their church authority, how is it possible to uphold the Church's dignity, and what sort of example have they set for subordinate clergyman and laymen to follow?</p>
