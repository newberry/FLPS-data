   <p>Willingness and sincerity of desire have made a much-talked-of possibility become a fact.</p>
   <p>The purchase of the church from Mr. George Sellas is a fact. The would-be subscribers and the selfish interests have failed. That which could not be accomplished in twenty years by hundreds of the intelligentsia has been done and paid for by twenty uneducated men.</p>
   <p>Twenty men who received their training in the "School of Life and Experience" and not in any university were unselfishly willing to make the necessary sacrifices. These twenty men, tired of waiting for the "social lights" to accomplish something, decided that the church must be bought. So they bought it. They organized themselves into a legal body, and each one began to reach into his pockets to take out five-hundred, and one-thousand dollar bills. Do you hear that? They took out $13,050 in cash--a sum which would not have been <pb facs="5422062_5_0782.jpg" n="2"/>collected by subscription in a hundred years.....</p>
   <p>The rest of the money will be raised by means of stock, which we are sure will be sold in entirety during the first week it appears. This is called accomplishment and the Saloniki is in favor of such fine accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The church will be called "Koimisis Tis Theotokou".</p>
