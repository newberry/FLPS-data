   <p>p. 4 -- The United States's break with Germany is a matter of time. It will undoubtedly come very, very soon. It is the duty of all the Greeks of America to respond immediately to the call of our adopted country. Especial attention is called to those who participated in the Balkan wars. Let them take the lead and form crack regiments with trained veterans and glorify the Greek name under the Stars and Stripes.</p>
   <p>Of all the Greek societies in Chicago the Cretan Fraternity was the first one to wire our President their willingness and readiness to serve the United States when need be.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to our brave fellow-Greeks. We are, as a race, Greeks, and will remain so, but America is our country, America is our home, our estate, our family, our church, our education, and everything we possess. Therefore, it is our holy duty to fight and protect our country,which is <pb facs="5422062_5_1319.jpg" n="2"/>our life.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly the rest of the societies will fall in line when the time comes, but the Cretans proved once more that they do not wait to follow; they lead. Bravo, Cretans!</p>
