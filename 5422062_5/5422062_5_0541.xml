   <p>p. 1. Fortunately our church matters still seem to interest God who, with so much kindness, comes to awaken us from our torpor and injects new life and energy within us.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, great activity is presaged for this week, since to the prelates that are coming to Chicago there will also be a fourth - His Holiness of San Francisco. In order to welcome them, however, it is highly probable that Vasilios, too, will come here, thereby making Chicago the center of all the ecclesiastical matters in America.</p>
   <p>Five prelates in all will be in Chicago; no insignificant fact, to be sure.</p>
   <p>Now, how does it happen that all five are coming to Chicago? Perhaps it is just pure coincidence, or perhaps it is premeditated,-they are going to get together to form a ecumenical synod which will solve all ecclesiastical problems.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0542.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many are discussing this impending meeting. Well-informed circles believe that great deeds will be accomplished in our community. We assure our readers that we will always be prepared to report on any of these great deeds.</p>
   <p>The Contradictor.</p>
