   <p>Among the Greek newspapers we find an interesting opinion set forth by the editor of the Chicago Greek Star, who says: "We are in full accord with the opinion of some of the officials at Washington that selection of admissible immigrants should be made abroad and not here, thus obviating unnecessary expense for trips to New York, trouble for the immigration authorities, and the unpleasantness now experienced by some unfortunate aliens who after landing on Ellis Island are not permitted to enter America and become part of this great country, where millions of men, women, and children have found home, work, and protection under the American flag.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1463.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"In selecting immigrants abroad the authorities should not be influenced in any way by politicians, and those who are selected should be healthy and sane and willing to contribute their share to Greater America.</p>
   <p>"The United States is a country of three million square miles, and in such an area millions of people from Europe can be absorbed and perform useful labor for the benefit of all concerned.</p>
   <p>"We believe that preference should not be given to the northern races because we feel that when selective immigration is employed, an equally good selection can be made among the races of the South.</p>
   <p>"To our own people, the Greeks, America can offer no objection, for the Greeks have contributed largely to literature, to science, and to business, and their patriotism during the war has proved them to be 100 per cent loyal.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1464.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"We are also in favor of fixing the admission quota at 3 per cent or over, and when we have selected immigration, we shall undoubtedly have selected Americans, and they will prove just as faithful to the land of their adoption as these who landed on American soil years ago and are now part of this great commonwealth."</p>
