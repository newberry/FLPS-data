   <p>p. 1- The Greeks of Chicago have decided to be fully represented in the Congress of Communities in New York.</p>
   <p>At first the communities here did not give serious consideration to the matter, and the idea of proxy representation took root. Through discussion and the development of different points of view the original idea has been changed, and it is now considered necessary that all communities shall send representatives.</p>
   <p>That is precisely what should be done, for it would not be right for Chicago to fail to send representatives and express its opinion on matters so vitally important to the organization of Hellenism in America.</p>
   <p>According to information received by us every community in Chicago will be represented by its own delegate, and most important of all, they will formulate a plan for united action and will thus present a solid front in the congress.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0180.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Such a decision was imperative, since those of New York, as indicated by the plans which they have laid out, were unfortunately desirous of claiming everything for themselves and of ruling all the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>The fact that the opinions of the laity coincide with those of the clergy and that there is no question of sacerdotal rule, as was originally believed, is satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Of such cooperation we have been always ardent advocates, and we believe that cooperation between clergy and laity is possible, provided that both sides have their courses of action outlined and do not forget the saying, "Every man in his place."</p>
   <p>We firmly believe that the cooperation of clergy and laity will facilitate the task of both, for the benefit of our communal and ecclesiastical interests, and that this comgress, comprising these two elements, will become the starting point of sincere cooperation between them.</p>
