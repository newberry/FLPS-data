   <p>p. 3- After three years of litigation the Greek community of Chicago last summer was ordered by Judge Kavanaugh to hold a new election supervised by an election commissioner appointed by the court. The community has elected a new president, new officials, and a new board of governors under the supervision of the Greek consul general. Peace, order, and progress have followed last summer's election. Now comes the new decision of another court of equity which voids the election ordered by Judge Kavanaugh. The breathing-spell allowed to our harassed community was of short duration.</p>
   <p>The ex-president of the community, Dr. G. Papaeliou, who has never ceased to push the litigation, announced the other day that according to the new decision of the court the election of last summer has been invalidated and nullified, and that he (Dr. Papaeliou) is still the president of the community.</p>

   <p>The Star, not wishing to comment on the court's decision nor to drag the already soiled linen of the past presidency into the light of publicity again, will repeat for the benefit of those who are trying to rock the boat of the community the following saying: "In national or religious quarrels victory won by court's decision is not glorious victory."</p>
