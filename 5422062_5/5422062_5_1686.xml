   <p>Of the many curious customs of the ancient Spartans we note the following.</p>
   <p>Forbearance, for the Spartan of that period, was considered a crime. Any person showing forbearance toward injustice done to him, was called before a magistrate, severely reprimanded and fined, as Plutarch states.</p>
   <p>Among other curious things was the tolerance shown towards stealing of food. That was not considered a crime, unless the person stealing was caught in the act. Then he was carried in a procession and severely flogged. The authorities of ancient Sparta tolerated stealing, as is stated by authentic historians, as when on a war expedition soldiers were permitted to steal alien food in order to feed themselves.</p>
