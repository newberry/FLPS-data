   <p>P. 1. Next Sunday, May 13th, the New Generation Society of young women will celebrate Mother's Day.</p>
   <p>The second Sunday of May has been set aside in America as Mother's Day.</p>
   <p>There are many holidays set aside in America, but Mother's Day is the sweetest and the holiest one we have. There is nothing sweeter and holier in the world. Even the most savage and brutal of men experiences the sweetest emotions when hearing the name of mother, and the remembrance of her gives him the happiest moments of his life.</p>
   <p>The consecration of this holiday among Greeks is also an imperative duty, and the good girls of the new generation deserve the heartiest congratulations for proving by this action of theirs, the noble sentiments, respect, and love which they cherish for the sweetest and most sacred being in the world.</p>
   <p>The Mother's Day festival which the girls of the New Generation Society are celebrating for the second time, this year, will be held at the Morrison Hotel, Sunday, May 13th, at 3 P.M. The program will be varied with speeches, recitals <pb facs="5422062_5_0503.jpg" n="2"/>and songs. Tea will be served and dancing will follow.</p>
   <p>The most select members of our community will be there, we are informed; and we have no doubt that they will show their love and respect for their mothers by contributing toward the full success of this splendid celebration.</p>
