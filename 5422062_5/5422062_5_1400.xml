   <p>The scarcity of laborers was felt in the big cities of industry and commerce. The City of Chicago, being one of those effected, was receiving the pioneers of immigration, with open arms. The city's population was about 150, 000 souls when the first Greeks made their appearance.</p>
   <p>According to Dr. Volikos the first Greeks came in the year of 1856. A group of them,(fishermen) in row boats, came up the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan and established their shelter at the shores of our city. They were islanders, fishermen by occupation, and intercommunicants of the southern parts of Europe and of Italy.</p>
   <p>In the year of the great fire, 1871, there were many Greek in Chicago, although scattered over the city. During the year of the Columbian exposition, 1893, the Greeks began to organize, in spite of their small numbers. When the late Most Rev. Dionysios Lattas, Bishop of Zante, came as a visitor to the exposition, the Greeks had their first church "Annunciation of Virgin Mary" at <pb facs="5422062_5_1401.jpg" n="2"/>Union and Randolph Streets, on the third floors of a frame house, where they held religious services. In that church, the above mentioned bishop officiated with the assistance of the priest of the Church, named Pan Fiampolis, a native of Ithaca.</p>
   <p>Two years later that church, under the same name, was established at Kedzie Avenue and Clark Street in a beautiful Masonic Hall. The duration of the church in that edifice did not last very long. The division between the Spartans and the Arcadians forced the church to close its doors under financial duress. However, a new church under the name of "Holy Trinity," at the year of 1898, was bought by the Arcadians, for $22,500 and with a new priest named Papathanasis, and began to function.</p>
