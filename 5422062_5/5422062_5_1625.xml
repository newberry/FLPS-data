   <p>It may seem strange to ask the question appearing at the head of today's article; many would answer, certainly there are Greek royalists in America.</p>
   <p>However, we doubt that it is possible for people to live in America and still believe in Monarchy, for the simple reason that these people cannot be of this epoch nor can they have a conception of contemporary life and conditions.</p>
   <p>There are worshipers of King Constantine here and those who hate Venizelos; there are people yet believing that the military movements and political irregularities in Greece are due to Democracy; there are people that still really believe that the institution of Monarchy is impossible. If we go to the bottom of things and investigate, we will find that the so-called Royalists have a different motive that sets them into motion as Royalists than the motive which prompts them to have faith in the institution of Monarchy.</p>
   <p>If we examine this argument we will find that it is groundless, altogether, and that it refutes itself. Democracy is not a system of government only, but an ideology..... and he who believes in the Democracy of America cannot <pb facs="5422062_5_1626.jpg" n="2"/>believe in a Monarchy for Greece. You may as well believe in Orthodoxy when in Greece; Mussulmanism (Mohammedanism) when in Turkey; and Buddhism when in India ........It is ridiculous to claim that the Greek people are not yet prepared for Democracy; it would be an insult to our race if we were, even for a moment, considered as inferior to others that have adopted the Democratic form of government.</p>
   <p>As to those who argue that you can have Democracy, with a King in the place of a president, and that there is no difference, whether a supreme archon is to follow by succession rather than by the choice of the people, we can simply tell them that if the President and the King are the same thing, then why have a King? (Translators note: Examples are cited from historical data of Greece against Kings and their cliques).</p>
   <p>It is ridiculous to want to make a comparison between a real Democracy and a Royalist Democracy, so lightly, and conclude that there is no difference whatever.</p>
   <p>The contentions of the Greek royalists in America are totally without a ground. The Royalists should open their eyes and try to synchronize themselves <pb facs="5422062_5_1627.jpg" n="3"/>with things as they are; understand that they live in the twentieth century in a country where the spirit of Democrary guides everything, and realize that Kings and institutions of Monarchy are historic events of the past, of an epoch that has gone never to return.</p>
