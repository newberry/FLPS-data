<title level="a">THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE LACEDAEMONIANS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>p. 1- The Chicago League of Lacedaemonians came forward today with a communication expressing the opinions of its members on our ecclesiastical problems. This communication will be found on the second page.</p>
   <p>The Lacedaemonians were moved to indite this letter by the publication in the Greek Star of an article censuring the Laconian deputy, Mr. Petrakakos. They present their ideas on our church problems, disapproving of the ecclesiastical policy of Rodostolos and Consul General Depasta, denying Mr. Lambros's right to interpret the ideas of the Lacedaemonians, and finally endorsing the policies of Mr. Petrakakos.</p>
   <p>The Chicago League of Lacedaemonians in commenting on our ecclesiastical matters demands a quick solution of the scandalous controversy which has distressed us for so many years. Like the Greek Professional Men's Club, it openly expresses opinion of our church affairs, and the statements of <pb facs="5422062_5_0546.jpg" n="2"/>these two organizations are worthy of note because in them the Greek community at large reveals its position in an important controversy. The parishes have for a long time been expressing their opinions on this subject. It would be highly beneficial if all clubs would assert themselves and give to the public their ideas on the subject of the Rodostolos churches.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the members of the League of Lacedaemonians on their frankness, and we hope that the other clubs will follow their example.</p>
   <p>The Contradictor.</p>
