   <p>The last general meeting of the members of Assumption of the Virgin parish was very turbulent and astonishing because of the revelation that conditions in the parish were not what they had seemed to be. Right after the meeting had been called to order by the president, Mr. Andritsopoulos, a motion was made to elect two representatives of the parish to the convention of clergy and laity, and because the president was nominated as candidate, he withdrew from the chair, and then it was revealed that the vice-president and six more members of the board had resigned a few days before, and the treasurer likewise.</p>
   <p>So Mr. Lymperes, the secretary, took the chair as temporary presiding officer during the election of the representatives, and after the election of the president, he again took the chair to preside over the meeting. The venerable <pb facs="5422062_5_0037.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. George Sellas declined to be a candidate for representative.</p>
   <p>The president thanked the members for his election and asked the co-operation of all and especially that of his opponent, Mr. John Kolliopoulos, who declined to accord it, saying that their views were at variance on many subjects, and that there was no chance for co-operation on the matter of their stand at the convention. After this somebody took the floor and asked the president to declare openly that after the convention a general meeting would be called to vote on the constitution of the Archdiocese, since conditions at present are doubtful and vague; some want [the Archdiocese], and some do not, for it has not been voted on by any general meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Geo. Manos...took the floor and asked for an explanation of the resignation of the vice-president, the treasurer, and the other members of the board; [these resignations, said he,] were a surprise to the members of the meeting, who wished to know what was going on behind the scenes of the adminstration of the church.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0038.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The president said that they were present and might speak for themselves; so he asked the ex-vice-president to report to the meeting on the reasons for the resignations.</p>
   <p>The ex-vice-president said that all the ex-members of the board had authorized the treasurer to be their spokesman, and that they would abide by his statements.</p>
   <p>The floor was then given to Mr. Soteras, the ex-treasurer, who stated to the members that he and his colleagues had resigned because they did not agree with the other members of the board about complying with the decisions taken by the former board; that they had signed [their promise] to carry out [these provisions] and were bound to do so, but the others did not want to comply with them.</p>
   <p>The most important decision is that about the priest, over which the disagreement among the members occurred. It was decided a long time ago to dismiss the pastor, the Reverend C. Papanikolaou, and for this purpose a special <pb facs="5422062_5_0039.jpg" n="4"/>committee was formed to see him and persuade him to submit his resignation rather than to let him be dismissed.</p>
   <p>This decision, however, was not carried out because the pastor had succeeded at the last election in having his own partisans chosen, among them his brother, and thereafter had obtained a leave of absence for four months, going to the old country and leaving his successor to await his return.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, that is to say, because the priest has had his own way and has not paid any attention to the board, doing as he pleases, especially since the last convention of clergy and laity, because he cares only for himself and not for the church, and because the other members of the board take sides with the priest, all who disagreed with these policies had resigned.</p>
   <p>The president then stated that the decision to dismiss the pastor had been adopted by a vote of 8 to 7, and...somebody shouted:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0040.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"You are a liar!"</p>
   <p>The former president, Mr. John Koliopoulos, asked to see the minutes and said that the remembered that the vote was 9 to 7, and that after the arrival of Mr. Art Papantoniou from Cicero the vote was 10 to 7.</p>
   <p>In looking over the minutes he discovered that the ink [used to write] the figures was different from that used for the rest of the record, and [this discovery] forced the secretary to state that there was not any forgery or alteration, but that he wrote the figures in after writing the minutes!</p>
   <p>Mr. Geo. Koletes took the floor to explain why their decision was not complied with and said that in order to dismiss the priest, the Archdiocese must have a written complaint signed by one of the members of the board, and since nobody was willing to sign it, this decision was not carried out; that was why the former president, Mr. John Koliopoulos, had resigned.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koliopoulos asked that all the minutes of the various sessions which <pb facs="5422062_5_0041.jpg" n="6"/>concerned the priest might be read.</p>
   <p>The president after this reading asked that all the minutes be read, and the correspondence with the Archdiocese concerning this matter, so that the members might form a clear opinion.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Tyrovolas, one of the ex-members of the board, took the floor and said:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen, we came here to investigate the condition of our parish. You see that the parish is divided on account of the priest. If that priest had had a sense of honor, a sense of responsibility, [he would have realized that] his duty was to get away and let us alone and not to do everything to stay in spite of those who do not like him. A priest who has not the respect and esteem of one hundred per cent of his parishioners has no place in that parish. Here we have the example of a priest who, when almost half his parishioners like him, and the other half do not, tries to remain; this shows that he has no sense of honor, duty, or responsibility."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0042.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Mr. Pikras, another ex-member of the board, took the floor and said that since he had come to this parish, [the priest] had not added a single nail to the church but had always looked out for his pocketbook, and that so he had succeeded in dividing the parish.</p>
   <p>"Look what he did; he went away and concealed the covers of the Holy Alter instead of surrendering them to the board or to the caretaker."</p>
   <p>At this point an old woman, Mrs. Konkles, shouted:</p>
   <p>"They are inside the church, and nobody took them, neither the priest nor anybody else."</p>
   <p>"How do you know it?" shouted another old woman behind her, and we almost had a fight among the few women who were present at this surprisingly turbulent meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0043.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>Somebody else took the floor and said,</p>
   <p>"Look, gentlemen, where we have arrived on account of the priest. Mr. Lymperes and Mr. John Koliopoulos were the best of friends. Look at them now; and the same thing has happened to quite a few. Is it right that the whole parish should suffer because of that priest? The people of Cicero do not attend this church because they dislike the priest."</p>
   <p>After many similar revelations and attacks against one another, with remarks and explanations added, the priest's brother tried to justify their absent pastor, but the president closed the meeting with the statement that after the convention of clergy and laity a general meeting would be called to decide these important questions, and that he would not again be a candidate for any office in the parish.</p>
   <p>This was the result of the friction between the members of the parish and the <pb facs="5422062_5_0044.jpg" n="9"/>priest which began after the first convention of clergy and laity. The conditions pictured in this parish meeting are similar to those in most Greek communities because of the fact that since this first convention the parishes cannot dismiss or suspend the priest without the consent of the Archbishop.</p>
   <p>It seems that according to the charter of the Greek Archdiocese the various boards have been reduced to collectors of money for the priests, who do everything which they choose without any fear of punishment from those who pay them.</p>
