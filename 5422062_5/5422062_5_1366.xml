   <p>The Sons of Pericles, a junior organization of the Ahepa, is making preparations for a unique entertainment program to take place at their dance to be given in the beautiful ballroom of the Blackstone Hotel on Friday evening, January 6.</p>
   <p>The committee, composed of well-known Greek youths, is as follows: Theodore Sarris, Peter Tatooles, John Lemperis, Nicholas Boolookas, and John Floros.</p>
   <p>They are planning a program of especial interest to the fair sex, because of the popularity contest in progress.</p>
   <p>The committee has decided that the girl selling the most tickets and receiving the greatest number of votes at the dance will have the distinction of being called "the most popular Greek girl in Chicago."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1367.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is truly an honor near to the heart of every girl.</p>
   <p>In connection with the honor, a wrist watch will be given as first prize to the fortunate young lady. There are also two other interesting prizes that will be given to those who win second and third place.</p>
   <p>Dancing will be the featured entertainment of the evening, and some unusual stunts will be performed by the members of the organization.</p>
   <p>This is the first ball that the Sons of Pericles have given and they are eager to impress on our people that "the first impression is a lasting impression."</p>
