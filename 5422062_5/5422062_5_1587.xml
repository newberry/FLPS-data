   <p>Some newspapers in the Greek capital and in other European countries have printed articles picturing the condition of the unskilled worker in America as "intolerable slavery." They have further represented the American capitalist in conspicuous colors as a leech of enormous size sucking the blood of ignorant immigrants who have been lured to the land of the free by fantastic stories of wealth and of fancy standards of living.</p>
   <p>The Greek Star of Chicago, which has gained a large circulation in Greece, takes exception to these untrue stories and as it usually does, hastens to correct the inaccuracies for the benefit and enlightenment of Greeks abroad.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1588.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Since the majority of the Greeks who enter this country are employed as unskilled laborers, and since these Greeks are part of the whole mass of unskilled immigrants, we will draw a line of limitation and deal specifically with the Greek unskilled laborers to confute the inaccurate statements published abroad.</p>
   <p>First of all, the United States of America is known all over the world as the most advanced democratic country in the whole civilized world. This statement is not hearsay nor idle words but an indubitable fact. That is why the eyes and the hopes of those in need are focused upon this land of liberty, justice, and equality.</p>
   <p>There is no other country on earth which can guarantee and provide for all these three divine privileges--liberty, equality, and justice. Every sovereign, every government, and every diplomat of the world knows that beyond any reasonable doubt America is the great champion of these principles.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1589.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And all the pseudo-rulers and would-be democratic governments of the world tremble at the sound of the mighty voice of the American Republic proclaiming liberty, equality, and justice.</p>
   <p>Jealousy, hatred, and prejudice are common to those who are not blest with the light of truth; ignorance with its disastrous results is common to those who refuse to be illumined by the shining beam of knowledge; and people afflicted with these faults are bound to condemn any and all good things and true under the sun. It is not therefore surprising to read in some of these European papers that black is white and vice versa.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1590.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If the defamatory articles were not written with deliberate purpose to deceive but through ignorance, there still is no excuse for them.</p>
   <p>The immigrant Greek arriving in this country is compelled by his obligations to his family, by his imperative duty to society, by his self-respect, and by his instinct of self-preservation to seek employment. Is he a stone-mason, a mechanic, a plumber, or anything that falls in the category of skilled labor? No! He is not. Does he speak English? No! But he must find a job and earn money if he is not to become a criminal. Naturally he will get a job that does not require skill nor the knowledge of English.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1591.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It is true that he performs the worst sort of manual labor, but he is not prepared, or fit for anything else.</p>
   <p>He is thankful to God that he finds something by which he may earn money honestly. He is also thankful--or if he is not, he ought to be--to the greatness of this democratic country. By reason of his earning capacity and his station in life his standard of living is not equal to that of the skilled laborer, and the skilled laborer's standard of living is not equal to that of the man of still higher earning capacity, and so on.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1592.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The intelligent Greek unskilled laborer (and this applies to all intelligent unskilled laborers) keeps his eyes and ears open and soon learns a trade. His English is improved, his earning capacity is increased, his station of life changes, and he advances to a higher standard of living.</p>
   <p>The opportunity is given to him without discrimination, and because of his intelligence the insignificant unskilled worker of yesterday has become a "somebody" today. Where in the world except in America is the same opportunity granted to millions of immigrants coming into a country to make their living! Nowhere else, of course!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1593.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Why the hue and cry about the "intolerable slavery" of the unskilled worker in America? Let us impartially examine the conditions and the standard of living of the unskilled worker in other countries, and what do we find! The Star does not wish to print the account of the condition in other countries not only of unskilled workers but even of skilled workers. Everybody who wants to know knows their condition and that if there is "intolerable slavery" anywhere, it is not in America.</p>
   <p>Plutocrats all over the world have as a rule the same code and apply the same methods; they amass fortunes by the sweat of the underdog's brow. Without exaggerating the facts we may say that with very few exceptions the American plutocrat is at least half human, while the plutocrats of the rest of the world are pictured as behaving like blood-thirsty beasts in the accumulation of wealth.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1594.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>We, as impartial observers and expounders of truth, do not agree with the universal conception of the plutocrat. The man who knows how to make and save money is a useful citizen and especially useful in our present stage of civilization. The moneyed man in any country, in spite of his wickedness, is useful to society, for factories, shops, railroads, are founded by his accumulated wealth, and the moguls of America have been a hundred years ahead of other moneyed men, for they have created useful, beneficial, and uplifting things in America that cannot be found anywhere else. And he, the American plutocrat, living in America and breathing American air, has made the standard of living in America the highest in all the civilized world.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1595.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>The American unskilled laborer of today is therefore not in a state of "intolerable slavery," as the press of some European countries has pictured him, but he is a king compared with the unskilled laborer of any other country.</p>
