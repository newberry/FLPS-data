   <p>Loxias for the first time in its history will go against its established rule and meddle in the affairs of a community. Because of the destruction by fire of Holy Trinity church the community is rent asunder with discussions for and against a new and larger church.</p>
   <p>Some maintain that the community cannot afford to build a new church and that consequently it is necessary to repair what is left of the old one. Others say that a new and much better church must be built to meet the growing needs of the community, and as to the cost, which according to plans will exceed $80,000 the community's credit is good, and it can borrow the money needed.</p>
   <p>The discussions pro and con are so heated that an explosion may occur at any time. Both sides of the argument are absolutely right. Those of one faction are very conservative, knowing that the treasury has no money for a new church and averring that we must be contented with the necessary repairs, etc., until the treasury is in a flourishing condition.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0823.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>old church building is in a poor and dirty neighborhood, it should be sold. The governing council of the church is going to examine this suggestion further, and decide whether or not it should be accepted.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki feels free to express its own opinion of this plan of building a new church. In the first place, the burning of the old church gives the Greek church the opportunity of withdrawing from a neighborhood that, to put it mildly, reflects upon the entire Greek community.</p>
   <p>Another meeting will be called next month in order to hear the report of the committee.</p>
