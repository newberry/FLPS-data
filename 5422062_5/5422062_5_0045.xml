<title level="a">SESSIONS OF THE CLERGY-LAITY CONVENTION STARTED YESTERDAY</title><title level="a" type="sub">244 Communities are Represented</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Church of "Evangelismos," Annunciation of the Virgin, has been a busy place since last Sunday, when Archbishop Athenagoras held Mass there.</p>
   <p>The Clergy-Laity Convention is being held there. From early yesterday, all comers were bothered with the distribution of various publications and pamphlets and especially the irksome insistence of the representatives of the communistic paper, Empros.</p>
   <p>It seems that all the representatives are sensitive and very active, and there is plenty of dynamite ready for explosion at this convention.</p>
   <p>Long before the beginning of the sessions, a priest and a lawyer almost exchanged blows for some misunderstanding regarding the attitude of the <pb facs="5422062_5_0046.jpg" n="2"/>Bolsheviki, and two other clergymen started a dispute in an angry way exchanging words, insults and threats, unbecoming to clergymen.</p>
   <p>All this occurred before the sessions started. They delayed the opening a little in order to register all the representatives.</p>
   <p>The office reported yesterday, that 244 Greek Communities have sent representatives. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon the registration was complete and the first session started with convocation and mass by Archbishop Athenagoras.</p>
   <p>After the announcement of the beginning of the sessions, by the President-Archbishop Athenagoras, a motion was made to elect four secretaries of the convention, two from the clergy and two from the laity. And right then and there we have the first incident of disturbance in the convention which seems likely to be a very turbulent one. When Mr. G. Kyriakopoulos, a lawyer, moved to nominate Mr. G. Drossos as one of the secretaries, Mr. <pb facs="5422062_5_0047.jpg" n="3"/>Heliopoulos, the teacher, objected with such impropriety and shameless expressions, that the convention unanimously shouted "Put him out - put him out," and a few rushed to attack him.</p>
   <p>The presiding Archbishop scolded the offender and called him from the floor. The election of Mr. Drossos was offered by acclamation, as nobody supported the malevolent objection.</p>
   <p>It is a pity for the class of the Greek teachers to have among them such shameless individuals. Only a shameless and malevolent type would make such an objection and express disrespectful statements in a convention, using profanity and indecency, involving the nomination of a fellow teacher.</p>
   <p>We can imagine in what kind of persons we entrust the education of the little Greek children!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0048.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>After the election of the Rev. Erinaeos Tsourounake, and Rev. Basil Loke from the clergy and Mr. Drossos and Mr. Anastasiades from the laity, Bishop Kallistos welcomed the members of the convention and wished felicitations for them and the convention's work.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Dritsas, the attorney of the Greek Consulate of Chicago, also welcomed the members of the convention. He represented Consul De Pastas who is ill. The Greek minister Hon. Simopoulos, congratulated the representatives and the work of the convention.</p>
   <p>After this the presiding Archbishop read the rules and regulations to be followed during the sessions.</p>
   <p>This was an opportunity for a few to show off rather than to say anything of importance, and others to object or make motions. Someone even got excited because his motion was referred to a committee for consideration!</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0049.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Mr. Apostolos Demos, the lawyer, also known as Paul Demos, took the floor and read before the convention a tiresome and incoherent speech with plenty of grammatical errors and other mistakes unbecoming a lawyer. The poor fellow had not read the manuscript before, which caused him to stumble.</p>
   <p>We cannot help but report some of his grammatical pearls as for instance, "the unsurpassed divinity" and others as humorous in his portrayal of his ignorance of his subject, and many more perfectly irrelevant.</p>
   <p>Homer says, "clad in much of impudence." If that statement can be attributed to someone, certainly in this ovation it has a perfect application. Neither the request of the retiring members to smoke, the pounding of the gavel of the presiding Archbishop, who tried to stop the noise of the conversations, or the perfect indifference of the convention to his readings, moved this fool to stop wasting his time and that of the convention <pb facs="5422062_5_0050.jpg" n="6"/>with his foolishness, so he continued to the end of his folly.</p>
   <p>After this tiresome reading, Dr. Salopoulos welcomed the members of the convention with an inspired hymn to Greece, the Greek language and recommended we preserve our national and religious traditions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamantios Polyzoides, took the floor and with his natural eloquence and wealth of knowledge, as for years he has been editor-in-chief of Atlantis, the oldest Greek newspaper of America, thanked our countrymen of Chicago, for their hospitality and by his splendid oratory enthused all the members of the convention.</p>
   <p>After him a young Greek from Des Moines, Iowa was invited to speak. He was, Mr. Zafiropoulos, and representing the new generation he spoke in perfect Greek, even though he studied the Greek language in this <pb facs="5422062_5_0051.jpg" n="7"/>country. After a flattering reference to the former progress of the Greeks here, he said the new generation is going at the rate of fifty miles per hour while the old timers are going like the tortoise.</p>
   <p>His speech was the last for the day and the session adjourned to organize and form various committees.</p>
