   <p>Boys with their parents from six surrounding states will be here on September second to fourth inclusive to attend the District Convention of our junior Order. The program printed below, although it is tentative still, it will give you an idea that the Sons of this city are not asleep. Brother Peter J. Matsoukas, the Supreme Advisor of the Sons of this District, together with Charles G. Geanopulos, Supreme Secretary and W. J. Mavromatis, Supreme Treasurer, are working on the program to make sure that it is a success. On September third a dinner-dance will be given at the St. Demetrius Church and a number of notables will address the guests.</p>
