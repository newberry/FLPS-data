   <p>Tomb: Before the ceremony of the presentation of the flag is completed a committee escorted by motorcycle police will proceed to the hotel and under honorary guard will bring Archbishop Athenagoras to the tomb, where he will be received by the Governor and conducted to his chair reserved for the purpose.</p>
   <p>11 Memorial Services (Archbishop Athenagoras).</p>
   <p>12 Sons of Pericles will place wreath on tomb, and pay homage.</p>
   <p>5:00 P.M. Banquet at Hotel Abraham Lincoln.</p>
   <p>P. S. At 12:00 P.M. will meet you at the Illinois Central Depot with Bugle and Drums of our Sangamon Post, American Legion. We will parade to the arsenal where we will disband and each of us will go to <pb facs="5422062_5_1703.jpg" n="4"/>the St. Paul's Episcopal Church, where his eminence will have a short service, not lasting more than one hour, preferably 45 minutes.</p>
   <p>He shall be received by ten Episcopal priests and possibly the Bishop while he is in town.</p>
   <p>After the services the officials will proceed to the Arsenal (officials of the Order of Ahepa and those of the American Legion) where cars will be waiting to take the official body and parade to begin.</p>
   <p>Parade begins promptly at 2:00 P.M. No one shall march on foot, and it is the desire of governor against parading on foot, due to extreme heat, as fear of heat casualties are entertained. For those that cannot be accommodated with auto, arrangements have been made, by paying a minimum <pb facs="5422062_5_1704.jpg" n="5"/>fee, street cars and buses will be at their disposal to take them out to the Lincoln Tomb.</p>
   <p>About a year ago the flag of the State of Illinois was given to the members of Hellenic Post #343 of Chicago, The American Legion, Department of Illinois, to be by them delivered to Athens Post, The American Legion, Department of Greece, to be placed by them in The American Legion Club House erected in the city of Athens.</p>
   <p>We have come here today to reciprocate for the generous gesture of your Excellency in forwarding that flag to Greece. We have come here to present to you and to the people of the State of Illinois the flag of the Greek Republic. It is reported that 48 flags of the Greek Republic have been sent to America in reciprocation for the flags of the various states <pb facs="5422062_5_1705.jpg" n="6"/>sent to Athens Post. Though this flag is only one of the 48 we of Illinois feel that we have a peculiar privilege to feel more proud than the people of the other 48 states, because the flag sent to this state is being presented on the ground hallowed by the earthly remains of Abraham Lincoln, at the very foot of his monument.</p>
   <p>We also have a right to feel a greater pleasure because our presentation is being made to you, Mr. Governor the one man who has done most to foster and intensify the spirit of Lincoln in this state.</p>
   <p>Of all American statesmen, Lincoln's early career compares with the early struggles of Demosthenes, and his achievements are similar to those of the great Greek statesman Pericles. Through your efforts <pb facs="5422062_5_1706.jpg" n="7"/>and the encouragement you have given others, the spirit of Lincoln is therefore appreciated more at this time than at any other time since his death.</p>
   <p>We Americans of Greek birth or descent can readily understand and appreciate Lincoln, because during his early life he was confronted by the same obstacles and the same difficulties with which our people were confronted when first arriving in the United States.</p>
   <p>Lincoln's success has been an inspiration to all mankind, and his work has a peculiar appeal to the hearts of the Greek people because his labors closely resemble the work of the founders of the first Democratic form of government on the face of the earth, the Greeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1707.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>We appear here today not as Greeks but as Americans, fully appreciating the privileges which American citizenship bestows on us, and Hellenic Post #343 has been selected as the medium through which this gift is to be made because of their unselfish motives which actuated them to enlist in the cause of Democracy in the late war, and because of their unswerving loyalty to the principles of the United States.</p>
   <p>It is an easy task for natives of Greece to become good American citizens, because when they are asked to pledge allegiance to America and its Constitution they are not asked to pledge allegiance to kings, and rulers and monarchs, they are asked only to dedicate their lives to ideals of liberty and justice and in pledging allegiance to those ideals and principles we find them to be the ideals and the principles of our ancestors and the principles and ideals towards which the land of our birth is striving.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1708.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>The flag of the Greek Republic is selected as a gift to the people of the State of Illinois not only because the flag of Illinois has been sent to Athens Post, but because it is the emblem which represents the ideals, the hopes and the aspirations of the people of Greece.</p>
   <p>The people of the Republic of Greece may feel proud of the fact that their flag will stand alongside the Stars and Stripes, the one flag which spells guaranty of liberty and justice and equality. It is the one flag which was never carried into the field of battle to conquer or to oppress and on every occasion when it has been raised in battle, it has been raised always on the side of right and truth. The two flags together stand for honor and for the rights of mankind and for the right of free and self-government.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1709.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>The flag of white and blue represents a nation and a people who have not only given to the world the principles of free and independent government, but a people who have fought to preserve the institutions of free and independent government.</p>
   <p>The Stars and Stripes represents a nation which has given a new birth to free institutions and has been the champion of the rights of mankind.</p>
   <p>It is with great personal satisfaction to me as a native of Greece and an American by choice, that I, in behalf of His Excellency, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos of Greece, and the Government of the Republic of Greece, place in your hands the flag of the Greek Republic and with it the best wishes of everyone of its people.</p>
