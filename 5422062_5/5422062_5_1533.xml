   <p>Last Sunday, March 22, a lecture was delivered, to the college student division of the great Hellenism, National Educational Greek Society, at Hull House by the well-known Chicago attorney, Mr. Andrew Vlachos. Mr. Vlachos has established a great reputation for himself through his speeches, writings, and publications, many of which have appeared in the Greek press of Chicago and America in general.</p>
   <p>His lecture centered around the Greeks of America from the business, social, and nationalistic standpoint. In a rather long and detailed talk he sought to show the cause for the immigration of thousands of Greeks to the United States. He opined that "it is prompted by despair and despondency into which the Greek people have fallen because of economic destitution, social corruption, <pb facs="5422062_5_1534.jpg" n="2"/>and political intrigue."</p>
   <p>He then described the departure of the typical Greek immigrant from his home; how he secures the fare, and then sails to the New World full of strange sights--a veritable new civilization. He described the kinds of work which the first immigrant does and those are many and varied which require hardiness and endurance. Many Greek immigrants occupy themselves with the manufacture, importation, or exportation of Greek products. Mention was made of the frequent attempt of the educated immigrant and the professional man to engage in some sort of a profession. The question of Greek journalism in America and particularly in Chicago was touched upon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos gave us a rather comprehensive but enlightening analysis of the problems of family, church, and educational and community organizations which the immigrants everywhere have to face. No one expected the speaker to <pb facs="5422062_5_1535.jpg" n="3"/>chastise and rebuke us Greeks for our many weaknesses and deficiencies of character which retard our progress in all directions. After a broad description of all the conditions with which the immigrant must cope, he spoke at length concerning the greatest peril which threatens the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos' lecture was most interesting. We are here quoting the last part of his speech which deals with this peril--the national peril which threatens the Greeks of America:</p>
   <p>"And now arises the question: Are the Greeks of America being threatened with any sort of danger? He that has lived in America can well postulate the opinion that the Greeks of America are surrounded by the grave danger of being gradually assimilated into the American way of life in which they share. It is true that the danger is not imminent as far as the older immigrants are concerned or for those immigrants who are somewhat advanced in age on <pb facs="5422062_5_1536.jpg" n="4"/>arriving here, but no one can deny that those of us who have come here quite young are in danger of being engulfed by the forces which level out and assimilate all foreign groups with the predominant native American element.</p>
   <p>"With all certainty one can declare that such a danger is grave for our children who will be born in America in the future. The assimilative influence of one nationality on another, especially a minority group where there is free co-mingling, is a social and historic law. The results of such an amalgamation or assimilation are more pronounced, immediate, and rapid when the newly arriving racial group meets a native group which is superior in civilization, commercial progress, social education, and civic reforms.</p>
   <p>"The American program proposes to assimilate all foreign nationalities residing in this country. To this end, the American Government and the American people are working systematically day and night. Their doors are wide open to <pb facs="5422062_5_1537.jpg" n="5"/>immigration because America, which now has a population of eighty three million, needs that many more inhabitants to round out its population. This is why the desire to assimilate the foreigner and the intensive work of the native American to this end is entirely justified.</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless, we must not fail to see that this assimilative law is deadly and aims at the ultimate disappearance of our Greek consciousness and feelings. It means the abandonment of the use of the Greek language by replacing it with English; it means the substitution of loyalty to America and adherence to a foreign dogma instead of Greek patriotism and our Greek Orthodox faith.</p>
   <p>"The setting up of local nationalistic organizations, communities, Greek schools, and other institutions of a strictly national character, as well as the tremendous influence of the Eastern Orthodox Church will contribute immeasurably to the maintenance of our entity as a separate minority with its own rights and national culture. Any danger of being assimilated will be thus <pb facs="5422062_5_1538.jpg" n="6"/>offset by such protective activities.</p>
   <p>"All this applies to those of us who will not or do not intend to return to our fatherland. Naturally, many thousands of us will remain here, because we here find a wider and more promising field of action, opportunities, profitable work, unexplored and unworked resources--a growing society of men.</p>
   <p>"This new country is much richer than Greece in agriculture, industry, and commerce; therefore, it thrills the Greeks who remember well under what conditions of squalor and poverty they lived and worked in the homeland. So, naturally, they have no desire to return to their people permanently. Even if they do return for some nostalgic or other reason they are unable to tolerate the ways of the primitive village.</p>
   <p>"When these same immigrant Greeks of America return to their homes and villages which are composed of five hundred or six hundred inhabitants, they find that it is very difficult for them to live under the primitive and backward conditions <pb facs="5422062_5_1539.jpg" n="7"/>of life in the homeland. They cannot work and live decently as they did in New York and Chicago, which are huge and bustling cities where more than six millions of people live.</p>
   <p>"The poor and lowly farmer or goatherd who used to wear the characteristic white peasant shirt and the striking tsarouchia [Translator's note: famous Greek peasant footgear with red pompons. They are usually worn by the Evzones or white-skirted select Greek mountaineer regiments or shock troops] has now gone to America in great numbers; there, he has learned how to wear modern dress--shoes, hat, collar, tie, socks; he has become accustomed to living in warm and comfortable rooms. With such a high standard of living the Greek immigrant hesitates to accept any change for the worse; therefore, he either goes to Greece for a visit or he stays there long enough to help his parents and relatives financially and then he returns to America with great joy and considerable relief.</p>
   <p>"On the other hand, our fellow countrymen, according to the experience of many of us here in Chicago, discover that there are no worthwhile business or <pb facs="5422062_5_1540.jpg" n="8"/>investment opportunities in Greece. They cannot engage in the business which they started in America, so on going to Greece, they are forced either to go without work, idling their time away spending money aimlessly or to take the pick and plow in hand again. But, because not very many can make a decent living under such conditions and because they cannot win economic security, the farmer is attracted by the magnetic appeal of the American dollar. So, again they take the road back to Europe.</p>
   <p>"This phenomenon will sadden every Greek when he perceives that in this way gradually the Greek peasantry and citizenry, the productive forces of Greece, are being depleted and are being drained off. That is why the Greek government must take proper and immediate measures for the solution of a vital problem. It is the stemming of the rising tide of immigration to America. The government must cause the Greek immigrant to return to the homeland. No one knows how long our native land can bear this constant and perilous drainage of its young and vital man power.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1541.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>"The Greek government can produce some results in regard to this by not resorting immediately to restrictive measures as far as immigration to America is concerned. Any such abrupt and drastic action can have disastrous results for the suffering and poverty-stricken labor and farming populations of Greece. All realize that it is because of this poverty, misery, and economic insufficiency that in their desperation the masses of the Greek people are forced to seek new havens, new fortunes, and economic security in foreign lands. Only thus do they ever hope to become satisfied, happy, and prosperous people.</p>
   <p>"There is no doubt whatever that the Greeks of Chicago are deeply interested in the struggles and problems of the European immigrant. There are really many aspects of the immigration problem which must be studied and discussed. There is no question that the immigrant is a highly important factor economically, socially, and culturally in both our homeland and in America.</p>
   <p>"The Greek immigrant will be properly treated and served if the economic system <pb facs="5422062_5_1542.jpg" n="10"/>in Greece is reformed. The poor masses in Greece must be assisted. The burden of taxation must be moved; governmental and administrative extravagance and unnecessary expenditures must be drastically reduced. Many radical reforms are needed such as revision of the constituion, political and financial reorganization on a sounder and more just basis. The living and social conditions of the laboring, and farming classes must necessarily be improved. Only by such means will the continued emigration be stopped; only thus will our homeland preserve its most valuable asset--its human resources.</p>
   <p>"Naturally, immigration has many, very many advantages. Millions of Europeans have found their Promised Land in America; others have escaped from tyrannical oppression, slavery, persecution, and hopeless poverty. This is truly the Promised Land. We are all deeply thankful for the blessings of liberty, tolerance, kind hospitality, happiness, and prosperity.</p>
   <p>"Nevertheless, the Greeks of Chicago and the Greeks of America are possessed with one secret desire, the return to Greece, to their own people. We would <pb facs="5422062_5_1543.jpg" n="11"/>all be very fortunate if we could return to Greece with our savings and find more opportunities there for work and investment. If economic conditions allowed, the Greek would be happy indeed to return and settle in his beloved homeland. He can there breathe the free air of his own country; he could there enjoy the company of his relatives and friends; he could then contribute to the prosperity and happiness of his own native land."</p>
