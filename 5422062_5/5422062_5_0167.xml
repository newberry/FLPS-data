   <p>p. 1- According to telegraphic communications from Constantinople the Synod has approved of the rules as laid dowm and voted upon by the Congress of the Greek Communities of America.</p>
   <p>What remains now is the application of the rules, and the first one is the Common Constitution of Communities, which is to be the foundation of all other rules.</p>
   <p>We have no doubt that all communities of America will adopt the new constitution promptly, judging by the impatience with which they are waiting for it.</p>
   <p>But this is not enough. The most important of all is the application of the rules for school and education, which are the most urgently needed, since it is known that all communities have been delinquent in establishing and operating schools.</p>
   <p>To the speedy application of these rules for education we call the attention of the Archdiocese.</p>
