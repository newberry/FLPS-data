   <p>With the passing years as the immigrant population of the city was increased, the Greeks of Chicago were scattered to the four corners of the city. Due to the fact that on the South Side of the city, there were more Greeks, mostly Peloponnesians and a few Islanders, thoughts and debates began to flourish for the establishment of a new church. They wanted a church to be nearby, for, means of transportation from other parts of the city to the church were still in the early stage of developments.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed, and composed by Mr. H. Koumoutzi, President; John Papanastasios; P. Tzovani; A. Papaleonardos; K. Theodorou; P. Rousopoulos; H. Bratsolias and a few others, now members of the "Holy Trinity", to find and buy a suitable location. In the meantime, a temporary church was established in a hall at 62nd and Wentworth Avenue, and by vote it was given the name of "St. Constantine and St. Helen".</p>
   <p>Not having a local priest for the new church, two priests of Holy Trinity, Rev. A. Pegeas and Rev. A. Mandelaris, were alternately officiating. In this <pb facs="5422062_5_1399.jpg" n="2"/>church, which resembled the Garret of the Apostles, the first religious services were held for the Greeks of the South Side, until, the new church at 6105 South Michigan Avenue was built, and whose fate we will follow before and after its destruction by fire.</p>
