<title level="a">JUDGMENT AGAINST THE CHICAGO GREEK COMMUNITY $8,000 IN THE BANK THE PRESIDENT AND HIS CHAIN OF LAWYERS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>p. 3- In spite of $8,000 in the bank a judgment of $285.65 has been entered against the Greek community in Chicago. Why? Because the president of the community, Dr. Papaeliou, wants litigation in order to keep his string of lawyers busy. And what is the object or the necessity of keeping so many attorneys on the payroll of the community? To have enough legal talent on hand to perpetuate his grip upon the community's treasury.</p>
   <p>It is really a shame and an indignity to permit the name of the community to be dragged into litigation. Time will teach our eminent doctor that the president of a community must not stoop to actions motivated by personal animosity nor display the community's dirty linen in public litigation. Doctor, your oath to your profession is strong enough to bring you to your senses. Memorize it, doctor, for your interest and the interest of the community.</p>
