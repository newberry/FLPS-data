  <body>
   <p>Of the thousands upon thousands of Greeks, who came to America with a dream of acquiring some of the wealth of this great country and returning to their native town or village and living a peaceful life, sun-bathing in beautiful and ever-green Greece, very, very, few ever returned to realize the dream of their youth. The rest of the hundreds of thousands, remain here absorbed by the American environment.</p>
   <p>One of the rare exceptions who has returned to Greece is John Papaioannou who at the age of thirty five, with his wife and two daughters returned to his native. country, with the definite intention of staying there. Of course a trip now and then to America was undisputable. Mr. Papioannou leaves here a good deal of real estate and his wife leaves her mother and brothers. It is evident that their future visits to America are unavoidable.</p>
   <p>We wish Mr. Papioannou and his family a bon voyage and a return visit soon.</p>
