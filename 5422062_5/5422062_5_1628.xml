   <p>This number of the Greek News, by a happy coincidence, is issued simultaneously with the arrival of M. Papanastasios in our community, and wo we avail ourselves of the opporutnity to emphasize again what we have already ardently insisted upon, that Hellenism in America must be visited frequently by the politicians of Greece, and its life must be seen by them at close range to get its viewpoint, for not only does America have the most Grecian colonies in the world, but it is generally admitted that this colony is a great economic factor for Greece, the significance of which is recognized by the Greek State. The Greek State, however, has never taken steps to investigate the matter closely and study it diligently, which it ought to do if for no other reason than to maintain this source of wealth.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1629.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Unfortunately the arrival of Mr. Papanastasios under the present circumstances is unfavorable for such a study because of the economic crisis which prevails in America today and the abnormal political situation in Greece, on account of which he must hasten his departure. It is therefore impossible for him to go deeply into this matter and study the condition of Greeks in America and their national needs.</p>
