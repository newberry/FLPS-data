   <p>p. 5.- Miss Alice Diplarakou, "Miss Europe" of 1930, was honored last Sunday in a banquet given by Mrs. Soter, wife of Dr. Soter.</p>
   <p>The banquet was distinguished for its exceptional guests. Beauty, charm, talent, and intelligence were the attributes belonging to the participating personages. Only a Greek poet could describe the rhythm of the Greek dances performed by those alluring descendants of Aphrodite. They certainly knew how to perform the delicate and rhythmic turns of their graceful bodies. Anyway, it was a Greek affair and no barbarian eye was there to spoil the enchanting aspect of the banquet.</p>
   <p>Greek songs were sung by Miss Katherine Miller, President of the Greek Women's University Club of Chicago. This black-eyed beauty not only knows how to sing, but also how to enslave, with her scintillating eyes, both males and females.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1684.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Present at the banquet were: Miss Diplarakou and her mother; the Misses Miller, Tzianas, Pernokis, Perivolaris, Mavrogianis, Tangas, Petrakis, the Harvalis sisters, Mrs. Massias, with her two daughters, Olga and Chrisoula, Mr. and Mrs. Andrian, Mrs. Methenitis, Dr. Basil Trakas, the Attorneys Parry, Porikos, Gekas and Panoutsos, Dr. Thomas, and Messrs. Argyropoulos and Arachovites.</p>
