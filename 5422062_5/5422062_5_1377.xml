   <p>On January 9, the Plato Greek Students' Club gave a dinner in honor of the Greek professional men of Chicago at the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nicholas D. Cheronis, president of the Club and well-known chemist, gave a speech welcoming the visitors and expressing wishes of success to the guests of honor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gianakis, a lawyer, introduced Mr. Xanthopoulos, the Greek Consul, who in a few words emphasized the great need for education and progress. He pointed out the benefits of being educated in some profession.</p>
   <p>After the Consul, the well-known Dr. P. Chronopoulos spoke on behalf of the students. He described their dreams and aims. Despite their poverty, the Greek students had not lost their ambition and courage. He emphasized the necessity of supporting the Greek youth in its efforts to become better <pb facs="5422062_5_1378.jpg" n="2"/>educated. He stated that the Students' Club hoped to become big and prosperous enough to be able to give scholarships to worthy students of Greek descent....</p>
   <p>There were various recitations by such well-known members of the Club as Dr. Theodore, Mr. G. Kyriakopoulos, N. Salopoulos (former Greek Consul), John Gekas, and Mr. J. Haramaras.</p>
   <p>It was decided to organize the Greek Men's Professional Club, and then the dinner was finished. It was a successful move up the ladder of progress.</p>
