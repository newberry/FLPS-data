   <p>p. 1.- The Greek community bought a lot on Loomis Street several years ago for $40,000 expecting the value of the lot to increase. The lot was bought under the presidency of Gregory Papaeliou, with 19 other members and without the consent of the treasury. The treasury insists that it cannot pay the interest and should drop the lot, losing $6,000 in the deal. The value of the stock has dropped to $32,850.</p>
   <p>Various suggestions have been submitted as to what school could be built on the spot or it could be rented to Americans. The question of building a hospital is impossible because $240,000 at least are needed for this.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago have become quite successful in building churches. Why don't they build one for the North Side, so we will have three? It is as good a suggestion as any other.</p>
