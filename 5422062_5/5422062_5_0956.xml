   <p>Dear Sirs:</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the members of the Greek Community of Chicago there were fifteen men present including myself. This was because the members of the Holy Synod were holding a meeting and elections at the same time and date.</p>
   <p>Among others, my name was suggested as a trustee of the churches. Because this election was against the rules of the Greek Community of Chicago and because my friends tried to give me an office I have no intention of taking, I am stating myself clearly in this letter.</p>
   <p>I am not a member of the Holy Synod and do not wish to be considered as such, nor do I intend to take any part or interest whatsoever in any election they may stage.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Dec. 2, 1910</p>
   <p>Andrew Vlachos.</p>
