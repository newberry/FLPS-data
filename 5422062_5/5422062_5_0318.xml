   <p>The attack of the newspaper, Atlantis, against Archimandrite Thadeus Lekas, who, as is known, raises funds throughout the United States for the Patriarchate is not justifiable.</p>
   <p>We do not think that it is proper to abolish a means of raising funds, which are such a relief for the needs of the Patriarchate, before we find some more effective way, just for the theoretical reasons of Atlantis, which reasons, if thoroughly investigated, have no foundation.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, Atlantis must not forget that it has done about the same thing, having opened its columns for such a fund for the needs of the Patriarchate, that brought in substancial amounts. The Patriarchate showed its gratitude by tendering to the late Solon Vlastos, the Title of Grand Archon, Legate of the Patriarchates.</p>
   <p>What we think is that Atlantis, and anybody else who contributes money for the Patriarchate, ought to look out for is, whether the money reaches its <pb facs="5422062_5_0319.jpg" n="2"/>destination. In regards to this, however, the Patriarchate has full confidence, which has reasserted itself by the new appointment of Mr. Lekas for the job; the enthusiasm is such on the part of the Patriarchates, about this kind-hearted Levite, that his name will be remembered always. His Holiness, the Patriarch, expressed himself to that effect to the manager of the Greek Daily, Mr. S. Kotakis, on the occasion of his visit to the Patriarchate. Regarding the readiness which the Greeks of America show for the needs of the Patriarchate, the Greek Daily is glad in having the opportunity to announce this to Hellenism in America.</p>
   <p>The question of financial aid from the Greeks of America, and all orthodox people everywhere, is one of great importance, and needs much wider discussion and study; but before we tackle it thoroughly, it is common sense not to disturb a situation that was created by necessity; a situation which supplements the neglect of all of us, primarily of those who were, up to yesterday, the official representatives of the Patriarchate, and who neglected completely their financial obligations towards it so that it was compelled to appoint Thadeus Lekas for the raising of funds.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0320.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Now, certainly, we do not want to open up old wounds and blame the regime that is dissipated, for negligence of their duties towards the Patriarchate, but let us think about the future, how to find another means better able to help fill the needs of the Patriarchate, and on this, we believe, Atlantis has no quarrel. For the present, however, let us not stir up trouble and not touch upon a necessary evil.</p>
