   <p>We have been led to believe that our priests are above the average persons, because they have no mercenary unscrupulous principles. We have found that they are human after all. Why do they suddenly reach the height of eloquence with an over abundance of flowing words, after they have a $100 bill tucked into their pockets?</p>
   <p>In the last three months six weddings took place in our Greek community. We were present at the ceremony which united three couples. The Greek word for a wedding ceremony is Mistirion, which can also mean a mystery. What is mysterious about a wedding ceremony?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0967.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Two people meet, they take certain vows, swear never to desert one another, have children, and benefit humanity - sometimes. These two people can part, if they decide that they no longer can live with one another. There is no mystery to this. It is human nature.</p>
   <p>The priest enters the situation only when he reads a few meaningless words and makes the couple man and wife. This is where the mystery comes in. At a recent wedding, Rev. Pigeas collected $147 from Mr. Kolobos, the groom. At another, he collected $116 from Mr. Maniatos. That is the exact mystery, of marriage. The priest is paid $60 a month to conduct about 10 sermons during that time. This is not enough, it seems, because priests are always <pb facs="5422062_5_0968.jpg" n="3"/>collecting more money at weddings, funerals, baptisms, and so forth. A man must pay heavily if he wants to be married or buried properly. He must pay to have his children become Christians, so they can start paying, too.</p>
   <p>The Greeks in Chicago are not so well off that they can afford to give such high sums to the priests. We are always called upon to give donations to benefits, charities and philanthropic purposes. Has any one ever heard of a priest giving money to those who need it? No, he takes all he can get and laughs up his sleeve at us. These are our high-minded priests, whom we look upon as super-human.</p>
