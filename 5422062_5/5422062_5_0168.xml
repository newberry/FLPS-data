   <p>p. 1.- Next Friday the bells of the Christian churches will joyfully herald the birth of the Savior, and the splendor of the celebration.</p>
   <p>At the birth of Christ, Rome ruled the world. She had thrown together barbarian and civilized people. She held together moral and immoral people, the normal and the degenerate. Out of this blending, she produced a mixture, that contaminated the human race.</p>
   <p>Rome was buying slaves to be thrown into fish ponds. Roman emperors were burning slaves alive for the amusement of the celebrants. The world was nauseated with the sight of roped men and women following the chariots of Caesars, Pompeys, and Sullas.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0169.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The world was satiated with the bestiality of gorged Rome and the tribute paid to emperors. The condition of the human race reached such a point that neither philosophy nor change of government could save it from destruction. The Creator of the universe saved the world by the birth of Christ.</p>
   <p>The great ancient philosopher, Socrates, speaking to Phaedon, said, "Divine Revelation, is necessary, to untangle things, which philosophy is unable to do." The ingenious Greek mind with its lofty sentiments, created the philosophy that Socrates speaks of, and the same mind received Christianity from the Savior, developed it through its philosophies, and spread it through its proverbs, teachings, and through its ecclesiastical orators. It rendered God's worship--in the churches more splendid, accompanied by the Greek language, the holy Byzantine music, and the melodious poetical hymns.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0170.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Zeno, the founder of Stoic philosophy said, "God is immortal, provident, creator, and Father of all, but does not have a human-like appearance. The Greek philosophy, with its dialectics, and Christianity with its revelations, avowed the immortality of the soul. Plato revealed that the soul has ideas, not acquired through the physical senses; that it was in existence before its ingress into the human body; and that after its departure from it, the soul will exist as an immaterial integral entity.</p>
   <p>The Greek philosophy and the Christian religion, are two shining stars which must be followed by the human race, in order to make our planet an unbounded paradise of happiness and blessedness. Unfortunately, some decades ago, the sinister Boreas of materialism, with utter destruction, raged to destroy the flowers of Greek philosophy and the fruit-giving tree of the Christian religion.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0171.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Bolsheviki acclaimed the stomach to be higher than the mind, and in such debaseness they declared war against God. The plutocrat, on the other hand, accumulating gold and silver, treats with contempt every divine and human law.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately even the pontiffs of Rome, instead of following the pure and true Christian traditions, followed and are following still the traditions of the Roman Empire. They transformed the Vatican into palaces of Imperators, collecting annual tribute from the various people, through their Monarchic legions, much more than the Caesars collected through the Roman legions. Thus, the Pope with his Cardinals lives in the Vatican in untold luxury and magnificence.</p>
   <p>The Savior entered Jerusalem riding on an ass, and the Pontiff of Rome recently bought a train, bearing the imperial colors of the Caesars, beautiful and expensive silk red curtains, equipped and furnished with <pb facs="5422062_5_0172.jpg" n="5"/>unexampled luxury and expensed, that even a king or a multi-millionaire of today cannot equal. When, a few months ago, Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu philosopher, asked for an interview, the answer was negative. The high tribunal refused to interview the philosopher, because he was not properly dressed. He was attired in his Hindu cotton tunica (loin cloth and robe).</p>
   <p>The Savior of the world, wearing his loin cloth, would undoubtedly meet the same obstacle as the Hindu philosopher did.</p>
   <p>This article is written for Greeks and other Christians of the Greek Orthodox Church, in order to make a comparison between their own Holy Church and the Vatican, to discriminate between the holy and true traditions of the Greek Orthodox church, the mother of all the Christian churches, and the traditions of the Vatican. The gorged Rome of the past <pb facs="5422062_5_0173.jpg" n="6"/>went down, and the pomp and dazzling imposition of the pontiffs of the Vatican will, most assuredly, go down. That which is not built upon spiritual magnificence and splendor eventually will crumble.</p>
   <p>A few days from now the Greek churches, the world over, will chime, "Christ is born in the City of Bethlehem."</p>
