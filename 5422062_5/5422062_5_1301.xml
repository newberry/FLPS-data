  <body>
   <p>P. 1 - Enthusiasm and patriotism were present and manifested among the 7,000 Greek Liberals, who congregated, last week, at the Coliseum Annex for the 2nd Liberty Loan. Greek and American orators explained to the masses the importance of subscribing to the 2nd Liberty Loan. The Navy band, composed of 200 pieces and 1,000 soldiers, took part in the mass-meeting.</p>
   <p>Among the first political organizations whose cooperation for the Liberty Loan was requested by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. McAdoo, was the Chicago Greek Liberal League. The response and action of the Greek Liberals you will find in the second page, which emphasizes the patriotism of the Greeks, and the admiration of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
   <p>Among the Greek orators, who are distinguished for their love and patriotism for this country was Mr. D. S. Eutaxias, publisher of the Chicago Loxias, who <pb facs="5422062_5_1302.jpg" n="2"/>urged the crowd to subscribe to the Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>Due to the importance of his speech we print it here as follows:</p>
   <p>In this great ebullition of the nations, in which for four years democratic liberty has been fighting against militaristic tyranny, the duty devolves upon every intelligent citizen to be under the most honest flag of the two political sides of this world-wide war. Also, especially an inviolable duty is imposed on the Greek citizen, who has the inheritance of such a great and glorious past; on the Greek, who was father of the liberty of the peoples from remote times, to give at once his help to the cause of America and the Allies in order that victory may come to that party, which is providing and making sacrifices for the vital principle of the world, called the Democratic Liberty of Nations. (applause).</p>
   <p>Every one of you surely has in mind the great Greek citizen of antiquity, the renowned tragedian, Aeschylus, who in the gravest times of his country, addressing the Athenian youths of his age, said these immortal words concerning the safety of the country. "Hasten, hasten, sons of Hellenes, free your country, your homes your <pb facs="5422062_5_1303.jpg" n="3"/>altars and statues of your Gods", (applause)</p>
   <p>Is it permissible for the whole Greek race, especially the Greeks of America, in these gravest moments of humanity, to renounce the sublime principles of their race, to renounce their history, their fathers and forefathers, and place themselves under the standard of barbarism? (German, Bulgarian and Turk, as some of the Chicago Greek loyalists would do). No a thousand times, no. The struggle of the Allies and America, now going on, is for their salvation and for the salvation of Greece also. It is the struggle of democracy against the Huns who intend to rob and enslave their neighbor nations. (applause).</p>
   <p>The question is whether, being Greeks, you will allow yourselves to serve the barbarians? Is it permissible for Greeks to become instruments of the satanic purposes of the Turks and Bulgarians? Was it permissible for the Aeschineses of Modern Greece (of whom some are now exiles in Switzerland, others court-martialed in Athens, and still others here in Chicago disgracing the Greek name under the Germanic and Constantine propaganda) to betray the honor of the race; to kill more than 950,000 Greeks in Asia Minor, Thrace and Macedonia, to surrender to Bulgarians a whole army corps with its guns, ammunitions and provisions, to finally sell to the Turks of Iconium thousands and thousands of Greek virgins at the price of $8 each?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1304.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>What was this done for? For the purpose of augmenting the barbarism of the Central Powers and their allies. Greeks, look out, proceed with firmness, listen, think, decide and then act. Don't be deceived by a small part of the Greek press in America, which like Solon Vlastos, of New York, sold to the enemies, not only the body of Greece but her soul as well.</p>
   <p>Hellenism, from the very beginning of its existence up to the Balkan Wars of 1912 - 1913, has lived under one God, Liberty - for which it will again fight under the Allies. And it must sacrifice for Liberty, and it will, and because Hellenism remembers the words of our national poet of 1821, Regas Pheraeus, who said, "It is better to live one hour of free life, than forty years in slavery and prison." (applause).</p>
   <p>Everybody must bear in mind that for the existence of nations, sacrifice is necessary. If the citizens of today do not sacrifice themselves for the citizens of tomorrow, nations will not exist. Life was a sweet one to our heroes of 1821. But if Diacus, Lord Byron, Botsaris, the heroines of the Zalongian dance, and many others of our heroes, had not died, we, today, could have neither liberty <pb facs="5422062_5_1305.jpg" n="5"/>nor nation. Those who fall in battle and sacrifice themselves, like their forefathers, give birth and life to a new national spirit and liberty to their country.</p>
   <p>In order to secure that liberty in this great war of the nations, the material and moral sacrifice of the citizens is necessary.</p>
   <p>All of you know that America is our beloved mother, and that the Greeks of America, numbering 300,000, have won a place of honor among the foreign drafted men. More than 25,000 Greeks have voluntarily enlisted in the American army and navy since the United States began to mobilize. This is a much larger percentage than that of any other immigrant race in this country. It is an honor to the Greek immigrant, and shall be followed by material support of our adopted country, as ancient Demosthenes said, "There is need of money, without it nothing can be done."</p>
   <p>The late Admiral Dewey said that every Greek ought to be proud of the heroism shown by the Greek-American sailors in the naval battle of Manila and Santiago.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1306.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Now comes the time for us to prove our patriotismby buying Liberty Bonds, Rich and poor are entitled to the same honor in this great duty. I cannot think that any Greek in this assembly will refuse such a subscription. To emphasize our willingness to subscribe, I request you to stand up and take our national oath. "I swear on the testament of our national faith that I, a Greek, inside of forty-eight hours, will procure one of the Liberty Bond buttons."</p>
   <p>Let us hope, all of us, that our Honorable President Wilson will protect the national rightsof Greece, not only in Asia Minor, Thrace and Macedonia, but in Constantinople too. (applause).</p>
   <p>Our President and the American Republic are attached to the principle of the freedom of nationalities. Let us see that the part played by ancient Greece, the mother of civilization, will be played by her daughter, the United States of America, and thus the other worlds of our planetary system, sooner or later, will learn that the best workers on earth, who labored for the benefit of human liberty, were Greeks and Americans. (applause).</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1307.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The Greek nation must be - and it is -grateful to the United States. Leaving aside the super-human support, offered by the memorable Dr. Howe and other Americans in our revolution of 1821 and in the Cretan insurrection of 1866, I take pleasure in reading from the War Information Series of the esteemed E. B. Greene, professor of history, University of Illinois, the following items.</p>
   <p>"Monroe's annual message to Congress contained a strong expression of sympathy with the aspirations of Greeks for independence. 'There was,' he said, 'good reason to suppose that Greece will become again an independent nation. That she may obtain that rank is the object of our most ardent wishes.'</p>
   <p>"Monroe's sympathy for Greece as a small people trying to gain liberty and self-government was shared by many prominent public men. Even Adams himself, in a note sent to the Greek agent Luriottis, in 1823 spoke of the sincere and best wishes of this country for the cause of the Greeks."</p>
   <p>Oh, mountains, hills, forests and seas of Greece (where the Sun of Liberty has not yet set), you who have witnessed the magnificent spectacle of the glorious, heroic and exemplary revolution of 1821, you who have beheld the brilliant <pb facs="5422062_5_1308.jpg" n="8"/>victories of 1912 - 1913; Oh! Virtue, Wisdom and Righteousness, through whom all that is fair and good, is manifested; Oh! Greek Positivism which throughout the centuries has taught us to believe in one God, Liberty, illumine and guide this assembly and the minds of all the Greeks in America to stand like a solid rock behind the American flag, that no mortal hand will hinder its march to liberate the peoples of the world who are fighting for Liberty and Democracy (applause).</p>
   <p>Let us all stand up in reverence and devotion to the flag (at this point in his speech Mr. Eutaxias pointed to the Stars and Stripes) and say -</p>
   <p>Long live Greece, long live the Allies and down with their enemies.</p>
   <p>Long live the grand and righteous and glorious country of the world, the United States of America. (Deafening cheers and applause reverberated for many minutes throughout the Coliseum Annex).</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1309.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>It is estimated from the offices of the various organizations and societies that the Greeks of Chicago until now have bought over one million dollars of Liberty Bonds.</p>
