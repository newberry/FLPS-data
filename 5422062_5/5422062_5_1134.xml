   <p>Once more the prognostication of the Star has come true in the results of the community's elections. The Star does not play the role of soothsayer in predicting the winners in the administration of the community's affairs, but it bases its predictions upon the willingness of the people to heed the promptings of common sense and to follow the construction policy advocated by this newspaper, of which the fundamental principle is to safeguard the interests of the people and to enhance the good reputation of Greeks.</p>
   <p>All the newly-elected administrators of the community were sponsored and endorsed by the Star, and the people of the Greek colony have elected them on a platform of unity, mutual love, progressiveness, and wholehearted devotion to the interests of the entire colony.</p>
   <p>The religious principles which are deeply rooted in the hearts of Greeks <pb facs="5422062_5_1135.jpg" n="2"/>and the approach of the holidays have hastened the unification of the community, and for the first time in many years the Chicago Greek colony will celebrate the birth of the Savior in unity, love, and good will.</p>
   <p>Much credit is due to the defeated faction for their splendid conduct before and during the elections, which marks a new era in our political campaigns. They have played the game in square and manly fashion. Their defeat is attributed to a difference of opinion. They were honest and sincere but not right. And their honesty and sincerity have brought about the present unity.</p>
   <p>The Greek churches in Chicago, which for a long time have been enveloped in a pall of lugubriousness, are preparing to welcome worshippers to an atmosphere of mutual love and joy for the coming holidays.</p>
   <p>Mutual love and joy! What deep significance is attached to these words! Love is the Creator's first law, and joy is the fulfilment of the first law of creation.</p>
   <p>A deep understanding in love and joy will make our lives happier and our <pb facs="5422062_5_1136.jpg" n="3"/>relationships friendlier, and our social order will be raised to its proper level.</p>
   <p>This understanding should be extended beyond the Greek horizon in order to comply with the full requirements of the law, and when in a few days we hear the heavenly trumpets blow their accompaniment to the chant of "Christ is born to-day in the city of Bethlehem," the horizon of our narrow national and racial world should vanish in the dazzling light of mutual love and joy.</p>
   <p>Since our wings as yet are not strong enough to carry us to the complete fulfilment of the law, let us then in our own narrow circle remove obstacle after obstacle to mutual understanding so that the divine law will function to our advantage.</p>
   <p>Blessed are they who in our little world which we call the Chicago Greek colony have removed all obstacles and have permitted the currents of love and joy to permeate the disintegrating body of our community!</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly the newly-elected governors of our colony of Greeks, who have <pb facs="5422062_5_1137.jpg" n="4"/>the whole-hearted support, co-operation, and trust of the people, will do their very best to drag the suffering and bedridden community out of its plight.</p>
   <p>Credit and honor always await the victors.</p>
