   <p>The celebration in Chicago of the regeneration of Greece was not marked by united effort and enthusiasm as it was years ago when the Chicago Greek colony was fortunate enough to have conscientious and straightforward leaders, who left nothing undone that ought to be done in rendering unselfish service to the needs of the community.</p>
   <p>Other communities in America have celebrated the event with more magnificence, more genuine devotion, more enthusiasm, unity, and system than the Chicago Greek colony, which is the largest of all and in the past has always out-shone the others in local and patriotic activities.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Unfortunately the flourishing and rapidly growing Chicago Greek community for the last three years has been in the throttling grip of a leadership of which the principal object is megalomania and pomposity. And this leadership in order to perpetuate its parading scepter of authority has resorted to court battles which have strained the financial resources and dampened the enthusiasm of this populous colony with long-drawn-out litigation. The dignity and the prestige of the church have been diminished, and many enthusiastic well-to-do Greeks, who have always stood ready to assist financially in meeting the needs of the community, have become utterly disgusted with the leaders in power and with their destructive methods. And worst of all, some of the gigantic pillars which have supported the structure of the community have been seduced by the systematic propaganda of this autocratic clique which prepared its web to ensnare prominent fellow-Greeks, including the Greek consul general of Chicago, the Honorable N. Salopoulos. Dr. Salopoulos' character and integrity are beyond reproach; <pb facs="5422062_5_1148.jpg" n="3"/>he stands a tower of strength in our community. But the megalomanical octopus has succeeded in involving in the diabolical schemes of its activity the personal and official support of the consul general. And the celebration of the Greek national holiday was not a general celebration of the event which it commemorates but a parade of authority by the now-and-then president of the community. The honorable doctor became the victim of circumstances. It would have been better to refrain from participating in the celebration headed by our ex-president, Dr. G. Papaeliou, who does not represent the community, but the latest ruling of the Court, which has decided in his favor. Chaos beyond chaos prevails in the community, and the consul general was caught in the whirlwind of the conflicting decisions of the courts and unwittingly fell into the snare of Dr. Papaeliou's megalomania.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1149.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Eventually the will of the majority of the Greek community will prevail. Nevertheless, the Court's order must be respected, even though it be contrary to the community's interest.</p>
   <p>The celebration, naturally, couldnot be what it was when the leaders of the community were not paranoiacs.</p>
   <p>A few months ago Judge Kavanaugh, after hearing arguments pro and con in the litigation caused by the disqualification of Dr. Papaeliou as president of the Greek community in Chicago, ordered a new election in the community and appointed an election commissioner to assure an impartial record of the community's will. Dr. Sanitsas was elected president, and Dr. Papaeliou, upon his refusal to comply with the Court's order to turn over to his successor the records of the community's bank account, was fined $200 and cost for contempt of court.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1150.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The newly-elected president and his council began to rebuild the community on its ruins, and the defeated president, Dr. Papaeliou, began another battle in court. The result is that another court has decided that Dr. Papaeliou is still the legal president of the community. The impartial election, the will of the people, and the interests of the community were disregarded in the new decision. The consul general and other innocent victims were caught in this imbroglio and forced to recognize the ex-president's grip upon the sorrowful community. The presence of the consul general at the celebration implies that the ex-president is still president of the community. According to the Court's ruling Dr. Papaeliou is still president, but the Court's decision cannot compel the community to love the unwanted ex-president and cooperate with him.</p>
   <p>Dr. Papaeliou's fiasco will remain in the history of the community as an unpleasant event. The Star suggests that Dr. Papaeliou mend the error of his ways and relinquish his phantom authority because the time will come <pb facs="5422062_5_1151.jpg" n="6"/>when he will feel ashamed of himself for doing the things that he should not have done. The Greek community of Chicago, in spite of its present predicament, will go on and on. Megalomaniac presidents may retard its progress, but the community because of its abundance of talented men will attain the object at which it aims. The good and bad deeds of the community's presidents will reflect on the character of the individual not on the character of the community. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</p>
