  <body>
   <p>Our Saint Constantine Church on the South Side has been closed and has held no services for two consecutive Sundays now, because of the sudden departure of the Reverend Ambrosios Mandilaris for Canada.</p>
   <p>The church board has announced through the press that a new married priest is wanted. We have been informed that the Reverend Theodore Prussianos will be the new pastor. Reverend Prussianos was formerly pastor of the Greek churches at Newark and Boston. He is well known to many Chicago Greeks who come from the same province in Greece as he does. In addition, he is the brother-in-law of our wealthy and prominent Giovanis Brothers who are successfully engaged in the manufacture of ice cream.</p>
   <p>Thus, our thriving and forward-looking church parish on the South Side will acquire an able minister, and will again attend to its religious duties.</p>
