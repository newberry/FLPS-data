   <p>Today we continue to discuss the proposed unification of the three Greek churches of Chicago. On the whole, such a movement would result in benefits for all concerned.</p>
   <p>The opinions expressed by the thirty thousand Chicago Greeks indicate that they are in perfect accord with the ideas proposed by Saloniki. They realize that this unification will provide the only possible solution to our problem. Daily we receive letters from outstanding and successful Greek business and professional men, urging Saloniki to continue its good work. Thus this paper is encouraged, and sincerely believes that the day of harmonious co-operation is near at hand. It will be a happy day for us when all Greeks of Chicago are members of one powerful parish which will be governed peacefully and without discrimination.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0922.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We recently published the sound and patriotic opinion of the beloved and most respected Reverend Leon Pygeas, and we hope to hear from the other two Chicago priests.</p>
   <p>Before publishing letters and articles sent to us by outstanding individuals who have written in response to our recent editorials on this subject, we desire to present certain facts to Greeks of Chicago. These facts, which are as discernible as black and white, will explain the persistence of this newspaper. First: On the evening of Evangelismos [Editor's note: The Day of the Annunciation, March 25] all three of the churches gave a dance; hence, three priests, three boards of trustees, and three women's clubs were trying simultaneously to sell tickets to the bewildered Greek people. Undue animosity resulted; there was fighting and bickering between the three churches, since each person could attend only one dance. Fellow Greeks, observe that our places of worship have adopted the methods of our unscrupulous cutthroat businessmen.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0923.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Perhaps this slight illustration does not impress anyone with its importance, but clearly to be observed in this instance are the roots of the weed that is rapidly strangling the life and vitality of the Greek community.</p>
   <p>Second: On the Church holiday, Koimiseos Tis Theotokou (Death of the Mother of God [August 15]) each of our churches gave a picnic to which the community was invited. Rather than make a choice between the three groups, the people preferred not to attend any of the outings. They were certain that news of their presence at one picnic would arouse the wrath of their friends who might have gone to either of the other two outings. In fact, some people spent the entire day traveling from one picnic-ground to another, in order to satisfy all of their friends and business acquaintances.</p>
   <p>This perversity has not been overlooked or condoned by the Virgin Mary, for last year it rained very heavily and all three picnics were total failures.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0924.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Third: The Greek school on the property of the Holy Trinity Church, situated in the center of the largest Greek community of Chicago, has been abandoned to a pitiful fate. It has been, and still is, maintained by the Holy Trinity Church without any help from the other two churches. We modify this statement by saying that St. Constantine maintains its own school and for that reason cannot be justly accused of neglect or indifference. However, the Church of the Evangelismos should have been helping to maintain this Greek school; it has no school of its own and the children in that parish attend the classes of the Holy Trinity School.</p>
   <p>Our clergy does not even take the trouble to define clearly the boundaries of each parish. As a result of this indifference quarrels continually arise at funerals, weddings, and baptisms...</p>
   <p>We make these assertions not with a desire to slander, but with a sincere desire to bring about a reform by exposing the corruption of some of our institutions. Only after we have evoked the necessary changes, will our community become a <pb facs="5422062_5_0925.jpg" n="5"/>a happy and contented one. When our church affairs are given on different days the guests will be able to attend either or all affairs without fear of inconvenience or embarrassment. Then the membership of our churches will be numbered in the thousands and not in the tens and twenties as it is now.....National holidays will be celebrated by all three churches, working in co-operation.</p>
   <p>Therefore, action is imperative! These reforms cannot be accomplished by mere words. Let us be a good example to the others.</p>
