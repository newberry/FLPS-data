   <p>In the evening after his consecration a dinner was served in honor of Bishop Philaretos in the Red Room of the aristocratic La Salle Hotel. More than two hundred prominent businessmen and professional men of our colony were present. The dinner would have been more successful if there had been more time to notify our countrymen, for unfortunately, actuated by the Roman idea of taking it for granted that everything was being attended to with speed and without need of system, the executive committee of the Church, with all the individual enterprise which its members possess, seemed to be unable to make the necessary preparations within the two days available.</p>
   <p>Yet in spite of the heat wave and the hasty preparations the dinner was not a failure. All the tables were occupied and decorated with flowers.</p>

   <p>The food was excellent and abundant, and everybody was cheerful and happy. Besides our countrymen various foreign clergymen and many eminent society people were present. Mr. Constantine Paleologos presided. The Reverend K. Hatzidemetrios offered prayer, and Archbishop Alexander pronounced the benediction.</p>
   <p>The menu was richly varied. Instead of wine plenty of cold water was provided to refresh the guests on this excessively warm evening.</p>
   <p>After the dinner the president and toastmaster, Mr. Paleologos, spoke in English with numerous historical and sociological references, and after this he introduced successively Archbishop Alexander, Archbishop Theatyron (the Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of Central and Western Europe), Dr. Theodore, Dr. Salopoulos, Mr. Kotakes, and finally the eminent orator of the evening, Bishop Philaretos.</p>

   <p>They all spoke well, and the guests were very much pleased with their addresses. After this the children of the Reverend Father Xatzidemetrios displayed their musical talent on the piano and the violin, arousing the enthusiasm of the audience by their playing. The guests dispersed about midnight very agreeably impressed.</p>
   <p>A photograph of the banquet was taken by Kauffman and Company.</p>
