   <p>The dismissal of the pastor of St. Basil's Church is the subject discussion which daily becomes wider.</p>
   <p>Many rumors are being circulated against the dismissed priest by Bishop Philaretos's friends, and many more are afloat about the Bishop himself.</p>
   <p>We, as a matter of principle, cannot become the carriers of these rumors, and for that very reason we confine ourselves to recording a few positive facts in regard to the matter.</p>
   <p>One thing is certain, and that is that the priest was dismissed for neglect of duty. Furthermore the church committee demanded the appointment of a married clergyman to the pastorate of St. Basil's.</p>
   <p>Now, what caused the committee to ask for a married priest? We stated the answer the other day, and we here repeat it.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0465.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To the priest besides his pastoral charge the duties were assigned of president of the Ladies' Society of St. Basil's. For this reason precisely it seems that the pastor must be married, namely so that he may act as president of the Society. This is what those about Bishop Philaretos say. Mr. Paschalakis's friends, however, say many other things which we, shall consider in our next issue.</p>
