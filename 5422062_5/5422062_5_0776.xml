   <p>Because many people insist that Mr. Sellas cheated the purchasers of his church by selling it for $27,500 instead of the three or four thousand it is really worth, I decided to investigate for the benefit of myself and my readers.</p>
   <p>To accomplish my purpose, I found a real-estate estimator, a builder, a carpenter, an architect, and a painter. I took all of them over to the church, which fortunately was open. The first one I questioned was the realtor.</p>
   <p>"Tell me", I said, "how much is this property worth?"</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0777.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He looked at it, measured it, thought a little bit, and said, "This lot is used, it is of a previous era, and today lots like this sell for five cents a foot."</p>
   <p>Then I addressed the architect. "Tell me what you would charge to draw me a plan of a building such as this?"</p>
   <p>"Are you asking me, how much I would charge now, or what the charge would have been thirty years ago?" he answered.</p>
   <p>"Let us say, thirty years ago."</p>
   <p>"Well," he said, "thirty years ago, paper, ink, and pencils were very cheap, and so I would have charged no more than a dollar and a half."</p>
   <p>"Can you tell me what you would give me for this building?" He looked at <pb facs="5422062_5_0778.jpg" n="3"/>it, and then took a mallet and began hitting the bricks.</p>
   <p>"Why do you hit those bricks?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"I am trying to discover how many carats they are," he answered with a smirk. "These bricks," he finally said, "are made of sand and red dust, and they are of no value."</p>
   <p>I then asked the builder how many days of work he estimated had been put in in the building of this structure.</p>
   <p>"Then," said he, "the working days were long, and it could not have taken three carpenters longer than a day and a half to accomplish it."</p>
   <p>Then came the carpenter's turn.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0779.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Can you tell me the approximate cost of such a building, as far as the carpentry work is concerned?"</p>
   <p>"Well," he answered, "thirty years ago the materials we used cost very little, and we used a very poor grade of wood, which today is not worth two cents."</p>
   <p>"And you, Mr. Painter, what have you to say?"</p>
   <p>"Thirty years ago, we used a cheap oil in our paint, and instead of fine hair brushes, we used horses' tails. Well, you know you could buy a whole horse at that time for twenty-five cents."</p>
   <p>After hearing all this, I asked them to have a secret conclave and determine what they would ask if I wished to buy this building from them.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0780.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>After a long, secret conference, they told me that the price would be $120,000. "What!", I said, "You yourselves estimated it to be worth no more than twenty-two dollars."</p>
   <p>"Well, you see this is business," they replied. In other words, Mr. Sellas, who sold it for $27,500, doesn't know anything about business.</p>
