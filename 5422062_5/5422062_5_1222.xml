   <p>From: A. A. Pantelis, Americanism Chairman.</p>
   <p>To: District and Post Commanders and Post Adjutants and Americanism Officers.</p>
   <p>Youth Week will be observed in Chicago beginning Sunday, May 17 to Saturday, May 23, 1931.</p>
   <p>The object of Youth Week is to concentrate during one week the attention of the entire city of Chicago on its boys' and girls' achievements and their value to Chicago as its coming citizens.</p>
   <p>The General Committee in charge of Chicago Youth Week has arranged the activities for the entire week.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1223.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Local or District Committee chairmen have been appointed throughout the city. The chairmen of the local committees are in charge of all activities.</p>
   <p>A list of local or district chairmen of Youth Week is inclosed for your convenience. Communicate with your local chairmen at once and make arrangements to cooperate with them.</p>
   <p>The Americanism Committee of The American Legion is expected to be particularly active, and wherever possible to take charge of the activities on Friday, May 22, which day will be devoted to Citizenship.</p>
   <p>Comrade Felt, Chairman of the Committee on Athletics of the Cook County Council, is communicating with the Athletics Officers of the various Posts requesting that they participate in the activities of Wednesday, May 20, which is the day devoted to Athletics.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1224.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Commander Fenlon feels that these two days belong to the American Legion Posts in the various communities. It is his wish that the various Posts take complete charge or at least cooperate with the local chairman during those two days.</p>
   <p>The Americanism Committee stands today ready to help your Post in connection with Citizenship Day, Friday, May 22. We have for your use various pamphlets and literature. Should you desire any information telephone Central 3480 and request any assistance you may need.</p>
   <p>The Boy is not going to be a Citizen in some future time; he is a Citizen now!</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis, Chairman</p>
   <p>Americanism Committee</p>
   <p>Cook County Council.</p>
