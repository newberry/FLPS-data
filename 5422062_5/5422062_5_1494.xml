   <p>We once met a Greek man who had worked hard and saved his money in order that he might be able to return to Greece when he had grown old. He was fifty years old, when he left America to return to his fatherland. Within six months this man had returned to America. When asked for the reason for his return, he said, "It is not the same. The houses and fields are all the same, but the people are different; the ones I knew are all gone. Soon I found myself lonely, and missing the American way of life."</p>
   <p>When asked what he intended to do, he said, "I am going to do what I should have done years ago. I am going to become an American citizen. I am also going to invest my money in sound securities, and become a good citizen of the country in which I have lived for so long."</p>
   <p>This has not happened in just one instance, but in hundreds of cases; not only to Greeks, but to all nationalities. The best thing to do is to <pb facs="5422062_5_1495.jpg" n="2"/>invest in government securities and become citizens of this country.</p>
   <p>The Bible says: "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."</p>
