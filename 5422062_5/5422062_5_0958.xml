   <p>p. 1.- There is nothing more curious than the Greek clergy of America which lives parasitically off the general masses. These priests have thousands of dollars in private accounts, but never would they think of giving one dollar to a poor family for bread for starving children.</p>
   <p>The Holy Synod has permitted them to don street clothes, so they can now be found in saloons and coffee-houses gossiping till 3 in the morning. Can we blame them? The poor fellows work 200 hours a year; how can they help being lazy?</p>
   <p>Our priests are not the moral and upright men we think they are. One unmarried priest will leave behind him three sons when he dies. Another was recently sued for $750,000 by a "lady" of questionable reputation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0959.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hellenism is thriving in the United States. We must have the right kind of priests to lead our people. It is time we woke up to what is going on under our eyes.</p>
