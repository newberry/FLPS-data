   <p>The modern Greek church in America should really be called the Greek Commercial Church not the Greek Orthodox. It is useless to repeat how many times we have written on this subject in our newspaper.</p>
   <p>It is a crime to see 350,000 Greeks in America become indifferent to their native customs, their language, their nationality, their ideals, just because the clergy find them an easy prey for exploitation. It is too high a price to pay.</p>
   <p>The priests do not try to teach religion to the church-goers. They do not try to tell them what is right or wrong, what is good or evil. They do not try to improve community life. They just try, in every way possible, to fill their pockets with the hard-earned money of the people who come to them for knowledge and guidance.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0955.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The priest of today is not a holy man beyond reproach. He is a commercialite. The church is his business and he is in it to make a profit. He robs the poor disguised as their friend. He is unscrupulous in his search for money.</p>
   <p>The whole thing goes back to the Holy Synod of Greece which has authority over the priests of America. The Holy Synod could easily provide true and honest priests to preserve Orthodoxy over here but the Holy Synod never wanted to do it and never will want to do it.</p>
   <p>As long as Greece gets a huge share of these priestly profits, the Holy Synod will continue to keep her eyes closed to what is going on. She cares for us only as a commercial profit. When we are no longer that, she will quickly forget who and what we are.</p>
