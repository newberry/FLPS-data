   <p>A. A. Pantelis, a lawyer, with offices at 816 Ashland Block, formerly a Lieutenant of Infantry, for months stationed at Camp Grant, and who was chairman of the membership committee, was elected permanent commander. Thomas Papadopoulos, a real-estate salesman, was elected vice-commander. Nicholas C. Ganas, the temporary adjutant of the Post, was unanimously elected permanent adjutant in appreciation of the splendid work he had done as temporary adjutant and in assisting the membership committee. Mr. Ganas was chief censor of Greek literature in Paris during the war, and afterward assisted in Greek translations at the Peace Conference at Versailles. Nicholas Conglis, a young lawyer, was elected vice-adjutant.</p>
