   <p>The chief organ of the Republican party, the Chicago Tribune, wrote in a recent issue an article expressing its resentment against 1,500 Greek refugees being brought to America by the Greek steamer, "King Constantine".</p>
   <p>"If," it said, "the immigration law had been passed, these Greek refugees would not have been allowed to enter the gates of Ellis Island."</p>
   <p>Of course, Patterson and McCormick thought that they would arouse resentment against President Wilson if they published such a statement. Those refugees are from Thrace and Asia Minor, and are unfortunates who belong to the finest and oldest families, and who have been enslaved by the Turks and the Bulgarians.</p>
   <p>And if, according to the wishes of the Tribune, the President and the Congress had passed such a law, forbidding the entrance of immigrants, the doors should have been opened in the name of humanity and philanthropy. That is, if the <pb facs="5422062_5_1507.jpg" n="2"/>spirit lives; the Tribune makes us doubt its existence.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago and of all America should make a note of the attitude of the Republican party and its organ. Remember it at election time! The Chicago Tribune has always been unfriendly to our race despite the heroic efforts made over a period of a year by the Greek government, in order to save the Tribune representative, Mrs. Farrar from the hands of the Turks. The ingratitude of the Tribune is unforgivable. To desire to refuse these wretched refugees admission into "God's Country" is inhumane.</p>
   <p>The Tribune must be sure of this, however. The Tribune, as an organ of the Republican party, will find no admission into more than six thousand Greek stores and homes in Chicago. And, if the Republican party has the same ideals as its chief organ, it will find the doors of the White House closed also.</p>
