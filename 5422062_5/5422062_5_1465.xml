   <p>Greek residents of Chicago have protested against the proposal immigration bill pending in Congress. A resolution and a brief have been placed in the hands of Illinois senators and congressmen. If Congress adopts the new law, Greek immigration to this country will be practically prohibited.</p>
   <p>The plea for defeat of the pending measure chiefly is international family ties. It is contended that under the proposed act only 206 Greeks could enter the country each year, based on the quota of 1890, which <pb facs="5422062_5_1466.jpg" n="2"/>would be adopted as a standard.The result would be the disunion of families, the heads of which have come to the United States intending to send later to the motherland for their wives, parents, children, minor brothers and sisters or various dependents.</p>
   <p>The American association of the Greek Community of Chicago has voiced the plea of these naturalized Americans in a resolution which it has sent to Senators McKinley and McCormick and to all Illinois congressmen. Attorney Paul Demos, president of the association, prepared the brief that accompanied the resolution.</p>
   <p>Based on the belief that congress is not properly informed as to the class and character of Greek immigrants to the United States, the brief sets forth facts and figures which tend to show the Hellenic newcomer as a high desirable alien.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1467.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In 1920 foreign-born Greeks in Chicago numbered 11,546, the total number in the United States, 212,330.</p>
   <p>According to the brief, in 1922 a total of 3,809 immigrant and non-immigrant Greeks arrived in the United States, while 8,862 emigrant and non-emigrant departed, resulting in a net decrease in the Greek population of the United States of 4,873.</p>
   <p>In its resolution the association declares:</p>
   <p>"We believe in the restriction of immigration, but sincerely insist that the provisions of the new immigration bill providing for admission on a basis of 2 per cent of the foreign citizens of each country here in 1890 is discriminatory against the Greeks, because in 1890 there were very few Greeks in this country."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1468.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In his brief, Attorney Demos sets forth:</p>
   <p>"The Greeks in the United States are extremely law abiding. There is absolutely no socialism, bolshevism, or communism among them, not a single society existing in the United States."</p>
   <p>Of the 4,177 Greeks who arrived in 1923, 3,394 came to the United States to join relatives, the brief points out. Of the 2,703 women among them, 1,569 were single, between 16 and 29 years old. Concerning these, Attorney Demos, declares:</p>
   <p>"It is a well-known fact and a matter that should be brought to the attention of the legislative and immigration authorities that the Greek girls who came into this country do not engage in any work or business except that of keeping house for their relatives, who support them."</p>
