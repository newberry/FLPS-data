   <p>p.2.--Since his arrival in Chicago the Right Reverend Bishop Kallistos, formerly Bishop of San Francisco, has established the office of the diocese here and has given his attention to the most important matters.</p>
   <p>Bishop Kallistos first studied the financial condition of the communities of Chicago and then formed a plan for their reorganization, the final success of which he has made dependent on the councils of the churches.</p>
   <p>Besides this work Bishop Kallistos has received the committees of various organizations and cooperated with them. He has also visited the communities of Hegewisch and East St. Louis in Illinois and Mason City, Iowa, where he held masses and preached and gave advice for the improvement of the communities.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0133.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bishop Kallistos on the 10th of March went to New York and had a conference with Archbishop Athenagoras. On Friday, March 18, the Bishop celebrated masses in the church of St. Nickolas and preached there. He has also visited and preached in other Greek churches of Chicago.</p>
