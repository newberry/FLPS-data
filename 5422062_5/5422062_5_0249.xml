<title level="a">THE CONFERENCE RE: MATTERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>p. 1- In response to an invitation of the community "Assumption of the Virgin Mary," the first conference, took place on the day before yesterday, in which the several communities and many eminent members participated.</p>
   <p>The result of the conference was the election of a committee to formulate the plan of our communal organization. This will be the basis of the discussion of our communities with Archbishop Athenagoras.</p>
   <p>We have repeatedly pointed out that if the general plan from all communities does not come forth, and a common understanding among all on general lines is not reached, the discussions with the Archbishop are doomed to failure in advance, as were those with the Legate, despite all the good will displayed for the settlement of our communal matters.</p>
   <p>Having just that precedent in view, we have tried in everything that we have written so far to pave the way to an understanding, and we are very glad that the community "Assumption of Virgin Mary" took the initiative <pb facs="5422062_5_0250.jpg" n="2"/>by calling into conference the various communities, and that so the work has been started of bringing about a discussion of our communal organization.</p>
   <p>It would be sad indeed for such a community as that of Chicago not to be able to present by itself its views and submit matters to the Archbishop, who, time and again, has been invited, and now is waiting to effect our community organization with our help. It would be sad not to be able to present to him certain ideas, expecting him to regulate our communal affairs, believing, as many unfortunately do, that the Archbishop is the only one competent to decide about the affairs of communities all over, the latter having no opinion and no voice in them.</p>
   <p>But those who believe this do not know that the Archbishop does not assume such responsibilities, nor is it possible for him to know what is going on in the various communities, nor has he the power to set things right by a magic rod if the respective bodies do not submit to him the prevailing opinions and acquaint him properly with the situation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0251.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Unfortunately, however, it so happens that many of our communal officials do not know the situation well enough and look at things from their own narrow viewpoint and that of their own church and consequently are afraid of cooperation. Furthermore, in having worked singly and against one another through many years of separation, they are afraid that cooperation perhaps will bring about injury to the interests of their community. These fears are totally unjustified, and they are caused by their ignorance in not knowing that cooperation could not but be for the common good, and that the profits thereof will be profits for their own church.</p>
   <p>But that these things may be realized, it is necessary to have an understanding and an exchange of opinions, and from such a discussion they may all be sure that they will reach definite conclusions which will solve many errors heretofore prevailing, and that a common opinion will be formed about the manner of organization of our community.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that a few conflicting opinions would spring up, but that does not mean that we should not get any result at all. We shall benefit <pb facs="5422062_5_0252.jpg" n="4"/>first from the matters upon which an agreement will be formed, and the other points will be submitted to the Archbishop's mediation.</p>
   <p>And that is exactly the beneficial service of the Archbishop in regard to our communal affairs, for which we must be grateful to him.</p>
   <p>From this viewpoint, therefore, we consider it a happy event that this work has been started in our community, and we offer our congratulations to the community "Assumption of Virgin Mary" for its initiative as well as all those who hastened to offer their cooperation in the conference that took place.</p>
