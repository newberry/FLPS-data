   <p>Solemn and imposing was the funeral of the deceased priest, the beloved Charit. Panagopoulos, whose funeral services were conducted by the Right Rev. Metropolitan Bishop Basileos with ten priests.</p>
   <p>A large crowd from all over Chicago flowed into Holy Trinity Church to attend the funeral services of the popular priest, or white presbyter as some one called him, referring to his pure white soul and blameless life. Funeral orations were delivered by the Right Rev. Bishop Basileos and by Father Averkios. Wreaths were deposited by the parishes and by the Ladies' Societies, namely, the newly launched Lodge of Gapa; "Hearth", the Association of Mothers; and that of St. Barbara decided instead of wreaths to distribute the money for flowers to poor Greek families, who suffer this year especially, and so to mitigate their misfortune, confident that Father Panagopoulos' soul will cheerfully approve of the unfading flower of kindness.</p>
