   <p>It is with great pleasure that we announce that the Pan-Arcadian Union is sponsoring a conducted tour to Greece, for the benefit of the many Arcadians who desire to revisit the homeland. They will sail July 16 on the "Aquitania " of the Cunard White Star Line. Mr. Hurcules Veron, director of the Atlas Shipping Agency, will be in charge of the tour.</p>
   <p>This trip has been carefully planned, by the president of the Arcadians and Mr. Veron, in such a way as to guarantee a large number of travelers and to guarantee to the travelers the most for their money. It was decided to make the trip by way of Paris.</p>
   <p>The famous Aquitania will take the tourists to Cherbourg within five and one-half days. Special coaches will take them to Paris in six hours . In Paris, the travelers will stay at the aristocratic hotel of the steamship lines. The next morning they will be taken on conducted tours to all the famous and <pb facs="5422062_5_1611.jpg" n="2"/>beautiful sites in that historic city.</p>
   <p>Then special coaches will again take the tourists to Athens, where a splendid reception will await them. It is understood that all the expenses for food, sleep, and train fare are included in the price of the passage, so the traveler's will not be burdened with extra expenses and trouble.</p>
   <p>The above indicates that this tour is planned so well that not only will it benefit the Union but it will also serve as a pattern for other organizations to follow in the future. The Pan-Arcadian Union has done everything possible to assure the comfort and happiness of everyone taking the trip.....</p>
