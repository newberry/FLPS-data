   <p>p. 1.- The Right Reverend Archbishop Athenagoras of America in a personal letter announces that he will soon arrive in Chicago. The coming of His Reverence to Chicago fills all our fellow-countrymen with joy, and they are waiting with impatience to see him and receive his blessings.</p>
   <p>The fact that Archbishop Athenagoras is coming to us in the holidays proves his interest and appreciation of the Greek community of Chicago, whose eagerness to see him soon and whose expectations of effective action to be taken by him we have repeatedly recorded in these columns.</p>
   <p>And inasmuch as Archbishop Athenagoras will, by a happy coincidence, conduct his first service in Chicago on Palm Sunday, we are absolutely sure that the Greeks of Chicago will receive him with palms and olive branches.</p>
