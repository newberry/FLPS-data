<title level="a">THE MEETING OF THE GREEK CHURCH REPRESENTATIVES</title></bibl>

   <p>The Most Rev. Athenagoras, Archbishop, presided over the meeting of the representatives of all the Greek churches in Chicago. The meeting, as was heralded, took place June 30th, at the La Salle Hotel, and was marked by gratifying results. This historical council was comprised of representatives of all Greek communities of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Holy Trinity, represented by Misses N. Palivos, N. Nicolatseas and P. Bougas; Evangelismos, by Christ Davlantis; St. Constantine by N. Nomicos; St. George by Mr. Glambouras; Assumption of Virgin Mary by Messrs. John Coliopoulos, Limberis and Koklanis; St. Andrew by Messrs. Paul Demos, John Papas and Kotsonis; St. Basil by Messrs. Petropoulus, Ar. Tsekoures and J. Agriostathis; and St. Nicholas by Messrs. S. Kotakis, P. Tseronis, Lucas and Tsimtsilis. John Agriostathis acted as Secretary.</p>

   <p>The prelate of the Greek church as a true Hierarch elucidated the traditions of the Greek Orthodox Church and of the Greek race. He further brought out for the clarification of the councils, that the traditional system of the Greek church is dependent upon the sincere cooperation of the laity with the clergy and vice versa. This system is in contra-opposition to the Catholic church, which leaves everything to the clergy.</p>
   <p>He further added, that it is absolutely necessary for all Christians to become charter members of their respective communities. By doing so, the communities would be able to fulfill the duty of their delegation, and they would be strengthened financially in maintaining the Greek schools. The mission of the church is not only religious, but also nationalistic. From the standpoint of the Greek conception the Greek church is regarded as the undivided and inseparable exemplification of religion, language and nationalism.</p>

   <p>The Greek language is a necessary prerequisite to maintain and perpetuate faith and nationalism.</p>
   <p>The Archbishop, in terminating his speech, made the following suggestions.</p>
   <p>1st. Limitation and restriction of Churches.</p>
   <p>2nd. Maintenance of all Churches with a definite zoning of parishes.</p>
   <p>3rd. Division of Chicago in to three parishes.</p>
   <p>4th. Formation of one community.</p>
   <p>The Archbishop's suggestions were debated by the united councils of the Churches, and they resolved the following:</p>
   <p>A) The formation of a lasting central committee comprised of eight members and headed by the Archbishop. This committee would define and supervise the affairs of all the Greek Churches in Chicago.</p>
   <p>B) All the churches were to be maintained, each Church to exercise its own individual functions within its parish zone. In case one Church wished to be amalgamated with a neighboring Church it could do so with a free conscience.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0219.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>These resolutions were to be ratified by the united councils of the communities at the general Congress of the Churches.</p>
