   <p>p. 1- It is doubtful if any Olympian festival, from the first in 776 B.C., has had a more impressive opening than that of 1636 A.D. The new amazement is that the very scenes were carried almost instantly (more swiftly than the messages of the Gods by Mercury), across continents and seas and presented by telephotography to the sight of men, women and children of different races, nationality and language, thousands of miles away. To the reporter's Pindaric art, so remarkably exhibited in the account, this miracle has been added, more incredible than the myths of ancient Greece.</p>
   <p>The mind of Hellas, which "blossomed with a wondrous flame" has cast its seed to all winds of heaven, and in a very literal as well as figurative sense. Moreover, it was prophetic of a wider sowing. If, as one of the greatest of world poets has said, there is now no higher intellect to brighten the world than little Hellas owned, it is for our human welfare that we avail of what she gave.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1604.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That which is to be especially remembered of this particular gift of her early owning is that during the period of the games in ancient times none in all the territory of the contests were permitted to bear arms. It became temporarily "sanctified". Safe conduct was assured to all who travelled to Olympia. Here in the "sacred truce" was the microcosm (for a few days, at least every four or five years) of a world at peace.</p>
   <p>Not only was every part of Greece represented, but vast numbers of spectators came from Asia, Africa and Sicily--in such numbers that most of them had to sleep out under the open sky--an augury, it may be considered, of the coming of an enduring peace for the larger world , from Hellas to Hesperia. For more than a thousand years Olympia,as the seat of the games, was the national center of Greek religion and the scene of the greatest athletic festival the ancient world ever knew.</p>
   <p>That the next festival bearing this historic and stirring name is to <pb facs="5422062_5_1605.jpg" n="3"/>be held in Japan suggests the inter-racial and international nature of this now planetary organization, which may come to be one of the greatest of all agencies in the promotion of fairness in all human relations.</p>
