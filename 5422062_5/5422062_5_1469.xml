   <p>RESOLUTION</p>
   <p>Whereas, it has come to the attention of the American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago, that there is now pending in Congress, legislation which, if passed, will practically result in the prevention of Greek immigration to this country; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, we do not believe that Congress is properly informed as to the situation in America, with reference to its population of Greek Americans Citizens, and the class and character of immigration which is taking place from Greece to the United States; therefore,</p>
   <p>Be it resolved, That we unanimously pass the following resolution, and that a copy of same together with a brief, setting up the facts with reference to Greek immigration, be forwarded to the Hon. Henry R. Rathbone, Congressman at large from Illinois, requesting that he present the same to the proper committees in Congress:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1471.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And be it further resolved, That copies of said brief and resolution be also forwarded to all Illinois Senators and Congressman.</p>
   <p>The American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago, in meeting assembled unainmously resolve:</p>
   <p>We do not believe in an open door imigration policy. We are firmly against it and we sincerely believe that the immigration laws should be enforced more rigidly and that there should be a stop to hundreds of aliens who come in monthly through other channels than those prescribed by the Immigration Department. We believe that those people who came in as and by "human smugglers" are not the kind of people that we want in this country. Such people are undesirable who have been expelled from their own native country and they come into the United States to spread their unpatriotic propaganda.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1472.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We believe, however, in uniting families and that American citizens should be able to bring over to this country, their wives, children and parents, their sisters, if single or widows, their fiances and their brothers if they are less than twenty-one years of age.</p>
   <p>We further believe that those aliens who have come into this country in good faith and have declared their intention to become American citizens, should be able to bring over to this country, their wives and children. We also believe that the law which was passed in September, 1922, allowing an American woman to retain her citizenship after she married an alien and denying citizenship to an alien woman who married an American, should be repealed.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1473.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The idea that families need not have common nationality. is against the laws of nature and against the laws of civilization. It is preposterous to think than an American citizen who has married an English woman should go to the British Government and ask for protection for his wife.</p>
   <p>We believe in the restriction of immigration but sincerely insist that the provisions in the New Immigration Bill providing for admission on a basis of two per cent of the foreign citizens of each country here in 1890 is discriminatory against the Greeks, because in 1890, there were very few Greeks in this country. The Greeks began to come to this country after 1890 and in the short time they have been here they have made wonderful progress as patriotic American citizens, and have shown that they are an asset to our American citizenship.</p>

   <p>BRIEF</p>
   <p>The following is the brief submitted by Mr. Paul Demos, attorney at law, in accordance with the above resolution, of the American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago:</p>
   <p>The number of foreign born Greeks in Chicago, in 1920, was 11,546, the total number in the United States 212,338, of which nearly 100,000 emigrated to this country since 1910.</p>
   <p>In 1922, a total of 3,809 immigrant and non-immigrant Greeks arrived in this country, while 8,682 immigrant and non-immigrant departed, leaving a net decrease in the Greek population of the United States of 4,873.</p>
   <p>In 1923, 3,605 were admitted and 3,351 departed, leaving a net increase of 254. This tabulation is by country of last permanent residence.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1475.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>In 1923, the net increase of Greeks from all over the world, arriving in the United States was 1,326.</p>
   <p>Of the 4,177 Greeks arriving in the United States in 1923 from all countries, 1,474 were males and 2,703 were females. Those under sixteen years of age numbered 609 and those over forty-five years of age numbered 440, thus showing that nearly twenty-five per cent were under sixteen years of age and over forty-five years of age. Two thousand four hundred forty-two paid their own passage, 1,547 had their passage paid by relatives and 188 had their passaged paid by other than friend or relative. Three thousand three hundred ninety-four came here to join their relatives. Five hundred seventy-nine came over to join their friends, meaning in many instances that they were females coming here to marry. Only 204 were not going to join relatives or friends. One thousand five hundred sixty-nine were single females from 16 to 29 years old and 140 were single females from 30 to 44 years old.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1476.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>As to occupation, 135 were professionals; 345 were skilled laborers: 249 ordinary laborers and 198 merchants and dealers. The balance either had no occupation and included 1,653 servants which of course means women and children.</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact, and a matter that should be brought to the attention of the proper legislative and immigration authorities that the Greek girls that come into this country do not engage in any work or business except, perhaps, that of keeping house for their father, brothers or other relatives. They are being supported by their relatives until they marry, for which purpose they come into this country, thus they do not take any employment away from the people residing in this country, but, on the contrary, they make it possible to provide work for the unemployed in the various industries, because when they marry, their husbands open up a home, buy furniture and clothing, etc.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1477.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>It is also a fact that the Greeks, more so than any other nationality, through family and religious ties are obligated to supported their families, that is, their parents, their sisters and their minor brothers and in many instances, they sacrifice even their own future welfare for them.</p>
   <p>Now is it not better for the American Greeks to spend their money in this country having their families join them here, than send the money over to the old country to support them?</p>
   <p>The Greeks in the United States are extremely law abiding. They are all very religious, belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church. There is absolutely no socialism or bolshevism or communism among them, not a single society existing in the United States.</p>
   <p>A great proportion of the Greeks in America joined the American Army, perhaps a larger proportion than any other racial group by reason of the fact that the greater part of their population consisted of males. They made good soldiers and great numbers were, by reason of their army service, made American citizens.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_1478.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>One of the largest, and one of the first American Legion posts to be organized in Chicago was the Hellenic Post, consisting of American citizens of Greek descent.</p>
   <p>Their occupation is generally that of a merchant. It is a well known fact in Chicago that the Greeks here have done a great deal towards the improvement of real estate. They have gone extensively in the business of buying and developing corners in which their business is conducted and have greatly enhanced surrounding real estate. There is no question but what persons investing in business and residence real estate make the best of citizens.</p>
   <p>Chicago owes some of its finest ballrooms, theatres, buildings, factories, restaurants, confectionery stores, office buildings, residences and stores, to the genius, perseverance and financial offerings of its citizens of Greek descent. In proportion to their numbers as compared with other nationals, no other racial group, it can safely be stated, has done more towards advancing not only the material but the idealistic interests of the city, the state and the nation, in the short time that they have been in this country.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
   <p>Paul Demos, Attorney-at-Law</p>
   <p>Chicago, I11.</p>
