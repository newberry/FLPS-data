   <p>Chicago, including its small and big stores, banks, hotels, transportation, civic institutions, etc., is in feverish preparation, for the four day celebration of the Eucharistic Congress Convention.</p>
   <p>The eyes of the world, including the dignitaries of Catholicism, who were sent here by the Papal Throne from the five Continents of the Globe, and of this great Republic, which is free from Ecclesiastical intolerance, are focused upon the celebration, with devotion and due respect to the colossal church institution called Roman Catholic.</p>
   <p>One million people in New York welcomed the delegates of the Vatican, and two million people here in Chicago, either through devotion or curiosity honored with magnificence, the arrival of the delegates of Catholicism. The city of Chicago, including all religious denominations and the Jews, was decorated with the Papal banner, and dignitaries of othe dogmas were assisting and aiding the celebration of the Catholics.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0618.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And why all that? Because the systematic power of the Catholic Church is imposed on and felt by millions of people, not only within its circles but everywhere. The preponderance of the Catholic element, the devotion of its members, the almighty power of money, and, above all, the centralized systematic power and authority of the Vatican, are potent factors for the building up and maintaining of such an imposing magnificence and effect. That wonderful system emanates from the centralized Tribunal of Catholicism in Rome and its mighty leader, the Pope, who reigns over the Vatican, although he is imprisoned in it.</p>
   <p>This self imprisoned almighty Emperor of the greatest Christian Empire of the world, through his systematized and ruling power, governs Catholicism the world over, with such awe and respect that his scepter of authority and preponderance is felt and recognized by other dogmas as well. The imposing power of Catholicism is feared and respected everywhere.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0619.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This has been written for the sake of comparison. Orthodoxy, being the mother of all dogmas, and the tradition of the Greek race, which race, was the first one to adopt Christianity and spread it by means of the Greek tongue, (in which the Gospel was written) was, until the 15th century the dominant Christian world dogma of the Byzantine Empire. However, today, with 250,000,000 subjects and the wealth of these subjects, Orthodoxy has suffered and is suffering the greatest of tribulations and trials within and without.</p>
   <p>Where is the Ecumenical Patriarchate and its power? Who governs, the great Orthodox Empire of North Russia? The Patriarchate? No, it is governed by Jews. What are the deeds of Orthodox people within and without the domain of the Church? Mutual discord, and division. What is the attitude of our Patriarchates, towards religious harmony and mutual activity? It is known, very well known, by all.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0620.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Why, the existance of so many Patriarchates, why, the division, why not have, one Ecumenical Patriarchate? We know, that in unity there is strength, and that the mighty strength of unity is felt and imposed upon that forsake and deserted 130,000,000. Russian Orthodox subjects and their Patriarchate? Where is the power, that would have stopped Kemal Pasha from his sacrilegious activities such as the slaughtering of thousands upon thousands of Christians?</p>
   <p>The strength of the 250,000,000 subjects of Orthodoxy should have been sufficient to impose its iron grasp upon the sacrilegious if Orthodoxy were ruled and governed by one Patriarchate and not seven, as now is the case.</p>
   <p>The Catholic Church, separated from the Greek Mother Church in the 9th century, became the largest and the strongest Church of all, in spite of the opposition of other dogmas, and it has the best organization to serve the needs of its objectives.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0621.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>According to the Christian Canons, all the rituals, rites, celebrations and performance of sacraments are done by the simplest and natural means, without pomp or any ostentention, nevertheless the rite of the Encharists, today, presents a magnificent, showy aspect, with which, according to the prevalent spirit of advertisement, the Catholic Church demonstrates the mighty power of its dogma, and acquires new subjects.</p>
   <p>But the Vatican is a separate religious institution, governed by its own laws and leaders, without being under the political idiosyncracies of national political leaders, and for that reason, its systematized power is felt the world over.</p>
   <p>The Greek Church, unfortunately, is under the supervision of the government which government changes its powers ever so often, and, accordingly the system of the church.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0622.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Let us systematize this religious institution, otherwise its followers and devotees would be estranged and separated. Let us hope, the seven Patriarchates of Orthodoxy would be united, and by that unity the Greek Government would be requested to relinquish the governing power of the Church. Such procedure would be beneficial to the government, to the Church, and to the people in general. Let us have a system that shall acquire the respect of all.</p>
