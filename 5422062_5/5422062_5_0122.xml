<title level="a">WHY SO MANY DISTURBANCES IN THE GREEK RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS?</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Although the Greek community of Detroit cannot be considered as an example for judging the existing conditions in the Greek religious institutions, nevertheless, the fact that in a month's time the members of two churches closed the doors of the institutions in the face of a priest, and forbade him to enter and perform Mass, is an indication of the existing conditions in our churches and communities.</p>
   <p>It is not only that, but in two general meetings of the two parishes in Detroit, the priest, not only was called down, but in both of them disrespectful remarks were uttered against the head of the Greek religious institutions in America, the Archbishop. Even though the Greek community of Detroit holds the record for ecclesiastical and community disturbances and discord, we think that these horrible and unbecoming acts toward the discipline of the church could have been avoided had the priests used careful tactics.</p>
   <p>In the short time of three weeks, Rev. Alex Papastephanou was expelled from two churches through the locking of the doors by the members of the <pb facs="5422062_5_0123.jpg" n="2"/>churches, because they disliked his vulgar manners, ways of expression, and general treatment of the parishioners.</p>
   <p>Reverend Papastephanou, a former resident of Chicago, and very well-known here, was dismissed by the church of the East Side for economic reasons, but the priest disregarded the decision, and went to the church on Sunday, held Mass and took collections. On the following Sunday, the members went to church and stood as guards to prevent the entrance of the priest to the church. (Look at the level Orthodoxy has fallen!)</p>
   <p>After his dismissal from one church, Reverend Papastephanou was sent, appointed, or ordered, nobody knows which, to hold Masses in the other Church on the West Side. When this became known, the members locked the door, and the women who gathered there to prevent his entrance, forbade him to enter, even though he was accompanied by officers of the law for support. Did you ever hear of a priest going to his Mass escorted by policemen, and being locked out of the church by action of women? And this is what happened in Detroit, on September 11, at the <pb facs="5422062_5_0124.jpg" n="3"/>Church of Saints Constantine and Helene.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that the Greek community of Detroit presents the unique phenomenon of swindling and plundering of the church and community revenues by those who have stuck to the church as its officials for years, and who do not hesitate to exploit everything holy and sacred. But the attention and importance given to them by the officials of the church is the cause that brought on this condition.</p>
   <p>It is a pity that a gang of exploiters of our religious sentiments for their personal profit, for years have now stuck to the church of the West Side and who by various promises, convinced Reverend Tsapatsaris to disobey the orders of the Archbishop, and be idle now. But it is equally pitiful that the same confidence was placed in a similar gang that has stuck to the central church, Evangelismos.</p>
   <p>With these two acts in the two Parishes of Detroit, we have the open reaction against the head of our church, the Archdiocese. Probably, this may have been the result of the resistance against the Archbishop's representative there, who was fooled by the gang of exploiters, <pb facs="5422062_5_0125.jpg" n="4"/>who have stuck for many years to the central community, and do not differ from those of the East or West side. But where do we go?</p>
   <p>We are very sorry to publish such a report which we did not expect to take place, especially now, since the reorganization of the Greek Orthodox Church in America. Let us hope that all these differences will be ironed out in a Christian spirit of charity and appreciation, and that we shall not have a recurrence of such scenes as those reported here. All this will be corrected when the clergymen learn to conduct themselves as clergymen, and not as policemen, and when the communities expel from their boards, all those that have previously done some dirty work, And, unfortunately, most of the old timers have done in someway, sometime, some dirty work!</p>
