<title level="a">GENERAL MEETING OF THE MEMBERS OF HOLY TRINITY CHURCH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>On October 16, a week ago last Sunday, the members of the oldest Greek church of Chicago, Holy Trinity, held a general meeting in the hall of the Greek school to discuss the recently formulated constitution of the Greek Archdiocese and to elect a committee of supervisors for the parish elections.</p>
   <p>In discussing the subject of the constitution of the Archdiocese the whole body agreed to the recommendations of the special committee previously appointed to examine the said constitution.</p>
   <p>The recommendation was, to postpone the adoption of the said constitution, until after the meeting of the assembly of the representatives of the laity and the clergy, to be held in Chicago the following year.</p>
   <p>After a long discussion of the committee's report on revision of the <pb facs="5422062_5_0116.jpg" n="2"/>constitution of the community parish, the whole body of the members adopted the report and the reserved recommendations of the committee that in revising the constitution care must be taken not to copy that of the Archdiocese in anyway.</p>
   <p>After the necessary voting to revise the constitution of the community and the postponement of the adoption of that of the archdiocese after the Assembly meeting, the following year, the members of the congregation adopted a resolution to recognize the Archbishop as the head of the church, and to contribute annually a proper sum for the support of the Archdiocese.</p>
   <p>In discussing the subject of elections, someone arose and mentioned coalitions at the elections; Mr. Geo. Loumos objected and termed this a devilish scheme. The president, Mr. N. Palyvos, not understanding the meaning of the expression arose to admonish Mr. Loumos, so giving way to a series of exciting scenes that followed,.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0117.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Kominakis moved that certain members be appointed as a supervisor's committee for the elections and quite a wrangle followed as to why this gentleman should insist in picking the committee.</p>
   <p>After this incident Mr. Kokines asked to have the minutes of the previous general meeting read when it was decided to have the Auditing Committee give its report because the treasurer was absent.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zacharias Baldas, a member of that committee speaking for it, declared that everything was in good order and that the parish owes at all times some money to the treasurer as he always pays the bills of the parish out of his own money due to lack of money on the part of the community to meet its obligations.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Kokines inquired if the parish has a bank account, and also how it pays its bills. To this Mr. Baldas replied, that the parish has no bank account and that the payments are done by personal checks of the treasurer, because there are many judgments against the community and if judgment holders find community funds, they will be attached.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0118.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>On hearing these remarks, the president, Mr. N. Palyvos who got wild because this deplorable condition of the community was revealed, arose and protested to the meeting for these absurd questions of Mr. Kokines and said if that condition exists today it is Mr. Kokines himself who is responsible, for as president of the community he squandered about $30,000 to buy the church of St. Nicholas and the Cemetery, leaving the treasury emptyand not even paying the personnel of the church, leaving his successor in this present predicament. Addressing Mr. Kokines, he said, "we, Mr. Kokines, tried to cover you up, and did not want to reveal your doings, and now you come here and ask questions to make trouble." To this Mr. Kokines replied, "If you gentlemen, thought it was advisable to cover me up, that is no reason for me to cover you up."</p>
   <p>Mr. Kominakis made a motion to expel Mr. Kokines from the membership of the parish as an embezzler, to which Mr. Kokines replied by making <pb facs="5422062_5_0119.jpg" n="5"/>a motion to audit the books and find out the real embezzlers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Loumos moved to terminate this discussion and set aside Mr. Kominakis' motion, because he had already brought embezzlement charges against Mr. Kokines through court action. Mr. Kokines was exonerated at the trial because the books and the accounts were found to be in perfect order, which showed that this motion of Mr. Kominakis was untimely and injurious.</p>
   <p>Mr. Spiros Kotakis amending the former motion, said that he favored the expulsion of Mr. Kokines as a troublemaker who is always working against the interests of the community, thus insisting on an expulsion.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Panteles Rhangos arose, and instead of speaking on the subject he addressed Mr. Kotakis thus: "When I take the floor, I do not allow anybody to make faces at me." Mr. Kotakis arose with threatening intentions and when Mr. Rhangos stepped forward towards the latter ready for a combat, the ones nearby hastened to grab them both and a fight between them was prevented.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0120.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The young lawyer, Mr. Dem. Papis, took the floor and explained that this meeting cannot expel any member nor discuss such a thing, because it is against the constitution. In order to do that, certain formalities are required first.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kotakis with all his oratory, was unable to eradicate the deep impression of the clear arguments of the young lawyer upon the members and when Mr. Kokines said that somebody must undertake the responsibilities of such a motion, Mr. Kominakis withdrew his motion at the request of Dr. Geo. Karaflos.</p>
   <p>After this, a motion was passed to have the books audited from 1922 to the present time, and this was adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p>A characteristic episode was created when Mr. Basil Georgoules arose during the controversy of Palyvos-Kotakis-Kokines, and accused the <pb facs="5422062_5_0121.jpg" n="7"/>president, Mr. Palyvos, of incompetency, as unable to conduct a meeting, and of no ability to hold office of the president, which he debases with his evident inability to direct the meeting by himself as he had to depend on those around him.</p>
