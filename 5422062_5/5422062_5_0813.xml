   <p>P. 2- The Greek priests in America are not slow in catching up with the idea of "getting rich quick" and I should say they are fast workers. They are the "real McCoys" when it comes to emptying the pockets of those ignorant Greeks who flock around the holy fathers and pay them plenty of dollars so they can pray or offer sacrifices to a capricious God for the salvation of the departed souls of their dear ones. It is really a shame the way we abuse Christianity. Anyway, on my part they are excusable because, "monkey does as monkey sees monkey do". They don't know any better. Our Lord said, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do".</p>
   <p>Authentic statistics show that each and every Greek priest in Chicago makes $12,000 a year in wages and tips. And this does not include the money that comes in from funerals, commemorations, extreme unctions, sanctifications, confessions and other things, God knows what, and amounting to at least $3,000 a year, making a grand total of $1 5,000 per year. Good business. I should say our priests are not pikers. The Holy Synod of the Church of Greece ought to take notice.</p>

   <p>Why do things of this kind take place here in America and we tolerate it? Well, it is the spring fever of the era, all of us are doing it. Why blame those poor priests, our religious servants, who forsake everything in this world but the Almighty D..........</p>
