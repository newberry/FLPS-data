   <p>The Greek people of Chicago will be vitally interested to know that, according to information received from a distinguished friend in New York, whose name we cannot divulge as he is connected with the Greek Embassy in Washington, D. C., the Greek Government after an exchange of notes and opinions with the American Government has consented to the drafting of all the eligible Greeks in America between the ages of twenty and forty.</p>
   <p>The agreement between the two governments, which will be signed by the Greek Ambassador in Washington and the Secretary of State of the United States, contains the following provisions in outline:</p>
   <p>1. Every Greek in America between twenty and forty years of age, regardless if he is a citizen of the United States or not (excepting Greek men between twenty-one and thirty years of age who have already been called) will be <pb facs="5422062_5_1287.jpg" n="2"/>drafted for military service. Previous service in the Greek army will not exempt them. They may have had either the first or second papers issued to them.</p>
   <p>2. The Greek men drafted in America will not be sent to Greece, but will be trained in the United States and France by American and French officers and will form separate Greek divisions.</p>
   <p>3. It is believed that by such a call to arms a new Greek army will be formed in America numbering about 75,000 men, including those who will be exempted because of physical or other handicaps.</p>
   <p>4. The American army that will be composed of Greeks in time probably will be sent to the Macedonian Front in Southeastern Europe, but this will be finally decided by Field Marshal Foch, who is Commander in Chief of all the Allied and American Armies in France and who determines the amount of reinforcements that are to be sent to the various European fronts.</p>
