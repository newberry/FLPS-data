<title level="a">THE ECCLESIASTICAL QUESTION IN AMERICA</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>P. 2.- The ecclesiastical question which has kept Hellenism in America from progressing all these years, has finally come to an end if we are to believe a telegram which has recently been received from the Holy Synod of Greece and the Ecumenical Patriarch.</p>
   <p>After the Royalists and the Venizelists finish their little argument there won't be much of Hellenism left here or elsewhere. The Greeks have been kept back by this very reason.</p>
   <p>Those in Greece believe that the Ecclesiastical question has come about because we want to break away from our mother country. This is not true. We love Greece and her troubles are our troubles. When a house burns down, the inhabitants feel the loss very keenly. That is the way the Greeks of America feel about Greece.</p>
   <p>Now that there is an opportunity offered us, we must take it, shake hands and make peace.</p>
