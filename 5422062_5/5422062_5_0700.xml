   <p>Thirty three years ago, to be exact, the Greek Parish in Chicago initiated its first communal organization and asked the Holy Synod of Greece to send a priest. Up to 1890 the Greeks of Chicago were calling upon the Russian priest of San Francisco for their religious exigencies, from a distance of 2,000 miles! At last, Chicago acquired its own Greek church and its first priest, Father Fiampolis, was appointed.</p>
   <p>Thereafter, the Greek churches in America multiplied and their number at present is about one hundred and seventy. As a direct consequence of this multiplication of churches, we have acquired the mission of a Bishop, and have organized a self-governed church, not any longer with one but with four bishops. The Greeks of Chicago, now after thirty years, have their own bishop and Chicago has become the seat of a Greek Diocese. This certainly is progress.</p>
   <p>Next Thursday, our community will witness a grand ceremony, during which the endorsed bishop of Chicago, Philaretos Joanides, will be ordained. It, of course, is not an insignificant event for the community of Chicago to attain <pb facs="5422062_5_0701.jpg" n="2"/>the dignified elevation of a Diocese and to have its own Bishop.</p>
   <p>For the devout public such an event is a confirmation of great progress. Even for the non-religious the progress of every organization is a step forward, because many questions that have provoked considerable confusion, and caused much dissension will be straightened out, from now on, in a simple and quick way by the responsible authority.</p>
   <p>Our community had, up to now, dissensions about trifles which were being exaggerated and remained unsolved.</p>
   <p>The progress is indisputable, even for those who systematically attack the priests, and who now have to deal with the bishop, and who will bear, in place of the paralyzed title of priest-o-phagos, the one of Bishop-o-phagos, (!) if they have strong enough teeth.</p>
   <p>The ceremony will take place in the church St. Constantine and two Bishops, the Most Rev. Alexandrou of America, and Mr. Germanou, Bishop of St. Thyateron, is arriving today, from London, will officiate.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_5_0702.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Committee of the church St. Constantine finds itself in motion and emotion for the event that will take place in their church, which, by this means, will acquire the title of Metropolitan Church (Cathedral) of Chicago. The Committee is also preparing itself to give a dinner in honor of the new Bishop, at the Hotel La Salle, that evening, at which will be present the most prominent members of the community.</p>
