We must show our willingness to proffer all of our services at this critical time. We must heed the voice of our adopted country in her hour of need.</p>
   <p>Inspired by this feeling and certain that it is acutely felt by all of you, also, I decided to organize a battalion composed of Greek men which would offer its services to the American government.

   <p>The names of those enrolled will be published in the Saloniki; and when a sufficient number has enrolled, a meeting will be called.</p>
