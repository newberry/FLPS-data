   <p>The Odin Branch of the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society held a meeting on Monday evening at Humboldt Park House. More than 150 members were present.</p>
   <p>Mr. N. M. Stoltenberg, president of the Branch, strongly criticized the powers granted the nominating committee of the Society. The committee, he said, has greater powers than any political machine. At the elections of the Society it is necessary to vote for the candidate selected by the nominating committee or else abstain from voting altogether. When two names are put up by the nominating committee, the members have to vote for one of the two even though they do not approve of either. On the other hand, <pb facs="5423969_3_1280.jpg" n="2"/>it is only possible to vote for one of the two even if the members wanted to elect both. The nominating committee consults neither the branches nor the members on the matter of nominees; the committee alone decides on the names to be placed on the ballots for determining the representatives of the various branches. The representative elected by the Odin Branch, as well as the representatives from other branches, have been excluded from the meetings of the nominating committee, and the majority of the members of that committee belong to the party which, in our opinion, does not comprise the friends of the Hospital....With the nominating committee constituted as at present, we know what to expect; candidates from our Branch will be placed on the ballot for the visiting committee or some other minor committee, but not for the nominating committee or the board of directors. It is a common saying that the voters have no show at political primaries; but our Society, with its nominating committee, puts the political primaries into the shadow. In our elections the voting members do not have a ghost of a show. It appears as if two men are running the whole nominating committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1281.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The president then read a letter from Mr. Rommen, secretary of the Society, in which the latter states that he had received two requests from the nominating committee for lists of members of the Odin Branch and of other branches. Upon receipt of the first request, he had written the secretaries of the various branches asking them to send the required lists to their representatives on the nominating committee, and he again calls the request of the said nominating committee to the attention of the branches. The meeting voted to table the letter temporarily.</p>
   <p>Dr. Karl Sandberg, the representative to the nominating committee elected by the Branch, reported that he had been present at two of the meetings of this committee but had been turned away; that he had been refused permission to be present at the committee meetings as a listener, the committee stating that it would not do to have present the individuals who might be subjects of discussion at the committee meeting; that the representatives elected by the California Branch, the Norge Branch, and the Logan Square <pb facs="5423969_3_1282.jpg" n="4"/>Branch had, similarly, been turned away by the committee.</p>
   <p>As to the nominating committee as it is now constituted, Dr. Sandberg had discovered that the election of its members had not taken place in conformity with the laws of the Tabitha Society. While, under the rules, two names should have been placed on the ballot from each of the seven branches then existing, it appeared that for two branches....no name had been placed on the ballot; for one branch only one name....The North Avenue Branch had five names instead of two....Furthermore, all the twelve persons placed on the ballot as candidates for the nominating committee at the last annual meeting belonged to the Norwegian Lutheran Synod.</p>
   <p>Attorney Waage read the paragraph from the constitution of the Society dealing with the nominating committee, its nomination and election, and expressed the opinion that the present committee was not elected in conformity with the <pb facs="5423969_3_1283.jpg" n="5"/>laws. He spoke strongly of requesting the board of directors to call a special meeting of the Society. After a brief discussion it was unanimously decided to do so, and the following communication was sent to the board of directors, signed by the required number of members:</p>
   <p>"We, the undersigned members, do hereby request that you call a meeting of the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society for Sunday, January 5, 1902, 2:30 P.M. at Scandia Hall, for the purpose of constituting a nominating committee in conformity with the constitution, and for the transaction of such other business as may be deemed for the interest of the Society."</p>
