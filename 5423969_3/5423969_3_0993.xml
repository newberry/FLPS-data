   <p>At the annual meeting of the Norwegian National League several things of interest occurred. One of those which caused some excitement was the action of Mr. Iver M. Malmstrom, who had been recording secretary for nine years, in declining to be a candidate for re-election. He retired after these years of active service. The president, George M. Kramer, was re-elected. Mjoen Edahl was placed in charge of the employment office.</p>
   <p>The treasurer gave a brief report as follows:</p>
   <p>The Seventeenth of May Festival brought in receipts of $3,302.11. The income for the year was $3,891.63. The expenses for the year were $2,470.89.</p>
   <p>Mr. Abrahamson of the employment office reported that the farmers had sent $1,344.59 to the office for traveling expenses. The deficit for the year <pb facs="5423969_3_0994.jpg" n="2"/>was $431.57.</p>
   <p>Applications for work had been received from 2,980 men and from 1,012 women. 2125 applicants were placed within the year.</p>
