   <p>Nora Lodge No. 1, Knights of the White Cross, the oldest Norwegian Lodge in the United States, gave a sexa [fish dinner] for its members last Wednesday evening, at its headquarters, corner of North and Western Avenues. Quite a number of Knights attended, although many of the members were absent because the Norwegian Singing Society, to which many of Nora's members belong held its annual concert on the same evening.</p>
   <p>After the business meeting, a table was served in the hall; there was an abundance of the usual smorrebrod [Scandinavian sandwiches]. Mr. Abraham Haugan welcomed the guests, and informed the members and guests that the affair was given in honor of two of the oldest and most active members of the Lodge, members who joined twenty-five years ago, in 1886. Captain L. J. Johnson said a few words for the guests of honor, Henry Tolzien and David Benson, who were <pb facs="5423969_3_1035.jpg" n="2"/>then carried through the hall in a "chair of gold," while the members sang "Ja Vi Elsker Dette Landet" (Yes, We Love the Land That Towers).</p>
