   <p>The Bjorgvin Dramatic Club presented a play last Saturday in Bjorgvin Hall. The play was the humoristic piece by C. P. Riis, "Til" (Mountain Life). The play has been presented several times before, yet so many people sought admission to the presentation that many had to be turned away.</p>
   <p>The Bjorgvin Dramatic Club has undergone certain changes in that new actors have joined the Club. Whether these changes will improve the Club cannot be said with any assurance yet. It was noticeable at the performance on Saturday that the actors were nervous and uncertain, though there were some notable exceptions....</p>
   <p>Mr. Christ Olsen is the director and has succeeded in gathering together quite a group of actors. The Bjorgvin Dramatic Club is able to do better work in <pb facs="5423969_3_0156.jpg" n="2"/>the humoristic line than the Danish troupers who have offered their wares of late. It is to be hoped that the Club will get up enough energy to present something new soon.</p>
