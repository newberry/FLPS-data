   <p>We Norwegians have a lot for which to thank Pastor C.J.P. Peterson. He is trying to uphold Norway and to educate the American people to respect and love our old mother land. For a long time he has written in English, for the various American papers, telling them about Norway of one thousand years ago, of King Harald Haarfager of the Norwegian American S.S.Line between Bergman and New York, of the Arctic discoveries and of Captain Carlsen's discovery of Novaja Zenilja.</p>
   <p>Pastor Peterson has published a Norwegian Danish Grammar and Reader with a vocabulary designed for American students of the Norwegian and Danish languages, the book consists of 202 pages, of which forty-three pages are devoted to grammar, eighty-three pages to reading matter and fifty-five pages to the dictionary. The book is published by S.C. McClure &amp; Co., the greatest <pb facs="5423969_3_0662.jpg" n="2"/>Chicago Publishing firm and printed by the Donnelly Printing Co. The book is beautifully bound and it is the first time that such a book has been published.</p>
   <p>Pastor Peterson was called to teach Norwegian in an American high school in Chicago. Pastor Peterson's great ability in handling the English language has been praised highly by Chicago's literary men who want him to work out a whole Norwegian history in the English language.</p>
