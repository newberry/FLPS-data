   <p>Skandinaven informed its readers some time ago that the Order of Chosen Friends has gone bankrupt and as a result is to be dissolved. The society was one of the so-called fraternal societies, the purpose of which is to be of use and comfort to the members. Every member of such societies received a life insurance policy, and the individual lodges served as social centers for the members and their families.</p>
   <p>The Order of Chosen Friends....followed a working plan which in outline is similar to that of most fraternal societies. The main purpose of the society was to provide the members with inexpensive life insurance on the basis of the so-called assessment plan....According to this plan the society carried no reserve fund. When a member died, the other members were assessed for a certain amount and the insurance was paid from the assessments. This is the usual form of assessment insurance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1142.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The society experienced some special misfortunes: The treasurer stole $30,000 of the insurance funds and, like other insurance companies, it had to meet extraordinary demands after the Galveston disaster. Bankruptcy was the only way out. When this occurred the society, which at this time had 551 branches all over the country, had $21,000 in its treasury, while the total obligations to widows and other relatives of deceased members amounted to about $220,000. These facts show that the society would have been compelled to go bankrupt even if the treasurer had not absconded and even if the funds had not been drained by the catastrophe in Galveston. The two occurrences mentioned may have hastened the bankruptcy, but sooner or later this would have occurred anyway.</p>
   <p>As all of us know, there is a very large number of fraternal insurance societies in this country, and new ones are formed almost daily. The organizers are usually people who desire good incomes and easy work. It is not difficult to arrange for an attractive plan, especially if it is made to appear that good will and mercy form the cornerstones of the plan; that the desire of the <pb facs="5423969_3_1143.jpg" n="3"/>organizers is mainly to aid widows and orphans. People join the society; money pours in; and for a time all is well. But the real foundation is unsafe, and after a while the attractive structure collapses.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every man to take care of his family. Life insurance carried by the head of the family is a usual method whereby this duty is performed....It is necessary, however, to be careful in this matter. It is not always easy to separate the genuine from the fraudulent. Most people can escape the traps if they use their common sense and seek advice from reliable people. Most of the unsound schemes are calculated to catch people of meager incomes for whom it is important to get inexpensive insurance. Yet these people especially are the ones who can ill afford to lose their savings, and whose families will suffer most if the insurance policy on which they are relying proves to be but a piece of worthless paper.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven has thought it a duty to present this matter to its readers. It would be well for our people to study the Order of Chosen Friends, its insurance plan, its methods, its growth, its collapse.</p>
