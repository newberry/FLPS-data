   <p>The Norwegian Society for the Home for the Aged held a meeting of all its branches at the home of Dr. N. T. Quales last night, in connection with the bazaar, which the Society is to hold at Schoenhofen's Hall from November fifth to tenth. The ladies' auxiliary had made their preparations for the bazaar long ago, and the many tasks connected with the selection of committee members and assistants have been accomplished. The bazaar is the fifth to be held by the Society and it now appears that it will surpass all its predecessors both as to contents and decorations, and also with regard to attendance. The bazaars have meant a great deal in the development of the Society and its work.</p>
   <p>Since the [U. S.] presidential election is to be held on November 6, the board of directors of the bazaar has made arrangements for visitors to the affair on that evening to get correct information about the election results from all over <pb facs="5423969_3_0302.jpg" n="2"/>the country. This fact, in addition to the interesting programs, which are to be presented during the evening, will make this bazaar-week an event to be long remembered in the history of the Society.</p>
