   <p>The Singing Society Bjorgvin last Sunday arranged a music and play evening in the hall on Artesian Ave. in memory of Bjornstjerne Bjornson's birthday. The quality of the entertainment was such as to compel admiration.</p>
   <p>One important factor was the object of the entertainment, a national poet and author of high rank was remembered. Noteworthy also, is the fact that a little humoresque as "Til Saeters," the play of the evening, is yet capable of entertaining and amusing people when it is presented by people in whom the love of the theme and the love of the memories of the past remain alive. Then returns to us those old pictures which constituted Saeter; marry-crazy girls; school-master "clothed in correct stupidity"; gay students on sight seeing trips. There was nothing pedantic or awkward about the manner of playing. The lively Bergensians were not made to do things stiffly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0140.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Bernhard Monsen was the schoolmaster, his play was fun, but a great deal more than fun; his schoolmaster became a man, with all the stiff correctness as the situation required.</p>
   <p>Aamund as presented by Mr. Klepp had the typical irritating shown faithfulness. Mrs. Nicholaysen as Sigrid was both quick and humorous, and Mrs. Monsen gave Ragnhild sympathetically and naturally. Mr. Eliasen played Halvor; strong, violent, kindhearted and virtuous; his bright voice was appealing. As his grouchy counterpart, Mr. Petersen was very funny. The three college students were good: Hans Sunde as Nordahl was quick and brusque, making a good impression; his unpleasant fellow student, Busk, was presented very ably by Mr. Christensen, and the little role of Steuby was played discreetly by Mortensen.</p>
   <p>The public showed its approval of the playing by enthusiastic applause.</p>

   <p>It is very evident that within our Norwegian colony we have young people with ample ability to give high class amateur performances and it is well that they should be encouraged.</p>
