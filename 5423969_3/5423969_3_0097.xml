   <p>The first anniversary of the Norwegian Singing Association was celebrated last Sunday evening at Schoenhofen's Hall. More than one hundred singers were present. While waiting for some laggards, the Singing Association, under the leadership of Director Emil Bjorn rendered a number of songs. An hour after the appointed time the throng gathered around the tables for their feast, to the music of the band and the singing of "Ja, vi elsker."</p>
   <p>Vice-president Theodor Ebert was the toastmaster and the first speaker. He reminded those present that the Singing Association had been organized one year ago and that the number of members to the four singing societies of which the Association consists has been on the increase. The Association had been started without any money in the treasury, and now after one year's existence there is not only money in the treasury but more money due the treasury.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0098.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Norwegian singers are the core of the Norwegian population in Chicago, the speaker said; the Association had its annual meeting last Saturday, he added, and at that meeting a new board of directors was elected. He concluded his speech by thanking the members of the retiring board of directors for their able and faithful services.</p>
   <p>A letter from the president of the Association, Dr. T. Warloe, who is in Trondhjem, Norway, at present, was read and the toastmaster stated that the board of directors had today replied to the letter by telegraph.</p>
   <p>Mr. Birger Osland had promised to act as the speaker of the day, but was kept absent through illness, however, and Senator Niels Juul [Dane] was requested to undertake the task. He readily complied, and expressed his pleasure at being with the singers. We do not love America less because we come together occasionally to call to mind again the Norwegian language and cultivate singing and music. The people of the North have given valuable service in building up this country; yet we will ever remember the country <pb facs="5423969_3_0099.jpg" n="3"/>where our cradle stood. He concluded with a toast for the Norwegian Singing Association. The veteran singer, Professor J. W. Colberg, was the next speaker. He expressed his thanks for the honor shown him in that he had been specially invited to the anniversary social; he also thanked the singers for the interest they had shown in the development of Norwegian singing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The instructor of the Norwegian Singing Society, Mr. Christian Nilsen, was called on to make a speech, but he declined. Mr. Emil Bjorn expressed the thanks from the Association to the delegates; he also thanked the singers for their splendid co-operation during the past year and concluded with words of praise for the veteran song leaders Messrs. Colberg, Nilsen and Svenson.</p>
   <p>The new president of the Singing Association, Mr. E. J. Johnson, expressed his satisfaction at the harmony prevailing among the singers whether engaged in serious tasks or in social activity and pleasure. Mr. Ingolf Erdahl spoke in remembrance of the past president of the Association, Dr. T. Warloe, who had moved to Norway. Last Saturday Dr. Warloe was elected honorary member of the Singing Association. Mr. Julius Jaeger spoke in honor of the Norwegian <pb facs="5423969_3_0100.jpg" n="4"/>Glee Club, wishing success for its endeavor to gather means for a tour to Norway in 1902. Mr. Henry Dahl rendered some humorous songs, and Messrs. Alex Anderson, Arent Lee, and others gave brief humorous speeches.</p>
   <p>After supper, the Singing Society Bjorgvin sang Finland's national hymn and other songs. Then the Glee Club and the Norwegian Singing Society gave some numbers. The pleasant social concluded about midnight.</p>
   <p>Saturday evening the Norwegian Singing Association held its annual meeting at Schoenhofen's Hall. Mr. E. J. Johnson of the Norwegian Singing Society was elected president, Mr. Axel E. Jensen of the Norwegian Glee Club vice-president; Mr. K. Knudsen of Bjorgvin Singing Society secretary; Mr. C. F. Arnet of the Norwegian Quartet Club treasurer.</p>
