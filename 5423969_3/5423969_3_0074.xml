   <p>The Norwegian Singing Society celebrated its thirtieth anniversary, last Sunday, at Wicker Park Hall with a banquet. Mr. John R. Larsen, an artist, had decorated the Hall most attractively in the Norwegian national colors. Upon one of the long walls the banner of the Singing Society was displayed, with the Norwegian flag on one side and the American flag on the other; [there were] also paintings of Ole Bull and Edward Grieg. The platform was decorated with palms and flags, also the state emblem of Norway, and other decorations.</p>
   <p>Five long tables were set for the guests, decorated with palms and flowers.</p>
   <p>The earliest guest arrived at 4 P. M., and while waiting for the others the Singing Society sang "Sangerhilsen" ("Greeting From The Singers") and "Nat-tener saa stille" ("Quiet is the Evening"). Both numbers received lively applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At 6 P. M. the orchestra played the "supper march" and the chairman of the committee on arrangements, Mr. K. M. Hagland and his wife led the march, and Mr. Hagland also acted as toastmaster.</p>
   <p>After the edge had been taken off their hunger, Dr. A. Doe was introduced as the speaker in honor of the occasion. His speech was in part as follows:</p>
   <p>"In celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of The Norwegian Singing Society, we are confronted with a section of cultural history of which the Norwegians in this country have every reason to be proud. At the time when the Norwegian Singing Society was started, conditions were quite different and far more difficult than at present. The early members were young, poor boys, who had imigrated to America from Norway for the purpose of making a living here, but who were willing to spend their spare time in promoting the Norwegian song movement. Of the earliest members, we still find alive and among us Messrs. Martin Losby, Nokleby, Tunsberg, and Olsen. There are also a few members living who joined during the first few years.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0076.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"The Society got its first real start at a fair which was held in 1872, and at which the net earnings amounted to about $400. The voices at the time were none too good, and there was always the money difficulty. A tenor had to be hired, and the pay was fifty cents per hour. The practice hall was at the Kolamina (Coal Mine) on Green Street--a remarkable place--which at various times had been a chapel, a saloon, a song hall, and a furniture warehouse. It was finally torn down.</p>
   <p>"The first director of the Singing Society was Mr. [E. S.] Lindtner who came here from Stavanger, Norway. He was a man who took great interest in the Society, and his name is still remembered with veneration by all who knew him.</p>
   <p>"After Mr. Lindtner's departure for San Francisco, where he is still living, Mr. Larsen was elected director, and when he left, Mr. Uhe became his successor. In 1874 Mr. J. W. Colberg became the director of the Society, and under his leadership the Society became a prominent factor in the Scandinavian <pb facs="5423969_3_0077.jpg" n="4"/>world of music as well as in its social life. After twenty-five years' activity as director, Mr. Colberg withdrew and was followed by the present director, Mr. Christian Nilsen, who has proven a worthy successor to him.</p>
   <p>"From the very beginning the members of the Norwegian Singing Society have evidenced great willingness to sacrifice for the cause for which they have been working. At one time the Society had several thousand dollars in the treasury, most of which was donated to pay the deficit incurred by the first Scandinavian song festival in Chicago. Interest has been steadily increasing; it is possible that at one time there were a larger number of active members in the Society than now, but not because of any present waning interest. The financial depression under which we are laboring has, of course, had some influence upon the activities of our people, but the chorus of the Society was never any larger or better than today.</p>
   <p>"The Norwegian Singing Society, as we find it today, is a living proof of the <pb facs="5423969_3_0078.jpg" n="5"/>achievements made possible through love for a cause supported by unyielding persistence, by common sense, and by willingness to sacrifice.</p>
   <p>"Some day the Norwegian Singing Society may expire; we are living in a period of transition. When our children or children's have passed away, when the language of the great country in which we live has become the language of our descendants, then will the history of the Norwegian Singing Society have reached its last page. But by that time the mission of the Society will have been fulfilled. The Norwegian Singing Society has transplanted the haunting melodies of the Norwegian dales as well as Norwegian music to the soil of America. It has awakened and maintained in our people the love of music; it has aided mightily in developing cultured and educated citizens for our new homeland. For these reasons the Society has been of the very greatest significance."</p>
   <p>Attorney A. T. Johnson spoke in honor of America. He mentioned what the old Norwegian settlers had done for their adopted country; as law-abiding citizens <pb facs="5423969_3_0079.jpg" n="6"/>they had ever been in the forefront in the endeavor to promote the country's interests in every respect.</p>
   <p>The singers presented "Norges Bedste" ("Norway's Foremost"), after which the oldest Norwegian settler present at the celebration, Mr. P. M. Balken, gave an unusually interesting speech on the topic, "The Growing Generation".</p>
   <p>Professor J. W. Colberg, former director of the Singing Society for twenty-five years, spoke in praise of the Society. His speech was received with great enthusiasum.</p>
   <p>This very successful anniversary celebration will long live in the memory of the participants.</p>
