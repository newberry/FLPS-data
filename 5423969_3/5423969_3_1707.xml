   <p>p.4....Today twenty years ago the society, which built the "Old Peoples Home" in Norwood Park, was founded. It was the late Dr. Quales who together with his faithful wife laid the foundation for this home, which in the years to come was supported by thousands of our countrymen throughout the country.</p>
   <p>When we look back at its insignificant start, and now view the "Home," with its buildings and other property, one gets only a faint realization of the faithful and enormous work laid down here in the last twenty years, often under very trying conditions and adversities, for example; when the large main building, which had just been completed and ready for occupancy, burned to the ground January 4, 1910.</p>
   <p>A few months ago the "Home's" management issued a small pamphlet giving a general view of the blessed work and service rendered by this institution.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1708.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The society was founded in 1896 with a membership of three-hundred divided among five branches, the present membership is over one-thousand. The property is valued at $71,000.00 and the debt amounts to $7,800.00.</p>
   <p>At the beginning the home cared for twenty old people. Last years Annual Report states that in January this year the home cared for ninety-six people; expenses of course have risen, from $250.00 per month to more than $1,200.00 per month.</p>
   <p>When the pamphlet was issued, the oldest inhabitant of the "Home" was ninety-three years old, five were over ninety years. A few have been there since the inception of the "Home" or for about twenty years, but the length of the average stay has been eight years.</p>
   <p>Expenses, including Food, Medical Attention, Funerals, Wages of the staff, Maintenance of Buildings, Fire Insurance, etc., amount to $125.00 per year per inhabitant.</p>
   <p>This statistics, which has been compared with reports from similar institutions, shows <pb facs="5423969_3_1709.jpg" n="3"/>that the "Norwegian Old Peoples Home" in Norwood Park, is one of the most economically managed institutions of its kind in the United States.</p>
   <p>The "Home" to keep going needs the same liberal support it has received during the past twenty years. In this connection it might be in its place to mention The Nils T. Quales' Reserve Fund, which now amounts to about $4,000.00. To increase this fund would be the most laudatory means of honoring the memory of the founder.</p>
   <p>The capital of the fund can not be touched, only the interest.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow afternoon members and friends are invited to participate in a small festival at the "Home," to celebrate the 20th anniversary.</p>
   <p>Skandinaven sends the Norwegian Old Peoples Home in Norwood Park, its heartiest congratulations.</p>
