   <p>Ridderne (Knights), as they are familiarly known, naturally bring to mind lances, epaulettes, armor, and mysticism, and we expected to meet a lot of graybeards and baldheads when we recently attended a social evening at the Knights of the White Cross hall. Instead we found youth, vim, and vigor, with appetites (revealed at the banquet board) as ravenous as our own. Here was assembled the flower of Norwegian-American young people. When we asked officers and members about rumors that the Knights were to be absorbed by the stronger Sons of Norway we were emphatically informed that only the older (age-weakened) lodges of the Knights were transferring to the other order. The younger locals scorned the idea, and from what we could observe, their optimism as to the future of the Knights is well founded.</p>
   <p>The hall was thronged with vigorous, vital youth that thoroughly enjoyed a mixed program of song, music, recitation, and professional dancing. Dry speeches <pb facs="5423969_3_1033.jpg" n="2"/>were banned for the occasion, and this helped make it an evening of unmixed joy. A sumptuous banquet and dancing to music by a really good ten-piece dance orchestra rounded out the largest and best social session the Knights had ever held. The Knights will offer another such pleasure treat at the Northwest Hall on November 4, for which much is promised.</p>
