   <p>Dr. Ingeborg Rasmussen is again to be found at her office at 25 Bishop Court after the close of the season at the Loncoln Park Children's Sanitarium. During our interview, the doctor stated that her work during the summer had been very interesting. It is astonishing, what fond, but unknowing mothers, will load into the tender little stomachs of their few days, weeks, or months old babies. The ignorance of many mothers is truly unbelievable and it is no wonder that so many children die in infancy. Mothers feed their little mites such things as coffee, bananas, oranges, bread and butter, meat balls, and even beer; but these same mothers would assure the doctor that the child had been fed only milk. Chemicals and the microscope do not lie. Thorough chemical and microscopical examination of the excretions of the babies proved beyond doubt that they were being raised on a killing diet. So a proper diet was then arranged to fit each individual case. The improved appearance and vitality of these children was very apparent, <pb facs="5423969_3_1171.jpg" n="2"/>and visitors at the sanitarium are so enthusiastic over the work done there, that many have pledged support to a more extensive work during next summer. The sanitarium offers an opportunity for profitable medical research, which will no doubt be taken advantage of by many Chicago physicians during the coming seasons.</p>
