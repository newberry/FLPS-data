   <p>"The Discovery of the South Pole by Roald Amundsen," a book in two volumes (by Scandia) is now on sale. It is an interesting treatise--authentic and plentifully illustrated. Among the pictures is one showing Amundsen's tent, actually pitched at the pole, with the Norwegian flag floating proudly above it. It also contains a copy of the official map of the polar section which was submitted to the King of Norway, the original map drawn by Roald Amundsen personally. The publication contains a day-by-day diary with accompanying pictures; both diary and pictures are Amundsen's own work. The second volume covers all details of the expedition by dog sleds, and the narrative and pictures are very interesting and clear. The author has promised material for the coming volumes in time for publication before September 1, and Scandia is giving its readers an opportunity to secure the entire set by sending in ten paid annual subscriptions to Scandia.</p>
