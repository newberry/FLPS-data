   <p>The Foreign Language Governmental Information Service Bureau addressed the following interesting letter to the English-language press.</p>
   <p>"This letter will announce to you the establishment of the American Press Bureau as a division of the Foreign Language Governmental Information Service. You are familiar with the work and aims of our foreign-language bureaus, and with our efforts to give you papers, through our governmental information releases, adequate and interesting reports of the government departments' activities and information.</p>
   <p>"Through the American Press Bureau, we wish to give the English-language <pb facs="5423969_3_0473.jpg" n="2"/>press true accounts of the foreign-speaking peoples and their press. A number of articles have already been prepared and their titles will show their general trend--The Alien and the Income Tax, The Alien and Education, Industries and the Alien, Alien Efforts Toward Americanization, Why the Alien Goes Home, and several more. Two of these have already appeared in the press [including Skandinaven], and others will appear in various other publications shortly. The Bureau will also send out press bulletins containing short items on the activities of the foreign-speaking groups. A book entitled "The Alien in America" is also being prepared. This book will give to the native born, in a more exhaustive treatment, these facts on the foreign-born people.</p>
   <p>"We deplore the grave injustice which is being done the foreign-born peoples as a whole these days, by the many inaccurate and sensational newspaper stories; and the unfair and unfriendly treatment accorded them by Americans <pb facs="5423969_3_0474.jpg" n="3"/>who are ignorant or misinformed concerning them and their press. Our eighteen months of intimate relations and work with the foreign-language press has brought us indisputable proof that the large majority of these papers and peoples are Americans in the truest sense, that they have rendered valuable service to this country, and are behind no one in their desire to see any disloyal or seditious publications speedily and properly dealt with.</p>
   <p>"Because of this conviction, based on our experience in this matter, and because we realize that much of the prevalent prejudice against the foreigner is due to lack of knowledge of existing facts, we are making this effort to give all possible publicity and discussion to the constructive record of the foreign-born groups and their press. We hope we may have the co-operation of the American Press Bureau in this undertaking."</p>
