   <p>The seventh of June will be celebrated this year, as last year, by the Norwegians of Chicago. The Sports Club Sleipner has arranged for a festival on a large scale at Brand's Park. A fine program is offered, and in addition to the features recorded on the posters, there will probably be a meet between the leading Norwegian Sports Clubs in Chicago.</p>
   <p>To explain the holding of a festival on the date mentioned, the committee on arrangements has issued thousands of hand bills of the following contents; On June 6, 1905, the Norwegian cabinet informed King Oscar, in writing, that the members felt compelled to resign in order to remain faithful to the Norwegian people,and the Norwegian constitution, since the King himself had exceeded the power granted him by the constitution, through his last veto. The following day the Norwegian parliament decreed that the King had ceased to govern as Norwegian King.</p>
