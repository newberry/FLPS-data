   <p>P.5.col.2... Holfdan Koht has published a new book "Pengemagt og Arbrid i Amerika" (Capitalism and Labor in America) now on sale at Lund's Book Store at the modest price of 85.</p>
   <p>It is surprising what one pair of eyes can discover in so short a time as eight months, especially when the owner of said eyes has an uncanny ability to appraise and portray what has been seen.</p>
   <p>Prof. Koht has made every hour of the eight months he has spent here count. The result is the aforementioned book. He paints a realistic picture of the power of money and the depressing influence on the condition of the worker in general. His portrayal of our trusts and their influence on the social and economical structure of the country is clear and convincing. His analysis of methods and maneuvers employed by Standard Oil and other industrial octopuses to eliminate all competition is evidence of close and intelligent observation. The book is written in the language of the working man-no high sounding phraseology, and is in itself a clear history of the development and results of the present social structure. In brief this book is a real education in political economy and could profitably be translated in several languages.</p>
