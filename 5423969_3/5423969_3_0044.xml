   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club held a banquet at its hall on Wabansia and Washtenaw Avenues last Saturday evening. The festivities began with card playing; later the guests gathered at the banquet table where the president, Mr. Axel E. Jensen, delivered an address of welcome.</p>
   <p>Senator Niels Juul (Dane) gave the oration in honor of the day, reminding the Glee Club members of the proposed trip to Norway in 1902 which the Club had set up as its goal for the time being. The speaker was confident of the ability of the members to raise the required amount for the trip. He also urged the members to permit no divergence in their endeavors in the field of singing. When arriving in Norway, he said, the singers should be able to give full evidence of the fact that the Norwegians in America have not forgotten the songs of the homeland even though they have been absent from Norway for many years. He then presented the Club with a collection of photographs from Europe and America, <pb facs="5423969_3_0045.jpg" n="2"/>which will be raffled off; the proceeds will be added to the fund for the trip to Norway.</p>
   <p>The Glee Club will hold a Christmas social during the last week of December; a masked ball at Aurora Hall on February 9; a bazaar at Scandia Hall in March; a festival in honor of Norway on May 17; an excursion to Milwaukee in July 1901. The income from these affairs is earmarked for the trip to Norway in 1902.</p>
