   <p>The Norwegian Sports Association at war with the Amateur Athletic Union.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Turnforening, the Sports Club Sleipner, the Ski Club Norge, and the Athletic Club Nye Viking have been expelled from the Amateur Athletic Union on account of their participation in the May 17th celebration at Brand's Park.</p>
   <p>Several of the best all around athletes through this action have become ineligible for participation in Amateur Athletic Union contests.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians maintain that they have broken no rules of the Amateur Athletic Union. The contests in Brand's Park, they say, were simply a family affair, as it were; the participants in sports were there as individual members of the Norwegian National League, of which all the clubs mentioned are members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0804.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Norwegian athletes have shown a tendency of late toward carrying off the laurels in the sports meets in which they have participated, and this is, of course, not relished by the big down town clubs. It is not at all impossible that this is the real reason for the expulsion, and that the matter of May 17th contest is simply an excuse to get rid of some too capable rivals.</p>
   <p>The action may prove unfortunate for the Amateur Athletic Union. The Norwegian clubs are considering the formation of a Norwegian inter-state athletic union in which the Amateur Athletic Union might find a formidable competitor for the attention and good will of the public.</p>
