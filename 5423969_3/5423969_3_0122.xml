   <p>The concert at St. Paul's Church, North Avenue and Leavitt Street, last Monday evening, was well attended when one considers the inclement weather of that evening. The concert was given by the ladies of Norumbega; the church was decorated with plants around the platform.</p>
   <p>The program opened with an organ piece by Eugene Skaaden, after which the choir gave a beautiful and appealing number. Violinist Frank Winters played two beautiful selections after which Mr. J. Alexander Bing sang "Fear Ye Not, O Israel!" Mr. Bing proved to be in possession of a very attractive tenor voice. Mrs. Olive Rolston, soprano, and Miss Nora Olson, contralto, sang beautifully, as usual, and the whole concert was a credit to the Norumbega Ladies. Miss Grace Nelson was to have sung at the concert but, unfortunately, she had been taken ill and thus was unable to appear.</p>
