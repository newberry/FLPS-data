   <p>English-Dano-Norwegian Dictionary by Martin Ulvestad With Complete Pronunciation Guide John Anderson Publishing Company 183-187 North Peoria Street, Chicago</p>
   <p>There is a great difference between the ordinary English-Dano-Norwegian dictionaries and Martin Ulvestad's new dictionary.</p>
   <p>1. The other dictionaries show us only the translation of the English words. Ulvestad's dictionary presents not merely the translation of the words, but also their correct pronunciation and their division into syllables, both of which are of great importance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0652.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. The publishers of other dictionaries presuppose that those who are to use the books have a knowledge of grammar; for this reason the words are not recorded in their various grammatical forms. In the dictionary by Martin Ulvestad the words are presented in their various forms in order that common people who have not studied grammar may be able to understand the book without difficulty and make use of it.</p>
   <p>3. The other dictionaries refer to the English language only as it is being used in England. Ulvestad's dictionary discusses the language both as it is being used in England and as it is being used in America.</p>
   <p>4. In Ulvestad's dictionary are included a large number of new everyday Americanisms. It is a matter of course that such words are not to be found in the older dictionaries (which, by the way, have been published in Europe) however excellent those books may have been.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0653.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The publishers have received more than two thousand statements containing warm praise of the book. The book contains seven hundred and thirty-two pages of large size. These pages contain about thirty-two thousand English words with translation and pronunciation. The dictionary is bound in beautiful and solid binding. The price is $2.50.</p>
