   <p>The Norwegian-American Turner Association is holding its third annual meeting in Chicago. The boys from Minneapolis came to the city last Friday. The turner competition took place yesterday, and tomorrow evening the meeting will close with a banquet.</p>
   <p>It is a pleasure to observe the vigorous, healthy turner youths, whether in the midst of athletic activities or just walking along the street. "A healthy mind in a healthy body" is their motto, and they constitute the living evidence of the influence of athletics on their bodies. Their bodies are developed systematically; their poise is excellent; their steps are light and firm; their eyes are clear; all their movements are quick, sure, and definite. They are in full control of all their faculties, thus being able to use them to suit their purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0852.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Norwegian youth in America ought to take up athletics more generally. Systematic, well-balanced bodily activities will strengthen and develop the mind as well as the body, creating healthy, capable people. The ancient Greeks owed their victory over the Persians to the Olympic sports. The ancient Romans were able to conquer the world because athletics were an important factor in the education of the Roman youth. The Norsemen of old put athletics in the place of honor, and this fact made them into a conquering people. The Duke of Wellington declared that "the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton." The Americans are the greatest athletes of the present generation; for this reason they are also the most courageous people of our generation--the "vikings" of the present age. The Norwegians had become careless in regard to athletics during recent years; now, however, the outlook in this respect is more promising in Norway. When athletics have once more been given the place of honor, we will hear less empty talk and will find development in clear thinking and in definiteness in action in our old homeland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0853.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Among the Norwegians in America, as well as among the other Nordics here, the matter of athletics has been given but scant consideration, and the reasons for this are readily discerned. The young people born in this country comply with the customs of the land of their birth, and that is as it ought to be. Thus they learn the sports in vogue; they also learn to use their fists. Most of our Norwegian-American schools have come to realize the importance of sports although several of these schools could and ought to do more along this line than they have done so far.</p>
   <p>In regard to the young Norwegian immigrants, however, little has been done in the line of sports. The Norwegian turner societies in Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, and Brooklyn, have been working hard to awaken the interest of the public in the matter, but this is about the total achieved so far.</p>
   <p>These turner societies deserve far greater support by our young people than has been the case up to the present. But that is not all. Turner societies <pb facs="5423969_3_0854.jpg" n="4"/>ought to be organized in every city and in every settlement where Norwegian youths are to be found. In addition, every young people's society, whether affiliated with a religious organization or not, ought to include athletics in its program. The ministers can do much in this matter and they should. It would do no harm if the younger ministers were to join the turner societies.</p>
   <p>Our young people will become healthier, stronger, and more capable if the time which now is wasted in idleness, in saloons, or in dance halls be employed in athletics. One branch of athletics is boxing. There is no desire on the part of people, young or old, to mix in brawls or fights; but it is too bad when a young Norwegian boy, strong and healthy, has not received enough training in the use of his fists to enable him to defend himself when attacked. In a country where personal courage is valued as highly as it is in America, a man will lose the respect of others as well as his self-confidence if he be compelled to humble himself again and again in order to escape a <pb facs="5423969_3_0855.jpg" n="5"/>beating. Yet it has been reported in the papers repeatedly that Scandinavians have been beaten by gangs of other nationalities. Only a short while ago a crowd of more than one hundred Norwegians permitted themselves to be robbed of their equipment and driven to flight by a gang of twenty scoundrels. Everywhere we hear the same story; always the Norsemen are being beaten; never do the Norsemen beat others. People of other nationalities are noticing this, and our people are not thereby gaining in respect. The notion is gaining ground quite widely that the Scandinavians are people sadly in lack of courage--fine servants and workers, but cowardly, poor fighters. We know that this opinion is incorrect. The Scandinavians are physically as vigorous as other people and more vigorous than most others. Also, the Scandinavians do not lack courage, although in this respect they have to take a backseat to the native-born Americans. But even the most courageous person will feel like retreating if he knows in advance that he cannot win in some impending fight. Here the Norwegians have sad experience; they know that they are at a disadvantage because they have not learned how to use their fists; and so they retreat where they ought to stand like men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0856.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>This national shame would not long persist if athletics, boxing, and other sports were taken up for practice by our young people. These sports would develop ability and courage in the individual; would give the Norwegians as a people a firmer and steadier attitude; make them able to stand up for their rights both politically and in other fields of endeavor....Athletics is an important factor in the moral development of a people, and for this reason, the moral leaders of the people--the ministers--ought to take the lead in the athletic movement with their good advice, encouragement, support, and worthy example.</p>
