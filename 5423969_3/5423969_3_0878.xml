   <p>There is no better medium for touching the heartstrings of the multitude than the press.</p>
   <p>The marvel of the century was the arrival at the port of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 of the Viking Ship. It was petted and admired by visitors as a most marvelous ship, and Captain Anderson and his crew were banqueted and felicitated upon having braved the seas and safely anchored in Jackson Park.</p>
   <p>Go see it today! Stowed away upon blocks outside the Field Museum, shelterless, listless, uncared for, desecrated, insulted! Its shields lie upon the ground beneath it. The colossal Field Museum was intended as a repository for exhibits.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0879.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Norsemen of red blood, why have we thus forsaken our sacred possession? If our Viking Ship merited bringing to America and receiving a place as an exhibit at the World's Columbian Exposition, should we not all the more revere and cherish it as a memento, or call it what you will, symbolizing the valor, the dexterity, yea, the sportsmanship of our brave forefathers? Said they:</p>
   <p>"The blast of the tempest aids our oars. The bellowing of heaven, the roar of thunder, harm us not. The hurricane is our servant and drives us whither we wish to go."</p>
   <p>With feelings akin to deep devotion to our forefathers and pride in their achievements and in the hope of arousing our people from their lethargy, thus to devise some method of preserving Norway's exhibit at the greatest of word's expositions, this appeal is made.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0880.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The ship needs shelter and some small repairs. Other exhibits repose sweetly, submitted to [public] inspection, within the Field Museum. Why not ours? A citizens' resolution, addressed to the Governor, who has jurisdiction over the park system, might serve the purpose.</p>
