   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Orphanage Society held its annual meeting in the Zion Church, on January 18. The president of the Society, Reverend N. J. Ellestad, presided. After the minutes of the last annual meeting had been read, the meeting proceeded to take up the business outlined in the agenda, the first point being the following report by the president:</p>
   <p>"Last year we collected approximately $10,000. This money was to be used to build a new orphanage building. We find that the new building will cost about $23,000.</p>
   <p>"Mrs. Jevne's bequest of $5,000 to the Orphanage helped a lot. The treasurer of the building committee, Mr. Oscar H. Haugan, reports that the building fund <pb facs="5423969_3_1534.jpg" n="2"/>now has a total of $25,268.76, Which means that we have a surplus of $893.87.</p>
   <p>"Sanitary and health conditions at the Orphanage have been excellent. We have not yet appointed a manager, but will have to do so soon as possible. Sister Caroline Williams has carried the entire burden and responsibility; she has done a man's job at the institution. We have been fortunate in finding such a fine gardner as Mr. T. Hansen. When spring comes we expect to see a beautiful garden and park at the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>"It is also important that we hire an additional teacher in English, Norwegian, and religion."</p>
