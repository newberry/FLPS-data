  <body>
   <p>The editor of Social Demokraten, the Norwegian socialist publication of Chicago, has been called into court for having published scandalous accusations against Police Inspector Sorensen, under the heading"Dissatisfaction in Police Circles. Students at Police Officers' School of Instruction Refuse to Join Force," the paper stated that Inspector Sorensen had visited the school and had told the students they had no understanding and knew nothing, in fact, that they were dumb. The students resented this insult and refused to attend further sessions of the school. This, one may call (department) pride, from the newest recruit to the inspector himself.</p>
   <p>We wonder how the Norwegian police department would react to such publicity as our Chicago department must squirm through as a daily diet.</p>
