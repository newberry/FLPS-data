   <p>Nora Lodge No. 1, R. H. K. celebrated Thanksgiving Day with a cinch party and banquet Thursday afternoon and evening at Nora Hall, in which more than one hundred members and their friends participated. The committee on arrangements....had decorated both halls with palms, flags, and wreaths. The banner of the Lodge was displayed in the front of the hall, and on one of the side walls the silk flag used by the Fifteenth Wisconsin Regiment in the Civil War, was hung. The decorations were appropriate for the occasion.</p>
   <p>In the larger hall were placed twenty card tables where card players were busy, two gentlemen and two ladies at each table. In the meanwhile Mrs. Harold Larsen had set the banquet tables in the smaller hall.... At seven o'clock the band played the dinner march, and the guests, led by the chairman of the committee on arrangements and his wife, marched to the tables. The chairman made a speech of welcome....then called upon Mr. Martin Field, the secretary of the Lodge, to speak in honor of the day.</p>

   <p>Captain Louis R. Johnson spoke in honor of America and Chief Secretary Jens Scheldrup gave a fine survey of the work of the Lodge.</p>
   <p>After justice had been done to the excellent food the guests were conducted to the larger hall where the floor had been cleared for dancing....Later in the evening prizes were distributed to the best card players....The banquet was a success in every way....</p>
