   <p>From Klee Brothers and Company, clothiers, the Skandinaven yesterday received a brief note reading as follows:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"You will undoubtedly be pleased to learn that we have received a mail order from an ad in the Skandinaven [as follows]:</p>
   <p>"I send you ten dollars in a money order for a three-piece suit (jacket, pants, and vest); material, mixed cassimeres or cheviot; style as on picture, for a boy age fifteen. Also for two shirts (white), one-half dozen standing collars, three pairs black stockings, and one tie, all for a boy of fifteen.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0533.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>" 'Please answer order promptly and address</p>
   <p>Mrs. W. Lannestad,</p>
   <p>Paia Maui, Territory of Kawaii.</p>
   <p>" 'P.S.-- I suppose the goods may be sent by mail in one or maybe two packages. Hoping to be fairly treated and to hear from you as soon as possible,</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Mrs. W. Lannestad.' "</p>
   <p>The Skandinaven is always pleased to learn that advertisers who patronize its columns receive ample returns and it is justified in stating that it has abundant proof in this respect. Nor is this the first time advertisements in this paper have brought orders from foreign fields.</p>
   <p>The circulation of the Skandinaven is perhaps more general in character <pb facs="5423969_3_0534.jpg" n="3"/>than any other newspaper published in the United States. Unlike the Constitution, the Skandinaven follows the flag--the flag of the United States, the flag of Norway, and the flags of Denmark and Sweden. The flag of Norway is seen on all seas and in every harbor, and the Skandinaven is also there to carry greetings to Norwegian tars. It has readers in every state and territory of the United States, and in every province of Canada; it has a large circulation in the Scandinavian countries; it has patrons in Europe; it goes to Porto Rico, Cuba, and a number of the other islands in the West Indies; it is found in most of the republics of Central and South America; it is a regular visitor in many homes in the Hawaiian Islands; it calls upon sailors and missionaries in Japan, China, and India; it has cheered many of our brave boys in the camps in the Philippines; it finds its way to the cities and mission stations of South Africa, from Cape Town to Pretoria; it is a welcome guest in many homes in Madagascar; it has many readers in Australia and New Zealand; in short, it covers the globe and is read everywhere.</p>
   <p>This applies especially to the semiweekly edition. And many advertisers in <pb facs="5423969_3_0535.jpg" n="4"/>this edition can testify that their first orders from foreign countries came in response to advertisements in the semiweekly Skandinaven. It has brought orders for ploughs, pianos, sewing machines, watches, patent medicines, patterns, tools, etc. from the Scandinavian countries, Canada, Hawaii, etc.</p>
   <p>Until a couple of years ago the circulation of the daily Skandinaven was mainly confined to Chicago. But the daily edition has since been forging ahead rapidly in the Northwestern states and also in the more distant fields generally, and for the most part in Chicago and the Middle West.</p>
   <p>The secret of this paper's high value as an advertising medium is to be found in the implicit confidence placed in it by its readers. But for this fact the advertisement of Klee Brothers and Company would have brought no response from a lady living in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, some five thousand miles from Chicago. But the readers know that what the Skandinaven says is so, and this confidence extends to the advertising <pb facs="5423969_3_0536.jpg" n="5"/>columns of the paper.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In 1910-1913 the translator saw copies of the Skandinaven five hundred miles up the Amazon River, and the Negro and Madera. So this editorial is no idle boast.]</p>
