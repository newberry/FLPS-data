   <p>The Norwegian Orphanage Society held its quarterly meeting in the Hauges Church, Wabansia and Central Park Avenues, last Tuesday evening. After the reading of the minutes of the previous meeting, a report was read by the vice-president, Reverend Lars Harrisville. Eight new members were accepted by the Society. The report of the vice-president was as follows:</p>
   <p>"Friends, because our president, Reverend N. J. Ellestad, is in California recuperating from his recent illness, I will give the report. My report will merely consist of a few of the highlights of activity during the past three months.</p>
   <p>"First, I want to report on the running expenses. We spend at least thirty dollars per day at the Norwegian Lutheran Orphanage in Edison Park. Today, this expenditure well takes care of the eight-five children who are now <pb facs="5423969_3_1527.jpg" n="2"/>inmates at the home. The income received from donations and numerous other sources will just barely cover the running expenses. But, as the late banker Haugan used to say: 'A reserve fund is necessary, and should be established.' If a premature death had not taken him, I am sure his dream would have come true."</p>
   <p>After the acceptance of this report, the treasurer submitted the following report:</p>
