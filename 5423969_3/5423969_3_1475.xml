   <p>p.7.........Home Finding Society held its annual meeting Wednesday evening in the St. Paul Church. Pastor M. E. Fretheim was in the choir, as Pastor Gullixon, the Society's President, was unable to be present; his annual report was read at the meeting.</p>
   <p>The report showed that the society had had a successful year in every respect. Sixty-two children had been taken care of at the home. Good homes had been found for several children, and others had been reclaimed by their parents when conditions in their homes warranted this. At the beginning of this year (1917) there were twenty-eight children at the home at 4840 Byron Street.</p>
   <p>The society has been most fortunate in securing Miss T. Erdahl as Matron, as she has proven to be a very capable manager.</p>
   <p>Many new societies and organizations have during the year done considerable work for the children, and this has been valuable help to us and is highly appreciated.</p>

   <p>The treasurer Ellert Knudson read his report: Receipts were $4,383.08, disbursements $3,706.90. At the beginning of the year, (1916) there was a cash balance of $840.60, total cash on hand January 1, 1917,was $1,516.78. The auditors; H. Rommen and O. Alf. Johnson reported that the treasurer's books had been audited and found correct.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Rommen had worked out an interesting statistical tabel, which showed, that during 1916 the weekly expenses to run the home amounted to $71.40; for each child $2.40 per week. The society's home, which is clear of encumbrances, is appraised at $9,923.78, which in itself is very encouraging to our many friends in and out of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Four new directors were elected: Pastor G. A. Gullixon from St. Paul Church, Reier Egeland from Our Savior Church; Kaja Jensen from St. Johannes Church and Mrs. James Halseth from First Lutheran Church, Logan Square.</p>
   <p>In appreciation of the many years of unselfish works in the interest of the home, Dr. Magnus Unseth was unanimously elected "Life Member" of the Home Finding Society.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1477.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The same honor was accorded H. Rommen, who established a practical book-keeping system at the home, and also during several years prepared a satisfactory report, so that the society was recognized by Chicago Association of Commerce. The meeting also expressed its appreciation to the President, Pastor Gullixon, its secretary Mr. Hovland and its treasurer E. Knudson, and to the Board of Directors for their true and faithful work throughout the year.</p>
   <p>As auditors were elected H. Rommen and C. Buslee, the society starts the new year in a fair financial position.</p>
   <p>It is the intention, if possible, to extend the work; a home of this kind is a great necessity to the many orphaned and neglected children, who need a guiding hand on the path to become useful upright men and women in the community.</p>
   <p>The meeting closed with a feeling of satisfaction over a well spent year in interest of the young ones.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1478.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>May 1917, also become a blessed year for the children at the home, the personnel and the many members and friends of "Home Finding Society."</p>
   <p>(Christ. Buslee.)</p>
