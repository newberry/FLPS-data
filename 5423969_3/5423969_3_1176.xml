   <p>The Norwegian Tabitha Hospital is making good in every way, according to the quarterly report submitted at the last meeting of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>All current bills were paid to date, the entire indebtedness on the building liquidated, and, although the hospital has thirteen hundred and twenty-five dollars' worth of free treatment, there is still a nice nest egg in the building fund. The fund is on deposit in Haugan &amp; Lindgren's State Bank of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The hospital, which is no longer large enough in having become too small in view of the growing demands made upon it, is launching a campaign for funds for expansion. A bazaar is to be held next week (October 23 to October 28, inclusive), at Northwest Hall, corner of North and Western Avenues. Donations to the bazaar will be thankfully received at the Hospital and all friends are urged to attend the big bazaar. A continuous program of vocal and instrumental music will be given each day and evening.</p>
