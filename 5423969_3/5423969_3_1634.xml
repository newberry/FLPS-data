   <p>From the Norwegian Orphanage in Chicago the Skandinaven has received the following appeal to the holders of the chain letters which the Orphanage sent out about a year ago:</p>
   <p>"It is our wish to close the account of the chain letters from the Orphanage and those who are now in possession of these letters are requested to send them to the undersigned before July 1 of the present year. Do not send out any copies of the letter after the date mentioned. For one year these letters have been circulated, and something over two hundred dollars has been received as a result. A large number of letters are out at present, and we hope that all of them are in good hands so that when they are returned every one of them will contain a sum of money, large or small. Some people have sent more money than called for with their letters, instead of copying the letters and forwarding them. Such action would be very commendable at present when we are discontinuing our <pb facs="5423969_3_1635.jpg" n="2"/>campaign. What a boon to our cause it would be if the letters circulating at present were returned to us with an average of one dollar per letter. Not only would we then be able to pay the debt still outstanding (about $1,500), but we would also be able to accept an additional number of orphans now knocking in vain at the door of the Orphanage with their applications. We have space for twice as many as we have here now.... but much is required before we can take them in.</p>
   <p>We sincerely hope that none of those now in receipt of any of the chain letters will throw the letter into the wastebasket, but will act in accordance with the admonition given above.</p>
   <p>If anyone who has not received a chain letter should feel able and willing to contribute to our work, please send the contribution to Reverend G. O. <pb facs="5423969_3_1636.jpg" n="3"/>Paulsrud, 15 Cherry Place, Chicago, Illinois. Reverend Paulsrud is the secretary of the Norwegian Orphanage Society.</p>
