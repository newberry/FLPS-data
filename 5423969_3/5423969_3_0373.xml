   <p>Of late, we have had numerous contributions sent to the columns of our paper: articles, poetry, translations, etc., many of them anonymous. Much of this material is good, so we pass it on to our readers. Someday we hope to know who the authors are, and we hope that they will come out in the open.</p>
   <p>That Daddy was a hustler And here in worldly strife A rough-and-ready rustler, Who led a strenuous life. This always should remind us To hump to beat the band, That we may leave behind us Some footprints in the sand.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0374.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He was a record breaker, For so the sagas run; He was a fluent speaker And handy with a gun. You never heard him grumble, Nor of his lot complain, And if he took a tumble He soon was up again.</p>
   <p>In France he was dictator, And taught them how to fight, As bard and navigator, He was simply out of sight. He led at every function, Was to himself a law And ruled without injunction, From Nome to Panama.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0375.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But Pa passed over yonder</p>
   <p>As everybody must;</p>
   <p>They squandered all the plunder</p>
   <p>And I must raise the dust.</p>
   <p>I have a tired feeling,</p>
   <p>Which words can ne'er express.</p>
   <p>His greatness is concealing</p>
   <p>My magnitude, I guess.</p>
   <p>But meadows are in clover,</p>
   <p>The fields grow corn and rice,</p>
   <p>We sail the ocean over,</p>
   <p>Without cutting any ice.</p>
   <p>The skies are blue and bonnie,</p>
   <p>The mountain peaks are high,</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0376.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>And you just bet your money,</p>
   <p>We'll get there if we try.</p>
