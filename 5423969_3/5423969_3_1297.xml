   <p>....At the last meeting of the board of directors of the Tabitha Hospital Society, Reverend M. K. Bleken moved to have the secretary of the board ordered to relinquish the lists of the members of the Hospital Society, and to render the lists available for inspection at the Hospital. I wish to support Reverend Mr. Bleken's motion for the following reasons:</p>
   <p>1. A branch will frequently hold socials and meetings to which members of other branches are invited. The secretary of the Society cannot be expected to take care of the invitations, and as matters are now, I can state from my own experience that it is easier to find a needle in a haystack than to get <pb facs="5423969_3_1298.jpg" n="2"/>hold of the membership lists of the Tabitha Society.</p>
   <p>2. If the lists are left open for inspection, a repetition of the voting muddle at the last annual meeting would be prevented. At that meeting voting was done by persons who, under the rules, had not been members long enough to be entitled to vote.</p>
   <p>If the secretary believes that he would break the constitution by relinquishing the lists, let him keep the originals and place a certified copy for inspection at the Hospital. Needless to say, such a copy ought to be kept, together with other documents concerning the Hospital, by the superintendent, and should not be placed in the waiting room.</p>
