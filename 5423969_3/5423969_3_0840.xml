   <p>The distribution of prizes in connection with the turner convention has caused considerable surprise, especially among the people who were present at the [turner] exhibitions. It wouldn't be too much to say that the turners from Minneapolis made an exceptionally favorable impression upon the spectators. But, when the list of prizes is inspected, one receives quite a different impression. Nearly all the prizes went to Chicago, with hardly anything left to the guests. This fact is so surprising that it has called forth comment in several places.</p>
   <p>One may assume that the turners in Chicago are not too well satisfied with this situation. They know that the decision of the judges is unjust as regards the turners from Minneapolis.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0841.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The selection of judges was as unfortunate as could be. Of the six judges, five represented the Chicago societies, while the society in Minneapolis was represented by only one man. To this it should be added that the five judges from Chicago are German turner teachers. The Norwegian turner societies in Chicago are following the German system of athletics while the turner society in Minneapolis is following the Norwegian-Swedish system. It seems reasonable to assume that the five German teachers who functioned as prize-judges were desirous, both from national and personal reasons, to maintain the superiority of the German turner system. The temptation to take this attitude would be so much the greater since the meet came to take on the character of a competition between the two systems. Naturally, the Germans believe in their own system, and, being in complete control of the prize jury, the safeguards for impartial decisions were insufficient.</p>
   <p>As a result of all this, the decision of the prize-judges will be considered as valueless in wide circles. It is a matter of course that the Chicago turners regret the result. They are fine upstanding boys who do not desire <pb facs="5423969_3_0842.jpg" n="3"/>undeserved honor. Neither have they forgotten the splendid reception which was accorded them in Minneapolis, and one may be sure that their desire was to make the turners from Minneapolis enjoy their visit here. The fact that the reception in Chicago cannot be compared to the reception of the Chicago boys in Minneapolis, is due to local conditions which cannot be blamed on the Chicago turners.</p>
   <p>Yet, by a little care, we could have avoided having a prize jury who could not offer guarantees against partiality in decisions.</p>
