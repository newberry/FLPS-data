   <p>The medical staff of the Norwegian Hospital decided, at its April meeting, to make arrangements for a library at the Hospital for the use of patients and the staff. The necessary money for the purpose was appropriated from the surplus of the latest charity ball. A committee was appointed, and as the result of the committee's work, the hospital now has an attractive and substantial bookcase with about five hundred volumes of Scandinavian, English, and German literature, and also a number of valuable religious books and several hundred magazines. If all of this had to be bought, the amount of money available would have been far from sufficient, but thanks to the wide-spread interest in the Hospital, and to the will to sacrifice on the part of those interested, the library has been realized at but little cost to the treasury of the medical staff of the Hospital.</p>
   <p>First among the contributors to this undertaking must be mentioned the publisher <pb facs="5423969_3_1356.jpg" n="2"/>of the Skandinaven, Mr. John Anderson; attention to his services in the interest of the new library has been called by the vote of thanks recently adopted by the meeting of the staff and addressed to Mr. Anderson. Next must be mentioned the Vala Reading Club, which furnished the materials for the bookcase, and Mr. E. Staff, who made the case. The bookcase is both attractive and substantial, and the fact that it was built during the summer months, the busiest season for cabinetmakers, adds to the Hospital's obligation to Mr. Staff.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. G. Krogness showed his interest in the cause by sending us several hundred of the most widely read magazines of the past three or four years. Pharmacist C. F. Bjercke presented the library with a number of interesting books and magazines, and is also sending to the Hospital, every week, the latest copies of Leslie's and Harper's magazines. Last but not least must be mentioned Mr. R. Stewart who, with his usual liberality, has donated to the Hospital many dollars' worth of binding material--both for books and magazines--and illustrated works.</p>
   <p>To all of these and to everybody else who assisted in bringing about the unexpectedly fortunate result, the Hospital and its medical staff extend their heartiest thanks.</p>
