   <p>The annual "Lawn Social" for the benefit of the Home Finding Society will be held this coming Saturday, afternoon and evening at the Home, 4840 W. Byron St. The committee on arrangements has been struggling hard to make this social surpass all those held at earlier times, and visitors on Saturday will find everything in first class order.</p>
   <p>At present there are about thirty children in the regular residence at the home and, as anyone will realize, it is not easy to provide enough of food and clothing for so many children. Especially in times of high prices, as at present, the task becomes very difficult. But the Norwegian population in Chicago have found ways of keeping this work going at earlier times, and it may be said with confidence that they will not permit the children of the Home to suffer want in the future. Several ministers will speak at Saturday's Festival, and good music has been provided for. The refreshments at these socials have always been of the very best kind, so that those who are coming to the arrangement on Saturday may confidently expect to get great value for the slight amount of money required of them.</p>
