   <p>....The following information concerning the work of the Deaconess Society in Chicago is presented in reply to statements in an article in Skandinaven for April 13, by N. Qually, Seneca, Illinois.</p>
   <p>First, the Deaconess Home has never refused admittance to anybody on account of his or her being poor. Frequently we have had to refuse admittance to people simply because every bed was occupied; but our rule is that in case we have a vacant bed and two people are applying for accommodations, one able to pay and one unable to do so, we invariably take in the one who is unable to pay. Of course we expect all who are able to pay to do so, <pb facs="5423969_3_1371.jpg" n="2"/>since it would hardly be right to employ the money given by charitable people for the aid of such as do not need aid. The rate of payment is seven dollars per week for those who pay in full; those who cannot afford the full price are being accommodated for three dollars or four dollars per week, while those who are utterly poor are admitted free.</p>
   <p>The annual report for 1898 shows that only one-tenth of the work at the Home for the year mentioned was paid for in full; nine-tenths of the work was fully or partially free. The report for the year 1899 shows that two-tenths of the guests paid in full, while eight-tenths of the guests were served partially or wholly free. For the first quarter of the present year the report shows one-seventh of the guests as paying in full while six-sevenths of the guests were accommodated fully or partly free of charge. In addition, the Home distributed free of charge, food, clothing, medicines, and medical aid to many poor people outside the Home.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1372.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But even if we could not show such magnificent charitable activity as indicated above, the cause would deserve support. The purpose of the Deaconess Home is not merely to conduct a hospital; it is also an institution for the training of deaconesses who will be sent from the Home, later on, to take charge of hospitals, orphanages, homes for the aged, and similar institutions of mercy; or as deaconesses for congregations to help the poor, the sick, and those suffering in other ways, especially in the large cities. It is not to be expected that an institution for the training of the young can support itself, especially when no fee is charged for the training. Such a training institution receives support, not on account of such good as it may do directly, but rather on account of the good influence which may reach society through those who have been trained at the institution. There is also another objective for our work; the care of the poor in their homes. One or more deaconesses are sent out to seek those who are sick or poor or in some way derelict, especially here in Chicago, for whom nobody cares; who have nobody to turn to. A certain amount of this type of aid has been given, but frequently we have been unable to extend this kind of aid because we have not had enough deaconesses; the Home has been <pb facs="5423969_3_1373.jpg" n="4"/>full of patients.</p>
   <p>In regard to the old woman Mr. Qually speaks about, there is probably a misunderstanding. From his description one would judge that the lady was headed for the Home for the Aged, where $300 is required for admittance as resident. Many take offence at this, saying that this is not charity. If people will use their brains, however, they will realize that also at the Home for Aged a large-scale work of mercy is being done. The old people accepted at that institution may live for five years, ten years, fifteen years, and during such a period of years they are being supplied with food, clothing, care, doctors, and medicine, if they are ill; and finally a respectable burial. How far will $300 suffice to take care of all of this?</p>
