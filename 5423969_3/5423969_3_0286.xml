   <p>The committee on arrangements for the Norwegian Singing Association's Tivoli Night in Bjorgvin Hall October 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th is now hard at work. This festival promises to become something extraordinary. The Tour singing societies belonging to the association will each have charge of an evening both in regard to the stage presentations and to the refreshment arrangement. Thus there will be friendly competition as to which society is best able to entertain the public.</p>
   <p>In addition to the programs given by the individual singing societies, the singers of the association as such will every evening present numbers under the leadership of their director, Emil Bjorn. The festival will be opened by the association on Thursday evening after which the Norwegian quartet Club will offer an exceptionally good program of singing and vaudeville. Friday is Bjorgvin's day, and the lusty Bergen Boys will undoubtedly know how to make their audience sit up and take notice. Saturday, the Norwegian's Singing Society is on the program. This very popular society counts many high class singers as members. Who does not remember Tuten and Lund, Mathisen, Novaldsen, and Hansen! On Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock the Glee Club gives a matinee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0287.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The club does not reveal its program in advance, but it is hinted that its members have something hidden under their coats and up their sleeves, which may cause both their fellow singers in the association and the audience in general to - well - gasp.</p>
   <p>The festival will be concluded in the evening with a program by the association singers. In addition, Borgen, Gerner, Palmer, and others have promised to assist, so the program will be full and rich. The income from the festival will be used to pay traveling expenses for the singers who are to participate in the song festival in Misneapolis next year. The Norwegian Singing Association of Chicago deserves the unstinted support of the city's Norwegians.</p>
