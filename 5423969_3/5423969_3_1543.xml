   <p>There are in Chicago many institutions and charity groups that do much good work in their different fields. One of these is an outstanding society that works nationally and is well known to Scandinavians throughout America. It is the Evangelical Lutheran Home-Finding Society, which is managed by the membership of the Norwegian Synod in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Synod has several Children's Homes. But the Home-Finding Society is different from the others. The Society not only rears children according to Christian standards, but usually places them in Christian homes as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The Society has, in its short existence, placed seventy children in private homes.</p>
   <p>In the home on Byron Street, there are, today, seventeen children.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1544.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The yearly meeting of the Society was held in the St. Johannes Church last Wednesday evening.</p>
   <p>Reverend Birkeland opened the meeting and read a number of letters from children who had been placed in private homes by the Society.</p>
   <p>Miss Caroline Halvorsen made the financial report, as follows:</p>
   <p>The home had received about $1,900, from different sources. All expenses had been covered. $100 had been paid on a debt of $2,550. The cash on hand was $87.95.</p>
   <p>Reverend J. R. Birkeland was re-elected chairman.</p>
   <p>A resolution was passed "That a life membership certificate be issued to members in good standing, on the payment of $10."</p>
