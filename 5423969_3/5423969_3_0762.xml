Senator John Waage is putting forth every effort to insure success, and among other pre-tournament events, to raise the necessary funds, he has headed the committee that has arranged a big wrestling show to be held tomorrow (Sunday) afternoon at Wicker Park Hall. The proceeds of the match go to the Norge Ski Club.</p>

Col. John J. Garrity has received orders for this service from Brig. Gen. F. S. Lickson, State Adjutant.</p>
   <p>Prizes amounting to a value of $1000 will be given; $350 cash to <pb facs="5423969_3_0763.jpg" n="2"/>
