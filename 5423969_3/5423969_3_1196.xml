   <p>The board of directors of the Norwegian Deaconess Home met last Tuesday. The meeting was opened with a prayer by Reverend C. Michaelson, of Rowe, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The report of the previous meeting was read....and accepted, and the old board was thereupon dissolved. The new board was formed by the election of Adolph Larsen, chairman; Reverend Lockrem, vice-chairman; Reverend J. N. Kildahl, secretary; Haakon Thompson, treasurer....An executive committee was constituted and delegated to act as a building committee, and to serve as such until the building was completed.</p>
   <p>The rector read the report on finances for May and June, together with the hospital report. The treasurer read his report, and all reports were approved and accepted. The rector's report on the progress of the work during the past two months, together with recommendations to the board of</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1197.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>directors, is in part as follows:</p>
   <p>At the annual meeting of the Norwegian United Church, the board of directors requested permission to start the construction of the new wing when one half of the amount needed had been subscribed. At the same annual meeting, the board of directors had been authorized to mortgage the property of the Deaconess Home for an amount not to exceed $50,000, for the purpose of completing the building. It was also resolved to continue vigorously the collection of money for the building fund.</p>
   <p>The building committee had the plans ready for presentation to the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The rector reported that he had bought five lots adjacent to the property of the institution; at present the price of the lots was low. He had acted</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1198.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>on a previous understanding with members of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>This being the annual meeting of the board of directors, the election of the medical staff of the hospital was a topic of discussion. In order to bind the doctors more closely to the institution, the rector recommended that they be authorized to organize. Further, in view of the fact that there was a prospect of enlarging the hospital in the near future, he recommended that the medical staff be increased in some way or other; he presented several plans for such a staff expansion.</p>
   <p>The rector further requested that he be again authorized to publish the annual report this year, and that Mother Ingeborg be granted a vacation of six weeks this year instead of the usual four weeks. The board of directors resolved to take up the rector's report for consideration.</p>
   <p>Reverend C. J. M. Gronlid, of Waterville, Illinois, was chosen as advisory member. It was resolved to elect the same physicians to the hospital staff</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1199.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>who had served last year. [Translator's note: Names of these physicians omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The following specialists were selected: Nils Remmen, eye specialist; E. A. Forehkin, epidermis specialist; G. A. Torrison, nose and throat specialist; L. H. Mittler, nerve specialist; H. C. Hanson, obstetrician; A. Klovstad, x-ray specialist; David Dans, pathologist.</p>
   <p>The rector was directed to investigate the question of enlarging the medical staff, and to report to the next meeting of the board of directors. The medical staff was authorized to organize. A six-week vacation was granted Mother Ingeborg. The rector was granted a month's vacation. He was also authorized to publish the annual report.</p>
   <p>The purchase of five lots by the rector was sanctioned by the members of the board acting as individuals, but not in their official capacity of</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1200.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>board of directors, because the board had not been authorized to make the purchase. When these lots have been paid for, they will be presented to the Society as a gift.</p>
   <p>Architect Richard E. Schmidt, of the firm Schmidt, Garden, &amp; Martin, had arrived by this time, and the plans for the new wing of the Deaconess Home were taken up for consideration. The plans were adopted unanimously, and the building committee was instructed to seek bids for the construction of the wing as soon as possible, and also to arrange for a suitable mortgage loan on the property.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to hold a special meeting of the board of directors when the contract for the erection of the new addition was to be let.</p>
   <p>Reverend E. E. Tiller's term as a member of the board of directors having expired, it was resolved to have the secretary send him a letter of thanks</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1201.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>for his long and faithful service as member and secretary of the board.</p>
