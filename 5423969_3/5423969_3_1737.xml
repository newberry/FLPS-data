   <p>The Concordia branch of the Norwegian Old People's Home Society held its monthly meeting for August at the home of Mrs. John Pedersen, 2440 North Springfield Avenue. The veteran pastor, Reverend Ring, spoke of the wonderful work being done for the Home by the Concordia branch and other groups, and of the appreciation of the old folks for this work.</p>
   <p>Mrs. B. J. Johnson announced that during the last seventeen years she had visited the Home every week and had, at all times, found those living at the Home to be well fed, well cared for, and contented. She urged all members to bring their friends to the annual picnic to be held at the Home (in Norwood Park) on Saturday, Aug. 31.</p>
   <p>The evening's musical treat was a series of solo songs by Elmer C. Bye, with <pb facs="5423969_3_1738.jpg" n="2"/>Miss Nora Bjornstad at the piano. To finish off a very pleasant evening refreshments were served.</p>
