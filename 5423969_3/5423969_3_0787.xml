   <p>Peter Birkemoe is visiting Chicago and his turner brothers here. The old Norwegian turners here in Chicago, and the younger ones, too, for that matter, will remember the name Peter Birkemoe. "Pete" belonged to the Turnforening (turner society) at the time--about six years ago--when the acrobats (of whom only Einar Bergendahl remains) were all the rage.</p>
   <p>The names Birkemoe, Rasch, and Johnson, or, rather De Losse and Rochette Brothers, have always been associated with the most terrifying daredevil stunts in the Norwegian Turner Hall and all over the world. Under the name "Rochette Brothers," Rasch and Johnson traveled all over the world with their own circus, and Birkemoe (or De Losse) has just returned from a tour of Europe where, together with a Scotch friend, he won thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Birkemoe visited the Skandinaven when, after four years absence, he came <pb facs="5423969_3_0788.jpg" n="2"/>back to Chicago, and he had much to tell. He has visited England, Scotland, Ireland, Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and other places. He enjoyed his stay in England most. For several weeks he acted in the great London Hippodrome, and even had to appear before Queen Alexandra. The Queen expressed her admiration for the Norwegian-American acrobat's ability and audacity. The admiration is mutual. Birkemoe cannot find words strong enough to express his admiration for this daughter of the late King of Denmark.</p>
   <p>Peter Birkemoe is only twenty-two years old, yet his name was already known, several years ago, far beyond Chicago. He became a member of the Norwegian Turnforening when he was barely twelve years old, and before many months had passed, he was one of the greatest daredevils in the group, and that means a great deal. He will stay in Chicago for a couple of months to meet old friends from the Norwegian Turnforening and from Sleipner.</p>
