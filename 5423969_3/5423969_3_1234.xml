   <p>We reported three or four weeks ago that Dr. Svennins Dahl (Dane) was asked to resign from the staff of the Hospital. It was reported today that Dr. Dahl had been reinstated as chief surgeon. But after investigating the rumor we find that this is not true. We also find that two other surgeons have been appointed to the staff, and the patients who have no confidence in Dr. Dahl will not be forced to be under his care.</p>
   <p>We will not discuss Dr. Dahl's qualifications or lack of qualification, or what he has learned or forgotten since he graduated.</p>
   <p>We know he is a great butcher, we beg pardon, surgeon, but we are not so sure of his ability to diagnose.</p>
   <p>We also criticize Dr. Dahl's bull-like manner and his rude treatment of <pb facs="5423969_3_1235.jpg" n="2"/>patients and Deaconesses alike. And, not to forget, he certainly is not capable as the head of a hospital. Just one example is enough to prove it:</p>
   <p>Early last summer a young Norwegian was admitted to the Hospital. A cousin of this youngster wired the parents in Norway for money. The money arrived with a request to summon a doctor as quickly as possible. The cousin went to Dahl and asked that he attend the young fellow, and also that he call in a specialist. Dr. Dahl, who was very offended, shouted, "I don't need any assistance, I know as much as any damn specialist." Using Holberg's statement to conclude: "The fever loft the patient; he died."</p>
   <p>Dr. Quales has also resigned from the Hospital; and has attached himself to Tabitha (Hospital). We wonder why?</p>
