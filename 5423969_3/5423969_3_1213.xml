   <p>....The Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess Home received a beautiful piece of tapestry from King Haakon VII of Norway. The tapestry weave is based on a drawing by the Norwegian artist Gerhard Munthe, and the weaving was done by the Norwegian Society for Art Industry.</p>
   <p>Everybody concerned agrees that the Home must not dispose of the royal gift. The intention is to have the finest room in the Home named "King Haakon's Room" and the tapestry given by the King is to decorate a wall in this room.</p>
   <p>Since, however, the tapestry was given to the bazaar which was held last fall for the benefit of the Home, it is being planned to....exhibit the piece at the Home on January 22....visitors' fee to be twenty-five cents. In addition to seeing the piece of tapestry the visitors will be served light refreshments, all for the twenty-five cents.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1214.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many people have expressed surprise at the interest shown by the King in the Deaconess Home, since the work connected with the Home is comparatively new and but little known among Norwegians here. The reason is to be sought in the....attitude of King Haakon's grandmother, Queen Louise of Denmark, toward the deaconess movement in that country. In 1863 she started the Danish deaconess home movement. The Deaconess Home in Copenhagen, Denmark is a very large building or rather a cluster of buildings. In front of the main building is placed a statue of Queen Louise. This is the reason for King Haakon's interest in the Norwegian Lutheran Deaconess movement in Chicago.</p>
