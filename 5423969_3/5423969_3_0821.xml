   <p>Sleipner's Skating Race took place in Humboldt Park on New Year's Day. Six thousand people were gathered in the park to watch the races. The Park Board engaged the Viking Marine Band of forty men to entertain the public. Thirty-eight entries were booked for the great event.</p>
   <p>The ice was not as good as it would have been in the early forenoon, mild weather melted the surface of the track. Three, races, two of one mile each, and one of two miles were held. The first two races were scratches, and the last was the handicap.</p>
   <p>The judges were alderman J. Rayner, P.B. Olsen, T. M. Hunter, J.F. Smulski, Olaf E. Ray, and J. D. Garner. John Langley was the winner in the first race. He is thirty-four years old, born in Norway and a member of the Sleipner Club. The prizes as usual were silver cups, gold medals, etc.</p>
