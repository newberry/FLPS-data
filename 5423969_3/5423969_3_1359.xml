   <p>At the last meeting of the directors at the Tabitha Hospital, the secretary presented the following excerpts of the reports for the month of April: Sixty-six patients were treated during the month--seven of them free of charge, twelve at half the regular fee, and forty-seven at full pay. The total days of treatment were 1,013, of which 378 were free or partly paid for, and 635 paid for in full. On May 1 there were 37 patients at the hospital.</p>

   <p>The Hospital has had many patients of late--as many as forty-five at one time, that is, more than the Hospital can accommodate comfortably. To overcome this lack of room, the board of directors has rented an apartment near by for the use of the nurses, and in this way room has been provided for eight more beds. Yet there is not enough room. One day five patients applying for admission to the Hospital had to be turned away on account of lack of space. The board of directors has frequently called these facts to the attention of the Society, but without results.</p>
