   <p>P. 3. - The Norwegian Old People's Home Society is preparing for their annual picnic to be held on the spacious grounds of the Home on August 26.</p>
   <p>Mr. Birger Osland appeals to all Norwegians in Chicago to get behind this institution and give it the support it so rightly deserves. The home now houses a hundred worthy old people whose final years are made easy and pleasant with no pecuniary worries and no toil, just well earned rest and quiet, so dear to advanced years.</p>
   <p>All Norwegians are asked to contribute to the work of this home for the aged of all creeds, which instead of being dominated by some church synod is sponsored by business men from all Norwegian churches and by some belonging to no church. Any aged Norwegian may be admitted as far as finances permit.</p>
   <p>The home is often visited by various groups who bring great pleasure into the lives of former members who now live at the home: veterans of lodges, churches, singing societies, etc., and who long for and appreciate frequent visits <pb facs="5423969_3_1754.jpg" n="2"/>by their old friends. Possibly you who read this article may find among these people one or more who in times past has been dear to you and we suggest that you plan a visit to the Home on July 26.</p>
