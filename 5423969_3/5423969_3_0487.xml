   <p>A grandson of the old deceased radical, Marcus Thrane, living in Chicago, wishes to gain possession of reminiscences of his grandfather, such as articles or letters from him or about him, copies of a paper, Nordlyset, which he publishedin Chicago about 1876, also the first year of DenNyetid, 1879-1884, again a play of three acts, by the name of Konspirationen (The Conspiracy), written by him a couple of years before he died. Information is also desired of the whereabouts of the oil painting of Marcus Thrane used on the stage in Aurora Turner Hall, 1891,at the Thrane memorial festival.</p>
   <p>The members of the society,"Norway a Republic" (about 1884) now living are requested to forward their names and addresses; in addition,it would be desirable to get into touch with some of those who contributed toward the <pb facs="5423969_3_0488.jpg" n="2"/>payment of Thrane's trip to Norway in 1884, perhaps also contributed toward the publishing of the pamphlet "Norge Som Republik" (Norway as a Republic) about 1884.</p>
   <p>Any information at all relative to these matters, should be addressed to Olaf Ray, 30 N. Dearborn St., who has contacts with Thrane's grandson in Norway; a comprehensive work about Marcus Thrane, his popular movement, and his time, is being prepared.</p>
