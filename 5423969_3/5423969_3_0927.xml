   <p>Mr. Sigvald Asbjornsen's model of the Leif Ericsson statue was inspected last Saturday by a committee of twenty-five prominent Norwegians together with representatives of the press. This committee agreed completely with the artists' committee which, with Mr. Charles L. Hutchinson as chairman, had been appointed to study the statue and render a verdict. This verdict was most flattering, and similarly, all those invited on Saturday were most pleased with the model, and nobody had anything but praise for the artist. The committee of artists presented the following report to the Leif Ericsson Society, addressed to the president, Mr. L. E. Olson:</p>
   <p>"In accordance with your request the committee appointed by you met at the study of Sculptor Asbjornsen and there inspected his model for the intended statue of Leif Ericsson. We are pleased to report that we are particularly well satisfied with the model, and we most heartily recommend it to you for acceptance. It is <pb facs="5423969_3_0928.jpg" n="2"/>the opinion of the committee that if the statue be executed in the same spirit which characterizes the model, then it will be of great artistic value, worthy of being placed in any locality which our city may have to offer."</p>
   <p>The members of this committee of artists consisted of Mr. Hutchinson, chairman, and Messrs. Svend Svendsen and Charles A. Coolidge. Mr. Hutchinson transmitted a copy of the report to Mr. Asbjornsen immediately after it was received by the Society, and in a letter accompanying this copy the well-known art criticen and supporter [of the project] speaks as follows:</p>
   <p>"Personally I am enthusiastic about the model and am hoping that you will execute the statue in full accord with the model. The spirit of the work is magnificent; the figure is simple, dignified, and heroic, and I do not need to add that it is artistic."</p>
   <p>Among those who inspected the model on Saturday was Banker H. G. Hangan. He expressed his complete satisfaction with the work and declared that the conditions <pb facs="5423969_3_0929.jpg" n="3"/>which he had imposed as to the support of the Leif Ericsson Society had been completely fulfilled.</p>
   <p>Svend Svendsen, who was also present on this occasion, offered to paint a picture which the Society might dispose of in the interest of its treasury. Among others present on Saturday were Messrs. Thisslev, architect, Hans Nordahl, B. Osland, Thomas Ehert, A. J. Elvig, Oscar M. Torrison, attorney, and John Anderson. Letters of excuse had been received from several of those who had been invited but had not been able to come....</p>
   <p>The model presents a rare combination of leanness and power; both these motives are so strongly represented that in this respect the figure must be said to represent an ideal rather than a reality, since it would be rather difficult to find a man who fulfilled the requirements, in these respects, of the statue. Inasmuch, however, as both in the total impression it gives and in its various details, the model passes the strictest examination as to anatomical correctness, <pb facs="5423969_3_0930.jpg" n="4"/>the idealism referred to is so far from indicating a weakness in the artist's conception that it undoubtedly is one of the characteristics of the model which most strongly contributed to the unanimous satisfaction with the work. It is the very combination which makes the figure appear heroic, as Mr. Hutchinson expresses it.</p>
   <p>The face possesses regular features, is forceful and of genuine Nordic type. The expression is calm and clear. As to the historical details of costume and weapon, Mr. Asbjornsen has made thorough studies of the matter, and the result is that no anachronisms or incorrect articles of wearing apparel or weapon are to be found on the figure.</p>
   <p>It is the intention of the Society to have the statue cast nine feet tall; but the president, Mr. Olson, stated to one of the reporters of the Skandinaven that if the sentiment among the Scandinavians in Chicago favors it, the plans may be changed so as to make the statue ten feet tall instead of nine feet. It may safely be said that a statue executed in the spirit of the Asbjornsen model will <pb facs="5423969_3_0931.jpg" n="5"/>add honor to the Norwegians in Chicago, if the statue finds a place in one of the city's parks.</p>
