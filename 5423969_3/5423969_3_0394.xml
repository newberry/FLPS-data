   <p>Amund Fjortoft writes that in spite of the fact that engineers belong to the wandering tribe, still a good many stayed at home and have formed an interested and hard working nucleus around which we will carry on. We not only intend to increase our membership but also the importance of our society, professionally and socially. In February, we had the pleasure of getting acquainted with the new acting counsel in Chicago, Mr. Alex Berg, who talked on South Africa. He convinced us that it was the only land of promise left. We were all on the verge of packing up, until he mentioned that capital was the most essential baggage. On March 7, the society gave its annual dinner - dance which was very successful; a surplus of $1.48 was the cause for great rejoicing. Later in the month the chief chemist for the Sanitary District, Mr. Holman, talked on the latest developments in sewage treatment plants, a very actual subject these days. On our membership meeting in April, Mr. A. I. Appleton talked on Russia. The accompanying discussion brought out many diverging views on the subject. We finished the season with a stag party on May 28th.</p>
