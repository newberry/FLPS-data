   <p>An old subscriber to Scandia, Mr. Thos. Johnson, contributes the following article to our "Minors and Majors" column:</p>
   <p>"About two years ago, we received the very pleasing announcement that Den Norske Klub"(The Norwegian Club) had taken upon themselves the responsibility of bringing about the repair and preservation of the Viking Ship presented to Chicago (during 1895 World's Fair) as a Norwegian memorial.</p>
   <p>"This announcement was enthusiastically and gratefully received by all Chicago, especially by members of our Norwegian colony, as it must be admitted that this memorial was in anything but a presentable condition.</p>
   <p>"To date, however, the Club has done nothing in the way of repairs on restoration,or even given the ship a much-needed "house cleaning," and during the past two years it has become anything but an object of admiration, or one that we might point out to visitors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0889.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Many of us would like to know what, if anything, is being or will definitely be done by the Norwegian Club or the special committee it appointed to carry out this work. If they have"gone dead" on the subject we have the colossal nerve to state that any other Norwegian organization that will assume active leadership in the effort to restore and preserve this historically valuable exhibit will be heartily supported both financially and with service."</p>
   <p>Upon receipt of the foregoing, Scandia contacted this Norwegian Club regarding this work, and we are asked to inform our readers that the issue is still very much alive. The work of the original Viking Ship Committee was interrupted by the consolidation of the Norwegian Club and the Quartette Club. A new committee has been appointed representing both factions of this merged club, and they announce that the actual work of restoring the Viking Ship will start in a few days.</p>
