   <p>In a recent issue of your paper I saw an article regarding a debating club and the difficulties through which it passed, though it survived and prospered. it matters not from what motive such objections arise; they show that such people are against progress in the nineteenth century. There are people who hang their heads in religious pretense, thinking that a debating society is a hindrance to religion. Not at all. Anybody with common sense can possess intelligence and religion at the same time. What is the use of being so radical? What is the use, I say. Is it not better to use all the honest and reasonable means you can (you who have the ability and, perhaps, the experience) to help enlighten people in these lonely country-places, where advantages are so slim and scarce? Where the people have religious services in the little schoolhouse only once a month, perhaps, is a debating society not an excellent thing in such localities? Is there anything better if they be conducted right? And in places where there is dancing, and the young people <pb facs="5423969_3_0733.jpg" n="2"/>spend their precious winter time at these valueless amusements, what would be better than a debating society or a literary club?</p>
   <p>I know of a locality where there are scores of young people of all ages, all bright and ambitious, who have reveled in country dances, etc., to their hearts' content. I organized a debating club which had a literary program as one of its features. We met every Saturday night (that being the only convenient time). The first meeting was not large, but the next one was; the club grew until the schoolhouse became too small for us. Other amusements of every description became a thing of the past, and debate night was the theme and anticipation of the week. And all, even those who had never picked up a paper or a book to read, and who were looked upon as extremely unintelligent, began to study in order to attain some kind of standing in a debating society.</p>
   <p>After about two years this society was the boast of the town; every schoolboy <pb facs="5423969_3_0734.jpg" n="3"/>was aspiring for a place on the program, or as an officer of the society. Everyone wanted to debate, and they did, and profited by it. Those whom the people had called ignoramuses began to speak about books, politics, and even science and art, taking a part in the entire program of the society, and soon they were so developed that we could not get along without them. They became our star speakers, and they did not need much urging on account of their natural brightness.</p>
   <p>How proud I am when I think of our little organization! What a noble effort it is to help enlighten and develop the youth, whether it be politically, spiritually or educationally. I have spent some years of my life doing so, and am most deeply interested in such work. I shall do more in the future along this line.</p>
   <p>What do you think of this, worthy readers of Skandinaven? Let us hear from you, and soon, through the columns of this grand old paper, which is read by <pb facs="5423969_3_0735.jpg" n="4"/>so many who seem to devour its every word. People who object to an organization of this kind are not in it, in this age of kodaks and snapshots. "Keep abreast of the times," my friends; you need not abandon your religion by so doing.</p>
