   <p>A midsummer festival was held at the Home for the Aged in Norwood Park last Saturday.... The ladies brought refreshments, and while the committee arranged for the table service the guests went through the building greeting the aged people.... Dr.[N. T.] Quales, the president of the Society for the Home for the Aged....welcomed the people. He mentioned that on June 15 four years had elapsed since the first guest, Mrs. Osterberg, had been received at the Home which, at the time, was not in such excellent condition as at the present time.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Andersen was the next speaker.... The board of directors of the Home, <pb facs="5423969_3_1630.jpg" n="2"/>he said, in taking such energetic steps for the comfort of the aged, have erected for themselves a monument of which they have reason to be proud....</p>
