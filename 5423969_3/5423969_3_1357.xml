   <p>The open-air festival of the Tabitha Hospital Society was very well attended....The garden on the north side of the hospital was decorated with flags, and George B. Carpenter and Company had lent the committee four tents. Mr. Daniel Erikson had persuaded the Carpenter Company to this generosity. Hans Finstad provided the necessary tables and chairs. The ladies of the visiting committee were constantly busy seeing to it that all the guests were offered coffee, cake, and ice cream.</p>
   <p>Dr. K. F. Sandberg, the president of the Society, introduced the Reverend Alfred Johnson as the first speaker. The pastor stated that nearly six years have elapsed since the hospital was opened; that a group of women had been working for a number of years prior to the opening, giving much of their time and money in order to bring the hospital to the standard it enjoys today....</p>
   <p>The intention is to add two wings to the hospital. The speaker held that the <pb facs="5423969_3_1358.jpg" n="2"/>hospital more than any other work the Norwegians had undertaken, served to make the Norwegian name known and respected....</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Doe, the second speaker, stated that the hospital is up-to-date and on a level with any hospital in town as regards efficiency....Between the speeches Miss Eleonora Olson sang two soprano solos; she was accompanied by Eugene Skaaden.</p>
