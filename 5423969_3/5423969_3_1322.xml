   <p>The Odin Branch of the Norwegian Tabitha Hospital Society held a meeting in Hans Finstad's hall last Monday evening. About two hundred people were present. The president, Mr. H. N. Stoltenberg, opened the meeting by expressing his pleasure at the number present from the other branches.</p>
   <p>Dr. Marie Olsen delivered a speech in which she explained her attitude toward the proposed changes in the constitution of the Society for the Tabitha Hospital, referring especially to Mr. Haugan's proposal that a majority of the members of the board of directors must belong to congregations under the Norwegian Lutheran Synod in America. The speaker was opposed to this change in the constitution. She added that the Synod for several years had dominated the board of directors because most of the members of the nominating committee were also members of the Synod congregations. Dr. Olsen urged that the Hospital remain a Norwegian national undertaking, and that everybody be invited to join the Hospital Society whether he be a member of a church or not. On the whole, Dr. Olsen's speech <pb facs="5423969_3_1323.jpg" n="2"/>was a refutation of articles by Reverend Alfred O. Johnson and Reverend K. M. Bleken in the Skandinaven concerning the proposals in question.</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Z. Torgersen was the next speaker. He referred to the development and progress in the undertakings of mercy during the past thirty years. The speaker did not think it fitting that ministers of one particular sect or that ministers of any sect should be placed on the boards of directors of institutions such as hospitals, orphanages, homes for the aged, etc. Businessmen ought to be in control of these boards. If a patient in a hospital wished to have a minister visit him he ought to be at full liberty to send for the minister of his choice, no matter to what sect the patient might belong.</p>
   <p>Reverend Fred Ring spoke in the same tenor. The physicians are responsible for their patients and must have the right to refuse even a minister permission to call on a patient who is very ill.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Jorgensen was afraid that the Lutheran Synod would cripple the work at the Hospital if the representatives of the Synod were to gain control. The <pb facs="5423969_3_1324.jpg" n="3"/>necessary money may be gathered in various ways, through socials, concerts, dances, etc., but if the ministers are to hold leadership, there is the risk that money gathered in such manner may be declined by the boards, as was done a year ago by the board of directors of the Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Rommen was the last speaker. He gave a brief survey of the status of the Hospital. The debt of the Hospital Society is about $7,500 while the property value is more than $30,000. Thus there is no danger that the Hospital will become bankrupt. The speaker expressed the hope that Mr. H. A. Haugan's motion will not be adopted by the coming general convention of the Society.</p>
   <p>After the business meeting was concluded, Mr. Mathias Pedersen's orchestra played, and refreshments were served.</p>
