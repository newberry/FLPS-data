   <p>The Chicago Record for Tuesday contains a series of interviews with Norwegians in Chicago in connection with Mr. Sigvald Asbjornsen's sketch of a statue of Leif Ericson. The paper contains nine of these interviews; only one of these, one by Mr. Hans Nordahl, agrees with the committee of experts that declared the model an excellent piece of work. One of the statements, from Dr. A. T. Boyesen, is somewhat indeterminate; the others are strongly condemnatory.</p>
   <p>Only one of the nine gentlemen who have expressed their opinion of the work has seen the work itself. This gentleman is Mr. Hans Nordahl. Up until Tuesday noon--many hours after their criticisms had been printed--the others quoted by the Record had not seen the model.</p>
   <p>Eight of the gentlemen quoted in the Record have thus had nothing to guide them <pb facs="5423969_3_0926.jpg" n="2"/>in forming their opinion except the drawings which appeared in the newspapers last Sunday. As everybody knows, newspaper drawings of this type will invariably be more or less distorted. That such is the case becomes all the more evident when one considers that all those who had seen the work itself, up to Tuesday noon, without exception were highly pleased with the model, while seven gentlemen who had not seen the original but had judged from newspaper drawings have expressed their displeasure with the model. Unanimity as complete as that in evidence here could hardly be imagined, unless the drawings and the model itself gave the same impression.</p>
   <p>The man who gathered the criticisms referred to, the Scandinavian reporter of the Chicago Record, last Saturday said to one of the writers in the Skandinaven:</p>
   <p>"You know that our paper does not appear on Sundays. In writing of the Leif Ericson statue and the Asbjornsen model I shall have to find material that has not been used by the other papers. To do so will not be very easy, but I guess I may be able to find something." Evidently he did.</p>
