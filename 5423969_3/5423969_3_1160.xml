   <p>Last summer, the board of directors of the Norwegian Tabitha hospital decided to build a large addition to the hospital. This addition was to be financed by a bond issue in the amount of $63,000. Everything looked rosy at the time, and the project was considered as being "no sooner said than done," but one hindrance after another bobbed up, and the proposed addition has been <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> lately given up. In the meantime, the architect has presented a bill for <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, for services rendered. Add to this other items of expense, and the hospital sustains a loss of a little over $1000. Taking everything into consideration, the hospital was fortunate to get out from under with no greater loss.</p>
   <p>From another point of view, it is probably just as well that the project was dropped, as the practice of many institutions nowadays to create debts for future generations to pay is going beyond all reasonable bounds.</p>
