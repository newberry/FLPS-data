   <p>On Sunday, Jan. 12th, the Northwest Skating Club held its annual race meet on the Humboldt Park Lagoon.</p>
   <p>The weather was perfect, and the meet was a real success-in spite of the fact that several of the contestants loafed terribly at certain times. The intrepid little Irishman, Bob McLean, took first place in three events including the one-mile Illinois championship event, and the two-mile Illinois championship event. Between the races, the crowd was entertained by Dr. Heide, Paris dentist and champion figure skater of France, who on the previous Sunday had donned his skates to try out the ice on the lagoon and was summarily chased off the ice by the park police. Dr. Heide's performance was really artistic; the most difficult figures were accomplished with an ease and grace that brought forth salvos of applause from the 7000 fans gathered for the event.</p>
