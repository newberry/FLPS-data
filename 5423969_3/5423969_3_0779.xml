   <p>The Norwegian Turner Society held a pleasant social on Sunday evening in the Society's gymnasium at the Park Casino. The large hall had been given a festive air by the decorations executed by Sverre Dietrich and Chester Thorson. Norwegian and American flags and colors met the eye wherever one turned and on the long northern wall appeared the letters D. N. T. in red, blue, and white.</p>
   <p>At 10:30 P. M. the march to table began, Mr. and Mrs. S. Huseby heading the procession. Mr. G. Martin functioned as toastmaster and....performed his task well. The food was excellent; Mr. Lippmann, the host of the Park Casino did himself proud in the meal he served.</p>
   <p>The first speaker of the evening was the president of the Norwegian National Association, Mr. Birger Osland, who in appropriate words spoke in honor of <pb facs="5423969_3_0780.jpg" n="2"/>Norway. The speech was vigorously applauded.</p>
   <p>Attorney Olaf Ray called attention to the importance of the turner movement in a speech entitled "We Norwegians". He claimed that the turner movement is not being shown sufficient interest in our country, and that Norwegians of means do not contribute as much as they ought to the Norwegian Turner Society in Chicago. We are ready, he said, to aid the children by building orphanages; we help the old people by building homes for the aged. All of this is very good, Mr. Ray said, but it merely means that we co-operate in so far as the outer points of life are concerned; on the other hand, we pay but scant attention to the organizations which teach us to live.</p>
   <p>To emphasize his assertion, the speaker referred to conditions in Japan.... The Dutch ambassador to Tokio was to be transferred to the United States and before moving he went to make his farewell visit to the famous General Nogi. He found the General's wife at home, and she told the Ambassador that her husband was at work....He was teaching gymnastics in the public school. The Ambassador later found the General busily instructing a class of boys under <pb facs="5423969_3_0781.jpg" n="3"/>fourteen years of age in gymnastics.</p>
   <p>If athletics were lent as great interest in America, Mr. Ray said, the results would soon be apparent. America would have strong, healthy young people.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ray's interesting speech was listened to with rapt attention and was rewarded with strong applause.</p>
   <p>Attorney John J. Sonsteby gave an appealing speech in honor of America; Mr. C. Holt spoke in honor of the Turner Society; Attorney G. A. Ellingsen spoke with great enthusiasm in honor of the ladies with special reference to the ladies' turner class....</p>
   <p>The social concluded with dancing. Mr. Lawson's orchestra furnished the music.</p>
