   <p>The West Park Board has formally accepted the Leif Ericson statue for erection in one of the parks on the West Side. As earlier mentioned, the committee to negotiate this matter with the Board consisted of L. E. Olson, president of the Leif Ericson Monument Society, together with Messrs. O.A. Thorp and Charles Thislew, the architect. As Mr. Thorp and Mr. Thislew were unable to be present, Mr. Olson was the sole negotiator to meet with the Park Board.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson mentioned that he had been informed that it was customary for the Board to provide foundations for statues that were to be placed in the parks on the West Side. The Board immediately agreed to provide funds for the fundament of the Leif Ericson statue. This fundament will cost about $500.</p>
   <p>The acceptance of the monument was unanimous, and Mr. Olson said to a reporter of Skandinaven that all the members spoke very favorably of the statue. Several of them had seen not only innumerable sketches, but also the model itself in <pb facs="5423969_3_0917.jpg" n="2"/>the studio of Mr. Asbjornsen, and they were delighted to get the statue for one of the parks on the West Side.</p>
   <p>No decision was taken as to which park is to contain the monument, but the attorney of the Board, Mr. Charles B. Paolicek, was appointed to assist the committee in the selection of a suitable place.</p>
   <p>Sculptor Asbjornsen long ago started the execution of the monument itself. It is being modeled in wax at his studio, 300 Wabash Avenue, where he moved when he was about to begin work on the statue. His former studio was not large enough for a statue of the size of the Leif Ericson monument. It is expected that the sculptor will have the statue finished early in the summer.</p>
