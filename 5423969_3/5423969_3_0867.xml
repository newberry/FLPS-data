   <p>It is interesting to see the national interest that the issue of the Viking ship has created. Andrew Hummeland, secretary of the Viking committee has just received the following letters, some elaborate, some short and to the point:</p>
   <p>The following letter is from an American state senator; it reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Kindly find enclosed my check for $100 for the purpose of helping to defray expenses in repairing and moving the Viking ship. Allow me to assure you that I am very much interested in this work. Nothing could mean more to the early history of our country and the wonderful part taken therein by the seafaring Norsemen than the Viking ship. However, I have always thought that the average person did not pay enough attention to this noble relic and reminder of the very earliest attempts at the colonization of America by Europeans.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0868.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I hope that when the ship is placed in its new home in Lincoln Park, that thousands of visitors, particularly the children of all nationalities, will view it with the keenest interest and enjoy that thrill of sentimental pride which naturally follows the sight of this historic ship.</p>
   <p>With very kindest regards, believe me.</p>
   <p>"Yours sincerely,</p>
   <p>"William H. Malone."</p>
   <p>The following letter is from an outstanding Norwegian businessman:</p>
   <p>"I take pleasure in enclosing my check for $50 made payable to the Viking ship committee. Also accept my heartiest wishes for the success of the undertaking. I think it is a grand opportunity for all Norwegians to prove <pb facs="5423969_3_0869.jpg" n="3"/>that the memory of our brave forefathers instills in our hearts the desire to keep it alive by something so closely related to their lives as a Viking ship.</p>
   <p>"Yours truly,</p>
   <p>"D. Lunde."</p>
