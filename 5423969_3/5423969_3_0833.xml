   <p>The Norwegian turner meet here in the city is now an event of the past; only the memories of the gathering remain with us. Athletic exercises in themselves are simply bodily movements which may be of value when carried out with moderation, that is, valuable as far as the health of the individuals participating in them is concerned. The impression received from the exhibitions of a turner society is, however, different from that of the calisthenics of the individual. One might, for example, expect from the turner society a sort of expression of the totality, in life and action, of the progress of our nationality in a broader field than just that of turner activities. One may well demand that these exercises for the body be considered a means for the development of the man or boy in question for life's practical activities. Let no one think that athletics are the goal; they are but the <pb facs="5423969_3_0834.jpg" n="2"/>means.</p>
   <p>Only by emphasizing the practical goal of the turner Movement can one find an excuse for the expenditure of time and energy incident to the Movement. Athlectics are or ought to be simply a means for greater perfection in a man's development as a citizen, as a soldier, as a sailor, as a laborer, as a businessman, etc. Of course it may be said that the turner movement is producing specialists in gymnastics. But in this case the turner has become an acrobat, and this result can but rarely be attained through our ordinary turner societies....</p>
   <p>In general there should be good reason to expect more from a turner, because of his bodily agility, than from the average individual. Where one is facing a whole society of turners one has reason to expect more from such a society of men who possess that gayfulness which comes from perfect health, than one would expect from an ordinary insurance fraternity in which the members expect <pb facs="5423969_3_0835.jpg" n="3"/>to die first, and only afterward to reap the promised benefits.</p>
   <p>The other day we had the banquet of the Norwegian Turner Association, and on that occasion one would expect to be in the presence of the flower of the movement. Dr. Anders Doe gave a speech on that occasion, dealing with the turner movement in our day; among the ancient "Birchlegs" [Translator's note: Old Norwegian warriors]; among the still more ancient Romans, and among the Greeks of a yet older date. At the same time, the Doctor warned against mixing the turner movements with politics, since this would result in death and dissolution....But the illumination thrown on the movement by the Doctor leads us backward, not ahead. The Olympic games were lauded, but baseball was not mentioned. The "Birchlegs" were spoken of but not the "Rough Riders". Theodore Roosevelt is an up-to-date athlete, and if individuals are to be mentioned in support of the turner movement, then it would seem natural to call attention to those of living men, not to those of centuries ago. For the rest, the Doctor's speech was academically correct, <pb facs="5423969_3_0836.jpg" n="4"/>but where were the words of practical guidance to be gained from the Olympic games?</p>
   <p>In our country we have no government except as we ourselves decide, and since athletics are of great importance in the determination of what sort of laws we shall have, it would seem quite out of place actually to warn athletes against entering politics. The Doctor is a Norwegian citizen, and hence his example can be of little importance in our Norwegian-American turner movement, for here it is necessary to become Americanized as speedily as possible so as not to lose out in the procession of nationalities in this country. As regards Mr. Ferdinand Keane, the chairman at the banquet, his presence could carry no threat of aggressive politics, for his candidacy for the legislature brought only twenty votes in a whole district, so that any further announcement of abstention from politics would seem to have been quite superfluous, at least in so far as those participants were concerned who knew the record and attitude, in regard to political matters, of the chairman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0837.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>As far as I could detect not one of the few Norwegians in Chicago who have attained some slightly recognized position in political life, was present at the banquet. The reason for this was quite naturally that the turners were so busy discussing the turner movement, the Olympic games, and other kinds of old-fashioned matter that the practical political utilization of the forces of a healthy mind in a healthy body could find no chance for consideration.</p>
   <p>We like to hear ourselves spoken of as Vikings, Birchlegs, etc., but that sort of bragging does not produce desirable results. It is no use talking loudly about the facts of our ancestors; if we ourselves be not able to do viking deeds we are yet not vikings. Take Ward Fourteen, the Ward where Dr. Doe is living. Do you see any Norwegian vikings there? Germans, Jews, and Danes are running the government in the Ward while we are yet listening to fables about the Olympic games and about the times of the "Birchlegs". An ugly sin has been committed among our people here to bring about the present situation in which other nationalities possess the political power <pb facs="5423969_3_0838.jpg" n="6"/>here in our midst. One may well ask to what extent Dr. Doe is a leader in the move to subject our people in this manner; in what measure the blame for this disgrace is due to him, whose social influence has been so great among our people. Politically we are badly off. The quarrels incident to church divisions are notorious, and we are being designated as devoted seekers after theological phantasms. I believe, however, that the political cowardice ever apparent in the public addresses of our leading men of affairs, on such occasions as, for example, the Norwegian Turners' banquet, is responsible to a far greater degree for our lack of political courage and sense. The turners need to carry their agility as athletes with them into their life and activities; they must take in hand the rich opportunities to be noticed which are open to the youths of this country. It will no longer do to drug ourselves at punch parties and other occasions with "Birchleg" boasting, for our humiliation with reference to participation in public life has become extreme, and we need to shake loose from the shackles of the past.</p>
   <p>At a Norwegian Turner meet we ought to pay our respect to the political life, <pb facs="5423969_3_0839.jpg" n="7"/>and the boys ought to be taught to realize that the Norwegians are expecting more from them than simply to jump and catch for the amusement of the people.</p>
