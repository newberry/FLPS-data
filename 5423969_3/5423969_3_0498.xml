   <p>We are often asked, "Why do you report lectures by Socialists, radicals, free-thinkers,etc.? "One might as well ask, Why is the day light or the night dark?</p>
   <p>Scandia, is the organ of the fair-minded thinking group of our Norwegian-American public: we have no party connections and are free, open and independent; we carry no man's collar or yoke. We represent a new and different element of our people, a new spirit of progress and freedom.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian-American press has long been dominated by narrow-minded opinions and bosses, and among these the single track, retrogressive, narrow-minds of leaders(?) in our Norwegian churches have by no means been the weakest detrimental influence.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0499.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Scandia is the herald of a new day, a new line of thought, and a new idea of personal and religious freedom, and for this reason we are critized, heckled and damned by the mentally dead, ultra-conservative press. We recognize no master but our readers, and as long as Scandia lives, its columns are open to all decent citizens; their viewpoints will be printed even the we may personally disagree with their every ideas. We publish socialistic articles because they refer to a worldwide movement that presents a theory and an ideal so different from the present slavery and exploitation that one involuntarily feels a growing interest in statements by the leaders of the party. While we are anything but atheists or free-thinkers, we will continue to publish articles submitted on such subjects, in the belief that much can be learned and new struggle developed through knowledge of the claims of the opposition.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0500.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Regarding religious articles, we remain neutral. Religion is, in the strictest sense, a question of belief, and belief or unbelief is optional with the individual.</p>
   <p>With these thoughts in view, Scandia will continue to publish articles contributed either by radical or conservative writers, and, so far as our personal comments and judgment are concerned, we shall be as fair and impartial as possible, regardless of subject or contributor. Deep thought is constructive, and we pity those who tenaciously hang on to traditions and idess of predecessors, and dare not think for themselves or give voice to their thoughts. These individual are in the most abject slavery.</p>
