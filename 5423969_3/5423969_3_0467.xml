   <p>But now that I an being interviewed, there is another matter in which I, together with nearly every other Scandinavian, am deeply interested. I refer to the attacks made on the use of foreign languages in this country. It will be remembered that even so great an American as Theodore Roosevelt seemingly referred to this country as a "polyglot boardinghouse," and in a letter written shortly before he died, he stated that in this country there was not room for more than one language.</p>
   <p>Governor Harding of Iowa had the brazen effrontery to issue a proclamation prohibiting conversation in any other language than English by people on railroad trains, in hotel lobbies, or other public places, and forbidding the use of any other language than English at public gatherings, in the churches, <pb facs="5423969_3_0468.jpg" n="2"/>and in the schools. In Nebraska, a law has been passed and declared constitutional by the State Supreme Court, prohibiting the teaching of any other language than English in all the grades below the eighth in all public and private schools. But the state of Oregon caps the climax in this hysterical, not to say insane, crusade against the foreign element in this country. A law was recently passed by the legislature of Oregon and sanctioned by its government, forbidding the printing of any newspaper, pamphlet, or book "in any other language than English" in that state. The result was that several newspapers printed in foreign languages in Oregon had to suspend publication.</p>
   <p>In my humble opinion, the fact that we are polyglot is one of our most valuable cultural assets. A person knowing only one language lives in a home with only one window, and has an outlook in only one direction. A polyglot nation has several windows on all four sides of its mansion and sees what is transpiring in all parts of the world. The great poet and philosopher, Goethe, was certainly right when he said that without a knowledge of other languages, a man knows nothing of his own.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0469.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Not long ago, Senator King introduced a bill in the United States Senate to exclude all publications--newspapers, magazines, and so on--printed in other languages than English from second class mailing privileges. The bill was read twice and referred to a committee. Such a bill, if it should be passed, would kill every newspaper published in any other language but English in this country. To publish them, it would be necessary to put them up in single wrappers and put a one-cent stamp on each, an expense that no newspaper could bear.</p>
   <p>I am not at all in sympathy with all this hysterical agitation against the foreign born or their descendants now rampant in this country. The statistics show beyond question that the foreign born are not less loyal to the United States than the native born. There are in this country approximately 1,500 newspapers and magazines published in foreign languages, and their circulation aggregates about 8,000,000. They are printed in 33 different languages and circulate in every state in the Union. They are read not only by the foreign born, but also by their children, born in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0470.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Now this is what I want to call particular attention to. Not more than four per cent of these publications are Socialist, Communist, or I. W. W. in their tendencies, and hardly more than one per cent are of deep red color, that is to say, Communist or Anarchist; so that ninety-nine per cent, at least, of this foreign-language press is entirely loyal, and ninety-six per cent definitely anti-Socialist. To be more explicit, only sixteen of the 1,500 papers published in foreign languages in this country are of the socialist or radical kind, and of these sixteen, five are in Yiddish. Not one of the sixteen has anything more than a very limited circulation.</p>
   <p>The ultra-radical press of the country is printed in English and has millions of readers. The Appeal to Reason, published in Kansas, is supposed to have a circulation of more than a million. Of course, I do not deny that the foreign born who have acquired a thorough knowledge of English are sometimes employed on the editorial staff of some of these revolutionary publications. The refusal to seat five Socialist members of the New York legislature is a piece of the same cloth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0471.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Let me add that it is up to the Republican as well as to the Democratic party to take a strong position in their platforms against all persecution of foreigners in connection with the use of their mother tongue in their newspapers, magazines, pulpits, and schools, and to nominate as their standard-bearers candidates who are not contaminated by know-nothing prejudices. A candidate, be his name General Wood or W. J. Bryan, who endorses these crusades against the foreign born who have been invited to our shores, will, if nominated, surely meet his Waterloo in November.</p>
