   <p>The young people's society, Ulabrand, has resolved to arrange a series of free popular lectures this fall and winter; they will be presented monthly to start with, and later, if the people desire it, there will be a lecture every two weeks.</p>
   <p>The first lecture was given a month ago. Dr. Klovstad spoke of consumption and how to avoid it, in an interesting easily understandable way.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow the Rev. Bergesen will lecture on Ibsen's "Brand." Surely people will be interested in learning how one of our leading ministers looks upon this mighty drama.</p>
   <p>This undertaking by the active young people of Ulabrand deserves recognition.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0724.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In Norway and in other European countries, lectures such as those mentioned have for a long time been important elements in public education. This educational work is known there under the name of Workers Academies. Of late years, several of the American universities have carried on a similar work through the University Extension lectures. These latter ones are not always free, however.</p>
   <p>The lectures arranged by Ulabrand are given in Norwegian, especially for Norwegians. They will be given in plain language and in such a manner that everybody will be able to enjoy. The intention is both to provide information and to stir interest; and also to create pleasant hours as a variety from the daily work. Let there be full house at each lecture.</p>
