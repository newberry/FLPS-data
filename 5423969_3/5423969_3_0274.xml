   <p>p.8..."Nordmendenes Sangforening" (Northmen's Singing Society) held their 41st annual picnic on Sunday, July 9th. Experienced committeemen had wisely secured the best park money could obtain and the resulting attendance more than justified the expenditure. Experience gained at former picnics demonstrated that "speeches"were not popular,so music, singing and dancing were the day's program that was thoroughly enjoyed by all.</p>
   <p>The evening concert drew every one on the grounds, and with the assistance of a Swedish Chorus, which was a special guest, the singers wove a spell of enjoyment over the vast assembly that held them till the last note had died away in the night. "By the Sea" and "I Would Flee" in Norwegian and "Free as a Bird", and "Spring Sunshine" in Swedish were exceptionally well rendered by the Norsemen and selections by the Swedish Chorus were given a long and hearty applause.</p>
