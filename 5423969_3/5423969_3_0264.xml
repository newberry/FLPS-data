   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club celebrated their twenty-third anniversary with a banquet and program at Bjorgvin Hall, on Tuesday, April 30th. This was one of the best celebrations ever stages by any of our organizations.</p>
   <p>The food was excellent and perfectly served, and the speeches were just right, neither too long not too long nor too bombastic. The hall was tastefully decorated and everything combined to make a thoroughly enjoyable evening.</p>
   <p>The first speaker, Judge Torzison, spoke of the excellent work of the club on the concert stage; also its support of, and service to, our benevolent institutions. In conclusion, he presented the club with a large framed picture of the eight founders of the chorus. Only one of the original eight, John Dahle, was left, and he could not think of missing the affair.</p>
   <p>The name of the donor of the picture was, by his request, withheld, but we <pb facs="5423969_3_0265.jpg" n="2"/>have since learned it was Haldor Hansen,</p>
   <p>Several hearty toasts were given Professor Alfred Paulsen, who, as was Mrs. Paulsen, was a special guest of honor. All speakers made reference to Professor Paulsen's contribution to the Norwegian Male Choruses, and Finn Rein Simonsen told how at a national convention of male choruses in Bergen Norway five or sixty years ago, they nearly sung themselves to death on Paulsen's "Nar Fjordene Blaner," Norway's most popular song at the time.</p>
   <p>Other speakers were Julues Jaeger, L. M. Steensohn, Louis Nilisen, G. Harveland, and F. Tollefsen, master of ceremomies. Singing by the chorus and individual soloists, together with violin and piano music, was pleasingly interspersed between the speeches. The final hours of the evening were spent in dancing, after which the guest wended their way to their respective homes with a true consciousness of the passing of another perfect day.</p>
