   <p>p.7........Ironwood, Michigan - Anders Haugen (Norseman) is now the world's champion ski jumper as a result of his delivering a jump of 152 feet at the tournament on Sunday February 19. Not only did this win the championship, but it established a new world record. A brother, Lars Haugen won second place with jumps of 129 and 131 feet and also one jump of 144 feet. The Irishman Barney Riley in a trial jump made 154 feet but fell when landing.</p>
   <p>In addition to the regular first prize Mr. Haugen won two additional prizes, breaking the American record of 138 feet, $50.00 and the world's record, $25.00. His total winnings for the day amounted to $175.00, a neat days result.</p>
   <p>Between seven and eight thousand spectators gathered at the hill, and so great was the enthusiasm that every hall in town had a celebration in the evening, the entire city having been decorated in honor of the occasion. Banquets honoring the champion and his fellow skiers were served in several halls, and Haugen and skiing <pb facs="5423969_3_0768.jpg" n="2"/>were toasted loudly and long. Yes the old Norwegian sport is coming to the front in America. Hurrah for the sport of skiing - may it ever prosper and please in Norway and wherever her sons set forth! We enthusiastically look forward to the World tournament in Cary - 1912.</p>
