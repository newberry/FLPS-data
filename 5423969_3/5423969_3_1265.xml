   <p>Fifty members of the Tabitha Hospital Society called a special meeting to elect a nominations committee in accordance with the bylaws of the Society. The meeting was held last Sunday at Scandia Hall; three hundred people were present. The pastors of the Synod churches had warned their congregations against attending this meeting, but many church people showed up just the same. Attorney Stoltenberg was elected chairman for the evening, and H. Rommen was elected recorder.</p>
   <p>Dr. Carl Sandberg showed, with colored diagrams, how the last convention was illegal because the constitution called for a representation of all the branches of the Society, and this had not been the case. The Erie Branch, the smallest, had the greatest representation, and the Norge Branch, the largest, had no representation, and this year's nominationscommittee had tried the same stunt. The president of the Society, Dr. Oscar Torrison, rose to declare the present meeting illegal because neither president nor secretary could call a special <pb facs="5423969_3_1266.jpg" n="2"/>meeting; this could only be done by the entire executive board. Attorney John Waage replied by saying that "the entire fault was with the board; they had broken the constitution of the Society and had laid themselves open to arrest, and the membership could force the board to abide by the Society's laws, by taking out a writ of mandamus." Dr. [Anders] Doe had nothing to do with the calling of the special meeting. A nominations committee was elected. It is composed of Captain John Anderson, Attorney Waage, and Dr. Sandberg.</p>
