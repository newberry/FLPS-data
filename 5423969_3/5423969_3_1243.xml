   <p>The new board of directors of the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society held its first meeting last Tuesday evening. According to the report given, forty-nine patients were treated in the month of February. It was decided that all monies collected must be paid to the treasury of the hospital, and that all dues be credited to each individual member paying dues, all such credits to be used to defray the expenses in the event that these members enter the hospital for treatment. A motion was made and carried that Dr. Karl Sandberg be made head surgeon of the hospital.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stibolt, having refused to serve on the board of directors, was discussed, and a committee was appointed to call on him to determine whether or not he wished to serve. A decision was made that his office be declared vacant until <pb facs="5423969_3_1244.jpg" n="2"/>the committee turned in its report.</p>
   <p>The chairman asked for nominations to fill vacancies on the board. Mrs. Wm. B. Johnson, K. M. Hogland, and Dr. Karl Sandberg were elected. Dr. Sandberg, however, was elected to serve temporarily.</p>
   <p>The following resolution was passed:</p>
   <p>The board of directors of the Norwegian Lutheran Tabitha Hospital Society record their profound regret at the death of Dr. Christian Fenger, which occurred in the city on March 7, 1902. The lamented deceased held the position of chief surgeon of the Tabitha Hospital since 1895 and up to the time of his death.</p>
   <p>The world knew his distinguished ability and accorded him a place among the world's leaders in his great profession. But we know also the tenderness <pb facs="5423969_3_1245.jpg" n="3"/>of his heart and the breadth of his exalted humanity. The afflicted and suffering never needed wealth to secure his kindest care and solicitude. This board and our hospital were honored by his official connection, as the inmates of the hospital were blessed by his invaluable services.</p>
   <p>We beg to tender to his bereaved family our most sincere sympathy, and we fervently pray that God may strengthen and comfort them in their great afflicition.</p>
   <p>The secretary is hereby directed to forward to the beloved wife of our dear friend and engrossed copy of the foregoing expression.</p>
   <p>H. N. Stoltenberg, president.</p>
   <p>H. Rommen, secretary.</p>
