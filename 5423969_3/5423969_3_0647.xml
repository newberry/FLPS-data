   <p>Norge I Billeder (Norway in Pictures) is a book that should be found in every Norwegian home in America. The book is unique; the publishers deserve great praise for having brought the work before the public.</p>
   <p>Do you long to see once more the grand, beautiful, enchanting land of Norway? Do you long to see the green hillsides, the narrow dales, the whispering books, the mirror-like fjords, the steep mountain peaks? You need not cross the ocean to behold it all; secure a copy of Norge I Billeder; this book presents Norway in all its true beauty and magnificence.</p>
   <p>The book shows you your own home district so vividly presented that you will imagine that you are beholding the real land, not merely a picture.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0648.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The book brings a greeting from your own cradle; from the trees around which you played when a child; from the house in which you received your training; from the door through which you passed on the day of your emigration; from your father, mother, sister, and brother over in Norway.</p>
   <p>Nowegian nature, smiling at dawn and flooded in sunlight, is enchanting; it presents to the eye the most delightful aspects of nature's art. Norge I Billeder will be a welcome guest in the home of every Norwegian in America. During the long winter evenings the book will be a source of enjoyment for everyone who procures it. The book takes you by the hand, as it were, guiding you from the Naze to the North Cape, past wild mountain ranges, over ridges, up and down narrow valleys or dales, across glittering fjords and lakes, among thousands of islets and peninsulas; and after such a fairy tale journey you will gain a new and living conception of the glory which is our old homeland, Norway.</p>
