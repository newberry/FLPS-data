   <p>Home Finding Society dedicated its new home in Irving Park, last Sunday afternoon. The day was exceptionally beautiful, and several hundred people were present. The home was decorated with American-Norwegian and Danish flags. The Reverend J. A. Moldstad spoke of the objective of the society in founding the home. It was an expression of neighborly love. The children who have no parents or who have been neglected are in the same position as the man told of in the bible who had fallen among robbers. The home is to become an aslyum for such unfortunate ones.</p>
   <p>The Receiving Home is located on Byron Steet two blocks West of Milwaukee Avenue, and two blocks South of Irving Park Boulevard. It is a fine two story frame house with four large rooms down-stairs, and five rooms upstairs. The attic is large, having space for two rooms. The grounds <pb facs="5423969_3_1599.jpg" n="2"/>consist of two lots making a fine lawn with several big trees.</p>
   <p>The Finding Home applies modern principles of caring for unfortunate children. The old way was to gather the children in orphanages, and care for them there. The modern way is to find kindhearted people who are willing adopt the children and bring them up as their own. This new method has several advantages over the old one. It is better for the children to be brought up in private homes than in institutions. In addition, this method makes it possible to take care of a far larger number of children. The Home Finding Society started as a branch of the German "Kinderfreund" (friend of children) in Peoria. The children were temporarily placed either in Peoria or in the Lutheran Orphanage in Stoughton, Wisconsin until homes could be found for them. Since the society has become known and has gained the confidence of the Juvenile Court, so many children were given into the society's care that it became difficult to find places for them, and the officials of the society began to realize that it was <pb facs="5423969_3_1600.jpg" n="3"/>necessary to get a Receiving Home in Chicago. It was resolved to discontinue the connection with the German "Kinderfreund" and form an independent corporation. The necessary steps were taken, and the society is now able to continue its work under better conditions and with bright outlook.</p>
   <p>During the past year and a half, the society has cared for about seventy-five children, a very large number considering the means at the society's disposal. It is an undertaking everybody should rejoice in, and which all Scandinavians might well help supporting.</p>
