   <p>p.4...The affairs of the Tabitha Hospital, financial and otherwise, seem to be in a real muddle and have been the subject of a great deal of newspaper comment and general discussion.</p>
   <p>The May 14th issue of Skandinaven published the minutes of a meeting held on June 28, 1910, wherein we read that Mrs. Capt. Wm. Johnson was listed as treasurer of the hospital. We decided to interview this wonderful old lady and we learned that she had been told of her election, but no funds, records, or documents had been delivered into her keeping, nor had she ever been notified of any meetings of the executive board of the institution. She had been informed that records and documents were in the vaults of a bank, but, which bank was not mentioned. Needless to say, Mrs. Johnson refused to serve under these conditions and is resigning. Likewise, we <pb facs="5423969_3_1181.jpg" n="2"/>learn that Dr. Quales and Editor Grevstad,of Skandinaven, have resigned, refusing to let their names be linked with an institution whose affairs are kept secret from those named as officers and sponsors; nor will they permit themselves to be led by the nose without knowing what it is all about. Men as prominent and busy as these two do not connect with an enterprise for mere pleasure and certainly will not be a party to such deceit as seems to be the practice at the Tabitha Hospital.</p>
