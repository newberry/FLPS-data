   <p>p.4....An appeal is being made on behalf of the Norwegian Children's Home in Edison Park, Ill., for funds to give each child a fruit or garden paten. Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars is the estimated amount necessary and should be easy to raise.</p>
   <p>All who have visited the home will recall that it is quite isolated, the nearest neighbor being a half mile away. The Home gives one the impression of the privacy of a good sized farm. The impression ends with the privacy as the many acres, on which the home is built, are lying fallow due to lack of funds for farming operations. Allowing each of the older children a portion of this rich land for garden patches will not only please the children and provide a healthy outlet for youthful energy but would mean additional supplies for the home larder.</p>
   <p>Larger sums have been easily raised for many purposes so we are confident <pb facs="5423969_3_1531.jpg" n="2"/>that the modest amount requested will be raised in a few days. Spring is here and we will shortly see an enthusiastic group of children happily planning and planting their gardens under efficient supervision. These youngsters will have a priceless combination of health building contributions; sun, fresh air, and useful exercise, all in one.</p>
   <p>One of our neighbors, Miss Servos, has been deeply interested in the children since the first one came to the home and has contacted the children every day since. This young lady is determined to put the garden project over and will not give up until every child has his or her favorite garden plot with growing vegetables, berries, grapes, apples, flowers, etc. Each child is to decide what is to be raised on his or her plot.</p>
   <p>Miss Servos is a practical and experienced farmerette and will donate her services in buying supplies and supervising the garden project from beginning to end. One has but to see the children cluster around their friend and listen for a few minutes to their conversation to be impressed with her love for these children, with their faith in her and with the enthusiasm with which they plan their gardens.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1532.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Subscription lists have been placed with Scandia and with Mrs. Selma Lunde, Edison Park. Mrs. Lunde will serve as treasurer of the project and will at all times be able and willing to show subscribers and friends just how the work, and its financing, is prospering.</p>
   <p>In addition to the gardening phase of the project the great interest shown by certain children in the poultry on her place, Miss Servos will start some of the older children raising poultry, instructing them in the intricacies of the incubator, brooder, feeding and sorting.</p>
   <p>In view of what one person, Miss Servos, is doing for the children it would be a disgrace for our people to fail in raising the mere pittance required for this work. As an investment in character and citizenship our donations will bring greater returns than we will ever fully know. "Bread cast upon the waters, etc."</p>
   <p>Norsemen - our hearts are eight - let us demonstrate it by raising even more than the "mite" requested.</p>
