   <p>The Young Ladies Society of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of Our Savior gave a most successful church concert at the Church, corner of May and Erie Streets, last Wednesday evening. The attendance was large, although the big church auditorium was not completely filled.</p>
   <p>The attractive program opened with a cornet solo by Mr. M. Pedersen, "My Old Kentucky Home"; this number as well as the concluding number, "Remembrance of Norway" was played with that sureness ever evidenced by Mr. Pedersen when playing the cornet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bruno Hess sang the baritone solos "Songs My Mother Taught Me", "Gamla Mor" ("My Old Mother"), and "It's Enough", and received much praise.</p>
   <p>Miss Anna H. Olsen gave a piano solo; she proved a master on her chosen instrument.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0096.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Eugene Skaaden played numbers by Grieg, Seeboeck, and Chopin with great success. He also accompanied Messrs. Pedersen and Hess.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Bass, violinist, played two numbers by Mendelssohn with his usual ability, accompanied by Mr. Charles Green.</p>
   <p>Besides these various artists the audience also had the pleasure of listening to Miss Grace Nelson whose beautiful soprano voice is well known in Chicago; she has appeared on numerous occasions on the South Side.</p>
   <p>The concert was a success in every way. The audience had been requested not to applaud, since the concert was given in the church.</p>
