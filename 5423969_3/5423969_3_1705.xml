   <p>At the monthly meeting of the Humboldt Park Branch of the Norwegian Home for the Aged, an interesting report of the work was given. At present there are one hundred and five old people at the Home, and to keep the institution going requires $1,500 to $1,600 per month. A few years ago the Home was comparatively wealthy when the income rose to as much as $1,000 per month, but the high prices have made higher amounts necessary. Even so, some keen figuring is needed to make ends meet.</p>
   <p>Among the many thousand Norwegians in Chicago hardly one thousand are members of the Society for the Home for the Aged, and of these probably not many more than one tenth are doing real active work.</p>
   <p>There seems to be a general feeling among our people that the Norwegian Home for the Aged is a rather well-to-do institution, quite capable of taking <pb facs="5423969_3_1706.jpg" n="2"/>of itself. Such is far from the case. The Home has a certain amount of invested capital; there are three funds, but these funds cannot be used for current expenses until they have reached, with interests added, a certain amount. The so-called endowment fund has been created for the use of those who are to carry on the work for old people when the present workers are no longer at hand. On the other hand, if the Home for some reason or other were to be abolished, the endowment sum must be large enough to repay such old people as might then be guests; the amount required of them at the time of their admission to the Home; that we owe those old people.</p>
   <p>The leaders in this movement are very anxious that people should understand the position of the Home for the Aged. The very large number participating in the recent picnic in the interest of the Home - the largest ever - seems to indicate a growing interest in the Home and its work.</p>
