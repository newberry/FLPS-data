   <p>Sleipner, Chicago's oldest Norwegian athletic club, held their annual skating races in Humboldt Park, on Sunday, Jan. 5th. The light snowfall just before the start of the races reminded one of the Holmenkollen Ski races in Norway being viewed from under a sea of umbrellas. An unexpectedly large crowd kept the park police more than busy directing traffic and keeping the crowd on shore.</p>
   <p>The Nestor Johnson cup for the one mile event was won by Bobby McLean, who now holds this trophy permanently, having also won it in 1912.</p>
   <p>Other winners were (boys): Edw. Planert, half-mile; Roy Gunderson, one-mile-novice; Thos. Norman, two-mile handicap.</p>
   <p>Between races, Mr. August Wilson gave exhibitions of figure skating that brought him a storm of applause after every figure.</p>
   <p>This year's racing show was one of the best held in Chicago, and Sleipner is justly proud of its success.</p>
