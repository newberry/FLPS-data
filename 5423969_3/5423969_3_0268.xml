   <p>Members and friends of St. Johnanne Hirken (St. John Norwegian Lutheran Church), gave a surprise party for their pastor, Reverend H.P. Ausan, and his wife, on Thursday, March 14.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Mr. Ausan has been the pastor of the church during the last two years, and though the time has been short, he and his good wife have won themselves a host of friends by their faithful work and ability.</p>
   <p>The members of the congregation and their friends had gathered to honor the beloved couple, and present the with a well-filled purse as a token of appreciation for the wonderful work they had done in such a short time.</p>
   <p>The Reverend A. Holstad, of Markus Hirken (St. Mark's Church), at the evening's master of ceremonies made the presentation, and announced the program which consisted of vocal selection by Mr. Thiels, readings by Miss Kinnie Broten, and songs by a quartette of visiting friends.</p>

   <p>Dr. Warloe, speaker of the evening, thanked the Reverend Mr. Ausan and Mrs. Ausan for their faithful work. Afterwards, sandwiches, cake, fruit, and coffee were served. The Reverend Mr. Ausan voiced appreciation on behalf of himself and Mrs. Ausan, for the kindness and generosity shown them during his pastorate, and commended the faithfulness of the congregation in the matter of church attendance and in meeting all obligations promptly-even in these hard times.</p>
