   <p>The annual convention of the Tabitha Hospital Society was held last Tuesday at Schoenhofen's Hall. Dr. [Oscar] Torrison, president of the Society, presided.</p>
   <p>The first dispute arose when someone asked for a temporary chairman, and nominated Dr. Oyen. Dr. Carl Sandberg then nominated Attorney Stoltenberg.</p>
   <p>Dr. Torrison ignored Sandberg's nomination and declared Dr. Meyer elected. The result was that the secretary took the chair and proceeded in a legal and democratic way with the nominations. Attorney Stoltenberg was then officially elected.</p>
   <p>This did not meet with the approval of the other faction, so the battle was on again. This faction suggested that the ballot be secret this time. Dr. Marie Olsen, who had taken the chair, nominated K. M. Hasland and Captain H. Mikkelsen, <pb facs="5423969_3_1253.jpg" n="2"/>and they promptly declared themselves elected. Finally, after an hour or two had been wasted, order was restored. The election results were finally made "public". The following directors were elected for a term of three years: Mrs. M. Pedersen, Mrs. G. Isaacson, H. Stiboldt (who defeated Henry H. Haugan), John Waage, and H. N. Stoltenberg. The directors who retained office were Dr. Marie Olsen, C. T. Arnet, H. Rommen, Reverend Bleken, and Miss Belle Olsen.</p>
   <p>The result was a complete defeat of the "spiritual" committee.</p>
