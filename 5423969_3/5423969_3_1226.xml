   <p>A reader asks, "Is the financial report of the Tabitha Hospital Society false?" It is rather suspicious that Dr. Marie Olsen refused to recognize any delegate who did not belong to her faction. There must be a reason.</p>
   <p>And, fortunately, she has been unable to silence the press; so we may give the people some facts.</p>
   <p>It was reported at the convention that the Hospital owed $420 to the Jefferson Ice Company, and that no other unpaid bills were outstanding.</p>
   <p>The reader who questioned the honesty of the report handed us the following unpaid bills: The Kuecher Coal Company, $349.38; Truax Greene and Company (Drugs and Sundries), $195.71; John Sexton (Groceries), $22.55; and the Physicians Drug and Supply Company, $65.66. The bills total to $633.30, and in addition there is a court order for $72.52; and a bill of $15 from Nordahl and Olsen <pb facs="5423969_3_1227.jpg" n="2"/>for nurses' graduation pins. Another thing that did not appear in the report was the sale of the lots on which the Hospital is built, for street assessments.</p>
   <p>We find that the total debts of the Hospital amount to $1200, and the report only shows $420. The reader who brought this to our attention was Mr. Henry Rommen, whose honesty can not be doubted.</p>
