   <p>Chicago's Apothecaries are good mixers (no pun intended). This is evidenced at their social gatherings, one of which was held last Monday. The Chicago Apothecaries' Club had arranged a Norwegian evening at the Hotel Bismark where decorations and surroundings were in the Norse style.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brunn represented Norway on the committee, to make sure that the real Norse brew was served by Dr. A. Doe. An octette from the "Nordmendenes" Male Chorus, under the direction of Hans Oftedahl, entertained with several selections that were thoroughly enjoyed. With all the appetisers disposed of, the group adjourned to the tavern where the sumptuous free lunch disappeared like dew under the warm sun. What chance has a supply of eatables after a few drinks of Lysholm Akvavit and a speech by Dr. Doe? This was one occasion where the well-known business and pleasure, was properly well mixed.</p>
