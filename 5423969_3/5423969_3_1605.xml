   <p>On Saturday evening the bazaar of the Norwegian Orphanage Society at Wicker Park Hall came to an end. Reverend Torgersen was the speaker of the evening. The attendance was large on Saturday as it had been throughout the week.</p>
   <p>The income from the bazaar has been more than $1,000 during the week, and there are yet a number of articles to be sold. Since all the articles on sale at the bazaar had been donated, the expenses were insignificant, and most of the income is net. There are still a few bills that have not been received, but the belief is that the total expenses will not exceed $100.</p>
