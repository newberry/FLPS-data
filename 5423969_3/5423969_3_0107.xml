   <p>The picnic proceeded according to announcement and was a success in every way......Already at noontime, a number of people had gathered; more came during the afternoon, but it was not until about six o'clock that the large crowds arrived and the program got under way.</p>
   <p>President T. Ebert of the Association welcomed the people warmly, and Attorney Alfred T. Johnson spoke in honor of America. His speech was enthusiastic and was received with applause. Senator Niels Juul [Danish] spoke in a humoristic vein and, as always, was warmly applauded.</p>

   <p>As to the remaining numbers on the program, the rendition of the song, "Mindets Bagen" (Toast to the Past), by performers in viking costumes, made a special impression. The performance was most attractive, though the illusion suffered somewhat from the gaiety evoked through the sight of acquaintances dressed in helmet and armor, especially in consideration of the terrific heat. Those not participating in the performance could not help feeling strong sympathy with the unfortunates who were loaded down with armor, including wigs and other heavy articles of clothing.</p>
   <p>The black magicians were watched with great jubilation as they engaged in a competitive eating contest, each from his end of a long sausage.....The two sausage-eaters did their work faithfully, and Mr. Birger Osland, under whose watch the exhibition was performed, had to keep an eye on the two to prevent them from attacking each other after the sausage-eating was over. Later on there was a sports exhibition, vaudeville, and dancing in the large dance pavilion....until late in the evening.</p>
