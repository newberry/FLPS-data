<title level="a">NORWEGIAN LUTHERAN ORPHANAGE SOCIETY HOLDS DONATION PARTY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Norwegian Lutheran Orphanage Society gave a Donation Party on Saturday at the Home, on Irving Park Boulevard. During the afternoon a number of gifts were received in the form of groceries, clothes, beds, and cash to the amount of more than one hundred dollars. The Ladies Aid Society Verdandi served coffee and cake at the low price of ten cents, and the customers were many. Many of the visitors to the Home brought flowers for decorative purposes.</p>
   <p>Three children belonging to Jens and Lina Nelson were received at the Orphanage or Home last week. The president, Reverend J. Hetland, took the occasion to have the children baptized, something which the parents had not done. The children received the names of Clara, Myrtle, and Leroy.....</p>
   <p>A trip by streetcar out to the Home, to watch these many well-behaved children, is a pleasant diversion after the daily duties. The Mother of the Home, Miss Abrahamsen, is glad to have visitors, and the children, too, are eager to know who the visitors are.</p>
