   <p>The Norge (Norway) Ski Club gave a dinner and card party on Saturday, May 10, in honor of Ragnar Omtvedt, whose 169-ft. jump at Cary, last winter, set a new world's record for ski jumpers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Omtvedt has been one of Norge's most active members for many seasons and has been every year one of its outstanding performers; in fact, the accomplishments of this young Norseman have done more to put Norge on the American winter sports map than those of all the other members combined.</p>
   <p>The one hundred or more men present were nearly all active ski addicts and many of them spoke of pleasant memories of ski races and jumping tournaments in Norway. Mr. Hoakon Lehns officiated as toastmaster, and Mr. Charles Johansen (to the ski boys, "the ski editor") delivered the speech in honor of Mr. Omtvedt. Other speakers included Ivar Johnson of the Norge Ski Club; Mr. Wessel, of Skandinaven; Mr. Engdohl, of The Press; Mr. Dyhrendahl; Mr. Lampe; <pb facs="5423969_3_0756.jpg" n="2"/>and Mr. Terje Jensen, who spoke for the younger members of Norge.</p>
   <p>Mr. Omtvedt was decorated by the club president with the gold medal of the club, for having won the championship and for his good sportsmanship.</p>
