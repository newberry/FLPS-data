   <p>It was more than thirty years ago that the Norwegian men and women of Chicago saw the necessity of starting an orphanage here. The old pioneer Ellins Ellinssen was very interested and talked about this issue whenever he had the opportunity. But it was not until some time in the early 90's that work was really started. Mrs. Sophie Michaelsen began by organizing a number of girls' societies, and having the girls raise money for such a home by selling five-cent books. The first meeting called by Mrs. Michaelsen was on January 14, 1892, but September 21, 1893 was really the day that the Society was organized. On that day a meeting was held in the home of Mrs. Christine Johnson, 56 Bingham Street, where the Society received its name and the constitution and bylaws were formulated. The first executives were Reverend Hetland, Mr. and Mrs. Michaelson, Mrs. August Johnson, Messrs. Rude, Holm, and Liabo.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1897 the Society was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois. In November, 1898, the Society bought the property on Irving Park <pb facs="5423969_3_1497.jpg" n="2"/>Boulevard and 58th Avenue, the old Martin Luther College--a three-story building and six lots, for the price of $4,000, with $1,000 in cash. In February, 1899 Mrs. Abrahmson was appointed matron at the Home. On May 5 of the same year the newly purchased building was occupied and the work really began. The building was officially dedicated on June 18 by Reverend J. N. Kildahl. There were ten children in the Home at that time. In later years there have been as many as seventy-six children in the Home at one time.</p>
   <p>In 1912 the building was remodeled at a cost of approximately $3,500. Sister Caroline Williams was appointed matron on October 3, 1907.</p>
   <p>In the last week of December, 1907, the home was almost destroyed by fire, and while repairs were being made the children were cared for at the home for the poor in Dunning. In 1908 additional property in Edison Park was purchased. It was decided to build there, the new building to cost $40,000. It was decided to house the children in cottages instead of one large dormitory. This proved to be the wisest plan because it was quite easy to add a cottage when <pb facs="5423969_3_1498.jpg" n="3"/>it became necessary. At present there are eighty-five children at the Home.</p>
