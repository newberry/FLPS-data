   <p>p.1...A group of prominent educators, American and Scandinavian, gathered in Hitchcock Hall, University of Chicago, on Friday, May 28th, to organize a Scandinavian Philological Society of America. Professor C.M.Gould, University of Chicago, A.G.S. Josephson, John Crerar Library, J.C.Hansen, director of the University of Chicago Library, were on the committee on arrangements. Philologists from both eastern and mid-western universities were enrolled as members and several of them delivered lectures on various phases of history. Among those who delivered special lectures were Professor Flom, University of Illinois, Professor A.M.Sturtvant, University of Kentucky, Dr. Lee M. Hollander, University of Wisconsin, Professor G. Schutte, Copenhagen University of Denmark, Professor Schutte's treatise was read by Doctor Henry G.Leach of Howard University, Professor Julius E. Olsen, University of Wisconsin, Professor Jules Mauritzen, Augustana College, and Dostor Leonard Bloomfield, University of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Professor Julius Olsen's lecture was of special interest at this time, because of the half-witted attacks on the authenticity of the traditions of Vinland and Leif Eriksen. He attacked utterances of Fr. Nansen, questioning these old sagas <pb facs="5423969_3_0425.jpg" n="2"/>and while, Nansen, was one of the world's greatest explorers, he was, in Professor Olsen's estimation, a mere novice and ill-informed in the realms of early history. Professor Olsen maintained that research, by truly scientific men, was the only way to obtain authentic information as to the accuracy of the old sagas touching on the discovery of America, and the occupation by the old Norsemen. Professor Olsen quoted from Dr. Babcock, conceded to be the greatest authority on Atlantic coast geology, who, thru research, has, among other findings, found certain geological conditions exactly identical with the old descriptions in the saga of "Erik the Red." Professor Olsen voiced a determined demand that in reaching a decision regarding the authenticity of historical data, the decisions of men who have conducted scientific research in the matter be given final word.</p>
   <p>At six o'clock the society were dinner guests of the University of Chicago, at Hutchinson Common, and at 9:00 P.M. were given a "smoker" in the same hall.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0426.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On Saturday morning the society again convened for a short session and lectures were delivered by Professor T. Flom, University of Illinois, Doctor A. Louis Elmquist, of Northwestern University, Professor C.N. Gould, University of Chicago, and Professor A. Stomberg, University of Minnesota, after which organization work was completed, committee reports received and officers elected.</p>
   <p>With such an array of learned men taking up the cudgels to fight the die-hards who are so loath to give the Norsemen the credit due them, we may rest assured that our claims will be proved and the honor our own.</p>
