   <p>Saturday, Sept. 21, the Norwegian Turnforening will open the season with its annual autumn festival in the hall of the society. The members have worked very hard during the past few months to make this festival a success. The best of talent has been engaged for cafe chantant, and there will also be an excellent program in the hall every evening in the form of "turning," singing, etc.</p>
   <p>The public has supported the society in past years, and it is to be hoped that this year will also find the Turn Hall filled evening after evening. Going there, one is certain to meet friends and to have an enjoyable evening.</p>
   <p>The income from this festival will be used to increase the building fund, and it is important that there be more vigorous work this year, in order to realize the hope for a new Turn Hall in the near future.</p>
   <p>The Turnforeningen has done a good job, and has a right to expect strong support from the public.</p>
