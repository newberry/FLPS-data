   <p>Norwegian students of Chicago honored their Alma Mater, on Sept. 2nd at the club rooms of the Chicago Norwegian Club. Twenty former students of the Christiana (Norway) University gathered for a reunion banquet honoring their old school. The senior student of the group was Ivan Doe, who graduated from the C. U. 51 years ago and the baby of the group was student Dybing, a second year student, who is now in Chicago studying dentistry.</p>
   <p>Among the students were also Dr. Warloe and Dr. Holmboe, (who had arranged the banquet). Emil Midelfart, Dr. Doe, engineer Nygaard and editor Sundby Hausen of Scandia.</p>
   <p>The reunion was such a success and so pleasant that it was unanimously decided to hold a like affair on Sept. 2nd every year. Mr. Doe was chosen chairman and Dr. Doe (brother) vice chairman of the alumni association and banquet committee.</p>
