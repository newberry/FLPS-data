   <p>During the summer months Chicago witnesses from year to year a succession of graduations--tiny tots from the kindergarten, children from the public schools, youths from the high schools and colleges, and maturer young men and women from the universities and the training schools.</p>
   <p>To every student graduation is a festive occasion, the realization of a certain goal.</p>
   <p>The education of individuals is the most important function that community and state can undertake for its citizens; it means the preparation and training of the minds and bodies of the individuals for life and life's work, and directly in proportion to the wisdom and thoroughness of this training will be the results for the general welfare and happiness of the individual and the community. In the march of time and races problems are arising which test the wisdom, judgment, and capacity of educators and statesmen; all the more <pb facs="5423969_3_1153.jpg" n="2"/>is it essential for us to be well prepared for the increased duties of modern times. Every parent should give his and her child the best opportunity possible for education and training. By so doing they will not only promote the physical, mental, and spiritual growth of the individual and afford an opportunity for the discovery of any special attribute or inclination for encouragement or correction, but also help raise human standards.</p>
   <p>On numerous occasions we have pleaded with parents to bestow upon their daughters the same educational advantage they give to their sons, and of the girls we have asked that they exert themselves in their own behalf and take advantage of every educational opportunity they can. It is sad indeed for the young girl when she cannot finish grammer school or attend high school although she wishes to do so and is as much qualified as her big brother. One must not forget that delay in education often means no education.</p>
   <p>Opportunities are offered all along the road and it is up to us to take advantage of them. And right here we wish to state that whenever a girl wants to <pb facs="5423969_3_1154.jpg" n="3"/>improve her education she can take up her school work where she left off and go on, at a slow or a fast speed, as conditions permit. Such plans have been made by the Board of Education and should be of great service to those who have not had previous opportunities. As the requirements for admission to certain types of work now demand at least some high school training--and now it is possible to get it--let us hope that a great many of our young people will make use of their time and opportunity by acquiring such knowledge as will qualify them for some of the more important work to be done among us.</p>
   <p>In these days of great activity and stress we recognize, everyone of us, the value of proper training, and in the instance of the trained nurse there is hardly a vocation in as great demand today as hers. We meet her on every hand, not only in hospitals and homes taking care of the sick, but out in the world: in the schools; looking after the health of the children in the tenement houses and slums; advising and instructing mothers and aiding in <pb facs="5423969_3_1155.jpg" n="4"/>placing the sick, the old, and the poor, the cripples and indigent in homes provided for their care. Large employers of labor engage her in looking after the health of their employees. The world today seems awake to the fact that it pays to keep well, that prevention is better than cure, and that nothing is as expensive as ill health.</p>
   <p>The training course in the hospital where the nurse has learned to apply in practice the knowledge of the medical sciences enables her to render these valuable services to the community, obtain for herself a good compensation, and gain considerably in personal value to mankind.</p>
   <p>We wish to congratulate the young women who have just graduated from the Norwegian-American Hospital upon their choice of a profession. And to the graduating class we want to say that we feel sure you will go out and do good work in your chosen field. You have put three years in close application to work and study, we know you have done very well. No doubt you <pb facs="5423969_3_1156.jpg" n="5"/>have on occasions been weary and discouraged when the work seemed hard and the results were not all you desired; but let us remember that most anything worth while is hard. And as to the result, remember that the final inning is not with the Hospital; we can only start you off; the rest is up to you.</p>
   <p>We know that every graduate of the Hospital will go out into life well equipped and ready to serve. We wish that more of our Norwegian daughters would take up nursing.</p>
