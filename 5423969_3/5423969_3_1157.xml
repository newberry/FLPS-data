   <p>The Tabitha Society held its annual meeting at the hospital Jan. 18, in spite of the cold weather the meeting was well attended. Dr. Marie Olsen was in the choir and Miss Belle Olsen was secretary.</p>
   <p>The reading of the minister from the last annual meeting as well as the quarterly meetings was listened to with great interest, also the reports from the hospital activities.</p>
   <p>The president Dr. Marie Olsen gave an exhaustive report of the preceding year (1915), during which time 990 patients were cared for with 11417 hospital-days, nine partly paying patients and 78 free patients; 169 babies were born with 1861 hospital-days. No charges were made for this service. Receipts and Disbursements were as follows.</p>

   <p>This last item covers several large payments on improvements under way, which will make the hospital an up to date one in every way.</p>
   <p>Lastly Dr. Olsen thanked everyone who had lent a helping hand, both of the hospital and in the society. These "good samaritans" have done a noble deed in helping to care for those less fortunate of our countrymen as well as helping to train and educate young women for the profession of nurses.</p>
