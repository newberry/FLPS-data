   <p>The Norwegian Turnforening's banquet on Saturday evening in honor of the seven prize winners of June 16 was very well attended. The banquet was held in the Turners' Hall, 586 N. California Ave. President Martin Anderson functioned as toastmaster, and expressed the thanks of the club to the prize winners for the great victories won at Riverview Park.</p>
   <p>Sports director, John Benson, presented to the club the silver bowl put up by the German Turnverein, and presented to the winners gold medals as follows:</p>
   <p>Leif Widness, Nicolay Beck, George Michaelsen, Carl Granberg, Conrad Christensen, Sverre Dietrich, and G. Thorsen. The speaker emphasized that it was not to be forgotten that the competitors from those other clubs were able athletics, even though they did lose this time. The <pb facs="5423969_3_0791.jpg" n="2"/>silver bowl was given into the president's care.</p>
   <p>A telegram from the Ski Club Norge was read. During the evening the varied program consisted of speeches, declamations, songs and piano numbers. A very pleasant evening.</p>
