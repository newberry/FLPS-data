   <p>A benefit concert for the Norwegian Children's Home Society of Chicago,will be given at Orchestra Hall Wednesday night, April 8, by the United Norwegian Societies, under the auspices of the Norwegian National League and the Norwegian Singers League.</p>
   <p>Proceeds from the concert will be appliedto the building fund of new Norwegian Orphans Hall, to be erected on a tract of about 20 acres at Edison Park just outside the city limits. The need of the fund is great, as the present home on Irving Park Blvd., was diminished in capacity by one-third through the rebuilding made necessary by fire. It is hoped to erect the new building this summer, so that it can be occupied in the autumn.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Childrens Home Society of Chicago was organized in 1896, and shortly afterward was able to move the children under its care into its own home. A large <pb facs="5423969_3_1593.jpg" n="2"/>debt has rested for several years on the home, which has been occupied to its fullest capacity by poor, neglected little ones gathered from the city and suburbs. It soon became apparent that the capacity of the home was inadequate and the Edison Park site was purchased through a legacy received from the last George Bessen. The debt has been paid off, but there is not enough money on hand to build adequately.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that the new building cost $25,000.00 and it has been planned to accomodate 150 children. For the last three years the income of the home has been entirely from voluntary subscriptions.</p>
   <p>Though conducted in a christian spirit the Norwegian Children's Home does not belong to any particular church. It is a national and non-sectarian charity. Any man or woman may become a member of the society by accepting its constitution and by-laws and paying annual dues.</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_1594.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The program of the benefit concert will include orchestra numbers, chorus singing under the direction of Emil Biorn, Gust Carlson, John D. Swendson and Alfred Paulsen, a prologue written by Dr. Olav Rohmer and delivered by Arthur Thallough, a violin solo by P. Marinus Paulsen, piano solos by Miss A. R. Walden, a baritone solo by P. Ericksen, a soprana solo by Mme. G. Nelson, a baritone solo by Gustaf Holmquist, reading by Miss Ethel C. Olsen, a soprano solo by Miss E. Olsen and organ solos by William Middelschulte.</p>
