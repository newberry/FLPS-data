   <p>The committee on arrangements for the great athletic contest to be held in Logan Square Baseball Park, Sunday, September 19, held its first meeting last night at the Norwegian Employment Office, for the purpose of organization. Einar Bergendahl, a veteran turner, was elected chairman of the committee; Lars J. Siljan was elected secretary, and Mr. C. A. Liabro was elected treasurer.</p>
   <p>A committee of three men...was selected to arrange with the I. G. U. [International Gymnastic Union] for authority to hold the meet. As soon as this authority has been obtained the official invitations will be issued, and programs for the meet will be sent to the various societies under the I. G. U.</p>
   <p>The following program, which is subject to change, has been adopted by the committee:</p>
   <pb facs="5423969_3_0776.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. One-hundred yard dash</p>
   <p>2. High jump</p>
   <p>3. Broad jump</p>
   <p>4. Three-step run</p>
   <p>5. Shot-put</p>
   <p>6. Pole vaulting</p>
   <p>7. Relay</p>
   <p>8. Tug-of-war</p>
   <p>The official order in which the various events will be held will be announced later. For each event three medals will be awarded, one of gold, one of silver, and one of bronze. The winner of the relay will receive a cup, and the two societies represented by the best athletes will each receive a banner. There will probably be other prizes for individual excellence.</p>
   <p>The committee decided to meet every Wednesday evening at the Norwegian Employment Office, so that inquiries as to other features of the meet may be addressed in care of that office.</p>
