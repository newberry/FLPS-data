   <p>Among the Norwegian football players in Chicago, there is probably no one better known by the Norwegian public than Blaaman (Blue man). But it is quite certain that many of his admirers do not yet know that his real name is Trygve Schou.</p>
   <p>Saturday evening, the football club Fram gave a social at Central Park Hall in honor of the popular player and his wife. Mr. Schou was taken completely by surprise when informed that the social was in his honor.</p>
   <p>At the dinner table many speakers expressed their admiration for the honor guests, and a gift was presented to Mr. Schou and a bouquet of flowers to his wife. Mr. Schou thanked the members warmly for the honor shown him and his wife and for the excellent cooperation of the players during the past year.</p>

   <p>After the dinner, the band played and dancing concluded the pleasant evening.</p>
