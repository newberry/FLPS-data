   <p>The Singing Society Bjorgvin held a social last Saturday at Schoenhofen's Hall, in honor of the ladies who assisted at the last concert of the Society. About one hundred people were present. Four long tables, bulging with food, had been arranged by Mr. Anton Nass.</p>
   <p>After an hour of dancing in the smaller hall, Professors J. W. Colberg and Alfred Paulsen played Norwegian folk melodies, while the chairman of the committee on arrangements, Mr. Ingolf Erdahl, led the march to the tables. The chairman welcomed those present, after which the president of the Society, Mr. Alexander Anderson, spoke in praise of the ladies, thanking them for their assistance in the past and expressing the hope that, when needed in the future, they would prove as willing to help as they had been in the past.....</p>
   <p>The president of the Norwegian Singing Society, Mr. C. Bergersen, made a speech in honor of the Singing Society Bjorgvin; Dr. Bayesen and Mr. P. Erikson spoke <pb facs="5423969_3_0116.jpg" n="2"/>in honor of the ladies. Mr. L. H. Steensohn brought greetings from Professor Elberg of Racine, Wisconsin, the former singing instructor of the Bjorgvin. Mr. Robert Nelson appealed to the membership of the Bjorgvin for many socials like this one, and Mr. Julius Jager thanked the concert committee for the work it had accomplished. In conclusion, the mixed chorus under the direction of Professor [John L.] Swenson sang "Before the Cloister of the South".</p>
   <p>Then the tables were removed and dancing continued. Between dances the Bjorgvin gave several vocal selections. The social was a success from every point of view.</p>
