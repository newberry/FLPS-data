   <p>The Minnehaha Temperance Club offered an exceptionally attractive entertainment last Sunday. The Club succeeded in getting Mr. Ben Blessum to deliver an illustrated lecture on Norway. Mr. Blessum's previous series of lectures on Norway has won unanimous praise among the Norwegians in Chicago, and the people were not disappointed last Sunday either. The attendance was not as large as had been expected, but the lecturer held the audience spellbound from beginning to end.</p>
   <p>Mr. Blessum's pictures, with motif from the southern part of Norway, cover a territory which so far has been partly disregarded. The mountainous inland section of Norway became easily accessible only after the railroad from Christiania to Bergen had been completed. With this new and modern railroad Mr. Blessum led the audience from the eastern part of the country to the west coast, and the stereopticon presented the pictures in a very realistic manner.</p>
   <p>It is easy to see that Mr. Blessum has sifted his material carefully, with <pb facs="5423969_3_0719.jpg" n="2"/>good taste and much love for his theme. As the pictures are selected in his lecture they form a gold mine for anybody who is interested in the study of the Morwegian people and the type of life led in Norway.</p>
