   <p>Mathew Pedersen's jubilee concert at Schoenhofen's Hall last Sunday evening was well attended and a source of musical enjoyment far above the ordinary.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program, "Leif Erikson's March" written by Mathew Pedersen, and presented by an orchestra of thirty men, aroused enthusiasm; it was followed by Soderman's eternal "Swedish Wedding March"; Lumby's "Dream Phantasies"; G. Meyerbeer's "Candle Dance". The public applauded each of these numbers, and during the presentation of the next piece, "Memories from Norway," the public did not wait with its applause until the numbers had been played, but lively applause was heard while the playing went on. This, by the way, should not be done, since the applause will drown the less strenuous of the tones from the instruments. The "Memories from Norway" had been arranged by Mr. Pedersen and he himself played the cornet solo.....Mr. Pedersen plays the cornet with masterly power. Under the leadership of Mr. Pedersen, the Viking Marine Band <pb facs="5423969_3_0120.jpg" n="2"/>played "United States Military March"; the difficult phantasies of Norwegian folk melodies were played by the band in a manner that gave clear evidence of the splendid progress made by this young band under its able director.</p>
   <p>Miss Eleonora Olsen sang "Synove's Song" with beautiful effect, and, being recalled again and again, she sang as an encore "Sigrid's Song" from "To the Saeter".</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Glee Club rendered with fine effect a serenade by O. W. Rechter under the direction of Mr. John Dahl.</p>
   <p>A young violinist, George Bass, gave a violin solo from Mendelssohn. He showed ability as a player indicating that he may become a great violinist. The Chicago Trombone Quartet played Wagner's "Pilgrims' Chorus" from "Tannhaeuser". The presentation received much applause.</p>
   <p>As the final number, the orchestra played Edward Grieg's "Peer Gynt Suite, <pb facs="5423969_3_0121.jpg" n="3"/>No. 1," and this formed a worthy conclusion to the very successful concert.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of part two of the concert, Mr. Olav Boehmer gave a poetic speech on the theme "Music," and ended by extending his thanks to Mr. Mathew Pedersen for his services to music in Chicago during the past twenty years.</p>
