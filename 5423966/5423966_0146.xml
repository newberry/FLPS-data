   <p>A long time beforemany of us were born, our Serbian immigrants organized a colony in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Many of these immigrants have seen their sons and daughters married and their grandchildren born. The original immigrants are getting pretty old, and these grandchildren of theirs are growing fast. So our present world is built on the younger generation, and many of their elders have lived so long in Chicago that they may rightfully be considered old settlers.</p>
   <p>In some families, father, mother, sons, daughters, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren were born in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This fact convinces us that our colony in Chicago is the oldest Serbian settlement in America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423966_0147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Serbians have centers in all three divisions of Chicago, on the North Side, the South Side, and the West Side. Many of our people have bought their own houses and have become property-owners. All this is admirable but there is another part of the picture which we do not like.</p>
   <p>Serbians in Chicago lack many things. They do not have schools, recreation halls, libraries, or a place where they may gather and relax.</p>
   <p>All our meetings, concerts, lectures, etc. are held on rented premises.</p>
   <p>Our people in Chicago have a 'builders' committee. This committee has been in existence, at least on paper, for many years. We have hopes that it will soon display some sign of life and so we will continue to be patient a little longer. If the committee continues to sleep, the younger generation will ask the older: "Were you ever young?"</p>
