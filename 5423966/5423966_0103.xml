   <p>The Serbian Benevolent Society St. Djuradj was organized April 15, 1926, as branch No. 61 of the Serbian Federation Sloboda. At the beginning the above mentioned society had only 50 charter members, whose names are still on the list of today.</p>
   <p>During 1927 the society also organized a youth branch. During three years of existence (1926-29), the society succeeded in increasing its membership to 150 members. Today the society's membership consists of 200 adults and 140 children. The assets of this society are valued at over $6,500. From its beginning until today the society has paid to its members $8,082 in sick benefits.</p>
   <p>The sick benefit consists of $10 cash per week, plus free medical service during the entire period of illness. This society has always been known <pb facs="5423966_0104.jpg" n="2"/>as a very active (one) in practically all Serbian affairs in Chicago, and helped financially and morally each cultural or national enterprise.</p>
   <p>The Serbian church on the north side of Chicago draws especially much financial help from this society. Every church need is partially paid from this society's treasury. Here are just a few donations registered in its treasury book:</p>

   <p>These statistics show that the insurance policies of this society are highly protected due to the big number of young members.</p>
   <p>This society is very young and compares to others; it still shows a bigger cash capital, which offers the best protection to policyholders.</p>
