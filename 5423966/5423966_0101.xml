   <p>Thirty-five years of unselfish work on organizing people of Serbian extraction in South Chicago was celebrated on May 23rd of this year by the oldest known Serbian organization, Lika and Krbava.</p>
   <p>On this rare occasion hundreds of Serbians, Montenegrins, and the representives of other Slavic nations paid their tribute and homage to fifty-seven old members and pioneers who, thirty-five years ago, got the excellent idea of putting together unorganized old-timers.</p>
   <p>Hard work, patience, and love for their neighbors' welfare was the fundamental principle of this society. The self-preservation of those pioneers, of course, played a part in organizing this society.</p>
   <p>After a brilliant celebration, partially in church and outside, members and friends held a banquet in the church's hall. Dozens of speeches were <pb facs="5423966_0102.jpg" n="2"/>delivered by prominent members of the Serbian colony, representatives of several societies, press and political organizations. This showed the attitude of the people toward the activities of the society Lika and Krbava.</p>
   <p>The general motive in these speeches was praise of the noble, self-sacrificing and energetic work done by the society in improving colony life, economically, culturally, educationally and religiously.</p>
   <p>In the evening the South Chicago Dramatic Club, assisted by a combined choir of a few singing societies, gave a well selected entertainment. The dance following continued until after midnight. Old and young were mixed in perfect harmony, enjoying the music, native songs, dances, games, etc.</p>
