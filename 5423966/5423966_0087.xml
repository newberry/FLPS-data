   <p>I have been listening to the Jugoslav program over station WWAE every Sunday and can truthfully say that it is the best foreign program on the air, and the Popovich Brothers deserve great credit for the wonderful music they have been giving us.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adam Popovich, as the leader of this group of talented musicians, is doing a great deal to stimulate a new interest in our folk-lore music.</p>
   <p>With the aid of Mr. Palandech and Mr. Popovich's knowledge of music (being a composer of songs and music which he has shown in his new song of Kossovo, the undying chapter of history of old Serbia), Adam can give us something we as Jugoslavs want and are in great need of.</p>
   <p>A new collection of songs with a modern version is given us on this program. It gives us a chance to learn songs from our mother country.</p>
   <pb facs="5423966_0088.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This would not only give radio audiences satisfaction, but would be very beneficial to the Jugoslav cause, by bringing out the cultural side of the race and the artistic gifts of our people.</p>
   <p>Here's luck to Popovich Brothers and to all of Mr. Palandech's splendid artists, and of course, to our own Mr. Stepanchev, who is doing a splendid job at announcing.</p>
   <p>Emily Colovich.</p>
