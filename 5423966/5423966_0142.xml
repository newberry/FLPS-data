   <p>The suffering immigrant should be pronounced a saint.</p>
   <p>Our immigrant cannot stand the cry of his poor relatives in the old country; he is carrying a heavy load in supporting his family, and yet he always finds something to contribute to our numerous organizations. It seems that everybody is eager to exploit his hospitality and his open heart.</p>
   <p>Our immigrant, despite all his hardships, still manages to be a real Christian and support his church. But too much is too much. Before the war we had three priests in America, and now, after the war, we have forty-three. Our church leaders in Belgrade watch carefully that our souls shall be saved, and they export more and more priests. They do not send us writers, professors, teachers, doctors,--in other words, the intellectuals of whom we are so sorely in need. They send only soul-savers, and we are supposed to thank them for this favor.</p>
   <p>Father Zika says, "Watch your soul, for if you lose your soul, you lose everything."</p>
   <p>Socialists and communists say: "Workers work six days a week and rest on <pb facs="5423966_0143.jpg" n="2"/>the seventh day. Priests work only one day a week and rest six days. The rich do not work at all but rest on all seven days of the week."</p>
   <p>This is a free country. Let every man think and live in his own way.</p>
