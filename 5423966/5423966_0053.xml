   <p>Our greatest ideal of strong unity among Serbians, Croatians and Slovenes never has been accomplished. It seems that the cement which we need to bring complete unity was lacking, and it was mutual understanding between not the race, but different classes. This grave problem at least was solved, as it concerns Chicago colonies, by organizing a Jugoslav club, which has just recently opened the door to members and friends, and is already showing noticeable progress.</p>
   <p>The first meeting, which the organized group held in the Morrison Hotel, brought a great number of our people. We are happy to advise our people that as far as we can remember, there was not a single occasion where people of different social, business, or professional standing met together, as it was seen on this meeting of the Jugoslav club.</p>
   <p>Doctors, engineers, priests, businessmen small and big, common laborers, etc., all united by the great problem of national unity, mixed together and showed most desirable equality.</p>
   <pb facs="5423966_0054.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The main object of this club, as we already announced, is promotion of national unity, but as we have been informed, the club will have quite a large activity in the way of organizing our groups in the way of financial, political, educational cooperation.</p>
   <p>Ugljeska Pupich, Secretary.</p>
