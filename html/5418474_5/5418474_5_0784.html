   <p>All the good resolutions made under ordinary circumstances are scattered like autumn leaves when the storm rises. The "storm," of course is never anticipated. When it does arrive, all the fragile fantasies of human imagination are driven before it and torn to shreds. The cyclone of war has played havoc with the Hague Resolutions and the Paris and London Declarations. How many "scraps" of documented agreements have gone with the wind! You wouldn't hear as many tall stories told in a year in any of New York's notorious Baxter Street clothing shops as the "associated diplomatic service" dishes out in one single day. It's a fake all the way through! In Baxter Street, New York, you get at least a "shoddy" for your money; in Downing Street, London, you get nothing but hot air and "pious" deception.</p>
   <p>The British Parliament is in session again. The Prime Minister has announced <span class="page-break">\2</span>that nothing may be discussed except the war and matters related to it. No impertinent questions will be answered. A credit for an army of three million is to be asked, which is about as many men as France has lost, dead, wounded, prisoners, and disabled by disease included. Such an army of three million is supposed to give to the French new courage and to reconcile them. How many of these three million men will or are intended to see actual combat only the secret books of Lord Kitchener's auditing office could reveal. This credit for an army of three million is not only for England. Every one in the British Parliament knows that England could never raise three million volunteers. Any one who is not too dense to comprehend will easily arrive at the conclusion that at a conference of the Russian, British, and French ministers of finance the painful fact was revealed that the Russians and the French could not raise any more money. The ruble [Russiam monetary unit] has fallen 25%; France is on the verge of bankruptcy with her paper currency, which has fallen 30% below its face value. In order to conceal this misery of the two Allies from the world, the British braggart is asking for an [internal] credit for an army of three million, whereas in fact the <span class="page-break">\3</span>army numbers only 750,000. The Tories, who before the war were in violent opposition to a liberal administration, have promised to agree by silent consent to this "pious deception" "in consideration of the struggle for Great Britain's existence". To be sure, there'll be some verbal skirmishes, but Lord Beresford has taken care that there will be topics for discussion for those who like to unburden their Christian consciences. This "prominent" Christian has announced that he will propose a bill in the House of Commons permitting the "sea and air raiders" who may fall into British hands to be hanged in public. No doubt this measure will afford ample opportunity to the "Christian" Commons to cleanse their hearts and their consciences, and they will make a compromise by adopting the amendment of the famed former navy chief Beresford, which stipulates that the "Germans are not to be considered honorable foes any longer". The title page of Leslie's Weekly shows a German soldier holding a Belgian child on his knees and feeding the child from his mess-kit. Something tells us that this German soldier, even though he is not an "honorable foe" according to Lord Beresford, is nevertheless a very kind and sympathetic fellow.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>He who has become acquainted with the British on their pilfering expeditions in India, in the Boer country, and in the Egyptian Sudan knows that it is their habit to treat every enemy as a "dishonorable foe". We were entertaining the hope that this time their ingrained bloodthirstiness, which would have been a credit to an Attila, would not manifest itself in a disciplined armed force. We could even have excused to a certain extent a Tommy Atkins who has never learned anything but brutality and malicious behavior, but in this case it is the educated class which recommends the practices of bestiality! In the Christian publication Daily Graphic, the following "poem" was published on August 20:</p>
   <p>"Down with the Germans, down with them all!</p>
   <p>Our Army and Navy, be sure of their fall.</p>
   <p>Spare not one of them, those deceitful spies!</p>
   <p>Cut out their tongues, pull out their eyes.</p>
   <p>Down, down with them all!"</p>
   <p>Now doesn't that make "inspiring" reading in a sheet recognized for its <span class="page-break">\5</span>devoutness, such as the Daily Graphic? The owners of this English educational organ know their cultural responsibility. Such outpourings of "deeply stirred" hearts we can find in unlimited numbers. Lord Beresford's demand is only the logical consequence of these pious doctrines and instructions.</p>
   <p>"Wars are becoming more and more humane," they tell us. But we say that war can never be humane! Not in all eternity! War is barbarism! But this barbarism can be restricted to the very minimum necessary! One essential necessity is that any malicious agitation and hostile attitude be avoided by non-combatants. Belgian civilians would not have sustained the slightest discomfort if they had adhered to this principle. Of their rabid agitation they have suffered the [natural] consequences. And so war becomes a terror for the innocents as well. No pious pen records the atrocities of the Cossacks in East Prussia! What English newspaper would express disgust and indignation for the Czarist hordes? was any one of them outraged about the crime of a human beast who strangled a daughter before the eyes of a mother <span class="page-break">\6</span>because the mother had tried to prevent her being ravished? The bloodthirsty Cossack was probably an "honorable foe" of the Germans and a worthy brother in arms of the noble Lord Beresford, British M.P.! If only the Anglo-American press would brand such disgrace for what it really is! How proud we should be to call ourselves Americans!</p>
