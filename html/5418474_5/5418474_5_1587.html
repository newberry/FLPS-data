   <p>The problem of controlling liquor is just as far from solution today as it was in the days when Congress legalized four-per-cent beer. Since that time prohibition has been abolished. Congress and the various State legislatures have enacted laws, and municipal authorities have passed ordinances; but despite this the problem has not been satisfactorily solved. Our fellow citizen, Max Henius, who certainly can be considered an authority on matters pertaining to the manufacture and regulation of liquor, has recently published a pamphlet which contains some noteworthy ideas.</p>
   <p>Max Henius is familiar with the liquor business of his native land, Denmark, and with [liquor traffic] in England, in Germany, and in other countries of continental Europe; he knows what the situation was in the United States before prohibition and during prohibition, and what it is now. He considers education in temperance to be the key to all liquor control. And therefore <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>he is convinced that beer of light alcoholic content would be the ideal national drink for America. However, if it is to be made our universal beverage, the price must be low, and therefore Max Henius demands that it be sold at five cents a glass and at ten cents a bottle.</p>
   <p>This demand is just; but it cannot be enforced, since the tax on beer is much too high. The author shows by statistics that the consumption of beer is not nearly so large as it should be when compared with the consumption of the prohibition era. Therefore Henius recommends that light beer of the kind that was sold immediately before the repeal of prohibition be reintroduced, and that a tax of three dollars a barrel be levied upon it. Stronger beer should be taxed six dollars a barrel. However, in most instances the so-called light beer would contain less than four per cent of alcohol by volume, since brewers would make it so light that it would not contain any more. This was what we experienced in the beer that was brewed just before prohibition was repealed, and it cannot be denied that too little alcohol spoils the taste of the beverage; but if Congress would decrease the tax on beer to three dollars a barrel, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>irrespective of alcoholic content, then beer could be sold at five cents a glass and at ten cents a bottle, the consumption of it would increase, and the tax receipts would be greater.</p>
   <p>Max Henius also takes up the saloon problem in his pamphlet. He believes that most of the evils of the saloon can be removed by abolishing the bar. Now we do not wish to deny that drinking at the bar has increased the abuse of alcohol. However, we cannot do away with this evil by the merely mechanical process of eliminating the bar. The Chicago city council has provided ample regulations for saloons, yet these regulations do not cover the worst evil, the sale of intoxicants to minors and to inebriated persons. One could even say that the ordinances promote this evil. For instance, it is a well-known fact that any saloonkeeper who is deprived of his license because of flagrant violations of liquor laws may take out a license in the name of a "dummy". The procedure involves no difficulty whatever if he has a political pull.</p>
   <p>The rule that saloons must close at one o'clock in the morning on weekdays and at two o'clock on Sunday mornings shows results that are altogether different <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>from those which the authors of the law intended to gain. The rule in itself is foolish because in a large city like Chicago there are thousands of people who are obliged to work after midnight, such as bartenders, waiters, musicians, actors, cooks, employees of local transportation companies or railroads, and others. Why should these people be deprived of the privilege of taking a drink after they have finished their daily work? They acquire the right to do so by organizing clubs that really are not clubs and by patronizing speakeasies. And it is unnecessary to prove that such conditions are conducive to corruption.</p>
   <p>In one word, the regulation of our entire liquor business is still in a very bad way. Exorbitant taxes on beer and distilled liquors encourage the smuggling of whiskey and illegitimate liquor sales. That is one of the fundamental evils. Another consists in the mechanical regulation of saloons, which is too narrow-minded on the one hand and on the other hand ignores the most important factors, such as the character, the reputation, and the past life of licensees.</p>
   <p>It is absolutely necessary that the proper authorities shall thoroughly revise <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>our liquor laws. Millions of dollars have been invested in the liquor business, and millions of dollars change hands through the manufacture, purchase, and sale of intoxicating beverages. The liquor traffic is one of our most important branches of commerce, and reasonable taxation and regulation of it are an absolute necessity.</p>
