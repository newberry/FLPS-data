   <p>Karl Heinzen has issued, according to the Cinc. Volkefreund, a pamphlet in English, in which he denounces those Germans who feel happy over the victory of Germany in the war with France, (i. E. 999,999 out of every million), as infamous scoundrels and perjured traitors to the American Republic, and makes propaganda for a nativist crusade against them. Poor old fool! who has demonstrated, in himself, the two categories in which he otherwise divides all humanity. For many years he has been a scoundrel, and now he has become an ass in addition.</p>
