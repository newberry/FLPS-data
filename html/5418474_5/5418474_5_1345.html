   <p>The newspapers of cities on the Eastern Seaboard are still preoccupied with Cuba. Reports are published that war preparations are in full swing in all harbors, and that President Grant intends to embroil the United States in a war with Spain because of Cuba; that the President desires to bring this about, in order to be elected for the third time.</p>
   <p>Although the Constitution of the United States provides that only Congress may declare war, yet, as a matter of fact, any president can, by resorting to diplomatic subterfuges, create a condition which leaves no alternative to Congress but to declare war.</p>
   <p>Thus Tyler inveigled the country into a war with Mexico; and similarly, Grant would be able to conjure up a fight with Spain. <span class="page-break">2</span>If that is his intention, he will find strong support throughout the nation, which may be summed up in a few words: "Anything for a change!"</p>
   <p>The times are bad; business is at a standstill. There is no dearth of money, but opportunities for profitable and safe investment are non-existent.</p>
   <p>The thought that war might instill life into business and bring money into circulation is attractive even to otherwise sensible and sober people. The idea becomes doubly attractive as each day brings renewed proof that the business trend is still downward, as it has been ever since the great crash of 1873. To be sure, the result of such a war, and its effect upon the nation, is a problem about which no one seems to have a clear idea. The simplest answer is the casual remark: "Well, it can't be worse!"</p>
   <p>There are no signs, however, of either a genuine sympathy for the Cubans or an actual desire for the annexation of Cuba.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>One hears and reads about the Spanish atrocities in Cuba without manifesting more interest than one does in the Japanese-Korean hostilities. If a war could be provoked between the United States and Cuba, it would be fully as flagrant and conscienceless as the Franco-Prussian conflict in 1870.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, America has no lack of Laguerronieres and Cassagnacs to agitate for war.</p>
   <p>Even the Chicago Tribune has, during the last eight days, been calling its readers' attention to the "probable necessity" of a war with Spain.</p>
   <p>Well, in a few days we will hear the annual message of the President and it will give us a detailed account of his plans and intentions. If Grant merely repeats his former indefinite phrases about Cuban conditions, then they will soon be forgotten in the rush and confusion which now prevails in Congress, since our political parties regard the impending session as a prelude to the presidential election.</p>
