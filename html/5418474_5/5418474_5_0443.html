   <p>The transport ship, Tuscania, was sunk on the coast of Ireland. It is the first time a large number of American soldiers were victims of such a catastrophe. The whole nation is deeply grieved. Although, from the very first hour America declared war, such tragic news was expected, when the great danger to which the war brought American manhood, appeared for the first time, not as a possibility but a fierce fact, only then did we realize how close we were to this war in far away countries. That the catastrophe is not as large as was given out in the first reports, is meaningless. It will always remain, in history, as America's first loss in a sea battle in the effort to reach the slaughter fields of Europe. These young men who lost their lives in the icy waves of the sea, without having been able to use their arms for the protection of their country and people, deserve the same honorable memory as those who are yet to die as victims on the war field.</p>
   <p>The whole nation stands united and compact"?&gt;in its express of deepest grief, which this first catastrophe has awakened. If ever more evidence is needed to prove <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that war makes no difference in the individual parts of a great nation, the coincidence of these sacrificed young men came from Wisconsin and Michigan, two states which are thickly populated by Germans would fully prove it.</p>
   <p>Among those to whom the sinking of the Tuscania means more than a grieving calamity of the whole country, among those, in whose families, throught this tragedy, fathers and sons were lost, a great number are of German descent. Therefore, the voices should be silenced, which are still and, perhaps, more than ever, attacking the solidity of the nation with their continuous suspicion, harming and attacking the citizens of German descent.</p>
