   <p>A few weeks ago, the members of the Architects' Association in New York City swore a solemn oath not to use any more building material in the future which have the stamp "Made in Germany". Soon afterwards there arrived in New York a shipment of several million dollars worth of toys which were manufactured in Germany, and had been detained in Holland because of the war. Several buyers refused to accept the merchandise; others declared that they would be willing to sell the goods shipped to them, but would turn over any profit which might eventuate to the Red Cross. Only a very few had the courage to state that they could not see anything less patriotic in dealing in German toys than in dealing in materials made in Japan--as long as the same product was not manufactured in sufficient quantities here in the United States. Attitudes of this sort, however, had the same effect, in certain circles of our superpatriots, as a spark in a powder barrel. There immediately sprang into existence "committees" of women afflicted with patriotic hysteria. These committees made it their business <span class="page-break">\2</span>to protect the souls of American children from the demoralization which would surely result from the use of Hun-made drums, hobbyhorses, Noah's Arks, and paintboxes. And in order to give this insanity a more substantial basis, these females expressed a fear that these toys were germ carriers and poisonous; and would cause an epidemic among American children. They went so far in fighting the German toy peril that they had to appear before a United States District Attorney in New York and give assurance that they would keep within the law.</p>
   <p>But these women and their blind hatred are not exceptional, as can be seen from a bill which was introduced last Monday in the United States Senate by Senator Lodge, Roosevelt's "pal". The bill specifies that dealers in merchandise made in Germany and Austria-Hungary must post a sign over the entrance of their business establishemnts reading, "Dealer in German Merchandise," and must display these words in bold type in all their public advertisements. Whether this attempt by Senator Lodge to discriminate against certain businessmen within the American world of trade will actually bring about all the damage and disadvantages which the author of the proposed bill visualizes, seems more than questionable.</p>

   <p>"How many people," it was recently asked in a Magazine, "would stick to their resolution never again to purchase a piece of merchandise 'made in Germany', if the life of a beloved child could only be saved by a medicine invented and manufactured by German medical science? Are physicians going to refuse treatment to hundreds and thousands of persons afflicted with venereal diseases, if a well-known German remedy could restore their health? Will our manufacturers be willing to do without those hundreds of colorfast German dyes if their competitors are using them and thereby securing an advantage in the world market? Are people with poor eyesight willing to forego an improvement of their vision just because the prescribed glasses and lenses come from Germany? And who would have the heart to deprive the little child of its enjoyment of its little doll just because the doll was made in Germany?</p>
   <p>"The federal government, through its highest officials, has time and again declared itself against a war after the war, which evidently could only mean an economic war. It has realized that such a war is not dependent upon <span class="page-break">\4</span>sympathies and antipathies but merely upon the sober facts of the price range and quality of goods in demand, and on raw material. We are going to continue to get our potash from Germany if its use will be of benefit to our agriculture and if it cannot be obtained elsewhere or cannot be obtained for as low a price. We are going to continue to buy raw materials, chemicals, scientific instruments, etc. from Germany if our industry needs them to remain in competition with the world market."</p>
   <p>The American Defense Society could not have better demonstrated its inability to take facts into consideration than by its second proclamation this week, demanding that all German products be boycotted. "We have," this particular circular says, "three hundred branches in various parts of the country, which will assist us, as before, in driving German goods completely from the market and in keeping them off the market in the future."</p>
   <p>The attitude which is revealed in actions of this sort contradicts the ideals in defense of which we entered the war--freedom, justice, and democracy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>To realize this program we must renounce all the antagonism and contempt with which we have judged every action of the enemy since the beginning of the war. We will have to get rid of the apostles of hate like Lodge, Roosevelt, Root, and others. If, as was intended, our government is going to supply the defeated enemy with foodstuffs just as it has our allied friends, then it also seems just that we give our former enemies an opportunity honestly to earn the bread which we give them.</p>
   <p>Only a peace without hate,and one which promotes world reconciliation, will make a renewed appeal to arms impossible for a long time to come.</p>
