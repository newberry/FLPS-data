   <p>"Craft," the term usually applied to extortion and surreptitious payments to politicians for favors, appears to be epidemical here in Chicago. The four chaps who robbed the Washington Park National Bank have admitted such a far-reaching conspiracy, involving an alliance 'twixt bandits, the police, and politicians, that their attorney declined to be associated with the case. He did not consider himself able to defend such a criminal horde. If this is the truth, then the facts must be hair-raising indeed, if an American lawyer refuses to face a tribunal for his client. Usually they long for sensational proceedings and the opportunity to establish a reputation, which, <span class="page-break">\2</span>in turn produces a lucrative practice.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, there is a deeper problem beneath this crime wave, which induces even the officials in the City Hall to supply themselves with handy shooting irons. The present frigid season's stiriated environment, a customary and inevitable adjunct to our unemployment situation, tends to induce a greater participation in criminal pursuits, but whether this explains the basic cause for the present conspiracy, still lacks confirmation. The investigation may prove it, and perhaps not.</p>
   <p>One reason, but by no means the only one, is to be found in the persistent prodding of our police, which produces feverish activities in behalf of our <span class="page-break">\3</span>Sunday ordinances; the accomplishments of our illustrious Mayor, and, because of the incessant chase after the "Fox-trot" and other evils now absorbing the attention of the entire enforcement officers, who are doomed to procure the "salvation" for our solid or rather, wobbling citizenry, no time is available to provide for the bodily protection of the burglars. It is by no means a singular instance that prohibition begets crime.</p>
   <p>Chicago, however, is not the only city which might complain about graft. The entire Nation is afflicted with this pestilence.</p>
   <p>That the munition manufacturers maintain an excellent lobby to espouse their war equipment plans to the press and elsewhere, is common knowledge; lurid even to the most humble humans. And if it were possible to peruse the <span class="page-break">\4</span>diverse books of the noble gentry, then quite a few disconcerting items might appear, somewhat different than the stolen check stubs of Mister von Papen.</p>
   <p>The "military graft," a nomenclature one might apply, thrives luxuriantly. When the preliminary excitement about the preparedness propaganda subsides, and the hot heads cool off, a prolific array of discoveries may be presented.</p>
   <p>There is also a "pacific graft." For this we cannot give a suitable German translation because it does not exist in the German language. [Verbatim. What about Friedensschwindelkumpane? Transl.] Annent this pacific graft, one gathers interesting information through the amusing, satirical dissertations by Carolyn Wilson, popular correspondent of the Chicago Tribune, <span class="page-break">\5</span>reporting from Haag, Holland.</p>
   <p>That Peace-dreamer Henry Ford, loaded a nice horde of crooks on his tranquility ship, "Oscar II." This consignment is not inferior to our own Chicago brand, and in regard to rascality and meanness it may even be superior. Just a few choice selections:</p>
   <p>A member of the pacifist delegates or "Peacer," as Carolyn Wilson dubs him, owed $75 to a Stockholm Hotel; expenses incurred long ago. The fellow's audacity was fabulous. He felt no compunctions in presenting the bill to Ford, as well as a demand for advance payments for an extra journey to one of the warring nations.</p>
   <p>Another "advocate of pacifism" falsified a check for $40. The manager paid.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>A third "quiescence candidate" cheated a poor waiter at a Copenhagen restaurant. He gave him a worthless $5 Confederate note; the old shin-plaster variety. Mr. Ford's manager shelled out.</p>
   <p>A fourth "pace vobiscum adherent" ordered a most fragrant dinner and elusive, aromatic wine for six persons; not content, he was base enough to write a bogus check, using the name of one of the most influential ladies of the "Armistice Expedition." The manager provided the shekels.</p>
   <p>But, the "females" of this wonderful, heterogeneous "Brotherly Love Association," were not of better stock, not much, to be explicit. No check manipulations <span class="page-break">\7</span>appear; evidently it was too bothersome. The harbingers of harmony-- doves--simplified matters considerably. They drove in expensive cars, visited the most exclusive shops and ordered the most stunning gowns. The manager dug into his pockets.</p>
   <p>Of course, auto rides, by all means. Were they not "guests" of the famous car manufacturer? Thus, they felt no reluctance in making most extensive tours, and upon returning to their quarters, they merely remarked to the hotel clerk: Please add it to Ford's bill. - and the manager provided the "wherewithal."</p>
   <p>In the various hostelries, revels were held 'till dawn, verily the "Peacers" fared well. The bills, properly seasoned, were presented to the manager. And he paid, But the greatest impertinence was perpetrated by an adventurous <span class="page-break">\8</span>youth who idled away the fleeting moments, loitering casually and purposeless on the dock, gazing at the departing Oscar II, Ford's floating freedom for foreigners. An inspiration overpowered him. He sailed on the next steamer - at Ford's expense. Arriving in Christiania, he introduced himself to the magnate of the horseless buggies, as a reporter of a well-known New York morning paper. Later it was shown that the scoundrel never wrote a line, except a few advertisements for the movies.</p>
   <p>It does not require a keen imagination to understand that the good natured Ford finally sickened - the"peace rabble" did not agree with his constitution - and he returned home suddenly.</p>
   <p>That ended it. No dinners, wine, liquors nor auto trips for the "war abolitionists, <span class="page-break">\9</span>"the good-will to man" birds had to scramble for their own. The "peace graft" flopped.</p>
   <p>But, is it not an outrage and a disgrace if the most benign intentions, and, after all, that is what peace overtures are, should thus be ruthlessly exploited? The highwayman is fair, if compared with such abominable examples of the human race - both genders.</p>
   <p>And again we will hear the old adage: "True Americanism!" When tolls the hour, announcing the American people's liberation from such vultures who besmirch the honor of the Nation? Where is the Hercules who cleans the vast, filthy Augean stable! Here is the opportune place for our reform craving public benefactors to apply their levers.</p>
