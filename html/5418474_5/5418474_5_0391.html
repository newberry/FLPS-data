   <p>The bill which gives the government the power to conscript all males between the ages of eighteen and forty-five (excepting, of course, enemy aliens and nationals of neutral countries) passed the House last Saturday by a vote of 336 to two.</p>
   <p>That makes it practically "unanimous". But it does not mean that our representatives, virtually without exception, like the idea of "field service" for our "boys" of eighteen and nineteen, or that they approve, on principle, the drafting of these very young people for the hardest service--a service which calls for the greatest sacrifice [i. e., of life itself] on the part of young people who have, as yet, no voice in the affairs of their country. It is well known that many members of Congress <span class="page-break">\2</span>are against conscription of persons that have not yet reached the voting age. Many expressed their disapproval quite frankly, and we do not suppose that the arguments of the advocates of "conscription of boys" can convince them that they are wrong. When, in spite of their disapproval, they voted for the bill, they did so against their fundamental principles and personal convictions. They yielded, not so much to the pressure of the military authorities--as did one prominent House member, who justified his vote for the "man-power bill" on that account--,nor did they yield for reasons of necessity; they yielded, rather, because they were convinced of the advisability and expediency of a great and immediate effort. They realized that America's purpose in this war--the overthrow of the military autocracy in Germany and the conclusion of a quick, just, and democratic peace--could be accomplished more quickly, if all of America's war power could be speedily Mobilized and made available for the struggle. They felt that the only possible end of the war--the victory of America and the democratic idea--could be realized more quickly, the greater <span class="page-break">\3</span>America's efficiency and the sooner her full military strength could be thrown into the scales.</p>
   <p>If one has decided, after careful deliberation, on a certain course of action, then it is best to follow it through with every effort, in order to reach the goal safely and as quickly as possible. This applies to nations as well as to individuals. Hesitation increases the danger and prolongs the "ride", thereby, also, causing the sacrifices [of life] and the expenditures to mount.</p>
   <p>The greater the effort, the smaller the danger and the quicker the purpose can be accomplished. The adoption of the conscription bill will enable the government to increase the man-power of the American armies, within twelve months, to about five million. Experience has shown that it is possible to have three million men at the European battlefronts within a year. Perhaps, then, the ruling masters of Germany will realize how hopeless their cause is and will decide to put an end to this horrible slaughter. Or, <span class="page-break">\4</span>possibly, the masses of the German people will realize that they are fighting for a lost cause--a cause that is not their own but that of their masters--and will decide to liberate the German people from an unworthy and fatal class rule. In either case, we would have a democratic peace and the accomplishment of America's purpose in the war would be hastened and the sacrifice of human lives lessened by the adoption of the "man-power bill". If they will not listen to reason over there, then it will be possible--thanks to the conscription of all those between eighteen and forty-five that can bear arms--to break the military power of the high and mighty [German despots]. Even in that case, peace will come sooner and the necessary sacrifice will be smaller than it would be if America were to proceed at a slower pace and dish out its man-power by the spoonful, so to speak.</p>
   <p>To keep the bloody sacrifice [of lives] within bounds--that is why the House unanimously voted for the "conscription of young blood" and all <span class="page-break">\5</span>able bodied men up to the age of forty-five; that is why the government decided for this measure. The administration is not war-mad. President Wilson and his associates are well aware of the anxiety and worries of the fathers and others of the "boys", who, in their early youth, are asked to shoulder this heavy duty. They are peace-loving, as peace-loving as any mother could be. They decided on this apparently severe measure, because it will hasten the return of peace and end the war; because it will prevent many thousands--tens and hundreds of thousand--of young people, sixteen or even fourteen years of age, from giving up their lives on the battlefield.</p>
   <p>The "conscription" of the eighteen-, nineteen-,and twenty-year-olds is a war measure against war. It will find its natural end when this war is ended.</p>
