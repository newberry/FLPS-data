   <p>The present administration has great plans for social and economic legislation, which will afford the masses of the people a greater measure of security in life. For a long century and a half, the American slogan has been: "Help thy self". In Europe, on the other hand, responsibility for the security of life has been for many years given over to the state, in a not inconsiderable degree. This, in Europe, took the form of so-called "Social insurance," in the gradual introduction of which Germany has been the pacemaker. Germany was the first to introduce state insurance for the sick and aged--a measure intended to put upon a partially secure basis the existence of the individual member of society. Although the system was later enlarged, its purpose was attained only imperfectly, chiefly because the means at the authorities' disposal did not come up to such a level as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to exclude all want. In most cases, aid was given in putting a temporary halt to want, but rarely beyond that. At any rate, Germany was a pioneer in social legislation.</p>
   <p>Other countries emulated Germany's example in protecting their nationals, as much as possible, against the consequences of disease and reduced working capacity in old age. And, all that time, America remained true to its old principle. It gave to everyone--at least theoretically--the same opportunity to pursue happiness, but at the same time made it the individual's own responsibility to provide enough to live on in the days of sickness and old age. There were, instead, private insurance companies which, for a specified premium insured anyone against possible loss of earnings caused by disease or accident. That this was not sufficient is simply because the small man, with a small income, is not in a position to pay the premiums required to give him security against all imaginable misfortunes that might throw him into want.</p>

   <p>The American principle that everyone must look out for himself received a fatal blow at the time of the great crash of 1929, with its resulting unemployment for more than ten million workers. For the first time, the authorities of local, state, and federal governments see themselves face to face with the necessity of giving direct aid to the unemployed of the land. That aid has already cost considerable sums, and will cost much more. Unemployment, and the want that goes with it, affecting as it does a large number of people, is the result of a battered economic structure. President Roosevelt and his administration are at present at work to reconstruct it. It is, however, not enough to reconstruct our economic life, it is just as necessary to secure the new structure against a repetition of the collapse, in the light of recent experiences.</p>
   <p>The social and economic program of the President strives to attain that. It is, for the time being, not yet known in full, but we may count on it, with some assurance, that it is going to reach out and include security for our fellow citizens against the perils of unemployment, sickness, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>accidents, and old age. First of all, the new congress will have to deal with the introduction of unemployment insurance. Enjoyment of its fruits will be reserved for those who may become unemployed in the future. For the present unemployed, the kind of aid given until now will be continued for the duration of existing conditions. The administration assumes that the public works already begun or contemplated will contribute a great deal toward removing the economic depression. What is to be the next project in the field of social legislation remains to be seen. It is the opinion of many that the administration is planning some sort of old-age insurance, but the details of this plan have not yet been agreed upon by those responsible for it.</p>
   <p>In this connection, the plan of Dr. F. E. Townsend of California has been recently very much discussed. At first sight, it looks very fantastic; competent economists will have to make careful experiments to test its applicability. Townsend's idea is that the United States should pay every law-abiding citizen a monthly pension of $200 from the time he is sixty <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>years old. In exchange, the person takes upon himself the obligation to renounce all gainful occupation from that moment on, and to spend his entire pension within a month. The number of old citizens who would thus become pensionable is, according to the creator of the plan, about eight million. If each of them should receive $200 a month, it would cost a billion and a half monthly, or eighteen billions a year. According to Townsend, the government would have to create a revolving fund of a billion and a half, which would renew itself every month from a sales tax to be created. In this manner, the entire plan needs only one single expenditure of a billion and a half by the government to become permanently workable. Whether his figures are correct will have to be verified. It is by no means a trivial matter to accumulate a billion and a half every month by means of a sales tax.</p>
   <p>Townsend believes that, by accepting his plan, unemployment would be as good as done away with, for, says he, every pensioner is compelled to spend $200 a month; this would provide work for one person, and eight <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>million pensioners would thus provide eight million jobs. Further, he thinks that, of the eight million oldsters eligible for a pension, at least four million would give up their jobs, which would give employment to four million unemployed. Thus, his plan would give work to twelve million unemployed, who would be placed in a position to earn a living and so become potential buyers. To them he would add the eight million old men and women who will have to spend a billion and a half each month for the products of the soil and of industry. Townsend is firm in his opinion that his plan would insure continuous economic activity in the whole country, and end all the phenomena attending unemployment or resulting from it. It would reclaim from idleness persons who are healthy and able to work, and would give work-worn oldsters a complacent evening of life. The plan is quite intriguing, and it would by all means pay to test it for its practicability.</p>
   <p>Hand in hand with unemployment and old-age insurance there should go insurance against disease and accidents, and also against permanent <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>disability. In these fields, we are not concerned with capital insurance, but with the assurance of certain benefits in each individual case. At any rate, in order to make payment possible, a considerable sum of money would be required. The capital will probably be secured through contributions from the insured. These contributions will certainly be a burden upon employees and employees as well, perhaps even upon the state. Since, however, security against all life's hazards is of equal importance to all three who share the expense, the American people will shoulder this additional economic overhead without protesting. Of course, all types of insurance will have to maintain themselves from their own receipts, save only old-age insurance. The greatest of the problems, however, will be to keep the whole enterprise clear from the influence of politics, free from corruption and graft. For this very reason, the federal government should take over the administration, because it is easier to exercise control from one central point than from forty-eight or more scattered ones.</p>

   <p>It is not difficult to realize how deeply the social legislation planned by Roosevelt may affect the country's economic life and the lives of a large part of the American people.</p>
