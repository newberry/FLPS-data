   <p>The Administration's plan to launch a social legislation has apparently met with the universal approval of the press. It seems that even those papers which on general principles disprove and combat everything that comes from Washington can no longer hide themselves from the realization that social insurance in one form or another is necessary, and that the enaction of such laws can no longer be delayed. It is quite reasonable that such laws represent a far-reaching intercession in the economic life. This intercession, however, is by far not as deep and as thorough going as is generally supposed. That a large number of states have already adopted a form of social insurance must not be overlooked.</p>
   <p>The plans of the Administration, therefore, will serve to expand and to unify those already in existence. As the President declared, the payment of compensations to unemployed is to be made by the states and regulated by state legislations. The Federal Government, however, retains the right to withdraw and to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>administer the money. The Republican minority points out that this centralization is incompatible with the democratic theory of the sovereignty of the states, which Roosevelt emphasized in the election campaign.</p>
   <p>This objection is justified. It would undoubtedly be better if the states retained absolute autonomy as regards social insurance, but that cannot be carried out. During the years of the depression it became apparent that in many instances the states had conducted the management in an irresponsible manner and had quite thoughtlessly incurred colossal debts. The citizens allowed themselves to be persuaded by the politicians to vote in favor of enormous debentures in the form of bonds which, as the situation stood, were by no means justified. Then, in the lean years that followed, the incomes from taxes decreased, and many of the states no longer could pay the interests.</p>
   <p>Accordingly these states were not in a position to raise the means necessary for the support of the unemployed, and consequently it was necessary for the Federal Government to go to work with its own aid. While conditions of this kind do not <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>exist in all states, they are typical of many, and the President would be foolish and unmindful of his duty if he failed to insist that the management of the funds for the unemployed be reserved for the Federal Government. It is true that social legislation will cost a great deal of money, but it should be remembered that the persons who are later to derive their means for a living from this insurance may not be left to go hungry. Today they receive the dole and later they will receive insurance money. This may be more costly to the public in general, but it is more akin to the views which exist today among civilized nations.</p>
