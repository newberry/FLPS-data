   <p>"The situation is more dangerous then ever." "The 'Lusitania' question is settled and the danger of a diplomatic severance between America and Germany has been averted." Screaming headlines, all akin to the old devination: He loves me, he loves me not; a pleasant sort of diversion offered at least half a dozen times within the past nine months. It has become tiresome. Although our world press and others worked mightily to sustain and possibly further arouse popular interest by resorting to ominous forebodings and dire descriptions of the new crisis, the majority of people showed an ever-increasing apathy at each recurring citation of calamity. Yesterday's dispatch, the last frightening firecracker, reads in part: "Germany refuses to admit that the sinking of the 'Lusitania' was illegal; a rupture is unavoidable, if the administration insists upon its demands." It blew away like the acrid smoke of fulminating powder, a frightful failure, in so far as its fear-creating function was concerned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Today we note how inherently right the public was by maintaining its poise. There is no danger. The "Lusitania" affair definitely lost its perilous aspect and in the future will not even suffice as a "bogey man" for big and little babies, nor as a trump card in the political game. When the German government spoke its last word, it compelled the hands to be shown, and thereby ended the "bluff."</p>
   <p>Washington has not yet expressed itself in regard to Germany's staunch refusal to classify the sinking of the "Lusitania" as an overt illegal act.</p>
   <p>All doubt has been dispelled. Of course, there will be conferences and arguments about the exact phraseology but finally a mutually satisfactory solution will appear. That this question may lead to a break between American and Germany is utterly impossible. No one wants it; neither the American nor the German government. If American statesmen desired such a breach to realize their demands, they will find it convenient to desist; otherwise it will invoke a grappling with the obvious dilemma: the blunt fact that governmental ideas do not represent popular opinions, and it is <span class="page-break">3</span>evident that this would be bad business. After all, an overwhelming majority of our citizens wish to see a continuance of our friendly relations with Germany, and undoubtedly will not consider Germany's non-compliance as sufficient cause for a severance of diplomatic negotations. The greater part of the population considers it a grave injustice to insist upon such a statement from Germany and will define it as an official crime against the American people, because the nation does not sanction the conduct of the administration. It will arouse the citizens to appeal to Congress to halt the proceedings.</p>
   <p>Our leaders have no such intentions, being far too prudent. They have, according to insinuations and appearances pointing that way, used the "Lusitania" matter to bolster their international diplomacy and may now be fully appeased with their accomplishments, having obtained all the concessions which could possibly be asked for from Germany. Now it is politically expedient to stop, and that will be done. That our government was not able to glorify itself by dictating and bringing about the acceptance of new international laws in the midst of a World War, after all, was a preconceived certainty and no fairly sane person will offer any <span class="page-break">4</span>criticism because this ideology was frustrated.</p>
   <p>Most of our real Americans will be grateful if the bickering with the German ambassador ceases, when acceptable interpolations have been propounded which are suitable to all, and face-saving to both parties, thus settling the "Lusitania" episode.</p>
   <p>The public has been throughly exhausted by this theme and the subsequent incessant haggling.</p>
