   <p>If we can believe the contradictory reports from Washington, the peace negotiations will start action today. They will get in touch with the representatives of the interested parties. The United States will be represented by John Lind, the unsuccessful special envoy of President Wilson. At the same time we get news from Berlin from the pen of Maximilian Harden regarding our Mexican politics. We must endorse his viewpoint, which is, that the acceptance of the American peace negotiations means a great victory for Latin-America. The United States has lowered itself and President Wilson has studied the wrong methods, as there is no doubt that the prestige of the United States has lost much in its policy of "Watchful Waiting" about Mexico. The Government should have its entire plans ready for either the success or the failure of this peace conference.</p>
   <p>We suppose that President Wilson has accepted these humiliating peace plans in order to show the world that no means should be spared to settle <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the episode in a peaceful manner. What, however, will be the next step if the Peace Commission fails? Nobody wants war but, sooner or later the Mexican affair will have to be settled for good, and it would be better now, than later.</p>
