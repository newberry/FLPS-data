   <p>It is reported that last Saturday the German Government received a note which stated that the Peace Treaty would not be in effect as long as Germany failed to comply with the obligations and terms of the Armistice, and to live up to "other agreements" made. According to a report, this note was accompanied by a "protocol," giving a detailed account of what was demanded of Germany.</p>
   <p>During the last twelve months the history of the world has been enriched by many infamies. But this protocol (and the note it accompanies) seems to be the apex of shamelessness and impudence--the most brutal rape of right and good faith, the most brazen travesty on justice, civilization, and human rights that could possibly be conceived.</p>
   <p>What all the world--let us say the decent and reasonable part of humanity-- had suspected for a long time, but refused to believe--believing it seemed to be tantamount to giving up hope and losing respect for the governments and nations which claim to be the vanguard of civilization--is now openly and with brutal frankness flaunted before all mankind by this note and protocol. The German people, who put down their arms in good faith because they believed in our promises, are to be tormented and driven to desperation by infamous and ever-increasing demands, giving us a chance to annihilate them completely, unless they prefer suicide.</p>
   <p>All the demands listed in the protocol are brutal injustices aimed at a helpless and starving Germany. But the pinnacle of effrontery is the demand that Germany replace the German warships scuttled at Scapa Flow by other naval units still in her possession, or by turning over "floating docks," dredges, trawlers, and cranes.</p>
   <p>The brazenness of this demand is quite obvious, because there is not even a shadow of justification for it. The scuttled German warships for which substitution is demanded were lying in British waters within range of British guns; they were under British, not German sovereignty. The German Government had no jurisdiction over them whatsoever. They had been taken away from the German people--and now, since they were lost while under foreign protection, the German people are to pay for them! Nothing more idiotic has ever been conceived, nothing more brazen has ever been concocted to promote an infamous objective.</p>
   <p>The report from Washington referred to above starts as follows: "In a note by the Allied and Associated Powers, Germany was informed," etc. We hope this version is incorrect. It leads to the conclusion that America too, was behind this note (and the enclosed protocol), because America always has been and still is called a power "associated" with the Allies. But in spite of all that has happened, it is hardly conceivable that America should be a partner to this new, unprecedented effrontery. It is hard to believe that she will let the others get away with it.</p>
   
   <p>For the sake of her self-respect and honorable reputation among nations, America must not, by silently condoning it, to say nothing of supporting it, allow this latest impudence of the Allies to be carried out. On behalf of the future of all Europe and the whole civilized world, America must protest against this rape, which, if carried out, will lead to desperation.</p>
