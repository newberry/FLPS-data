   <p>The German ambassador, Dr. Friederich Wilhelm von Prittwitz, and Gaffron, spoke at the opening of the University of Syracuse, N. Y., in regard to the development of international citizenship, and challenged America to step out of its isolation and to participate actively in world happenings. The thought of world citizenship belongs undoubtedly to the future - and our future belongs to it.</p>
   <p>In spite of all political misery in the world, the entire development trends firmly towards a consolidation of international relations. What would have been an impossibility 15 years ago, is today openly desired as an ideal condition by all leading statesmen of the New and the Old World. More than one refers in his speeches to the united states of Europe.</p>
   <p>The Pan-American conference held last year in the United States, plainly proved that in spite of difficulties, North and South America form a closed phalanx outwardly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>In Asia and Eastern Europe a similar development, under the leadership of Moscow, is noticeable. Even in darkest Africa exists, something like a black union, which, for the first time was noticed several years ago at the Negro Conference at Paris, arranged by the French Government, when the black gentlemen criticized the French Government in an unfriendly manner on account of French colonization methods.</p>
   <p>All these movements, in regard to uniting mutual interests, are signs of the times, which are based upon the speed with which nations and races today exchange opinions, wishes and purposes. The joining of continental unions of interests leads more than might be expected to intercontinental differences. Not so many single nations battle any more for the acquisition of markets, but more and more and more whole continents strive to fight for acquisition - there-fore the battle, because of the competitors' increase in size, requires more harshness and keenness.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances, unifications and settlements are naturally more difficult to arrange, and therefore obtain a more far reaching importance than those, which today, belong to the past. When therefore the German ambassador <span class="page-break">3</span>recommends that America step out of its isolation, he invites us to an internationalism which America, for reasons of real politics under present conditions, can hardly join. This internationalism distinguishes itself in such a way, that outwardly it strives for connections, of which inwardly the nations and races do not possess a sufficient understanding. This is one of the reasons for the American pacifists, although representing the aims and desires of the majority of the people, often being forced to play a ridiculous role. Pacifism and real world citizenship can only be built up by practical understanding.</p>
   <p>Apart from all political difficulties of the world, such as a race of armaments and battles of competitions, the positive approach of a titanic fight between the Western and Eastern communistic world - which in all probability would develop into a fight to the finish - must be considered, and therefore, America, at the present time, can win only through its splendid isolation.</p>
