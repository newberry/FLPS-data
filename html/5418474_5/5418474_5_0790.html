   <p>[Translator's note: These resolutions were adopted by a number of prominent Germans from all walks of life at a conference held in Washington on January 30. They are referred to in an article of February 4, 1915, also translated.]</p>
   <p>Whereas, The spirit of absolute neutrality toward foreign nations engaged in war constitutes a fundamental policy of the American people, which to maintain is not only a privilege but a duty; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, It has become evident in the course of recent events that this highly regarded attitude has been endangered by foreign control of our news service and our overseas connections; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Our commerce and our citizens have been subjected to violations of the principles of international law; and</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Whereas, The ships of our country as well as those of other neutral nations, carrying property of United States citizens, have been detained on the high seas by a belligerent power, convoyed to her ports, and there subjected to an investigation and search causing delay and damage; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Citizens of these United States as well as those of other nations with whom we enjoy friendly relations have been forcibly taken from board, without regard for the protection which they enjoy under the American flag, and have been detained in prisons and concentration camps; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Merchandise that was heretofore considered absolutely acceptable for international trade has arbitrarily been declared contraband; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The provisions and regulations of international law pertaining to neutral shipping have been modified or disregarded for the special convenience of a group of belligerent powers, to the obvious disadvantage of the United States as a neutral nation, which as such enjoys rights that are entitled to <span class="page-break">\3</span>respect; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The shipment of arms, ammunition, and other war material is unneutral in character under the present circumstances and being contrary to America's ideals and code of ethics is likely to prolong the war and is [therefore] incompatible with our national prayers for peace; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, This situation has become intolerable for all Americans who believe in the principles of neutrality, fairness, and friendship for all nations equally, and who believe in the sublime mission of this country as the advocate of peace and the champion of justice and human rights; therefore, in order to restore genuine American neutrality and to render America free from all commercial, financial, and political subservience to foreign powers, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we, citizens of the United States, ally ourselves for the creation of a national organization of which the aims and purposes may be <span class="page-break">\4</span>designated as follows:</p>
   <p>1) We advocate an American cable, controlled by the United States Government, to insure an independent and unbiased news service;</p>
   <p>2) We demand freedom of the seas for United States commerce and unimpeded transit for all goods which are not considered contraband by the rules of international law;</p>
   <p>3) As a truly American policy we advocate the immediate enactment of laws prohibiting the export of arms, munitions, and war material;</p>
   <p>4) We favor the creation of an American merchant marine; and</p>
   <p>5) We pledge ourselves, individually or in groups, to support only such candidates for public office, regardless of party affiliation, as shall put American interests above those or any other country, and are willing to do their share to immobilize or keep away any undesirable foreign influence on American affairs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Whereas, The present European war, the greatest in history, is steadily assuming larger proportions, bringing immeasurable misery and grief into this world and claiming countless human lives; and</p>
   <p>Wheareas, The people of this great Republic are raising their voices in fervent prayers for peace; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The United States is unfair to itself in supporting the continuance of this European war in any form or manner; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The United States is ahead of all nations in the principles of humanity and justice even in war; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we, citizens of the United States, assembled in mass meeting, hold that it is the bounden duty of the officers of our Government and of <span class="page-break">\6</span>the servants of the people of the United States to desist from all utterances or actions which are likely to stir up the passions of the various national groups of our country; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the Government [Cabinet] officers of our country be requested to carry out the existing laws, especially those that have a bearing on the present world crisis; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the Congress of the United States be requested to enact immediately Senate Bill 6688, known as the Hitchcock Bill, or else H. R. 377, proposed by Representative Vollmer, which would prohibit the export of arms, war materials, and munitions of any kind, thus maintaining the absolutely neutral position of the United States as first advocated by George Washington; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the people of the United States be requested to carry out this policy of absolute neutrality, favoring no belligerent nation, in complete <span class="page-break">\7</span>co-operation with our Government, and to work for the cessation of any attitude of hostility or partiality with respect to any belligerent nation; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we request the Government to nationalize the manufacture of arms, munitions, and war material, in order to eliminate the disturbing and insidious influence of private business enterprises; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That every citizen of the United States be asked and requested to do everything within his province to work for the restoration of peace; and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we expressly condemn the use of airships as a means of bombing unfortified cities not used for military purposes, since this practice endangers the lives of women, children, and other noncombatants; and be it further</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Resolved, That we request the [State] Department in Washington to convey these resolutions to the representatives of all the belligerent powers as well as to all the neutral nations.</p>
