   <p>It is hardly believable that there are still people among America's Germans who do not quite clearly understand the meaning of that great struggle which our brothers in the old country are fighting, not only for themselves but in the interest of everything German and in behalf of civilization in general. That is why we cannot believe that American citizens of German origin would have the audacity to ask their fellow nationals to sign a petition to the German Kaiser, in which this monarch is implored to stop the war and accept the mediation of President Wilson. But strange as it seems, such a document, written in English (!), seems to be in circulation. It reads as follows: [Translator's note: The text of this petition appears in the Abendpost in English.]</p>
   
   <p>"William, Emperor of Germany (!!),</p>
   <p>King of Prussia. [Exclamation points are the editorial writer's.]</p>
   <p>"We, the undersigned, German citizens and residents of the United States of America, do humbly pray that your august Majesty may be pleased to advise the German Government to accept the mediation of President Wilson and the Washington Government in the interest of a cessation of hostilities in Europe."</p>
   <p>The authors of this document, which is a slap in the face of every true German, apparently do not have the slightest inkling of the real state of affairs; otherwise, they would never have gotten the idiotic idea of approaching the Kaiser with such a request. Their mentality betrays them to be readers of English-language newspapers only, people who have never had a German newspaper in their hands. Otherwise they would have been aware of the fact that in this war there are values at stake for Germany which, once lost, could not be retrieved by the German people in a hundred years. It is rather more probable that the smart-alecky authors cannot read German at all, and never could.</p>
   
   <p>The fact that the petition was written in English gives rise to that suspicion. We wonder if they honestly imagine they can impress the Kaiser with their scribbling. Wilhelm II knows perfectly well what he is doing, and does not have to look for advice to "Germans" who address him in English, and ask him as the head of the German people, to conclude a worthless peace which at best would leave everything as it was before and which, after a short period, would be violated by the vultures in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg.</p>
   <p>Another possibility is that this document was not drawn up at all for the purpose of being sent to its alleged address. The purpose is apparently something totally different. It is so obvious that we have to laugh at the authors' stupidity. That the authors of this petition are to be found only among Germany's enemies, that is, the Anglophile Americans, there cannot be any doubt. The English seem to have come to the conclusion that the anti-German attitude of the local [American] press is not enough, to convince the American people of Albion's just and righteous cause. The proud Britons are getting cold feet and are releasing trial balloons to find out whether they can get out of this whole mess without losing face. The peace articles which appear in "American" newspapers are probably just such feelers, by which German willingness to negotiate is being sounded out. This petition to the German Kaiser, which is supposed to have originated with the German-Americans, was only invented to put a little more pressure behind the whole thing. It is nothing but a clumsy invention designed to fool the American public by making them believe that a certain group of German-Americans would be meek enough to put their names under such a fake petition. But the perpetrators of this fraud will find out that the Germans will not fall for this sort of poppycock. Our German brothers in the old country are fighting a hard battle, and the least they can expect of their fellow Germans living abroad is the co-operation of the latter in this struggle. We are sure they will not be disappointed.</p>
