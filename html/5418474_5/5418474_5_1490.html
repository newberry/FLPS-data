   <p>The State of Pennsylvania is threatened with a potato war. Laymen who consider Idaho potatoes the choicest of this species of tuberous vegetables think that the remote Western state is a first-rate potato state. That may apply in regard to the quality of said tubers, but not in regard to quantity. In the latter respect the states of Maine and Pennsylvania rank first. William Penn's famous old forest state is seriously affected by those laws which Congress passed under pressure, during the last hours of a session that was much too long. The two laws are the coal law and the potato law.</p>
   <p>The coal law, also known as the Guffey Law, provides for a wide control of the soft coal industry of Pennsylvania by the Federal Government. The mining industry of Pennsylvania is exceedingly large, and it is reported that the Guffey Law is very favorably regarded by both the mineowners and the miners. Perhaps they are not yet fully familiar with the provisions of the law, or cannot foresee its effects; perhaps the law is really good. In any event, prospects of enactment prevented threatened strikes by the miners many times. Even now the leaders of the mine workers appear to be willing to postpone the strike, since President Roosevelt has promised to appoint the Coal Commission provided for in the Guffey Law.</p>
   <p>Thus there is at least a prospect that the subjects will be satisfied with the coal law. Matters are different however, in regards to the potato law. The potato growers of Pennsylvania are in open rebellion against it. The potato law is one of those abnormal products of the too fertile mind of our Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace. Probably he himself does not know the contents of this law or what its purpose is. However, it is certain that the purpose of the law is to regulate potato production. The bill consists of about fifteen thousand words, so it is a very voluminous product of agricultural legislation. We do not believe that even one farmer has read it. Even during the winter a farmer has access to reading material that is much more interesting than a law which he cannot understand, though he has read it time and again.</p>
   
   <p>However, it is certain that the law provides for very strict control over the production of potatoes and that it applies to at least three million potato growers. Its object is to increase the price of potatoes by reducing the harvest; but the farmers of Pennsylvania want none of it, and potato growers of New Jersey are also organizing to oppose it. Previously these good farmers had no idea of what Congress was preparing for them. Nor had Congress any idea of what it was doing. The bill of the law was drafted by some southern senators who thought that it would serve certain local interests. Of course, the Department of Agriculture, which rejoices at any kind of regulating, immediately assented, and Congress, which did not know what it was doing during the last hours of its late session, raised no objections whatever. Thus the law came into being. Now the potato growers are preparing to resist it with every means that they can command, and perhaps we shall have a potato war, unless the Supreme Court in the meantime declares the law to be unconstitutional.</p>
