   <p>February 18 will go down in history as a day of great significance. The German Reich, engaged in war with England, was forced to take measures which she never would have adopted, had perfidious Albion not resorted to still more perfidious means of warfare than is her usual custom. Her objective has been, for many years, to isolate the German Reich politically. Once Germany was politically isolated, war was inevitable. The shopkeepers knew that even Russia and France together would never be able to defeat Germany by military means, "But this would not be necessary," the noble experts of British statecraft reasoned. To strive for a military victory is outmoded! We use modern tactics! We'll cut Germany off from the sea and starve her civil population! We rule the waves, and we have the navy to do it, and while we have lots of money to buy any place in the world market, we'll see to it that not a single pound of bread or meat reaches Germany. Of course, international law and agreements stand in the way; foodstuffs and even supplies not directly benefiting the embattled armies, are not to be considered contraband. But what do we care about international regulations! We control the seas and might makes right!</p>
   <p>As a belligerent power, England had to consider other nations, but this consideration proved unnecessary because the nations in question were too small, too weak and too unimportant to waste much time on. What does England care about Switzerland, Holland, or the Scandinavian countries! What could these nations do against that powerful combine of England, Russia, France, Japan and their secret henchmen in the Balkans? It is true that English sentimentalists insisted that England, in this war, was making the supreme sacrifice for the protection of the little nations, but that kind of talk is just so much eyewash to fool simple-minded and hypocritical souls who believe in the dictum: Believe in my words and condone my actions? Where Albion's interests are at stake all other interests count for naught. That's the way we've been doing things ever since we ruled the waves. and that's the way it's going to be, even if the rest of the world should go to pieces!</p>
   <p>There is, England reasoned, only one great nation which we cannot afford to treat quite as brutally. But they are our relatives and we'll manage them. And up to now they have managed us pretty well, we are being jollied along. Today one tells us pleasent things, tomorrow we get a little consolation, and when the week is over, we have whole bushel baskets full of compliments, but still no definite answer to our inquiries. Not a yes or a no. We are being jollied along. It is claimed that this was Turkish policy. Far from it, this policy is English, and the Orientals have adopted it from the British. By virtue of her position as mistress of the sea, perfidious Albion has flouted all international regulations regarding war contraband because there is no power to challenge her. England not only wants to demonstrate her absolute power at sea, but is aiming to force the German Reich to take steps, which would bring the latter into conflict with those neutrals who have already suffered harsh treatment at the hand of Great Britain not having had the courage to raise a protest. Since Germany is now faced with the alternative, either to yield to the most vicious violations of international law or to counteract them, Englands' hypocritical politicians are telling the neutrals with crocodile tears in their eyes, that Germany is making war on them by menacing their shipping. At the same time, if not before, these same politicians have offered a bounty of L 500 for the destruction of every German submarine. For this purpose, the larger cargo vessels and passenger boats have been equipped with sufficient cannon. Accordingly, these steamers are nothing but auxiliary war vessels and can be treated as such. If neutral passengers are on board, it is unwise of them and their own look out. Under no circumstances should they have embarked for the trip. The world was informed since February 4 why Germany had decided on these retaliatory measures and the British Admiralty had advised British merchantmen to fly a neutral flag, which ipso facto would make neutral shipping hazardous and almost impossible in waters designated as war zones.</p>
   
   <p>It would be difficult to find a more virulent perfidy and guile at any time in history than England has seen fit to employ in this war. Her Lord Chancellor frivolously exclaims: The war is costing us ten billion dollars a year! But we've got the dough. We can finance this war for the next five years with the revenues derived from our foreign investments. If that is so, the "pirate" has revealed himself for what he is. If England can squeeze amounts like that from overseas possessions and holdings, we would call it blood money extorted from subjugated peoples like the Arabs, [East] Indians, Africans, and Asiatics. It was high time that an avenger appeared to liberate an exploited humanity, and all these peoples would have excellent reason to thank Germany for aiming to cut the tentacles off this vicious octopus.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the guilty ones are not the only ones to suffer. War inflicts wounds on innocent people as well. We can be sure of one thing: the Germans would gladly do anything to get hold of the real culprit and punish him exlusively. Since this is not possible, the entire English people will have to suffer. And another thing is certain: The German people will not lay down their arms until that is accomplished. England will pay for every wilful act she has committed against innocent neutrals in the process of carrying out her perfidious policy of starving Germany into submission. Germany will be England's nemesis! The 18th of February will become an important date in world history.</p>
