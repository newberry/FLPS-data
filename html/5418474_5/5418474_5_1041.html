   <p>Fortunately, we have advanced to the point where our British-minded newspapers feel compelled to furnish some excuse for their attacks on Germany and her government. A large part of the public has so energetically rejected the unreliable reports of the associated news agencies, and such a keen appreciation of decent impartiality has developed by this time, that even the worst dyed-in-the-wool German-baiters are forced to give an explanation as to why they are attacking the German Reich, German policies, and the German high command by blaming them for this war and its consequences.</p>
   <p>And the sturdy old alibi, which they have used in all their attacks, has always been the violation of Belgian neutrality and the German attack on Liege. If this wonderful alibi should ever turn out to be a flop and be unmasked as a delusion, as has happened to so many hoaxes before, it would really take the wind out of the sails of all those who so eagerly have joined in this denunciation of Germany as the sole perpetrator of this war. We have read little or nothing in American English-language papers to the effect that the Belgians had binding agreements with England and France in case of war, that Belgian fortresses had been constructed with French capital and designed by French engineers, that there were British munition dumps in Maubeuge. We have not read a thing about the communication from the Belgian Minister at St. Petersburg to his government in Brussels which, by a fortunate accident, was intercepted by the German postal authorities. From this letter it was learned that Russia's war-provoking policy was the result of a British guarantee to France.</p>
   <p>And now we hear this alleged Belgian neutrality denounced from a different source, which intends to furnish proof that all this yelling about Belgian neutrality, all this artificially created clap-trap about England's moral obligation to protect the sovereignty of small nations, did not have the slightest foundation in fact, and that a true neutrality of Belgium never existed. This bull's-eye hit was made by the Vital Issue Magazine, in its latest issue, in which John W. Burgess, a well-known exponent of truth and justice, has taken up this matter.</p>
   <p>We quote: "England has called Belgian neutrality 'a sacred thing,' but its preservation is not a moral issue, but rather a matter of a search for truth. The treaty of April 19, 1839, which separated Belgium from Holland and made the former a traditionally neutral state, was originally concluded between these two nations. On the same day, in London, England, Prussia, France, Austria, and Russia signed the so-called "Five-Power Agreement," which recognized and guaranteed the above-mentioned treaty between Belgium and Holland. In the following May, the German Federation became a co-signatory to the Five-Power Agreement. This Federation was dissolved in 1866, and in 1867 the Norddeutsche Bund [North-German Federation] came into being. Have these changes had any influence on the treaty of 1839? The European political situation in 1870 can supply the answer to this question. England was always strongly interested and affected by Belgium's neutrality. Gladstone at that time declared before Parliament: 'I do not share the opinion that the simple fact of the existence of a [neutrality] guarantee would be binding to all parties involved, if changed conditions and circumstances warrant a reconsideration.' This opinion of her prime minister induced England afterwards to demand, separately, special guarantees from the French and the then German governments. The neutrality of Belgium consequently was guaranteed for the duration of the Franco-Prussian war and for another year thereafter. In 1872, these treaties expired, and the German Reich never again signed any agreement which had Belgium's neutrality as its object. If the treaty of 1839 [guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality] was, in British opinion, worth so little by 1870 that it needed bolstering up, what are we to think of it now, in 1914, when forty-two years have passed since the additional guarantees have expired, Burgess asks. And those guarantees were then given by the North-German Federation, not even the German Reich. And finally, the provision of the Hague Conference of 1907 that "the territory of neutral nations is inviolate" has been ratified neither by England, nor by Germany, nor by Austria-Hungary, nor by Italy. Russia was not represented on that occasion.</p>
   <p>"And this," writes Burgess in conclusion, "amply explains the remark of the [German] chancellor that the very existence of the German Reich should not be put in jeopardy on account of a 'scrap of paper'. England, on the other hand, refused to remain neutral, even on the condition and promise that Germany would not march through Belgium or attack the channel coast. She even declined to name or accept any conditions on which she would preserve neutrality."</p>
   <p>This article, writes the editor of Vital Issue, has been at the free disposal of the great English [language] dailies for two whole weeks. Not one of them has published it. And why? Because it clearly proves that Belgian neutrality was only a pretense put up by England; because it proves by logical reasoning that England wanted war, and, finally, because this article hits the bull's-eye and puts an end to a convenient alibi.</p>
