   <p>At a huge mass meeting held last night in the Medinah Temple, German-Americans expressed their ardent desire for the sake of German culture and thought, that the German arms may soon win a complete victory, and that the work of love and charity, started by the Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft [German and Austro-Hungarian War Relief Association] may continue successfully.</p>
   <p>"Our hopes are with those German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers in the trenches over there," said Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, one of the speakers, "and we hope that the enemy will not defeat them. To the German people, regardless of class distinction or religion, who are fighting this struggle, we say: 'Be brave and courageous, do not give in; if you win, the best there is in the human race will have won also, and with you, the German element of America.'"</p>
   <p>And His Excellency Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, former German Colonial Minister who, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>as representative of the German Red Cross in the United States was the principal speaker, concluded his speech by saying: "I am going to convey your greetings and best wishes to the German homeland, which will derive strength and courage from your message. If I am not mistaken about your sentiment, it is like this: German fatherland, always be fair, keep your shield of honor shining, remain true to your culture, be victorious as you deserve to be. The best wishes of the German-Americans are with you. Through death to victory!"</p>
   <p>It was a memorable occasion which will long be remembered by all who were present. [Translator's note: the redundancy appeared in the original.] Shortly after 7 o'clock huge throngs started to converge on the hall. Unfortunately, only one main door was opened, and the lack of space caused a bad jam. Some people had to wait more than half an hour before they could get in. By 8 o'clock every available seat in the huge Medinah Temple auditorium was filled by German-Americans, united in their love, loyalty, and devotion to the old country. There were no class distinctions. They were like "a people of brothers," in whose eyes was reflected the everlasting love for the homeland, and whose <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>hearts were filled with unswerving loyalty to Germany. If the hall, which had a capacity of five thousand, had been larger, it would have been filled just the same.</p>
   <p>A Forest of Flags</p>
   <p>The stage presented a beautiful and inspiring picture. A forest of flags greeted the visitors. Delegations, representing all parts of Germany had rallied around their standards. German, Austrian, Hungarian, and Swiss vereine and unions, as well as veterans', singing, and turner vereine had sent their banners, which gave mute but expressive testimony of the patriotic feelings of their members. The old Austrian battle hymn: "Prinz Eugen der edle Ritter" found a cheerful echo in the hearts of all, as did the Radetzki March. It goes without saying that the "Wacht am Rhein" and "Deutschland, Deutschland ueber Alles" was sung by everybody. It was like a wave of love and enthusiasm that surged from the auditorium to the stage and back again. But this love found active expression, because many young ladies had donned the uniform of the Red Cross and were busy <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>before and after the meeting taking up a collection for Germany's heroic sons who had shed their blood on the altar of the fatherland, and for Germany's widows and orphans. The girls sold cornflowers, ribbons, and emblems with the German colors.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm was so great that after the meeting a group formed on the street, with German and American flags gaily flying in the breeze. They marched through Clark street to the Turner Hall, singing the "Wacht am Rhein".</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Ferdinand Walther, first vice president of the German and Austro-Hungarian War Relief Association. Mr. Walther extended a hearty welcome to everybody and introduced the chairman, Mr. Harry Rubens, who made the following address:</p>
   <p>"'Der Gott, der Eisen wachsen Liess, der wollte Keine Knechte!' [Translators' note: Means in English: God, who let iron grow (created iron and steel) did not want men to be serfs (slaves).] With these red-blooded words, Ernt Moritz <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Arndt [German poet] began his immortal patriotic song in 1812, inspiring the German people to the war of liberation against the Gallic oppressor. And now, when the German people are again threatened, this time by the Russian Knout [flogging instrument] and British greed, we are singing this song again together with our one-time brothers-in-arms, the brave peoples of Austria-Hungary and with the sword in our fist. A new war of liberation is now raging on the other side of the ocean, infinitely more horrible than the war of 1813, with infinitely greater numbers of victims as the inevitable consequence.</p>
   <p>"Forty-four years ago, when it became necessary to preserve German unity by fighting the Gallic neighbor, all the refugees of 1848 [German revolution], living in America, quickly forgot the experiences and hardships of that period and the united spirit of all sons of Germany residing here in our midst found eloquent expression in the poetic words of our Chicago fellow citizen, Kaspar Butz:</p>
   <p>"'Fuer Dich, o Muttererde, Du Land der Herrlickeit,</p>
   <p>Auch Deine fernen Soehne, sie stehen mit im Streit!'</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>[Translators' note: In English, this means something like this: "For you, our native soil, your glorious land, your distant sons, embattled also stand".]</p>
   <p>"And today, we also 'stand embattled,' as far as our neutrality as American citizens permits us. We 'stand embattled' with all our hearts and with solemn determination, by turning our brotherly love and charitable spirit toward relieving the wounds and devastations caused by this war. We 'stand embattled' by doing our utmost to stem the poisonous tide of utterly malicious calumnies about the cause of the war and the way the Germans and Austrians are said to conduct it. Instead, we will disseminate the truth, so that everybody will know. We 'stand embattled' by using all our rights as full-fledged American citizens, to encourage our Government in Washington in maintaining and even augmenting our neutrality provisions."</p>
   <p>After the applause which followed this speech, had died down, Mr. Rubens introduced as second speaker Dr. George L. Scherger, professor of history at the<a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>Armour Institute, who made the following inspiring speech:</p>
   <p>"It is not the purpose of this or any other meetings to violate the neutrality of this country. The German element in America does not desire a violation of it but a strict observance of this neutrality. It seems to us a hypocrisy and a travesty as well as an inexcusable contradiction if we are asked to pray for the early conclusion of this fearful war and at the same time are sending war materials across the ocean and in this manner creating more widows and orphans by the prolongation of the war. It would be asking the impossible, for it would require superhuman efforts on the part of the German-Americans, to expect them to withhold their sympathies for the heroic German people during these trying times, which have come upon them. How could German-Americans hide their satisfaction over the glorious victories which the German people have won over a world of enemies. Did world history ever record such a fight as the present one? Was there ever a people who accepted such a struggle and not fall on their knees and beg for mercy? Just look at the hoodlums the noble Germans and Austrians have to contend with! Not enough that they have to fight the French, the British, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the Belgians, and the Russians, but the hordes of Asia and Africa were turned loose against them, yellow Japs and black Sikhs, just to mention a few. But the Teuton slogan is: The more enemies, the more honor! Finally, I ask: Have ever a people been villified as the Germans? The whole world has been incited against them. They were called Barbarians and Huns who had to be wiped off the face of the earth. And to this we should acquiesce and not help the righteous cause to victory? If we did not open our mouths, then stones would talk!</p>
   <p>"It is not we who are violating America's neutrality, but the lying propaganda press of this country. It is our sacred duty to voice emphatic protest against such unfair falsification of facts. The American people must be informed. Truth will win. As an American poet once said: 'Truth, crushed to earth, will rise again; the eternal years of God are hers.' History will judge, for as Schiller said: 'World history is world judgment.' The mist of lies will vanish. The light of truth will triumph in the end. Some day America will have to be ashamed of her stupidity and unfairness. It would almost seem as if America <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>had lost her independence and become again a British colony. With a truly childish gullibility, our English newspapers copy all the fables that England transmits over here. Nothing is too fantastic for our American public. The Crown Prince has been taken prisoner at least ten times. General von Emmich has committed suicide because it took him a week to capture Liege. General von Beseler ditto, because he took Antwerp within ten days, and now General von der Goltz has put a bullet through his head because he was given the command over the Turkish army. How many times was General von Kluck discharged! And what wonderful victories did the British army win with their own Big Berthas, namely their big mouths.</p>
   <p>"We German-Americans won't fall for such drivel. Is it not a wonderful, nay an inspiring fact that America's German element sticks together like one man, united with the old country by the same ideologies, so that even the second and third generation are beginning to be proud of their German heritage? And how marvelous is their spirit of sacrifice with which they contribute to the [German] Red Cross.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>"I, too, was born in America. Even my grandparents were American citizens. I remember when I was a child and my father put me on his knee and told me about his experiences in the Civil War--of the battles of Shiloh, Lookout Mountain, and Missionary Ridge. I am glad about my American nativity, but I also consider myself lucky that I had a chance to go to Germany when I was twenty years old and could spend three years at German universities, where I had teachers like Wundt and Paulsen, Wagner and Schmoller, Harnack and von Treitschke. I was privileged to attend the last lectures of the latter before his sudden death. The impressions which were made upon my mind at that time have lasted ever since. It was then that I really learned to understand German culture and the German people. How empty of spiritual values my life would be if it wasn't for those German influences! Now they are trying to tell us that the Germans are suffering from delusions of grandeur and megalomania; that they believed their Kultur was unique and destined to conquer the globe. Of all this I have never found the slightest evidence. No other people are as friendly and polite to foreigners. The German has always overestimated foreign cultural values and never appreciated his own Deutschtum. He was only too willing to forget his language <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>and his German heritage when living in a foreign country, as for instance here in America. How many millions of her sons has Germany lost in this manner! All the treasures of world literature and philosophy have been translated into German, and no language is more suited to that purpose. The Germans have adopted Shakespeare, as it were. Foreign artists like Maeterlinck, Sarah Bernhardt, D'Annunzio, Leoncavallo, St. Saens, all founded their fame and fortune in Germany, even though they are now doing their best to brand the Germans as barbarians. Neither has the German Michel [translators' note: Michel or Michael in English. German allegoric figure, wearing a night cap. He personifies the German character as to manner. Trusting and gullible and somewhat of a simpleton, he is easily taken in by the scheming of foreign nations.] evinced any self-confidence in this country; for here, too, he was content to take the back seat. Maybe our new allies, the Irish, will teach us a thing or two in this respect. When it comes to bragging and boasting, it is always the Englishman and not the German who toots the big horn. The Germans have never questioned French and English cultural values; only in regards to Russia and Serbia did they claim to fight for mankind's most sacred possessions against the barbarism of the Cossacks.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>The two symbols of the Russian regime are the Knout and the Siberian exile. It will take centuries for Russia to attain the economic, moral, religious, and intellectual level of present day Germany. Germany and Austria now have to stem the tide of the Russian hordes. Napoleon prophesied that within a hundred years Europe would be overrun by the Cossacks. Whose fault would it be if that should happen after all? It would be the fault of that so-called free and Christian England which made this unholy and disgraceful pact with the darkest despotism in the world today, against her own race. England is to blame if the clock of civilization is turned back several centuries. History will sit in judgment over the deceased King Edward VII of England and his hireling, Sir Edward Grey. And the same can be said of Japan in regards to the Yellow Peril. The time will soon come when England and her colonies will just be crushed between the Slav and Mongolian hordes.</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, we are asked to believe that Germany has an insatiable greed for territorial acquisitious and wants to conquer the whole world including the United States--the little German Reich, not even as large as our state of <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>Texas, while England owns one-eighth of the world and Russia another eighth. Is it not these two that can never get enough? Let nobody believe that Russia loves Serbia and the other free Balkan states. They are nothing but succulent morsels which will some day find their way into the Russian stomach. Peter the Great pointed the way to Constantinople. Russia does not fight Germany because she hates the Germans, but because she knows that the route to Constantinople goes through Berlin. Compared with Russia and England, the Germans have only fought just and unavoidable wars, and have never robbed anybody. What people would have shown as much leniency and justice toward a vanquished foe as the Germans did in 1864, 1866, and 1871? Denmark only had to give up Schleswig-Holstein, which had always been German. Austria in 1866 did not lose one square foot of her territory. France in 1871 only had to return Alsace and one-third of the original province of Lorraine, which had been in German possession for seven hundred years, and which were stolen by Louis XVI because Germany was too exhausted after the Thirty Years' War to prevent the robbery. The Germans just wouldn't be capable of exploiting a country in the way Napoleon exploited Prussia from 1809 <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>till 1813. Perhaps it would have been better if the Germans, after their glorious victories of 1870 to 1871, had taken more territory, especially Belfort and Verdun. Immediately after the Franco-Prussian War Bismarck said: 'Germany is completely satisfied!' Referring to France, the great Chancellor said in 1887: 'If the French would like to live at peace with us until we attacked them, if we could be sure of that, then peace would be guaranteed forever. What else could we want of France? Annex some more French territory? Even in 1871 I wasn't very much in favor of taking Metz. I should have preferred a language boundary line.' In regards to Russia he said in 1890: 'What have we got to do with Russia or in Russia? If we should actually defeat her, we would inherit nothing at best but a restive Polish neighbor.'</p>
   <p>"Not on conquest was German policy bent, but on the preservation of peace. Germany had but one desire: to be left in peace. That has been German policy for forty-three years. Kaiser William II was a prince of peace. His most ardent desire has been to continue this peace uninterruptedly. He spoke the sacred truth when he said at the outbreak of the war: 'I have been forced to draw the sword.'</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>During the Morocco crisis in 1911 he had even withdrawn his justified demands in order to avoid a world conflagration. Russian greed for territory, French thirst for revenge, British envy and jealousy--these are the real causes of the World War. Germany is fighting for her existence. This war did not come unexpectedly. It has threatened for forty years. France, Russia, and England, particularly, are the guilty ones. None of the three would have ventured into the war singlehanded, but allied with each other the game seemed easy.</p>
   <p>"Just as little Prussia under the Great Frederick had to fight for her existence seven years against France, Russia, Austria, and Saxony, the German people of today again have to struggle to hold their own against overwhelming odds. But is not the situation more favorable than it was then? Frederick had as an ally perfidious Albion, who would help him with money, but not with soldiers, although she herself was guided by selfish interests and took Canada and India as a bounty. Today, England stands shoulder to shoulder with Russia and France, while Germany is united with Austria, a far better ally. And above all other things today there is a great and united Germany whose potential resources seem <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>inexhaustible.</p>
   <p>"How poor would Germany's chances be today if it wasn't for her army--the best in the world! Without this army there wouldn't be any German Reich. Without it, Germany's fate would be like Poland's. The German army is not the Kaiser's play thing. It is the entire German people in arms. The spirit of the War of Liberation [1813] is still alive in the German army. It is the spirit of von Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, von Bluecher and von Moltke. A nation like that can never be defeated. Not by a vanquished Germany, but by a Germany triumphant, can the peace of the world be maintained. If Germany were to be defeated by an overwhelming force, it would only be temporary. Just as Prussia was never greater than at the time of her most profound humiliation--when she was bleeding under the iron heel of Napoleon, but within five years was capable of bringing about the Corsican's defeat--so would Germany eventually rise again. But we are confident that Germany will not lose in the present conflict. Our faith in the German army and navy is unlimited. Only a victorious Germany will be able to free Europe from the bonds of militarism. When <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>Germany's frontiers are safe, and she won't have to fear her neighbors any longer, then she will be able to guarantee a lasting peace."</p>
   <p>Mr. Rubens then introduced the next speaker with the following words:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen! The next speaker, who will talk to you in German, is known as an intellectual leader, a courageous German and a great orator, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch."</p>
   <p>Amid loud applause Dr. Hirsch began his address:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen! The way you have received me does me great honor and shows a change in the sentiments of the Germans. I can remember the time when I was looked upon as a second-rate German, firstly, because I was a 'dyed-in-the-wool Luxemburger,' and secondly--and you can tell by my face--because I do not belong to the Teutonic race. But I have always maintained that Deutschtum is rather a matter of mind and spirit and that it would be a crime <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>to judge it by blood and race alone. I am glad that the present critical times have again made the German people conscious of their national heritage. Surrounded by hatred, we who stand alone must love all the more. The Germans are misunderstood. A philosopher once called the Germans the best-hated people in the world. When I returned from Europe this fall and stepped on American soil, my heart was heavy when I learned that our country, too [U.S.A.], had joined the sinister chorus of the [German] haters, at least as far as the English yellow press was concerned.</p>
   <p>"We did not ask anybody whose native tongue is English to love Germany, but we expected that at least the educated American would do justice to the German cause. But in that we have been disappointed, too. If anywhere, people should know in this country that we are not Barbarians, and that, if the German army is advancing, nobody should say that the Huns are on the move. In spite of our German birth, we are Americans all the way through. We have rendered great services to this country, and have kept the faith which we have pledged. When the Civil War broke out the Germans rushed to the colors while others were still thinking it <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>over. The United States has given us many things, but for every gift we have received we have given something in return. Our sweat has watered the soil so it would bear good fruit, and into the wilderness of a sordid materialism we have planted a friendly idealism which has expressed itself in song and art. We are Americans, and in raising our voices tonight, we do so in this capacity as well as in our sentiment as Germans. If others, contrary to the spirit of neutrality, send war materials across the ocean in unlimited quantities, thereby prolonging the bloody conflict, let us send over the things necessary to heal the wounds.</p>
   <p>"We are not just praying for peace. We do not implore the heavenly powers to interfere. These powers will restore the peace when the time has come and justice has triumphed; and will see to it that the future shall not belong to a shopkeeper nation--a people of slaves, who live in the past--but to a people who are conscious of their strength and fight for their rights--a people of the future.</p>
   <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>
   <p>"If we were to believe those British stories about the alleged German militarism, one would come to the conclusion that for forty-four years we had done nothing else but practice the goose step. In fact we have used that time to build up an efficient army. If we hadn't done so, our borders would have been invaded today from all sides. If England can build battleships in great numbers, more than are necessary to defend her coast, without any criticism from this country, even though England's domination of the seas is quite a nuisance, why has not Germany the right to concentrate troops at her borders in order to stem the invasion of the Barbarians east and west? But no, the Germans are Barbarians and the Russians represent culture! The Germans are the Huns and the Russians the apostles of the gospel of freedom! Is our memory so short? Have we forgotten the protest we made to Russia a few years ago, when she furnished proof of her culture, expressed in the one word "Kischinew' [city in Bessarabia]? Has Russia changed? Oh sure! The Czar has promulgated an appeal to 'his beloved Jews'. He has promised them all the blessings and benefits of <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>Russian civilization. The Knout, the gallows, the raping of Jewish girls, the murder of the little babe at the mother's breast, these were the blessings of the House of Romanov. And why the hatred in Russia against the Jews? Because even today they still speak the German language! Because even today they still preserve their German culture, which they brought to Russia in the thirteenth century!</p>
   <p>"The Russian Jews are speaking the German of the thirteenth century as it is still preserved in old documents. The Jewish minds and souls--with the exception of the Spanish Jews--reflect the German heritage anywhere on the globe. The Jewish Reformation was German inspired, because we, too, had our Martin Luther. [Translator's note: In this speech, "we" sometimes means "we Americans," sometimes "we Germans," and at other times "we Jews". Please watch!]</p>
   <p>"We hear so much talk about liberty and democracy. An American who does not understand the German form of government, imagines that country being ruled by a sort of despotism. But we know that the German Reichstag [Parliament] is elected<a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>by general franchise, and that nobody can become a member who is not elected by an absolute majority of popular votes. Would you call that absolutism or real democracy? And furthermore: The Kaiser cannot declare war by himself, but has to have the approval of the Federal Council. If the English press speaks of the 'War Lord' as of an autocrat, they only document their ignorance or their malice.</p>
   <p>The "War Lord"</p>
   <p>"War Lord" means commander-in-chief of the armed forces. We could say then, correctly, that President Wilson was our "War Lord," but commander-in-chief is the proper term. With whom was Germany at war during the last forty-five years? With nobody, that's right! And it is the only country which can show such a record. To be sure, opportunities have not been lacking. Repeatedly Germany has been gravely threatened, but she has always displayed an unmistakable desire to preserve the peace. A war probably would have been advantageous to her on certain occasions, but she did not choose to take up arms. It wasn't such a long time ago that Russia and Japan had a 'little controversy'. What would have happened <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>if Germany had given her support to one of the belligerents?</p>
   <p>"But such aid would not have been in conformity with German love of peace and the German democratic idea. Every nation has to work out her own destiny in order to become free. The philosopher Kant has taught the Germans that the only way to freedom is by doing one's duty. Now the German army is the incarnation of loyal fulfillment of duty, and therefore upholds Kant's philosophy. The reason Germany has become so obnoxious to England is because the former has built up her overseas commerce in such a truly efficient manner, which is characteristic of the German spirit. Germany owes her success, which, incidentally, caused England to make war upon her, to her diligence, integrity, and strict discipline.</p>
   <p>"The German does not go out into the world saying: You must become German! He finds out what the world has to offer him and is glad to reciprocate by giving things in return. The result is the honorable reward for honest efforts. We hear a lot about the lack of order and efficiency in our city governments, <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>and we point to the difference in the German municipal administration. The latter is the direct result of strict loyalty to duty, of subordination, and of co-operation throughout. In Germany, only he is free who performs his duty. That is why today our heart goes out to those men in the trenches over there, whose duty it is to stem the tide of the enemy hordes. To the German people, who today, regardless of class, profession, or religion, are fighting the hard battle, we say: Be valiant and courageous! Hold out for victory! If you win, America's German element will win with you!"</p>
   <p>The principal speaker of the evening was introduced to the audience by Mr. Rubens with following words:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen! Before I introduce the last speaker, on account of whom this splendid meeting was really called together, I want to call your attention to those charming young ladies sitting here in front of me, who will take up a collection after the meeting for the benefit of the war widows and orphans and I am asking you to make generous contributions. And now, I have the great <a name="p25" class="page-break">25</a>honor to introduce to you one of the highest-ranking German statesmen, whose keen and superior intellect has offset to some extent the anti-German feeling manifest in this country, His Excellency, Dr. [Bernhard] Dernburg.</p>
   <p>After the stormy applause which greated Dr. Dernburg had quieted down, the representative of the German Red Cross began his speech. At the beginning he spoke German, later on English, and in the last part of his address he spoke again in the tongue of his native land, much to the satisfaction of his listeners.</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen! The first thing I want to say to you is a word of profound and sincere gratitude. Gratitude to those who have come to show us their sympathy, to those who have called this meeting together, to the Hilfsgesellschaft [Aid Association], and to all the others who have felt that the time has come to extend aid to Germany. Truly, these are grave times! Germany is surrounded by a world of enemies, is dependent upon her own strength and that of her ally, cut off from all news services and therefore not able to tell the world her side <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>of the story, threatened by a blockade war of starvation directed against women and children and constituting the greatest infamy in world history. Yes, we do need sympathy. It will give us strength to know that we have the compassion of all people of German blood and tongue.</p>
   <p>"But in the meanwhile we are passing through a perilous time, a time of worry and untold grief, especially for those who are hardest hit, the women and children, the widows and orphans. And to these, ladies and gentlemen, you have opened your heart and opened it generously, because Chicago is way ahead in contributions for this great relief work.</p>
   <p>"You have come together here, to greet the man whose job it is to see that this relief work is making good progress and that the contributions will continue. The mere fact that you have come here in such large numbers convinces me that you will keep up the good work in taking care of those war widows and orphans.</p>
   <p>"When I arrived in this country three months ago I felt as if Germany did not <a name="p27" class="page-break">27</a>have a single friend left in the world, but I found out soon enough how wrong I had been. The German-Americans are faithful and loyal! And tonight I have experienced a demonstration of true German spirit. Everybody here seems to say: I am proud to belong to such a great and heroic people!</p>
   <p>"But, ladies and gentlemen, you'll find the going difficult in this country. Hatred and jealousy has done considerable damage to the minds of people. It will be hard to convince your Anglo-American countrymen and make them see the truth. Even so, you have done a wonderful job thus far. I have admired the poise and dignity with which you have rejected the accusations against the old country. But, ladies and gentlemen, there is a limit to patience. When your culture, your native land, and your forefathers are defamed and insulted by the application of the term 'Huns,' it is up to you to hurl back this obscene lie, this infamous calumny. This mass demonstration here makes me sure that no German-American will fail to do so.</p>
   <p>"What are we accused of? Well, in the first place there is the case of Belgium. <a name="p28" class="page-break">28</a>Germany is charged with a violation of Belgian neutrality and the breaking of a treaty. She stands accused of having trampled underfoot a small nation and of having torn up sacred pacts like scraps of paper. Therefore, Germany could not be trusted any more. How often has England broken treaties? England certainly is least fit to criticize others. She is certainly not the nation to lecture other nations on the sacredness of treaties and on general behavior. England is not the country which could tell other countries how to be honest and decent in international relations. How about neutral China, neutral Egypt, neutral Morocco, whose neutrality was just guaranteed by treaties a few years ago? Haven't all Germans and Austrians been expelled from Morocco on twenty-four hours notice under the jeering laughter of French officers? Why did not your [Anglo-American] press mention these things? It has to be admitted that the press is trying to be fair. The trouble is, they are ignorant of the situation. The [foreign] news reports are responsible for this. What is necessary is an accurate presentation of the facts which would permit the American people to judge things for themselves. Until they know all the facts, Americans should refrain from jumping <a name="p29" class="page-break">29</a>to conclusions.</p>
   <p>"I'd like to explain to you the case of Belgium. In 1815 the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established, which included present day Belgium. In 1830, a French army marched through Belgium, took Antwerp and compelled Holland to agree to the secession of Belgium. In the following year a treaty was signed, to which England was a partner, making Belgium a neutral state and forcing her to maintain neutrality toward all other nations from that time on. Thus Belgium was created as a buffer for England. An additional treaty was concluded in 1839, to which Prussia also was a signatory. Would you contend that a treaty signed seventy-five years ago could never be abrogated? Would you agree that the President and the Senate of the United States could conclude a treaty which would obligate your descendants for many years hence? Certainly not! And we feel the same way about it.</p>
   <p>"We Germans have never signed that treaty. It was Prussia and the other powers. In 1870, when war broke out between France and Prussia, Mr. Gladstone [British <a name="p30" class="page-break">30</a>Prime Minister] had separate agreements with Napoleon [III] and with Bismarck to the effect that, if either one should attack Belgium, England would interfere. This time it was different. When Prince Lichnowsky [German Ambassador to England] asked Sir John Grey whether England would remain neutral providing Germany respected Belgium's neutrality, Sir Grey replied that on this condition, alone, England could not promise anything. When Germany went a step farther and offered guarantees depending on French integrity [of intentions towards Belgium], Grey gave a definite reply in the negative. He has never made Belgium's inviolability an essential part of his policy, but France and Russia had the assurance of British support, and so the foundation for the war was laid. The Chancellor of the Reich has admitted the violation of Belgium's neutrality and of international law. Two duties which we had to perform were opposing each other. The less important of the two had to make way for the greater one, on which depended the life of the fatherland and the existence of Germany. No country is immune from controversial issues of this kind. I do not like to quote examples from the history of this country where I am a guest, but American history contains a case in point which is so <a name="p31" class="page-break">31</a>pertinent to our subject, that I feel I must present it to you."</p>
   <p>The fact that Dr. Dernburg used the English language in this part of his speech caused some protest among the audience. Some calls were heard asking him to continue in German. The speaker replied with a friendly smile that he'd be glad to do so, but that he first wanted to read a court decision in English. He then continued as follows:</p>
   <p>"Your own United States Supreme Court rendered the following opinion in regards to the constitutionality of a law which excluded the Chinese [no details on it] and which seemed to come in conflict with certain agreements made years previous: [translator's note: the following is also translated back from German.]</p>
   <p>"'Circumstances can arise, which would not only justify the Government's setting aside these treaties, but which would made it imperative, in the interest of the nation, for the Government to do so.'</p>
   <a name="p32" class="page-break">32</a>
   <p>"Complete disregard of a promise given by a nation would be intolerable, but not more so than the disregard of a word given by a ruler to his nation.</p>
   <p>"Of all continental powers, Germany has by far the smallest peacetime army with the exception of Austria. This army is, incidentally, the least expensive too. It costs much less than France's or Russia's. Germany spends considerably less for her army and navy than does England. There is only one thing wrong with the German army and navy: They are too efficient.</p>
   <p>"Our so-called militarism is not a German invention. Sadi Carnot, French revolutionary and general, introduced general conscription in France in 1791. And this first conscripted army overran and beat Europe under Napoleon. By 1815 Prussia had learned her lesson.</p>
   <p>"It was always claimed that a democratic form of government and general conscription were ideologically incompatible. Let me point out Switzerland as an example: She asks military service of every male citizen and compels him to <a name="p33" class="page-break">33</a>keep his gun and uniform handy at all times. Switzerland considers this always available army an indispensable part of the nation, and the best guarantee for her independence and inviolability.</p>
   <p>"So much about militarism. In the life of a people, the interest of the entire nation is entrusted to the government. The latter is under obligation to preserve and maintain these interests. The government, on behalf of the nation, must implement the measures of national defense and preparedness which are necessary for that purpose. Every country must have adequate armed forces to insure against disturbances from within, and to enforce the laws. That is, any self-respecting country should. As a matter of fact, L. M. Garrison, Secretary of War, has made this statement in a message to Congress with President Wilson's approval.</p>
   <p>"In Germany we have the general franchise. All citizens without exception can vote in the Reichstag elections. The Reichstag appropriates every penny that is spent for administration purposes. It has to account for every expenditure. <a name="p34" class="page-break">34</a>Since the sixties of the last century, only one appropriation has been made which was not authorized by the Reichstag, namely the emergency appropriation for the missionaries in Shantung, China. Even this expenditure was approved afterwards. Everything is accounted for painstakingly. Germany is the only country that does not know the term 'graft'.</p>
   <p>"And now the Kaiser, the 'War Lord'! I have once stood before this august personage, shortly after what might be called his gravest hour after ascending the throne. An alleged interview with the Kaiser, published in the London Daily Mail in 1908 had aroused a storm [in Germany] because it was believed that utterances made by the Kaiser during this interview were liable to upset Germany's foreign policy. The Reichstag asked the Chancellor of the Reich, Prince Buelow, to induce the Kaiser not to interfere [with the Foreign Office] in this manner any more. Prince Buelow complied with this request and the Kaiser not only gave him this assurance, but has kept it ever since. That is German democracy, that is the German Kaiser.</p>
   <a name="p35" class="page-break">35</a>
   <p>"And now I ask you to join me and give three cheers to Germany and Austria-Hungary. Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"</p>
   <p>The cheering reverberated throughout the huge auditorium like thunder and the great demonstration came to a close.</p>
