   <p>The Prussian militarism must be crushed! With that decision, John Bull started his "commercial campaign" against his rival, Germany, and the entire Englishcontrolled press gave its unequivocal assent, showing frenzied approval, while our American papers, akin to chirping, chattering sparrows, joined the chorus in so far as their editors had perused the accounts through their English monocles, which showed them the bloodthirsty Prussian militarism as the "sole underlying cause" of the frightful World War.</p>
   <p>And then this Prussian militarism performed its task by belaboring the wellnigh invincible and superior forces of the Allies, thrashing and scattering them in all directions of the compass, whereupon the howling flared up anew:</p>
   <p>"That's the Prussian preparedness."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Germany had been plotting for many years, while "harmless" England and its "still more defenseless" Allies were absolutely unaware. That our Anglo-Saxon press (the Anglo-American press, with few axceptions, disappeared long ago) would subscribe to these tenets was obvious.</p>
   <p>But secretly, in the deepest recesses of their hearts, they sighed with yearning, green with envy;""If only we had this Prussian militarism!" Gradually this unobtrusive, sibilant sigh developed into a piercing, ear-splitting roar, when the President of our country declared that we must have a larger navy and a larger army. Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis (Times change, and we change accordingly), said the old Roman.</p>
   <p>What we condemned as gory militarism only a few months ago we now embrace as an urgent necessity because our native land is in danger; enemies threaten on the east and on the west; therefore, shell out your millions, noble citizens!</p>
   <p>Of course we feel somewhat embarrassed to baptize the new infant now, because <span class="page-break">\3</span>we formerly denounced Prussian militarism so persistently, but we have compromised by calling it "preparedness". Yet did we not also accuse war-loving Germany of having the same trait? Today we do not remember it any more. Our people often have a significantly faulty memory when the press circulates its commands.</p>
   <p>But let us subject this "preparedness" to a cursory inspection. There is no doubt that the originators of this idea--we will refrain from any reference to clandestine intentions at present--had the German pattern in mind. Again, "the masters leading the world," although against its will.</p>
   <p>That Germany is their model is clearly evinced in the preliminary instruction which, when inculcated into our youth, makes American citizens amenable to and available for strenuous military servitude. Drilling in schools and hardening the full-grown in the so-called camps are examples. It was comical last fall to observe fat bankers and rotund businessmen trying to shed a few pounds while sweating profusely, all for the Fatherland. Do they actually believe <span class="page-break">\4</span>that by such soldiering an entire nation can be reformed? They underestimate Prussian militarism. What we see now, even if it arouses astonishment throughout the world, was not created in a day to fit the exigencies of a moment. It was the work of many generations, the accumulated effort of a people constantly surrounded by enemies. And everywhere the belief prevails that this Titanic result is attainable--I had almost said by tomfoolery. We have the money and can afford it. How many millions does it cost? Fine! Fetch'em. We'll finish it.</p>
   <p>But the most important element they forget--the spirit. The Prussian feeling for militarism sees in the army the elite of the population. This also explains our often expressed contempt for the German's reverence for a uniform. Inversely, if an American judge offers to suspend a criminal's sentence on condition that he immediately join the Army or the Navy, a not unusual occurrence, then such a thoughtless jurist heaps contumely upon these idols of our patriots. In Germany a culprit is expelled from the army. He is not worthy to wear the Kaiser's regalia. In America we relegate the crook <span class="page-break">\5</span>to the ranks of soldiers, to save him from a penal institution.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, are we so credulous as to believe that our youngsters will be patriots in the future if our women teachers induce them to swing star-spangled, striped little flags to and fro? Serious men are needed as educators for the youth of today. Feminism and militarism are incompatible!</p>
   <p>Preparedness! That is an imperative need! A patriotic requirement, to which every German-American gives unstinted, cordial assent. However, as good American citizens, we insist upon the justified inclusion of a counter resolution: the exclusion of all private interests!</p>
   <p>We must allay even the slightest lurking suspicion that this preparedness propaganda was promulgated at the behest of avaricious munition manufacturers, trusts through the perfidy of which the "world conflict" continues, and which seek to establish a constant source of income after the war. We need either government control over all these diverse elements or absolute abolition of <span class="page-break">\6</span>profits when increased production for the national defense is contemplated. Every dollar gladly to the land, but not one cent for covetous individuals!</p>
   <p>If Congress, however, were to make such stipulations and to espouse them as a principle of its own creation, then, we can safely predict, our harmless citizens would indeed be greatly astonished to see how suddenly the slogan "Preparedness" would cease, particularly among the most vociferous patriots. Why? Nothing in it! Therefore, citizens, take heed!</p>
