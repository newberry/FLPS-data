   <p>The increase in gas rates and fares for local transportation, the deterioration of the service, the provoking manner in which employees of the utilities conduct themselves toward their customers, and the contemptuous indifference which the operators of public utilities in Chicago show when legitimate complaints are made have stimulated the idea of municipal ownership. The matter is being emphasized in the discussion of the many aspirants to the mayoralty and, although they disagree in their proposals to remove the evils and bring about an improvement of conditions, they all agree that the benefits which were expected to accrue from the grant of the franchise did not materialize, and that the corporations which were benefited by the franchise did not keep their promises.</p>

   <p>Only two mayoral terms separate us from the termination of the present streetcar ordinance, which was drawn up in 1907, and the citizens of Chicago cannot be too earnestly cautioned to use the greatest care and deliberation not only in the election of a mayor, but also in the election of aldermen. It has long been established that the transportation service is systematically allowed to deteriorate in order to make improvements appear so desirable that the riding public, merely to obtain these improvements, will immediately agree to grant the Chicago Surface Lines a new franchise which will guarantee that corporation additional rights. Having thus consented to a carefully concealed fraud, customers will enjoy no better service than they do under the present ordinance. Under the conditions which prevail in Chicago every step to impede the city's freedom of action when the present franchise expires must be looked upon as a favor to the Chicago Surface Lines. Better streetcar service during the remaining period of the franchise could be obtained if the city authorities <span class="page-break">3</span>would honestly and energetically insist upon strict observance of the terms of the franchise, including the number or runs, cleanliness, light, heat, and so forth. The franchise grants the city officials this authority, and their police power enables them to enforce their ordinances.</p>
   <p>Some citizens still seem to feel that municipal ownership of public utilities would inevitably be followed by political corruption, mismanagement, and a rise in rates. Such objections should be refuted by calling attention to our city water department. Although it cannot be denied that, from a business viewpoint, its management could be improved in various respects, yet the fact remains that the rates for water service in Chicago are lower than perhaps in any other large city of the United States. Let us assume that Chicago's water requirements were being cared for by a private corporation, and ask ourselves: Would we have the same unrestricted use of water at low rates as we have now?</p>
   <p>When public utilities are placed in the hands of an exploiting private <span class="page-break">4</span>corporation, they are a constant source of political corruption, watering of stocks, and increased rates. A private business that does not pay because of poor management or because of overcapitalization, will, in most instances, be forced to close its doors. A utility which incurs losses for like reasons merely takes legal steps, or it appeals to a public utilities commission and requests that it be absolved from the terms of its contract, and the public must then suffer for the mismanagement of the corporation by paying higher rates. Our streetcar companies, elevated railroads, and gas company are pertinent examples.</p>
   <p>"Public utilities cannot fare worse under public management than they do in the hands of private corporations." That is the verdict which was reached a short time ago by the Municipal League of Kansas, and also by a convention of the mayors of the larger cities of New York. Despite the wiles and schemes of utility companies, despite the secret support which they receive from many a city council or local transportation committee, <span class="page-break">5</span>the idea of municipal ownership is constantly gaining ground. In the United States there are 3,060 cities which have municipally owned water works, 1,565 cities which own and operate electric light and power plants, 32 that own and operate gas plants, and 4 that own and operate streetcars.</p>
   <p>Municipal ownership is non-partisan. Democrats, Republicans, and social Democrats can declare themselves in favor of it without offending against their party program. Municipal ownership is a criterion of honest endeavors in behalf of the welfare of a community, and is evidence of the progressive spirit of its advocates and their earnest intention to put an end to the machinations of corporations that corrupt our city officials by bribery. Municipal ownership implies better service, lower rates, better treatment and higher wages for employees, and a considerable income for the city treasury. It is high time that Chicago's electorate indicate its intention to secure these advantages for itself..</p>
