   <p>The American Socialists recently met in two conventions, to which the papers gave little attention. One was the national convention in Detroit, the other the state convention in New York. The two meetings, following one another at short intervals, are remarkable for the reason that the Detroit convention made resolutions which stand in direct contrast to these made at the New York convention. As is known, New York is the only large city, except Milwaukee, in which Socialists have a certain numerical strength. Here and there, to be sure, a Socialist mayor is occasionally elected, but these incidents are rare and the cities do not form a part of the small group having more than a million inhabitants.</p>
   <p>The State and the City of New York have a considerable number of Socialist votes, which is to be explained from the polyglot composition of the voters and from <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the preponderance of the industrial population. It is, for this reason, that the New York Socialists, who form a strong group within the party, should go on record in direct contrast with those of the national convention. The former Socialist candidate for president, Norman Thomas succeeded in getting the nomination for the office of United States Senator; but this was conceded him only after he was reproached in highly bitter debates that he pays homage to a communism only feebly veiled, and that he exploits the party for personal interests.</p>
   <p>Before all, however, the right wing of the party succeeded in totally denouncing the declaration of principles as voiced by the national convention. With the Socialists; it is always the same story. They are in discord with each other; they perpetually quarrel over theories and doctrines, and that is why they can achieve no practical results in politics. The most successful candidate for president they ever had was Eugene V. Debs. He obtained almost 900,000 votes in 1912, and in 1920 even more. This was obviously due to the personality of the candidate. Debs was known all over the country. For years he played leading parts in the activities of workers, and it cannot be contradicted that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>hundreds of thousands of workers with no socialistic leanings voted for the party ticket out of personal sympathy for Debs.</p>
   <p>This can be best proved by the enormous reduction of Socialist votes since then, although the total number of votes was considerably increased during the same period. Not even the long depression resulted in an increase of Socialist votes. This is quite clear. When a citizen with radical tendencies decides to turn his back on the two great parties and to join the Socialists, he is immediately confronted with a great difficulty. For there are two socialistic parties, the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labor Party. Which of the two should he join?</p>
   <p>If he, however, studies closely the two socialistic parties he may realize that they are subdivided into many groups which are in a bitter feud with each other. There is, of course, also a Communist party; but the Communists are likewise divided into various groups, of which each makes claim to have the only genuine <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>hue of red teachings. Naturally, the Socialists are sharply combated by the Communists who call them sneaks. It is well to take notice of this discord which prevails within the radical parties. It goes to show that the red peril, which ever and anon is brought up by a certain type of politician, is but senseless chatter.</p>
   <p>From a handful of radicals, who are in bitter combat with each other, the country has nothing to fear.</p>
