   <p>Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins is considering a planned economy for this nation. A clause of the proposed Black bill provides the Federal Government with dictatorial powers in the field of economy. The minimum wage law, the proposed thirty-hour working week, and the control of produce by the Federal Government are also being considered for future legislation. It seems incredible that endeavor should be directed toward this end when such procedure is hailed by Socialists as the initial step in the introduction of their economic order, in which they include state control of the regulation of supply and demand, as well as of working periods and wages. The plans of the Secretary of Labor--for which acceptance is not at all assured--have a revolutionary aspect in a land which is predominately capitalistic. Although so far the President has not approved the plan, the bill will nevertheless be submitted to Congress.</p>

   <p>Attempts at planned economy were made under the Hoover Administration. It was then that the Federal Farm Authorities suggested to wheat farmers and cotton growers that they reduce their normal produce by one third, and thus assist the Government in restoring higher prices for their products. Various other suggestions pertaining to the regulation of produce were made, but did not find the necessary support. The idea of planned economy survived, however, and the Secretary of Labor found it expedient to introduce this idea as one of the principal issues before Congress.</p>
   <p>It would be nothing short of meddling if government authorities were to dictate to industry the quantity it might produce. And yet, nothing less than that has been proposed.... The regulation of supply to conform with demand would therefore be the chief task of the Federal Commission.... Absolute stability is inconceivable, unless we ruthlessly ignore the rest of the world and carefully avoid private influence upon our economic life. Fiction alone can supply us with such a situation.</p>
   <p>Planned economy, as advocated by Miss Perkins, would lead to an economic revolution <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in America. Free action would no longer exist; moreover a strait jacket with all possible constrictions would be placed upon private initiative....Incredible as it may seem, and despite the probable protests from business and industry, the fact remains that the free and unlimited system of economic activity adhered to up to the present time has led to the present state of affairs. It is quite obvious that things cannot continue this way. Whether international arrangements--as the result of economic conferences held in various parts of the world--are not preferable to a radical overthrow within a single country is comething to a deliberate upon. Further developments regarding this planned economy, which has now become a national issue, will be anxiously watched by the public.</p>
