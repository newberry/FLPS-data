   <p>Winston Churchill is the First Lord of the British Admiralty, and as such can display the largest amount of stupidity which a human being can cram into a space of 250 cubic centimeters. It was he who once said, "It is purest luxury for Germany to maintain a navy." When the "Panther" called at Agadir, Morocco, England made as much fuss as if the entire German fleet had landed at Southampton. England had announced that no other power could maintain a naval base within a distance of 250 miles from a British port. And all the nations had to or were willing to respect this policy. That this provision was intended at the time as a challenge to Germany, all other nations were pretty well agreed. German diplomacy came out of this affair with mixed feelings and was received at home accordingly. England's arrogance was not noticed in the United States; at any rate, this country pretended not to be aware of it. We hate to think what would have happened if Germany had proclaimed a similar doctrine.</p>
   <p>In Mexico, the Germans gallantly helped the American refugees reach safety when <span class="page-break">2</span>hostilities broke out. German ships and German homes provided shelter for them. During all that time, the British envoys in Mexico and in Washington were intriguing against the policy of President Wilson. If those "cousins" over there had succeeded, we would have had war with Mexico. Let us try to visualize what would happen if the German Ambassador to Mexico were to conduct himself the way the Britisher did! We cannot even begin to imagine the howl of outrage which would have come from the Anglo-American press, carefully nurtured by our "cousins" from overseas. We think Americans are capable of pretty good judgment as long as their press does not embark on a campaign to distort that judgment. But God help them if that happens!</p>
   <p>Now this Churchill has made another pronouncement! He said to a group of American journalists: "Germany's motives in this war are her lust to conquer and her desire for world domination. It is a fight of democracy against aristocracy." The American journalists listened to this incredible balderdash, paid their respects to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and telegraphed his wise words to Washington, but not before they had rehashed the tripe and substituted their <span class="page-break">3</span>own version. According to these wise words, Russians, Japanese, African negroes, and Moroccans are fighting for democracy against Germany--and aristocracy. Churchill expresses himself somewhat euphemistically. The word he meant to use was barbarism, but it would have been too ridiculous to imagine Algerians and Moroccans, [East] Indians and Sudanese fighting against barbarism. But our country, the United States, is not taken in one bit by this piece of irony. No statesman in Germany has made any remarks about the enemy since the war broke out. One has heard no calumnies, no boasting utterances. With unshaken faith in their righteous cause, the Germans coolly pursue the war.</p>
   <p>Edwin D. Mead, director of the World Peace Foundation, who is familiar with the English version of the cause of this war, has interrogated prominent men in Germany to learn their opinion on the question raised by Churchill. Wilhelm Forster, astronomer, as well known in London and Paris as he is in Berlin, Wilhelm Wundt, Professor Quiddt, Dr. Caspar Rene Gregory, a naturalized German, Dr. Drechsler, secretary of the American Institute in Berlin, the theologians Schreiber and Spiecker, Professor Julius Richter, Professor Karl Lamprecht, a <span class="page-break">4</span>historian who is considered an authority in England and France, Edward Bernstein, one of the most prominent socialist writers, all agree on the following, according to Mead: "Our cause is absolutely just. War had become inevitable once Germany was surrounded by greedy and jealous enemies. Now we have to fight for our existence." That is all! Not one of them is boasting that Germany is fighting for this or that doctrine. Not one is trying to provide American journalists with a thrill. Whatever is uttered in England or France, whatever is dictated to American correspondents in London and Paris, is designed to praise the Allies and their noble cause. The same tactics are pursued in Africa, Asia, America, and Australia. In the face of that universal hatred there is nothing left for the Central Powers, Germany and Austro-Hungary, to do but to act according to the old dictate: Since you don't want to be my friend and brother, I'll have to blow your brains out!</p>
   <p>Occasionally one finds spokesmen for the just cause. The reports of James O'Donnell Bennett and Joseph Medill Patterson of the Tribune are impartial and fair. We ask nothing more. A just cause needs no advertising. Let us quote <span class="page-break">5</span>two statements which are in harmony with an article published in this column last Saturday.</p>
   <p>Bennett writes: "Considering the efficiency which the German (military) machine displays before our eyes, we cannot help being profoundly disturbed. Waiting here in Aachen [Aix-la-Chapelle], the ancient empire city of Charlemagne, the idea presents itself whether we are witnessing the formation of a new Teutonic empire, one which may dominate Europe for the next hundered years, an empire which would be invincible, economically and politically, huge and efficient, orderly, contented, and magnificent."</p>
   <p>Eduard Bernstein made the following remarks to Mr. Mead: "We consider this war as a life-and-death struggle of a people. By giving our support to the fatherland, we have nevertheless not repudiated our fight against imperialism and militarism. Reinforced by the liberal parties, we will start a campaign against the entire military system of Europe."</p>
   <p>After this struggle, general disarmament could easily be visualized and liberal <span class="page-break">6</span>ideas will gain so tremendously that the [German] government will have to reckon with them. The German people will take care of that themselves, without the aid of the "reform" democrats [Patent-demokraten]and the eminent "fighters for liberty," as Churchill likes to call Russia, India, Canada, and Australia. When that time has arrived, the Germans will say to Churchill, Delcasse, Sazonov, and Company: Put your own house in order.</p>
