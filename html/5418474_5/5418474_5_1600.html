   <p>To Congress, and to the entire country, President Roosevelt's message was doubly surprising. It was surprising that he read the message in person, and his failure to make a single concrete proposal for legislation was certainly unexpected. After the Presidents had, for decades, refrained from reading their messages in person before Congress, President Wilson took up the old custom again. His example was followed by Harding and Coolidge, while Hoover avoided making a personal appearance before the representatives of the people.</p>
   <p>One can easily understand what induced Roosevelt to come to the Capitol and deliver his message in person. The circumstances surrounding a Presidential message are such that it is addressed not only to the Congress, but to the whole people as well, and, since the radio now gives men in public life an opportunity to make a personal appeal to every individual in the country, one can imagine why Roosevelt preferred to deliver the message himself, rather than to turn it over to a clerk. There is the further consideration that this message, at least in the opinion of its author, is a unique and extremely important document.</p>
   <p>Knowing that his appearing before Congress in person might seem a dictatorial gesture, Roosevelt sought to avoid giving this impression by laying particular emphasis upon the excellent progress made by Congress in the enactment of legislation. He explained that he had not come before Congress to demand new laws, but seriously to consult with it and to work with it in harmony. His message contained no proposals for new laws, but was chiefly a survey of what had been attempted and attained by the laws enacted in the special session of Congress.</p>
   <p>Roosevelt left no doubt that by these laws a new social order had been created in this country. He pointed to the measures for the relief of agriculture, especially the balancing of production and consumption. He indicated that the purpose of the measures regulating industry and commerce was the suppression of tyrannical monopoly and at the same time, the elimination of destructive methods of competition. In a few sentences he touched upon the currency policy, its effects and its goal, as well as the financial, banking, and budget policies of his administration.</p>
   <p>The President related his efforts to the history of the past when he alluded to the first sentence of the preamble of the Constitution and declared that the overwhelming majority of the people, without regard for party affiliations, sought for mankind a greater opportunity to find prosperity and happiness. He said that he agreed with the people that prosperity and welfare is not furthered by materialism and extravagance, but by honor, unselfishness, a feeling of responsibility, and justice.</p>
   <p>The message makes clear that its author considers the laws enacted in the special session to be permanent measures. They were measures to fight the depression, but in Roosevelt's opinion the chief cause of the depression was the fact that these laws and this regulation by the authorities did not exist; consequently these measures must be permanent. Hence the message foreshadows the end of economic individualism and the beginning of an economic era which is permeated with socialist ideas.</p>
   <p>The President's message is marked by an openness not usual in documents of this sort. Thus it declares that the efforts of European statesmen to promote better international relations and to limit armaments have been unsuccessful as yet. At the same time the President states emphatically that from now on the United States will keep clear of Europe's political bargains and problems. He also emphasizes that the Pan-American Conference in Montevideo was a success, and that the other American republics have been convinced that henceforth the United States will not interfere in their internal affairs.</p>
   <p>In every respect the message is in harmony with the President's policies. In broad outline it explains the New Deal, its goals and methods, and it will undoubtedly help to establish and strengthen the people's confidence in the man in the White House.</p>
