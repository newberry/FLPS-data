   <p>The systematic defamation of Germany by the English-language press is not, as many people seem to assume, a by-product of the war, but dates back to the early days of German immigration. The German immigrants have at no time made a collective protest against this German-baiting by Americans, except during the Know-Nothing movement, when they were physically assaulted. Then somebody got a beating, and quiet was restored.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the Germans lacked organization and competent leadership, and in the second place they did not trust one another any too well. Split up and divided into factions, into singing, turner, and rifle societies, into the Catholic and various Protestant churches, the Germans were never able to find a natural and common basis which would have enabled them to gain respect and recognition. There were always plenty of advisers telling them to be <span class="page-break">2</span>humble and throw their [German] national pride over the "fence" into the Atlantic ocean. "Just do your best to adapt yourselves as quickly as possible to American conditions; submerge yourselves without delay in the great melting pot of nationalities"--that was the "good advice" given the Germans by people "who knew", mostly political climbers and parasites. There was a great deal of such advice, but all of it was wrong. No natives of any other nation, whether they had landed on the shores of the Atlantic or the Pacific, have so earnestly and so successfully endeavored to make themselves useful in this country and to assimilate themselves; but for all that, no others have been treated, and continue to be treated, with such contempt as the Germans. Not only are the "War Lord" and "Prussian Militarism" endlessly condemned, but even the cultural, scientific, and industrial achievements of the Germans are very frequently derided, scoffed at, and criticized as of little value or else as a cheap imitation of the real thing. All this is beginning to get on our nerves.</p>
   <p>Some papers, it is true, boast occasionally of their impartiality, but, taken <span class="page-break">3</span>altogether, their attitude is either unfair, or malicious, or downright slanderous. There can be only one reason for this: HATRED. The Germans will always get their full measure of blame, but never the Russians, the Serbs, or the Japanese, never the French, the Belgians, or the British. We are still waiting for the first editorial berating these belligerents for the barbarous way in which they conduct the war. No Serb, no Japanese, and no Russian in this country can complain about an unsympathetic Anglo-American press. They have every reason to be satisfied; they do not have to go out of their way to devise propaganda for themselves. The Anglo-American press does that for them very efficiently by raving against the Germans. This saves the others the necessity of talking and agitating for their own cause. Germans and German sympathizers may say and write whatever they want to, but their arguments will always be met by the stereetyped reply, "That's pro-German," which means, "Watch out, it must be a fake!"</p>
   <p>"Belgian neutrality was violated by Germany!" It is useless to point out that France and England had made preparations which were tantamount to a <span class="page-break">4</span>Belgian mobilization against Germany. England's demand that Germany respect Belgian neutrality is hailed as a heroic act, but nobody mentions the fact that England did not care to give a similar guarantee to Germany. Sir Edward Grey guaranteed respect of Belgium's neutrality on behalf of France, but not on behalf of England. But German diplomats knew this British shyster politician well enough to determine their course of action by what he kept to himself rather than by what he openly proclaimed.</p>
   <p>An impartial and unbiased press, if it were really interested in seeing justice triumph and in improving the judgment of their readers, should make it their business to uncover any evidence that leads to the truth.</p>
   <p>But nothing of the kind! It is more profitable to defame and slander. England has more money to spend. If ever the Germans had to learn a bitter lesson, they are learning it now, during these grave days. Not only are their culture <span class="page-break">5</span>and the achievements of their native land maliciously belittled and German institutions ridiculed,but, to add insult to injury, they are now told that, if they want to be called "good Americans," they must spit on themselves and on the land of their fathers. How different all this would be if those millions of German immigrants had not forgotten so quickly that they were Germans, and instead had stood together and had united as fellow nationals! To be an American, it is not necessary to deny one's German national pride. This pride does not take anything away from good American citizenship, nor does it infringe on the duties of a citizen,as is proven, mutatis mutandis, by the presence of Americans on German soil, in Dresden, Stuttgart, Munich, and Berlin, and proven even to the satisfaction of our biased Anglophiles. Let us stop distrusting one another, let us forget our jealousy of one another when great issues are at stake. Then we will win respect even in the minor details of life, where we now get nothing but kicks in the pants.</p>
   <p>The acme of impudence toward things Germanic was reached by Collier's Weekly, a publication which enjoys a large circulation among the German element. The latest <span class="page-break">6</span>copy shows a cartoon reproduced from the Lustige Blaetter at the time of the Zabern incident in 1913. In this cartoon, Collier's gives German Militarism the name "Destroyer". Underneath is the editor's comment: "Prussian Militarism lives up to its name [destroyer]. It has torn up the 'scrap of paper' which all other nations regard as sacrosanct (referring to the violation of Belgian neutrality); it has destroyed Aerschot; Louvain, one of Belgium's most beautiful cities, with its churches, university, library, and homes of forty thousand people, has been reduced to ashes and ruin. Prussian Militarism is about to destroy Rheims Cathedral, the most beautiful ornamental Gothic edifice (French Gothic, the editor calls it (as if that were something special). Christianity was preached in this region at the end of the third century; Consul Jovinus was one of the first to be converted"--all this Collier's learns from a German tourist guide, where Rheims is described. "After the Vandals and Huns had ceased to be a menace, Rheims became the center of Christianity."</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>But this center of art and medieval craftsmanship could not be saved from the modern Huns, either by its own intrinsic beauty or by the Red Cross, which also protected wounded German soldiers in the city. These Prussian generals have the edge on civilization in this war; they can destroy the works of God and man without batting an eye. "Blessed are only the weak and the gracious," says Ruskin, and a German can be neither the one nor the other. When the Germans make their appearance in Lombardy, they will shell Venice and steal its art treasures (which they don't know how to appreciate) and will ruin the entire countryside, morally and physically, leaving behind them misery, vice, and intense hatred wherever their cursed boots have trod. They are doing this in France now. They crush and loot her, creating destitution, shame, and cold fury, then they go home, lick their chops ,and sing a "Te Deum". This is how the Germans look to editor Mark Sullivan of Collier's, which calls itself a "national weekly"!</p>
   <p>Although this pathetic "connoisseur of art" knows all the counterarguments, although this clumsy fool has no other mental equipment than his abysmally <span class="page-break">8</span>stupid insolence, this fellow, who in all his life has never amounted to more than a fourth-rate political ward heeler, nevertheless has the colossal gall to parade in front of a million readers not only as a historian but also as a connoisseur and protector of art. This disgrace of American journalism is making a mockery out of President Wilson's "regulations for strictest neutrality".</p>
   <p>How do you like it? Isn't it an object lesson for the Germans? And--What are you going to do about it?</p>
