   <p>The French secretary of state, Pierre Laval, in his international political speech last week, brought lucidity to a problem: that France does not regard the present arming of Germany as an actual fact. This he said to the face of Adolf Hitler's armament expert, Joachim von Ribbentrop, who came to Paris just in time to hear Laval's speech from a seat on the platform in Parliament. Nothing came, apparently of the negotiations, planned by Ribbentrop, with the French government. All the general did on Sunday was to have a discussion, which was granted him upon the request of the ambassador.</p>
   <p>What Ribbentrop would have sought to achieve, if the French government had given its consent to negotiations, was the recognition of Germany's rearmament as a rightful fact. He, in turn, was to offer the return of the Reich to the League of Nations, and a disarmament conference. Following his recent visit to <span class="page-break">\2</span>London, it was alleged that England would declare herself satisfied with the fact of German armament; France, however, has taken the opposite view before the whole world, pointing to the treaty of Versailles, which was infringed upon by German rearmament. With this attitude, it has removed a stone from the heart of its allies, the Small Entente, but it seems that that was completely lost sight of in Paris, for Laval put much meaning into his declaration that France and Russia together are taking care of preserving peace in Europe.</p>
   <p>Even more out of sorts is Poland, concerning the olive branch which the minister of the exterior, Laval, held out to the German envoy who sat disappointed on the platform--the renewed offer of an Eastern Locarno. If Laval could make the statement that Germany could have France for a friend as soon as it concludes the Eastern pact of security, this would be a slap in the face for Poland. The latter have flatly declined an Eastern Locarno as Russia would have it, preferring direct negotiations with the Reich. This offer, however, as made by France, is not going to sound like music in the ears of the Berlin <span class="page-break">\3</span>government, since all postwar governments have, for obvious national reasons, decidedly rejected an Eastern Locarno. In case the most national of all German postwar governments should compensate for its first success in foreign politics with a pact which it always regarded as anti-national, it would be unbelievable.</p>
   <p>What Laval omitted to say in his speech is perhaps even more important. Looking at the strengthening of German armaments as a breach of the treaty, the idea suggests itself that France might be looking for means to prevent these armaments. If one may believe the report coming from English sources, the Germans continue their arming more and more; they make their munitions factories work at high speed, and increase the number of men in their army. What is France going to do about it? Is it going to wait until Germany is powerful enough to wage a new war? In other words, has Laval taken notice of events that are quite ticklish for France? The German contention is that the Reich has a right to rearm because the Allies failed to keep their solemn promise to disarm. This promise is still valid, and could not be repudiated, even by Laval.</p>

   <p>Poincare answered the cessation of German payments for reparations by occupying the region of the Ruhr; but Laval merely declares the German armaments to be illegal, because, in the eyes of France, they are a breach of the treaty. Times have changed, and with them the tone in which France speaks to Germany today. Europe is not going to get much out of it, for Laval merely made clear that France does not want a direct understanding with Germany with respect to the question of armaments, which are the alpha and omega of German politics. The tension which exists in the political situation is not going to be loosened, and the armament race is progressing apace. It would be a miracle if all this is going to have a good ending.</p>
