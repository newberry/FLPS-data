   <p>So much has been written about our "benevolent neutrality" that by now everybody should be familiar with the subject. For the Germans and Austrians this problem is destined to cause more heartaches than any other, because they see with increasing apprehension and even indignation how the "noble Allies" of all races are being provided with all the implements to continue their war effort against Germany and Austria for an indefinite period. And no matter how often the pertinent fact is pointed out that it is impossible to prohibit American manufacturers from selling and exporting shoes, clothing, riding material, and vehicles, in short, equipment of all sorts, the bitter fact still remains that till today practically only the "Allies" are buying from American manufacturers and are able to ship their purchases to their places of destination.</p>

   <p>It is very easy to act on an emotional impulse; in many cases it is almost the only motive out of which great movements are precipitated. All legal objections are then brushed aside; all arguments of reason are then responded to by the clamor of the mob. It must be admitted that once a people have arrived at a point where an alternative course can no longer be discussed with any chance of being adopted, they are fully justified in listening to the dictates of their emotions and disregarding the cold letter of law and justice. Because in the life of a nation or a state (and particularly in a republic based on democratic principles) the happiness of the entirety [community; all citizens] must always be the ultimate supreme law--and we would do good to keep that firmly in mind--for in reality only that can be considered good which the great majority want, i. e., what seems useful and desirable to them.</p>
   <p>Laws are not eternal, but man is! If the majority of the American people should decide, out of ethical considerations, to prohibit the handful of manufacturers from producing war materials, or if the President should prohibit their export, the people as well as the President would be confronted with an unsurmountable <span class="page-break">\3</span>obstacle. The President cannot afford to judge by his sentiments; probably very often he has had to do something which was in open conflict with his emotions. What is being asked of him [arms embargo] could only be done by Congress, and Congress in turn is bound by the Constitution, the inviolability of which is guarded by the Supreme Court. There are actually things which neither Congress nor the courts have any jurisdiction over. One of them is the right of a citizen engaged in a constitutionally legitimate business to sell his goods to whomever he sees fit. Any restriction of this fundamental right is only permitted during times of actual warfare, wherein the United States was a belligerent, but would be illegal after peace was restored. This, of course, gives the Allies such a distinct advantage over Germany and Austria under the present circumstances, that one could indeed conclude that the United States was in alliance with the Allies--that is, the manufacturers and exporters. The United States Government does not come into consideration here at all, because its position regarding international law on one hand, and its dependency on domestic economic and political factors on the other, makes the Government <span class="page-break">\4</span>indeed a subject of opposing forces which were created by this international conflict. Too much is asked of this Government; too many things it is not able to do. Our country is not at war, and the Government has no emergency powers. We are at peace and our Government must act according to peacetime laws. At the same time we are surrounded by a war embracing four continents and coming ever closer to our own domain.</p>
   <p>Agitation against favoritism toward the Allies by sending them war supplies from this country, overlooks the main point in this controversy; namely that the Central Powers could buy over here on the same conditions as do the Allies. Ironical as this sounds, it is true nevertheless. Capital is not concerned with sentiment or moral considerations. Corporations have no soul, and big business, heavy industry, and wholesale commerce are in the hands of corporations. Big business is only concerned with two things: Profit and loss. It hates the latter and would rather deal with its worst enemy to make a profit than sell to its own brother at a loss. And we cannot even call that a callous attitude; it is the law of self-preservation. The Central Powers, therefore, <span class="page-break">\5</span>could buy the same things over here which the Allies are buying, but here is where the rub comes in, or the irony, or whatever you want to call it: The Central Powers have no means of transporting merchandise across the ocean. England with her navy is controlling all the sea lanes and would capture any [enemy] ship. She even goes further than that: She seizes the merchantmen of neutral states; she tells them not to import certain goods and abrogates the inviolable right of the buyer to dispose freely of such merchandise as he can import. England dictates the foreign trade laws for Holland, Sweden, Denmark, the United States, Italy, Spain, and others. She uses her state of war with one nation to paralyze the trade of the non-participants also. Such treatment should be answered by the neutral nations with a declaration of war, or at least with an announcement that such a declaration would be forthcoming, if these nations care to maintain their honor and prestige.</p>
   <p>The protest should, therefore, not be directed against our Government for permitting manufacturers to exercise their constitutional right, but against England <span class="page-break">\6</span>for making herself dictator of the seas and thereby creating conditions which make the natural right of our businessmen a gross injustice toward other nations, which was not intended as far as our manufacturers were concerned. But the protest must be made by the governments of all the neutral states and must be augmented by real power, a navy and an army. Resolutions won't do any good! Neither will it help to be afraid that the country may become involved in war. At certain times it is dangerous to give in to fear and worry and to submit to acts of violence without protest. England, with her arbitrary policy of telling the whole world what is contraband and what is not, has not one inch of legality on her side. But if the neutral powers submit to this piracy, it will become international law, because in cases like that most rules are made according to precedent, with the effect that international law will be nothing but Anglo-Saxon "law".</p>
   <p>It is at this point, therefore, that pressure should be exerted! This matter is not only of special interest to the Germans and Austrians, but also of <span class="page-break">\7</span>importance to the whole nation. We admit that in addition to the legal aspects sentiment also plays a part with the Germans and Austrians, whereas with the Anglo-American citizen the fact that England is trying to infringe on his inalienable rights is the sole consideration. Influential commercial bodies, businessmen's clubs, chambers of commerce, manufacturers' associations, these are the agencies which must be aroused to take action. After that, nobody would object to mass demonstrations of sentiment as a means of providing moral support. But the cause which we want to support must have a foundation of legality.</p>
