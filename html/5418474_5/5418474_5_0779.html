   <p>The British are now adopting a method of warfare at sea which they have used repeatedly in former campaigns on land. From the Indian revolts and the Kaffir wars we know that the brave two-shilling soldiers, in their skirmishes with the natives, used to put [native] women and children before their front lines, thus exposing them to the enemy's weapons. The purpose was obvious. The valiant "Tommies" figured that in the first place it was good policy to have as many natives killed as possible, and that in the second place the valuable bodies of the "most courageous soldiers in the world" would thus be spared. At the beginning of the Belgian campaign the English press recalled immediately this "glorious" past practice of the British army. They were at a loss to understand why the brave Belgians did not drive the Germans back to the Rhine as expected. The disappointment was great, and without knowing the reasons why or admitting the superiority of the German military [machine], <span class="page-break">\2</span>they suspected "tricks". Finally the resourceful British press had doped it out: Those damned Prussians were driving women and children before them, hiding as cowards behind them when going to battle! Looking up the records of their own glorious campaigns in the Boer War, the British came across some "tricks" of their own and concluded that the Prussians were making use of Tommy Atkins' experience. Sure, that was it! And for weeks we could read this fairy tale in the press, with variations. Finally it died, as so many others, but the things learned in the Boer War were not forgotten.</p>
   <p>But even if we wanted to forget the matter, the English themselves won't let us. What is sailing under the American flag if it is not hiding behind "mother's apron"? Behind this apron "the first sea power of the world" tries to hide and to have her ships plow the seas unmolested. They say: "It is permissible to make use of a neutral flag if necessity makes it imperative." This "permission" the "first sea power of the world" grants to herself arbitrarily. And it does not add to ex-President Taft's reputation as a jurist or to Mr. Harry Pratt Judson's scholastic prominence that they are so quick <span class="page-break">\3</span>to excuse this British "usage". The above-mentioned two gentlemen know as much about international maritime law as some of their colleagues, who don't know anything about it either. No belligerent power, unless it cares nothing for its military honor, may hide behind the flag of a neutral nation any more than it may hide behind the Red Cross flag for similar purposes. There are less than half a dozen university professors in this country who could be called authorities on international law, let alone maritime law. But these gentlemen are very eager and quick to put in their oars before they have even bothered to study the subject. And what for? Maritime law? That is England's concern, and England says: "It is permitted!" That suffices for any American professor of "jurisprudence," for he will always try "to be on the safe side".</p>
   <p>With all due respect for these learned heads, we think that the case is quite different. The use of a neutral flag is no "permissable deception" of the enemy but a downright fraud, which may lead to grave consequences for the neutral nation of which the flag has been abused. Why does not England use the Dutch or the Danish flag or any other for that matter? It is all very <span class="page-break">\4</span>simple: Her statesmen know that after February 18 the Germans will take measures to prevent this fraud "in order to protect their life interests"--to use that favorite phrase of British diplomats. No doubt this will cause difficulties between America and Germany. At least that is what London hopes. England wants America to adopt warlike measures. But at the same time England does not respect the Stars and Stripes under any circumstances whatever! Germany's announcement entails no difficulties for neutral shipping. However, if English and French ships should fly the American flag, the United States could not protest in case the belligerents had the right to do so. But the neutral nations cannot grant this permission. It is not only their right but their duty to prohibit the abuse of their flags. [Translator's note: The obscurity of the last two sentences is in the original text.] Of course it is still another matter whether England would pay any attention to a warning. She seems to think that one should not be too fussy among relatives.</p>
   <p>As soon as it became known that the "Lusitania" was sailing under the American <span class="page-break">\5</span>flag, the verdict was pronounced that such a war ruse was permissible. It is not hard to trace this verdict to the source from which all pro-British verdicts emanate. These "legal experts" are becoming confused in regard to what is permissible, and what is not. As a war ruse, a belligerent power has been permitted to fly the flag of the enemy since the time of Napoleon. This deception has been tried in almost all wars, including this one. England herself violates all the rules which she promulgates. In view of this fact we can look forward to worse violations. In her casual manner England wants to force a decision between the United States and Germany. Japan is England's big club in the Pacific, [encouraged] to do a little stealing there. Since England is fully informed about the military unpreparedness of the United States, thanks to Lodge and his son-in-law, we "had better keep our mouths shut" and not make a fuss about the matter.</p>
