   <p>America is conducting war against the German government--against dynastic autocracy and military as well as class rule. This war must end in victory, and it will. The only question is, How soon? And the answer can only be, The sooner the better.</p>
   <p>America entered this war because of the decision of Congress, which, in turn, decided in favor of war on the recommendation and at the demand of the President, in whose hands the foreign policy of the country rests. By abandoning many of its privileges, Congress granted the President extraordinary powers to put the country and the people on a war basis, to develop the people's fighting and defense power within the shortest possible time, and to ease the Government's task of winning the war.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Government has thus far fully justified the confidence placed in it. As far as the mobilization and development of our fighting power and the adjustment of labor, production, and finance are concerned, the achievements are really marvelous. But the job is not yet done, the victorious peace is not yet won, and the objectives of the government not yet accomplished. If it was merely advisable to give the Government a free hand during mobilization and in preparing a war plan, it now becomes imperative, and a plain duty, to give the Government unlimited power in pursuing its war policy, to meet all its demands, to stand behind it full of confidence, and not to put obstacles in its way. Sometimes it may seem that other methods than those adopted by the Government would be more efficient, but this is by no means certain. It is to be presumed that the Government weighs each step carefully and is acting according to the best of its knowledge and ability. Certain it is that the Government cannot have any other objective than this: to bring the war to a victorious conclusion as quickly as possible; and it also is certain that any criticism of, and objection to, its measures and proposals will tend to hold up its work and make its task more difficult, and will defer the achievement of the ultimate goal, <span class="page-break">\3</span>which is victory and a good and just peace.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, only those can be called strictly loyal who are co-operating with the Government and are doing everything possible to assure the Government of a reliable majority in both Houses in the next Congressional elections in November. Hence, only those can be called "loyalists", who favor the candidates of the Administration. If leaders of the other party claim to be loyal or call themselves "loyalists," we feel called upon to contradict them. And if people and newspapers that notoriously and openly oppose the Government at every uncalled-for occasion call themselves the standard-bearers and guardians of "loyalty" and suspect all who do not agree with them, they are merely being ridiculous, to put it mildly, and we have some doubts as to their sanity as citizens.</p>
   <p>Illinois has to elect a Senator in November. Tomorrow, in the primary elections, we will find out who will be the candidates for this office. On the Democratic ticket there appear three names, two of which we can disregard altogether. Both <span class="page-break">\4</span>Democratic organizations declare themselves for Senator James Hamilton Lewis, who, at the request of the President, is running for re-election and will naturally be the candidate of the loyal Democratic party and all true "loyalists". Three well-known men are running for the Republican nomination, and to a genuine "loyalist" they seem like birds of a feather. All three are undoubtedly loyal in the broader sense of the word, but all three are unreliable "customers" for the Administration--disloyal in the stricter sense. And in the case of one of them, the "loyalty" question was made an issue of during the campaign!</p>
   <p>The "second" candidate is called "disloyal" by the "first" candidate, because he talked against war before war was declared, and the "third" is called "disloyal", because he does not withdraw in favor of the "first".</p>
   <p>This seems to be somewhat strange, for it betrays a lack of legitimate claims for the nomination, and reminds many people of the derogatory remark: "Patriotism is the last refuge, etc." But all this is merely incidental: we, the real loyalists, are not much interested in this family quarrel. As the opponent <span class="page-break">\5</span>[of Lewis] in the fall elections, one seems to us as good as the other. But we protest most emphatically against the attempt to make the result of the Republican Senatorial primary a criterion for the loyalty of Illinois and, especially, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Chicago's good name is not at stake. The loyalty of Chicago, to say nothing of Illinois, must not be questioned, regardless of who gets the Republican nomination for the United States Senate. The fact that a candidate asserts, or has others assert for him, that he alone is "loyal," does not make him so by any means. Such presumption, or the denouncing of his opponents, is not apt to win votes, but will rather do the opposite, and will help the opponents in their fight. Such votes [i.e., the votes alienated by the tactics of the self-styled "loyalist" candidate], may secure the nomination for his opponent, but they cannot be called disloyal votes, nor can they cast any doubt on the loyalty of the citizens of Chicago or the State.</p>
