   <p>During the last few weeks the Chicago Tribune has been trying, in a careful, methodical manner, to ascertain just what attitude the public would take toward a war involving the United States and Spain; in yesterday's edition an analysis is given of the relations between the two nations.</p>
   <p>German newspapers use terribly cumbersome terms in speaking of this subject, referring to it as the "official communications and expositions of the dominant penchants of the authorities". In ordinary language it amounts to this: The United States is making the fleet ready, not because a war with Spain in the offing, but because a change in our relations is possible and this, in turn, would lead to war.</p>
   <p>This is the way it works: The President will recommend to Congress that it recognize the Cuban revolutionaries as belligerents. If that happens, Spain need not declare war, and probably will not. But, on the strength of the agreement of 1795, Spain will begin searching all American vessels on the high seas. And the search for contraband will be performed with the usual deliberate rowdiness and impertinence, with the result that the United States will have to adopt war measures as a matter of necessity. Or at least this will be true: that it will be exceedingly difficult to avert a rupture with Spain, because of the antiquated search law.</p>
   <p>So much for the Chicago Tribune. What that paper states is plain enough. It means that President Grant desires so to shape things that Congress will have no alternative but to declare war. But he wants to arrange matters in such a way that the blame for the war will fall on Spain and not on the United States.</p>
   <p>The objects of the war, according to the Tribune, would be manifold; for instance, abolition of slavery in Cuba and great commercial benefits for the United States through the elimination of import tariffs in Cuba.</p>
   <p>But that is all bosh. [Translator's note: The English word "bosh" occurs in the original]. The true purpose of such a premeditated war would be: 1) The reelection of President Grant; 2) the realization of better times through stupendous expenditures of new paper money.</p>
   <p>The latter, especially, is the essence of the matter. Those politicians who are not as conserned about the welfare of the country as with their own advancement ran into a blind alley with the money question. The paper money adherents find that the opponents of the paper swindle--and the hard money people find that the friends of the greenback swindle--are stronger than they expected.</p>
   <p>The political parties are each divided by the money question; that is, in both political parties, the Republican as well as the Democratic, the hard-coin and the paper-money advocates are about equally represented.</p>
   <p>The struggle cannot be decided on mere principles without disintegrating both parties. However, if a war could be started, then the argument could be transferred from the realm of principles to that of expediency.</p>
   <p>One would proceed in this fashion: "We are at war; we did not desire it, but Spain compelled us to fight. Money is necessary to wage a war. How can we get funds?</p>
   <p>"We cannot obtain capital by raising taxes during the present depression; loans--or bonds--bear a high interest rate; hence; 'Paper money'!"</p>
   <p>Just as was the case fourteen years ago, the demand for paper money would be regarded as patriotic.</p>
   <p>The question would be answered as follows: "The man who is so despicable as to demand that the United States acquiesce in Spain's cruelty, is the only one who protests against the use of paper money, which is indispensable for financing the war! After all, the Supreme Court considered it a 'military necessity' (if nothing else) to recognize noninterest-bearing, compulsory loans as legal; in other words, the expenditure of irredeemable paper money is fully lawful.</p>
   <p>"Very well then, on the strength of military expediency put more (paper) money into circulation and thus create better times."</p>
   <p>This just about represents the schemes of those politicians who desire a war with Spain. Only the immediate and obvious benefits accruing to the few are being comtemplated, whereas the future economic welfare of the country is deliberately ignored because, "Apres nous le deluge!"</p>
   <p>There are circumstances in the lives of nations when the invocation of God's judgement--war--becomes unavoidable, and our form of government is no protection against such a contingency, as the history of the United States and that of other republics has shown. Popular governments, as well as kingdoms and empires, have been embroiled in bloody wars. Hence a conflict between the United States and Spain may become an unavoidable necessity.</p>
   <p>So far it is not and need not be; and such bloodshed may only be provoked if the ill will of the American administration insists upon it. If that bad intention is present, then let us hope that our thinking and intelligent representatives in Congress will firmly insist upon one point: Whoever wants to dance must pay the piper; or--to put it in another way--the costs of war should be met by direct taxation, not by loans, or--a thing that is even worse--by means of objectionable mediums of exchange (paper money), which would lay a burden upon future generations.</p>
   <p>No war is the best policy. The next best is a war with its financial phases honestly managed--not by unprincipled loans, swindle, and fraud.</p>
