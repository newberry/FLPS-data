   <p>That the war would end favoring the side America was on was to be expected. The immense strength which our peaceful and democratically organized nation has developed as a war power was simply irresistible. During the war it was essentially our task, therefore, to do our part in rallying all citizens of this republic unanimously around the Stars and Stripes and in keeping the unity of the nation unshaken.</p>
   <p>But the period of reconstruction presents special and more difficult problems. To gain the victory was comparatively easy; to rebuild under entirely different conditions, once victory was accomplished, is quite another thing. The reorganization of the world on this basis is a herculean task of dimensions <span class="page-break">2</span>that mankind has never before had to face.</p>
   <p>To mention just some of the problems that have to be solved: the adjustment of the various races to the new order of things; the autonomy of nations; a world federation; the organization of a league of all the nations of the world; the internal political development of the different nations; the problem of international guarantees and treaties; the formation of an international police; disarmament and freedom of the seas; trade pacts, etc. This is a startling list of intricate problems, which can gradually be solved only by experts in political science who are endowed with inexhaustible patience, good judgment, unselfishness, and a keen appreciation of prevailing conditions.</p>
   <p>In this labyrinth of problems to be solved, what, then, is our function?</p>
   <p>As we are now organized, our main interest is in the future of the German people as a member of this world federation. We know the German people and the conditions in Germany, and we are, therefore, able to render an incalculable <span class="page-break">3</span>service to the striving German masses in their desire to develop a democratic form of government. We can point out to them, better than anybody else, what America's ideas of a government by the people really mean and what America has striven for and accomplished. Our political experience and training as citizens of a free community will be of great service. We can help them to avoid the errors and pitfalls which are recorded in the history of this country, and by which any people are threatened that would build up a democratic state. We can afford to do all this without the danger of being misunderstood, for we are doing it as the friends of German democracy. Our motives are free from bitterness and enmity. During this grave crisis we have clearly proved that we have honestly and successfully considered it our task to protect the good reputation of the German people and the American citizens of German blood from unwarranted criticism on the one hand and, on the other, from Germany's self-appointed rulers who have abused people of German blood over here as well as over there.</p>
   <p>Another service which we can render in reconstructing the world has to do with <span class="page-break">4</span>the grouping of races in the new world order. German science has done much research in ethnic psychology. Under the blind and power-drunk leadership of a military autocracy this branch of science was, unfortunately, completely wrecked. The German government has done a marvelous job of misunderstanding and misinterpreting the mentality of her enemies and particularly that of the American people including the German-Americans. It has now become our task to restore ethnic psychology to its proper place and so to enable the German people to comprehend and appreciate the racial spirit of other nations. Why could not the German and the Slav, the Nordic and the Mediterranean type, the Latin and the Semitic races, the European and the Asiatic, find a way of approach, in order mutually to recognize one another's good points, to tolerate differences, and to co-operate in sciences and commerce? Here in this country we have a realization of this mingling of races, through which we are building a nation of international character, which in turn enables us to show the world how all nations of the world may fraternize. What is possible in the United States of America should also be feasible in the <span class="page-break">5</span>United States of the World. The American Friends of German Democracy in this country have started a movement to facilitate the coming together of the various racial units and will continue their efforts in this respect.</p>
   <p>And last, but not the least important, is the service which our society can render the Americans of German descent after the war. We have observed much disintegration among them; much unnecessary antagonism and many misunderstandings have become apparent. Under the banner of democracy--even if it should be the black, red, and gold of the German Republic--let Americans of German blood unite with Americans of other racial strains in a powerful and courageous effort to bring liberty to the world. What the late German - American National Bund could not accomplish our society can bring about, namely, to create a rallying point, to unite all those, whether of German blood or not, who still believe that Americans of German descent and the German people themselves, through their science, art, and industry, have made valuable contributions to American culture and civilization, to American commerce, American <span class="page-break">6</span>art, and American industry. The National Bund went bankrupt because it attempted to segregate the so-called German element from the other American elements in the interest of purely German ideals, or perhaps even in the interest of the government of the German Reich itself. But we can hope for success because we do not ask for the recognition of German accomplishments merely out of vainglorious racial pride. We realize that the implanting of German talents in American soil that they may mature and flourish within the life of the American community, is just as important as the existence of these talents. We are therefore gratified to have had the opportunity to become part of a great people which could make use of these talents. In other words, our efforts are primarily directed toward the Americanization of the German cultural contributions rather than toward their preservation as a thing apart, as an alien body. In this sense, I am sure, the American Friends of German Democracy still have a great task before them.</p>
