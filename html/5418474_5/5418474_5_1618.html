   <p>It has been repeatedly claimed by people in our country that the United States of America is not proper soil for social legislation. These citizens take great pride in "rugged individualism," as President Hoover expressed it, and they insist that welfare laws, as, for instance, the ones which have been perfected in Germany during the last decades, and which could well serve as models, are not suitable for America.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, a wide breach has been made in the ramparts of this contention. Old-age pensions are being advocated more widely, and twenty-two states have already adopted them. It is even said that these states are feeling no ill effects from this action. The people who are receiving state pensions are relieved of the necessity of spending their remaining years in a home for <span class="page-break">2</span>the aged.</p>
   <p>But this is not the only advantage of old-age pensions. It is pointed out that through the institution of this social measure those pitiable creatures who looked for employment despite their advanced age, and who were willing to work for "starvation" wages in order to continue their wretched existence have vanished from the labor market. And finally it is stated with much emphasis that old-age pensions are really no burden on the state. Old people's homes are very expensive institutions, chiefly because they are under the management of politicians who, as is well known, are very wasteful. Old-age pensions are small, but they at least protect the recipients against want; and, since they involve little opportunity for graft, they even save money for the state.</p>
