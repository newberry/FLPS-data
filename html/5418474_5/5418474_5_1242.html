   <p>Today, anyone visiting the German Consulate could see that something extraordinary was in progress; for in the corridors of the ninth floor of the Gas Building, where the German Consulate is located, there were dozens of men who were talking excitedly--they were reporting for duty in the service of Germany.</p>
   <p>However, until now, the pressure has not been very strong. According to a statement made to a reporter from the Abendpost by Vice-Consul Baron von Reiswitz, there are less than a thousand men living in this city who are subject to call to military service in Germany, and of these not a hundred have registered. The men who live in Chicago are advised to go calmly about their usual business until it is known when they can be transported.</p>
   <p>It is self-evident that they must register immediately.</p>
   <p>The question of transportation is the great difficulty. The German Government has not even given directions concerning fare for indigent men who are liable to service. But the Consul would undoubtedly act on his own responsibility in this matter if he knew when the men concerned could board ship in the eastern ports. The transportation from here to the Atlantic coast would be by special train, but there is an obstacle in the matter of ships. It is true that the Consul had a well-founded private report today that the "Vaterland" would sail despite all rumors to the contrary; but that does not indicate, by any means, that local men who are obligated to serve in the military forces of Germany will be permitted to board this ship. There can be no definite information on this subject from Washington, since the German Ambassador is on leave of absence at present. However, it is assumed at the Consulate that the German Naval Attache has gone to New York to take charge of transportation matters. As soon as the Consulate has definite information on the subject, it will be published in the columns of the Abendpost.</p>
   <p>Asked whether he knew anything about the formation of a regiment of German volunteers alluded to in morning papers in the English language, the Consul admitted that such a step may be planned, but that he knew nothing about it.</p>
   
   <p>He pointed out that such undertakings are beyond his authority and that he could not sanction them under any circumstances. Baron von Reiswitz expressed deep regret that he cannot join his regiment--he is a first lieutenant of the reserves of the First Artillery Regiment--since duty keeps him here.</p>
   <p>After leaving the Consulate, the reporter talked with a gentleman who had just reported for duty. It developed that he had lived hare for many years, had his "first papers," and would become a full-fledged citizen of this country on September 4. He has acquired a prominent position in musical circles, has a wife and children, and owns a home. Although he is subject to only the second call for home defense, he considered himself honor-bound to report for service.</p>
   <p>The Call to Colors</p>
   <p>"His Majesty, the German Emperor, has ordered the mobilization of all war forces, on land and at sea.</p>
   <p>"All persons who are on furlough in foreign countries are to return to Germany immediately, even though they receive no official notice. This class of combatants includes all officers, doctors, officials, and men of the Reserve, Marine Reserve, Home Defense, and Marine Defense, as well as all men of the Supplementary Army and Marine Reserves.</p>
   <p>"Since transportation is greatly restricted, it is advisable that men who are duty bound to return immediately inform the nearest German Consulate of their present address, so that they may be notified in case of an opportunity for passage.</p>
   <p>"Von Reiswitz, Imperial Consul"</p>
   <p>In a meeting held at the North Side Turnhalle yesterday, the Deutscher Kriegerverein (German Warriors' Society) appropriated two hundred and fifty dollars from its treasury as its first contribution to the Red Cross. President Joseph Schlenker received instructions to forward the money immediately. In addition, all members who are subject to service in the German armed forces were requested to report for duty at the German Consulate without delay. The families of those who report will receive every possible financial support.</p>
