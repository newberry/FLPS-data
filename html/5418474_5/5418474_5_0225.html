   <p>It was about fifteen years ago when the renown English sociologist, William T. Stead, published his book, If Christ Came to Chicago. Mr. Stead was at the height of his popularity at that time, and his book caused much interest and found a ready market. But the success of the title was greater than that of the book itself. The title became a household word, as it were, and it was used by many, even by some who had not read the book itself, upon divers occasions, and in all manner of variations, to designate the change of things, views, and thoughts.</p>
   <p>Today, as the nation observes the one-hundred-and-tenth anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, that title looms up out of the past; for, although the nation is in a serious condition, and the political parties are in the midst of a bitter fight, and the Government must contend with great difficulties, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>yet the leaders of the Republican party are inconsiderately opposing the Administration, using exceedingly petty and unscrupulous ways and means to increase the difficulties of the party in power. Still the Republican party, even today, calls itself the party of Abraham Lincoln, and maintains, even today, as it did forty and fifty years ago, that it is imbued with Lincoln's spirit and that it acts according to Lincoln's ideas. Such boasting tempts us to ask, "If Lincoln came to Washington today, if Lincoln returned to us mortals and resumed participation in the politics of our country, what stand would he take?"</p>
   <p>Surely, he would not take sides with the Republicans, who through their leaders and organs constantly carp at, and secretly try to frustrate, the President's efforts to organize a league of nations and bring about a permanent and just peace. Most assuredly Lincoln would not side with those to whom England's will is law, and who try to make our nation believe that America will have permanent peace and security only if America unconditionally acknowledges England's continued dominion of the seas (and thus England's world dominion), bows down before England's will and power, and is satisfied to be England's vassal, "yes <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>man," and bootblack.</p>
   <p>As to the question, what Lincoln's attitude would be toward the problems which now engage the attention of the world, and that of our nation especially, various opinions are possible. It is impossible that anybody who has any knowledge of Lincoln's character and ideals would believe that, in regard to the league of nations and the freedom of the seas, he would agree with those who call themselves "Lincoln's party" and claim to act in his spirit. It is absolutely certain that "Honest Abe" would not recognize those Republicans (be they in Congress or outside of Congress) who did their level best to obstruct the shipbuilding program of the Government, as exponents and preservers of his ideals. It is true that he would cast the present ruling element of the Republican party out of his temple and would brand their claim that they are "Lincoln's party" as an arrogant assumption, as gross deceit and fraud.</p>
   <p>For Lincoln was a genuine American, in body and spirit. To him the "Union"--America!--was paramount to everything else. Never could he have entertained <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the thought that citizens of this Republic would recommend or tolerate America's submission to any foreign power, whether it be for fear of, or for friendship for, that power. And Lincoln was a good democrat in the fullest sense of that term. Undoubtedly he would oppose the present leaders of the Republicans on other important issues--perhaps on all important issues of the day.</p>
