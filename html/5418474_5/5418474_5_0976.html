   <p>What one doesn't know doesn't hurt, but neither does it prevent one from making errors and mistakes. We cannot expect even a fairly good appraisal of the responsibilities for this war from the average Anglo-American, because he simply does not know the real causes. Neither could we ask for any such knowledge and understanding, because he has not the slightest inkling of the economic, political, and racial background of Europe. Neither can we expect him, without any assistance, to evaluate the great potential danger which England's alliance with Japan constitutes for this country. The American will find it difficult to see that this country may eventually be plunged into the war, thanks to this country's British-controlled press and the Anglophile attitude of large and influential sections of the population. The American does not know his own American history, and least of all does he understand the true relationship between England and the United States; he is not aware of the many shady deals by which the beloved "Mother Country," under the cloak of <span class="page-break">\2</span>friendship, has duped him.</p>
   <p>For example, the American does not know the story of the former "military" boundary of the state of Maine, established at the conclusion of the Revolutionary War. This boundary followed the watershed between the St. Lawrence River and the Atlantic Ocean, ran north to a point about twenty miles from Quebec, and then along the mountain crest at the southwest bank of the St. Lawrence River, thus controlling the southwest bank, the opposite Canadian bank, and all connecting highways between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Quebec and Montreal, including a hinterland nearly 150 miles deep; the (average) American does not know that in 1842 the beloved "Mother Country" succeeded in talking Uncle Samuel out of this strategically important frontier and in moving it south into the flat country, where it was dominated by the Canadian mountain range with the result that Canada's highways are now completely safe, but the United States is left without any Canadian frontier that can be defended successfully. The (average) American does not know that by pretending <span class="page-break">\3</span>to be a friend England managed to make this Republic give up a small, but extremely valuable strip of territory situated west of Lake Superior and containing an abundance of minerals; and further, that in 1846 they [the British] succeeded in inducing the United States to relinquish the "Fifty-four forty" frontier (54.40 north latitude) west of the Rocky Mountains, and to be satisfied with the present northern boundary of Washington, whereby the English secured British Columbia with her important Pacific coast. And so on. The average Anglo-American does not know the history of his own country, at least not the history of Great Britain's relations and dealings with this country, because he either was not taught at all or, if so, with a biased and incorrect interpretation. The school textbooks were written by Englishmen from the British point of view, whereas older history books, telling of British perfidies, frauds and crooked deals, were withdrawn from circulation.</p>
   <p>The Anglo-American, thanks to his ignorance, is compelled to believe blindly and <span class="page-break">\4</span>to repeat that which was told him regarding the past, and he can therefore judge contemporary events only superficially, by their outward appearances. But even at that, some things should have become clear to him by now; if he would look toward Mexico, for instance, he might try to find the solution for the constant strife and unrest which prevails there. The smartest "Philadelphia Lawyer" would be at a loss to explain intelligently what these men, Carranza, Villa, etc., are fighting for--so long as he tried to find the solution in Mexico itself; neither could he locate the source of the funds which those various generals still seem to have for their revolutionary campaigns--as long as he looked for that money in Mexico.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the fighting goes merrily on in Mexico and the leaders of all parties involved seem to have plenty of dough. But where did they get it? Who could be interested in keeping trouble rife in Mexico, especially with the possibility that the United States might also become involved? Who else but Japan, which has or had a secret treaty with Mexico, and which loves us so much <span class="page-break">\5</span>on account of our policy in the Far East, and England, which was helped by Japan against Germany and therefore is obligated--especially since she expects Japan to help her some more!</p>
