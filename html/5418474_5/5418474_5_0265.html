   <p>Gustave Mery, the editor of the Paris newspaper L'Oeuvre, said recently in an editorial: "Our reactionary press, which does not yet dare to utter even a sound regarding the Russian expedition, indulges continually in an infamous campaign against Wilson. Certain dailies suddenly discover private American correspondents who cable them information designed to create the impression that Wilson never really represented the United States. Everybody (in the United States) was supposed to be against Wilson; everyone, from the Senate on down, seems strongly opposed to a league of nations."</p>
   <p>Paris reports, moreover, that dispatches from Washington and New York have depicted the President not only as a daydreamer with his head in the clouds, as far as his ideas are concerned, but also as an insane imperialist, who cleverly conceals is ambitions under the pretense of working for world peace.</p>

   <p>"What is the object of this maneuver?" asks the above-mentioned French publicist. "Obviously, to isolate Wilson, to discourage and weaken him; to frustrate the carrying out of his program and to induce the Peace Congress to abandon the idea of a league of nations. They want to relegate the most pressing problems to the distant future. If they had their way, world peace would merely provide a theme for belated academic oratory."</p>
   <p>These reports from Paris only confirm what anybody over here who could see and hear, and did not deliberately shut his eyes and ears, must have noticed for a long time. For quite a while a well-organized and efficient campaign has been in progress to discredit the President in the eyes of European nations. It is a well-known fact that this fight against Woodrow Wilson was started by Republican leaders in and out of Congress, and that the Republican faction in the Senate, under the leadership of Senator Lodge and supported by some so-called Democrats who are--shall we say--more un-American than democratic, is determined to negotiate, more or less openly, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with the spokesmen and probable peace delegates of the European powers, and to influence them against President Wilson and his peace objectives. And, finally, there can be no doubt about the purpose of these machinations: It looks like an attempt to cheat America out of her glory and moral greatness, to secure success for the more or less selfish and injust peace aims of other powers at the expense of America's ideals, and to cede the exalted position to which this great Republic is entitled to a foreign power--a procedure which we can call nothing, but treason. Even to the casual observer it must seem that people who are doin their utmost to discredit the President of their country, who is abroad on such a difficult mission, and who call his plans "castles in the air", are nothing but enemies in disguise--any thing but good Americans.</p>
   <p>In the case of some "leaders" in the fight against the President, that may be correct; but for the great majority it is not. They are not so bad. At least they do not wilfully and purposely betray America's reputation and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>greatness--they may become traitors merely because of their selfish and shortsighted partisanship, their greed for power and fat jobs.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately it is nothing but partisan political interests and the ambition to rule, or the influence of the Roosevelts and Lodges, which causes opposition to Wilson and his noble ideals. The purpose is to postpone the conclusion of peace until march 4, when the Senate will have a republican majority; to frustrate the adoption, by the European powers of some of Wilson's peace points, and otherwise to talk so much and be talked about, that the actual peace treaty can be called a Republican accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The Repbulicans have their eye on 1930, and they do not want the Democratic administration, which they could not push into the war fast enough, to receive credit for a peace treaty, especially of the type desired by wilson, for they are perfectly aware that such a peace would destroy the chances <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of the current Republican leaders and the elements behind them for a long time to come, probably forever.</p>
   <p>That is the gist of the matter but, strictly speaking, the campaign against the President is still treason--not exactly high treason, but treason to America's high ideals, to the American conception of democracy, which, because of this opposition, will fall into discreditin Europe.</p>
