   <p>President Wilson is a man of peace. He has done his best during these stormy times to preserve peace for the country. The scorn and ridicule of his adversaries have not stopped him.</p>
   <p>When war was forced upon him by the resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare and by other overt acts of the German Government against the dignity and the interests of America, he called for a war against the German Government only, not against the German people. He emphasized that "we respect and love" the German people and want only what is for their best interest. He declared--and he said it repeatedly in all his following proclamations and speeches--that America has no selfish war aims, that she is not fighting for territorial expansion or war indemnities but for the democratic ideal which promises all peoples freedom and <span class="page-break">\2</span>the right of self-determination.</p>
   <p>In this way President Wilson made this war a political war at the moment when it threatened to turn into a war of races--a war against the German race.</p>
   <p>In his program of war and peace aims and in his various manifestoes, President Wilson has always strongly emphasized that the destruction of the autocratic peril and the strengthening and propagation of the democratic idea constituted the first and most important war aims of America and that the peace which America--Wilson's America--desired, must be a peace which is just to all peoples and must be a peace which is permanent. While the Allies were talking about a commercial war after the war, President Wilson stated, repeatedly and expressly, that a war after the war was out of the question. While the mouthpieces of England and France advocated a "league" of those nations now fighting Germany, President Wilson <span class="page-break">\3</span>demanded the establishment of a league of all nations. When it was said from the British and French side that acceptance of Germany into the league of nations was out of the question, our President declared that Germany and her Allies must become members of the league and that, outside or inside of this league of nations, no alliances or group interests should be formed.</p>
   <p>With this statement he formulated as a war aim a peace in which all peoples would enjoy equal rights and be given the same opportunities; to every one that which is rightfully his; a peace which would not permit national jealousies or racial hatred--in short, a permanent peace, or rather the permanent peace. For only a peace based on absolute justice toward all nations, in which there is no room for revenge and hate, can be a permanent one.</p>
   <p>What the best and greatest minds of the German people, Goethe, Schiller, etc., dreamed of and desired, namely, freedom and fraternity of all nations, <span class="page-break">\4</span>was by President Wilson made the goal of the American - of his own - war and peace policy.</p>
   <p>An ideal objective! Whether it will be accomplished, or how far, will depend on the support which President Wilson receives from his own people. It is certain that the goal will be brought nearer, if not completely reached, if President Wilson's personally endorsed candidates are successful in tomorrow's election. There cannot be the slightest doubt, even for a moment, that a peace without hatred and revenge, a peace of friendly competition and co-operation between nations, would be the best for all nations involved. It is equally certain that such a peace, if it does not come now (in case President Wilson does not prove powerful enough to bring it about) must come later. For Europe's people will have realized that only peaceful co-operation which makes full use of each nation's energy and special ability, will justify the hope of an early reconstruction of the wealth and prosperity that has been destroyed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The American people will give themselves a very poor testimonial if they do not give their full support to the noble policy of humanity and justice, of a peace free from hatred and revenge. The citizens of German stock and those of Bohemian, Polish, Croatian and Slavonic descent, especially, who still feel love and loyalty for the land of their fathers, would have to be absolutely blind, not to support the President and to help him as much as possible to bring about a peace which promises their land of origin, prosperity and undisturbed development after a century old hatred of peoples and nationalities and the sufferings which result from it.</p>
   <p>They would be blind fools and traitors to the best traditions of democracy and to their own and their children's best personal interests if they, as citizens of a republic that wants to bring liberation to Europe's jealous nationalities, should tolerate or even cultivate such jealousy among themselves and work against one another when they should really stand together to promote the general welfare.</p>
