   <p>Possessed of all the characteristics of German idealism, I acknowledged, even admired, this country's organizations, and the excellent human traits of its people. Occasional disappointments in regard to politics and justice, art, and literature, did not alter my opinion, taking into consideration this country's early state of cultural development.</p>
   
   <p>But since the outbreak of the European war, I have lost faith in Americanism; perplexed I face facts which are incomprehensible, America's alliance with England, a country with the personification of egotism toward this country, the alliance with Russia, a country of notorious non-culture, of gross ignorance and superstition, - American in alliance with nations of greed, revenge and barbarity, fighting against Germany, a country of stable morals, which is waging a battle for the existence of civilization, whose enemies are supported morally, secretly and openly in every way by America!</p>
   <p>If this favoritism really is approved by the American people, I should regret to belong to these people, because the characteristics of the Germans are that, above all amenities of life, even higher than life itself, are the conceptions of truth, right and honor.</p>
   
   <p>To be helplessly surrounded by such a filthy mass of lies and hatred on the part of the supposed impartial Americans, to witness how defamation increases, and more and more fellow-citizens, without proper judgment, are drawn into this fatal muddle, is enough to drive one to despair.</p>
   <p>The only consolation is, that the opinions of the unscrupulous newspapers do not represent the state of mind of the great American people. We protested in huge mass meetings against the harassing of Germans in the newspapers, against the partial and non-neutral exportations of arms, we gathered millions of signatures and sent them to Washington, but what is the result?</p>
   
   <p>As soon as the storm of indignation is over, the individual goes back to every day life, he argues with and scolds every willing listener against this most revolting injustice, but he stands alone and lonely with a few, in hundreds and thousands of single groups and societies, which among themselves have no connections, and therefore cannot succeed. In addition, the leaders of the many German societies are not harmonizing; every group is striving for superiority, thus causing friction and omitting unity of force, but I believe when they realize the hour of danger and the fight for their existence approaches, the leaders will forget their egotistical interests, get together and form one strong unit. Then the work of organization can begin, members and friends will join this free union, a strong massive unit will be created, with the power to carry a decisive vote in the government decisions.</p>
   
   <p>The important problem to be considered is the legality of exportation of arms, whereby the war could be shortened and, in all probability, soon be over. How can the fair Americans account for helping those forces, greatly superior in numbers, through immense deliveries of arms? These exportations of arms will be a brand of infamy in the history of America, if not for the government, then for those people who are fattening on this bloodmoney. Our honor demands to protest indefatigably against exportations of arms, even if our protests are futile. We cannot stop protesting against this outrage; if through silence and being without energy, we participate in guilt, and, indirectly, profit from this bloodmoney, in the eternally repeated fight of the superior forces of injustice against right, vulgarity, and lowness against virtue, darkness against light, and for the better future of mankind.</p>
