   <p>In a meeting at Holy Trinity Church, the officers of the Chicago District Society were ordered to issue an appeal to all German Catholics to participate in the mass meeting at the Auditorium at eight o'clock this evening. They are urged to co-operate with other German organizations in making this the greatest mass demonstration ever held in this city.</p>
   <p>We Catholics condemn war with all its attendant horrors, but when we are forced to fight, as our fatherland has been compelled to fight, the least we can do is to prove to our fellow citizens that the "sacred right" is on the side of our native land.</p>
   <p>Chicago District Society</p>
   <p>Paul H. Koesner, president,</p>
   <p>Michael Walsdorf, secretary.</p>
