   <p>The expectation that twenty-five million dollars' worth of War Savings Stamps would be sold yesterday, which was the first day of the campaign for their sale, was sadly disappointed, partly because of the rainy weather. However, headquarters were able to report a result of about half a million dollars.</p>
   <p>The best success was scored by the Foreign Department, which sold two hundred and twenty thousand dollars' worth of Stamps on that first day. Of this sum, the greatest single amount was paid in by the German group, namely, forty thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The Post Office sold one hundred thousand dollars' worth of Stamps and the Federal Reserve Bank twelve hundred dollars' worth.</p>
