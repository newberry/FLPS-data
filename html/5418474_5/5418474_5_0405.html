   <p>William Hebs, 2734 Rokeby Street, a cornet player in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, has sued Leo Jaworowski, 2254 Fullerton Avenue, also a musician, for ten thousand dollars' damage, charging slander. The former was recently questioned by Assistant Federal District Attorney Borrelli for alleged unpatriotic remarks, but claims to have been completely exonerated. In spite of this, Jaworowski had denounced him as an enemy of the country. For that he is now asking satisfaction.</p>
