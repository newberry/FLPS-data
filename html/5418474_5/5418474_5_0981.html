   <p>They have been shooting off their big mouths again in London! The occasion was the inauguration of the new Lord Mayor of London. The noise was supposed to fool the rest of the world outside of London. But it does not fool us!</p>
   <p>A reply is not necessary. Nevertheless, it would be good to illuminate that illustrious event by presenting a few cold historical facts. It is useless to try to convince Americans. The Allies are held together by the same hand that keeps a gang of burglars together. Every member knows all the tricks and crimes of all the others, and all of them know the misdeeds of each. Everyone of them could send everyone else to the gallows. That's the only guarantee against the doublecross! If one of them should ever start talking, God help the rest of the gang! That is why even the worst among these criminals is treated like a gentleman, and everyone has to return the compliment. How long will that harmony last? Forever, they say. We'll see!</p>
   <p>How do the Allies fight for civilization? It is interesting to find out. Only too often have we had to refer to their works of "culture". England is known in all corners of the earth. She is feared because she dominates the seas. And that is the only reason why her colonies are still safe, for the time being. The moment this authority is relaxed, her colonies would revolt.</p>
   
   <p>The English have done some civilizing work. They went to India with the Bible and opium. The Indians rejected the Bible because (and this is a matter of fact) they already had their own religion, and a much older one at that. They did not need a new one, because their own was good enough for them. But they took to the opium, and what the Indians could not consume the Persians and Chinese had to take. What Christian value was there in the distribution of millions of Bibles, if the distributors of them drove women and children into the arms of this horrible demon opium? England's civilizing influence! That could make Satan laugh! The "most Christian" nation has no objection if millions of girls are married off at the age of ten. Why certainly! England is fighting for civilization; she has made a gigantic house of prostitution out of India. Why don't England's dear cousins on this side of the Atlantic talk about this "work of culture" of their dear relatives? Have those barbarians, the Teutons, every done anything of the kind? Civilized! Not one of the traders who sallied forth from England to conquer India could ever talk or read the flowerlike language of the Hindus.</p>
   
   <p>How, then, could they exert any civilizing influence on India's teeming millions? The British did not even gain respect as great military conquerors, because they did not come as warriors, but as merchants and traders, with opium as a dope.</p>
   <p>"Instead of a nation of heroic warriors, they appeared to the Indians as a horde of tradesmen", says an Indian scientist named Tahore. Of all the nations, these shopkeepers alone were too yellow to fight: they hired their"heroes" to fight for British civilization , i. e., business. As a nation, or in the field of administration, England cannot boast of a single cultural achievement. Her sole purpose and objective was business! Australia and Canada have become civilized without England's doings. England's highest dignitaries, who made speeches in London, were fortunate that nobody asked them when and where England had promoted culture after her missionaries and mercenaries had once obtained a foothold. Since the fall of the Byzantine empire, no nation more arrogant, frivolous, and cowardly has ever sprawled all over the earth. She made herself mistress of the seas, because she had stolen and hoarded enough wealth to outdo all other nations in building her navy. Other nations had to do the fighting for England's glory, and had to make great sacrifices. England herself knew only how to grab! And that's what her "big shots" call "civilizing"!</p>
   <p>It is hard to see how England could do any civilizing. Her scientists would have to have some measure of ability. When her present ally, France, had become weak, the sneak thief stole into Egypt. Besides India, the land of the Pharaohs is known as one of the oldest seats of culture in history. What were these shopkeepers looking for on this ancient and sacred soil? Only money, and they made it any way they could, honestly and otherwise. The research and development that has been done during the past fifty years in Egypt and ancient Babylon was principally the work of German scientists. No Englishman was ever able to read a book in an Oriental language before German scientists had translated this ancient literature. Up to today, all Arabic works are printed in German. The English can thank German scientists for being able to read something about the four religions of the Orient, Mohammedanism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Brahmanism. But it is England which "civilizes" people! She did not produce one scientist who knew the literature of the peoples she had the crust to subjugate. The "German babarians" had to help the shopkeepers get acquainted with Oriental culture.</p>
   <p>Treitschke--and Emerson agrees with him--says of Macaulay, the greatest English historian: "Macaulay shows a lack of philosophical education which a German "Fuchs" literally[Fox, German student expression for freshman] would be ashamed of."</p>
   <p>It is not saying too much if we predict that, in this war, the British "shilling soldiers" will,for the first time,have to do actual fighting. From the battle of Blenheim to the battle of Belle Alliance [Waterloo] the Germans had to come to their rescue. It was the young Dessauler [Prussian general] who saved Marlborough. Gilbraltar was taken by a German prince for the benefit of the British shopkeepers. One June 15, 1815, Bluecher [Prussian general] saved the battle of Waterloo for the Duke of Wellington. Truly, the English are some promoters of civilization! "During the Boer War," writes Delbrueck [German historian and statesman], an absolute authority, "the'shilling soldiers' tied Boer women together and used them as a shield against the enemy by driving them before them." The "shilling soldiers. "used to throw up their hands in surrender by the time every tenth man of them had been wounded. And these yellowbacks Lord Kitchener refers to as "our courageous British army". But this time they won't be able to dodge, either to the right or to the left, because the French are flanking them.</p>
   <p>The leader of the French radical party, Caillaux, whose wife had shot and killed the editor of the Paris newspaper Figaro, went to the front as a volunteer. Recently he was sent to the guard house for a week and when Joffre, commander-in-chief, learned of his case, the punishment was doubled. And what was the crime? Caillaux had criticised the British army! And in a German prison camp, Englishmen and Frenchmen had to be given separate quarters, because they were fighting with one another every day. The French have experienced England's friendship to their sorrow, even though we hear a lot of hokum today about their alliance, which is supposed to be as solid as a rock. And the Russian? He didn't have anything to say. He only ate and drank. Maybe Asquith, Balfour, and Cambon remembered, just in time, an essay of the Danish author Alse in the Copenhagen Dageblad, in which he made the assertion that, at the time of the Boer War, the Czar of Russia had made the proposal to Kaiser Wilhelm II to attack England and divide up the British Empire. Supposing Wilhelm had been like England or Japan? But! The Allies are fighting for civilization, and the Germans are barbarians!</p>
