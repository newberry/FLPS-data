   <p>In the next Congress the American Legion and other veterans' organizations will attempt to put through a bill authorizing immediate payment of the so-called bonus to war veterans, over the President's veto, if necessary. It actually will be necessary, for it is unlikely that the President has changed his mind on this matter since his last veto. He will again veto the bill if it reaches him from Congress. It is likely that the House of Representatives will be able to secure the necessary two-thirds majority to pass the bill over the President's veto, but its fate in the Senate is uncertain, since this body does not depend so directly upon the favor of the veterans as does the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>The immediate payment of the bonus would be as unfortunate today as it would have been a year ago. It would endanger the value of the dollar <span class="page-break">\2</span>without giving the people any practical advantage or economic relief. A considerable number of the veterans are not in such distress that</p>
   <p>they need aid, and those who are will receive assistance like everybody else even though they do not get the bonus. It is difficult to see why there should be an extra chicken in the pot for war veterans. It was their duty as citizens to go to war; that they came back safely was their good fortune. Many of those who are squawking the loudest for the bonus never were at the front, never risked their lives on the battlefield. Those who were wounded, or those whose health was impaired in some other way, have been taken care of by this country in an exemplary manner, and will be in the future. The demand for the immediate payment of the bonus looks like a racket. To grant the demand would be to show favoritism toward a part of the people who are in general no more in need than the rest of the nation. It would be unjust and unfair.</p>
