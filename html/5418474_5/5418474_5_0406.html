   <p>The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the German-born members of which, especially the cellist, Bruno Steindel, have recently been charged with disloyalty, held a meeting yesterday in Ravinia Park. Manager Albert Ulrich delivered a speech, in the course of which he said:</p>
   <p>"If I ever hear the slightest disloyal or pro-German remark from anyone of you, I will report him not only to the orchestra society but also to the Department of Justice, to make him pay for his foolishness. The times are too serious for foolish remarks or sentimental devotion to the old country, too serious for anti-American speeches of any kind. Speak the American language, so that everyone can understand what you say; think before you say anything and always be aware of your duty toward the country we all love, the United States of American."</p>
   <p>After this speech, all members signified their approval by rising from their seats. As Mr. Ulrich explained later, much of this disloyalty talk could <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be traced to an attempt to break up the orchestra, and the charges made against Mr. Steindel were due to a personal grudge. Mr. Ulrich called attention to the fact that the wives of the orchestra members had proved their loyalty by doing work for the Red Cross and that the members themselves had subscribed $16,300 to the third Liberty Loan. All were loyal American citizens.</p>
   <p>Joseph Winkler, president of the Musician's Union, announced that the union would expel from its ranks not only those who were aliens, but also all disloyal members, whether citizens or not.</p>
