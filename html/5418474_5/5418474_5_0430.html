   <p>The United States has so far no uniformly conducted registration of its population, which is indeed most lamentable. Countries which incorporated such procedure into their statutes are at an advantage, inasfar as it simplifies matters, in case conditions arise in the interests of which a survey of the people's movement is of great benefit to the Government. It is a lesson which we have learned in the present War. If a record of the American population had been available, registration of eligible men to serve in the War would not have been necessary. The record would have also provided the reliable information in regard to the number of men an their respective age class. Furthermore, it would have divulged the information of the percentage of foreigners among these groups. Moreover, it would have disclosed the percentage of the hostile foreigners living in our midst. Registration of the population is also a great factor in the speedy seizure of escaped criminals, which, <span class="page-break">2</span>in its turn, helps to curb crime.. These two outstanding reasons mentioned above have been regarded by most European nations as sufficiently important to have given this paramount matter special attention years ago. The necessity for similar records has become apparent in America recently. However, this plan could become a success if uniform registration methods would be applied throughout the land.</p>
   <p>In order to introduce uniform registration methods, Congress will probably have to act upon it.</p>
