   <p>Those American newspapers which pose, more or less modestly, as the interpreters and promulgators of public opinion and as the pillars of true Americanism and patriotism during these critical days prove themselves as un-American as possible.</p>
   <p>While the President of the United States, in full appreciation of the tremendous responsibility which he is assuming, prepares to make a trip to Europe in order to preserve the interests of his country at the Peace Conference, and to safeguard the success and adoption of America's peace program, that section of the American press can find nothing better to do than to nag and to criticize everything the President decides to do; to belittle his actions in the eyes of the public, and to prophesy the failure of his plans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"President Wilson's Peace Commission," so it goes, "is the President himself.....He is the Commission.....President Wilson has not bothered to secure the best heads America had to offer for the job.....It is a mediocre commission, dominated by the peculiar genius of Mr. Wilson."</p>
   <p>There is no arguing about taste. Everybody considers his own ways better and more efficient than those of the next to follow. The fox thinks he is smarter than the lion and always believes that he knows more and can do everything better than the latter. And perhaps the fox is right as far as his own particular wishes and plans are concerned, but only in this respect.</p>
   <p>If, to those newspapers and to the people whose mouthpieces they are, the members of the Peace Commission seem inferior in quality, it is only because the members of the Commission are not of their kind. The reason that the newspapers dislike the fact that the President is, in reality, the whole Commission, and that the Commission is completely dominated by the President's peculiar genius, is that they themselves cannot dominate or influence the President.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>If they prophesy defeat for the President's plans and failure for all his efforts, they only do so because they have no use for his plans and begrudge the President his success; because they desire his defeat and failure. What one wishes, one likes to believe. And whatever is against his own interests and schemes, the average person tries to frustrate. No matter how noble or beneficial for the general welfare a thing may be, it will be fought by those selfish people who put their own interests and desires above those of anybody else. If that is human, it is also petty and shortsighted; by no means is it patriotic and American in the best sense of the word.</p>
   <p>Those would-be patriotic and American sheets, those newspapers, which at every suitable and unsuitable occasion pose as the advocates of the only genuine Americanism and patriotism and, at the same time, are so unpatriotic as to make the President's difficult task still more difficult if they can, are also un-American enough to belittle America's ideal peace aims and to deny them any practical value or possibility of success. And on what grounds? <span class="page-break">4</span>Simply because, they claim, American diplomacy is not the equal of European diplomacy; because the President could only pursue ideals, but not a practical and concrete success! But it was not so long ago that these same newspapers and people considered America fortunate beyond all measure because of its idealism, and would condemn the thought of America's entering the war for practical gains as something wholly unworthy. They were either insincere then or they are so now.</p>
   <p>"Circumstances alter cases." It all depends on the circumstances how a certain case presents itself to us. At that time one probably believed that President Wilson would be stupid enough to appoint, as members of the Peace Commission, men who did not agree with his own ideas and who had different objectives in mind than he himself. At that time one believed it possible to secure all the material gains for one's own party, and to manage the whole thing in such a way as to give the President just the glory of having sought an idealistic solution. Since the President has indicated that he intends to assume the <span class="page-break">5</span>full responsibility himself, and is consequently entitled to full credit if he succeeds, and blame if he should fail, his efforts are now pictured as a sort of wild-goose chase, as an enterprise which is doomed from the beginning. Well, what are the chances of success or failure?</p>
   <p>"Every other nation," it is said,"enters the conference to gain or lose something concrete and tangible. Each one will play its part during the negotiations with an eye on this tangible element of national dignity, power, and prosperity."</p>
   <p>Every other nation?--No, every nation! And the American nation not least. Yes, the American nation, above all others, will have an eye on national honor, power, and prosperity during this conference, thanks to the fact that the American Commission will be guided by the "peculiar genius of the President." For President Wilson will stick to the American ideals and, as far as America is concerned, will make good his pledge: to insist on absolute justice for all peoples, the freedom of the seas, and disarmament, and thereby America's <span class="page-break">6</span>honor, power, and prosperity will be increased immensely and will be gratefully acknowledged by all mankind. Thus America will immediately become the prototype of morality in the world and soon material gains will fall into her lap like ripe plums.</p>
   <p>On the other hand--if Wilson's peculiar genius should not dominate the American Peace Commission to the extent that everything possible be done to realize America's idealistic peace aims--in that case, America would humiliate herself, would rob herself of dignity and power, and would sink to the level of a despicable hireling and slave of foreign interests, and would show unjust and hypocritical selfishness.</p>
