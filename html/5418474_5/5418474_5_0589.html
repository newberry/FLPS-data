   <p>The insistent demands of the postal inspectors, particularly C. N. Moore, induced Mr. Polokow to discontinue the activities of the German Iron Cross Society. In a recent letter to Postmaster Campbell, Mr. Polokow, who is the founder of the above association, requested that he return to the senders all letters received by him.</p>
   <p>The German Austro-Hungarian Aid Society published repeated warnings in the German papers about the German Iron Cross Society. It appears that this association consisted mostly of just Mr. Polokow. The address was Room 730, Consumers Building, 220 South State Street. From this address many patriotic letters were mailed to the German public. These letters stated that the association intended to improve the conditions faced by German and Austro-Hungarian widows and orphans, and that for one dollar the contributor would be given a documentary, richly engraved charter membership card and an imitation of the iron cross, which could be worn in the button hole.</p>
   <p>In an interview with Postal Inspector Moore, Polokow failed to convince the official that the aims of the association were unselfish. Following the advice of the inspector, he then wrote the letter of capitulation to Postmaster Campbell.</p>
