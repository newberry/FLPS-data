   <p>President Wilson, in some of his recent utterances, has assumed the point of view that the United States Government had strictly maintained American rights toward England and her allies, and had also preserved strictest neutrality. It is not quite clear how the two cases of the Greenbrier and the Navajo fit into this statement. As a sovereign power, the United States has the inalienable right to unmolested trade with belligerent nations in merchandise which is not contraband, provided the ports of entry are not blockaded. What is contraband is not decided by any individual belligerent, but long ago it was laid down by international regulations, which kind of goods was contraband under any circumstances and which kind was only conditionally so. These rights of the United States have been brazenly violated by England. The captain of the American ship Greenbrier, carrying no contraband, was asked by the British to haul down the Stars and Stripes and hoist the Union Jack instead.</p>

   <p>When he refused, he was made a prisoner on his own ship, and the vessel was taken to a British port as a prize. When the pirates of the Barbary Coast were conducting this sort of business a hundred years ago, the American Union, at that time still in its infancy, dispatched a fleet into the Mediterranean, demanding satisfaction for the crime committed. Is an insult to the nation any less grave because it comes from London instead of some Barbary hideout? When those pirates pursued their nefarious trade, Jefferson knew how to teach them respect for Uncle Sam. Today, the British pirates are treated with an obsequious bow and a bashful smile.</p>
   <p>On March 3, the American ship Navajo sailed from Galveston for Bremen with a cargo of cotton. Cotton is no war contraband. On April 7, the vessel stopped at the port of Kirkwall, Orkney Islands. There the British Admiralty took possession of the ship and brought her to Maryport, where she was stripped of her cargo. An American ship, therefore, carrying no war contraband, was <span class="page-break">\3</span>confiscated by the British just like that. Let nobody argue that the British has blockaded the German North Sea Coast. That is not the case, as everybody knows. Hundreds of ships enter and sail from German North Sea ports without being in any way molested, because the British navy does not venture close enough to establish an effective blockade. And in order to be valid, a proclaimed blockade must also be de facto. The above-mentioned vessel was traveling under the protection of the American flag, the symbol of our sovereignty.</p>
   <p>Even that man who--God pity him--still warms the chair of the executive office of our State Department, could not, when learning about the incident, keep from issuing a statement saying that the proceedure of the British was tantamount to an unqualified refusal to recognize our sovereign rights. Mr. Bryan has probably regretted these harsh words since, because many an American, to whom national honor is not just an empty phrase, may have entertained the feeble hope that, this time at least, Washington would make up its mind to answer British impudence with forceful action. But this hope will hardly be realized, judging the future by similar past incidents. Over here and <span class="page-break">\4</span>over there, one will gradually become accustomed to seeing the prestige of the United States sink lower and lower in the family of nations. Not a pretty spectacle to behold for anyone except Johnny Bull, who may secretly rejoice that he can take his revenge for former injuries sustained.
