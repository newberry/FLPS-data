   <p>Recently in one of the English-language newspapers, the Commercial Hotel in Washougal, Washington, advertised for a female cook. We are reprinting the ad here in the original in order to save the Commercial Hotel from the embarrassment of German customers:</p>
   <p>"Woman cook wanted for country hotel; no Germans need apply. Phone 321, Commercial Hotel, Washougal, Wash."</p>
   <p>The Crane Company, which has one of the largest factories in the country, and which manufactures water pipes, pumps, steam-and water-heating equipment, etc., boycotts Germans in an even more virulent way. In its periodical, "The Valve World, "which the company publishes in order to promote its sales, it agitates against "Hun" merchandise; The frontispiece of this <span class="page-break">\2</span>particular magazine shows a German soldier with the usual expression of a bloodthirsty maniac, with a knife dripping blood in his hand, standing beside a travelling salesman with the same face, representing the same individual who, hat in hand, is offering merchandise for sale. Underneath, it says: "This is the same Hun who now wants to sell you his goods." We will be glad at any time to inform our readers of the efforts which some business firms, large and small, are making to keep away German customers.</p>
