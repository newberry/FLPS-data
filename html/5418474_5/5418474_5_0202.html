   <p>This day, March 4, 1919, is a very important day in the history of our country. When the clock strikes twelve this noon, the Sixty-fifth Congress will adjourn. Immediately afterward President Wilson will leave the Capitol, go to New York, address and take leave of the nation from Madison Square Garden, and tomorrow embark for Europe to make his second visit to that continent.</p>
   <p>Our people are looking forward with great interest to his speech, because they are dissatisfied, uncertain, and uneasy; they are assailed by fear and doubt. And though the hope which President Wilson created when he published the fourteen points of his plan for a league of nations and lasting peace, and "all the world" greeted the plan with joyful acclaim, did not die, yet it is waning, and many are on the verge of despair.</p>
   <p>It will not do to call these persons pessimists because of their present attitude. It would be more fitting to apply the term "incorrigible optimists" <span class="page-break">2</span>to those who still hope for a league of nations and a just and permanent world peace in line with President Wilson's fourteen-point program. One would have better reason to call those who still expect an immediate, pleasant peace, blind and deaf fools, who do not know what is going on about them, or who do not want to see or hear because they are imbued with the naive trust that something unknown or unforseen will happen and bring about the realization of their hopes.</p>
   <p>The Wilsonian plan for a league of nations and a permanent peace is in a bad way--a very bad way, indeed. Eagerness for plunder, vindictiveness, envy and jealousy, the old archenemies of peace and the welfare of humanity appear to be more powerful than ever. The former seem to control the peace conference by which they were to be governed; the latter--envy, jealousy, and enmity at home--apparently have succeeded in cutting Sampson's hair and thus depriving him of his source of strength.</p>
   <p>President Wilson's program for a league of nations and peace was attacked most <span class="page-break">3</span>violently in his own country. American partisan hatred, envy, jealousy, want of understanding, hatred of national groups, and the welcome impression which Congress created in Europe that the American people want nothing to do with Mr. Wilson or his peace program--these are more dangerous to the good cause, a lasting peace for all nations, guaranteed by all nations, than French desire for plunder and revenge, British lust for power, etc. If our Congress and our people would openly give their full support to the President and his program, then nobody could have any doubts regarding the outcome. Then, if necessary, President Wilson could dictate a peace which would be just to all nations, and force the acceptance of a constitution for a league of nations. As matters are, he returns to Europe as one who has been discredited and reprimanded; as a leader whose leadership and aims have been disapproved by the majority of his fellow citizens; as a Sampson who is bereft of the locks whence came his strength.</p>
   <p>At least it appears so. The foreign governments which are hostile toward his program are justified in thus interpreting the present state of affairs. In <span class="page-break">4</span>any event the solution of the problem which he assumed when he published his fourteen points has become much more difficult.</p>
   <p>As a valedictory, thirty-seven Republican Senators, led by Senator Lodge, delivered to him a "resolution in which they declare that the constitution for the proposed league of nations, as presented by President Wilson, should not be accepted by the United States, and demand that the peace conference immediately conclude peace and later discuss the plan for a league of nations--a complete inversion of the President's program.</p>
   <p>What will the President's attitude toward this "resolution" be? What will he do? Sampson was chosen to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines. Since he was bereft of his strength and was unable to execute his plan, he used what time and power he had to demolish the pillars of the building in which the Philistines had assembled, and to bury them in the ruins.</p>
   <p>Will--can a league of nations still be brought about? Can we still hope for enduring peace? How will matters turn out?</p>
