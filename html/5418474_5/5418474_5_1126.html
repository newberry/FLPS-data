   <p>We German-Americans have received a mark for our good behavior. Not "excellent," but "good plus," that is, a little better than good. Being polite folks, we say: "Thank you!" If we could make a wish, it would be that other people may treat us as well as we treat them. The reports about German atrocities continue, and the Anglo-American press gives them plenty of space in their columns, especially reports of the "special correspondents" and "eye witnesses". It is practically impossible, by now, to investigate every individual lie and, after all, only our own readers would learn the truth, and for all practical purposes we would only justify our own faith in the humane conduct of the Germans, if that still were necessary.</p>
   <p>War in itself is barbarism. This realization has become a platitude by now. But this same realization was the guiding motive in Germany even more than <span class="page-break">2</span>in other countries, including our own, the United States. No nation has kept the peace for such a great number of years as did Germany. Nevertheless, the Anglo-American press persists in depicting the "war lord" as the breaker of peace, hence the entire German people is denounced as a war-provoking nation. This contention is not only unfair, but a deliberate misleading of public opinion. There is no use deluding ourselves about the seriousness of the situation. We know, only too well, that a wrong opinion can be created overnight, and that it takes years to correct it. This fact is brought home to us, only too clearly, when we analyze the editorials and the "voice of the people," appearing in the Anglo-American press. We are sure the German people will shoulder the consequences of their actions, but it must hurt them to see the press of neutral nations continuously accuse them of deeds of which they are either innocent or which through the force of circumstances, appear in an entirely different aspect.</p>
   <p>The Anglo-American press attempts to stir up a sentiment of contempt for Germany, <span class="page-break">3</span>by calling the annexation of Belgium a rape. But this "rape", like the one of Alsace-Lorraine, had once upon a time been perpetrated on the Germans, or, the American press likes to call them, the Teutons. Without doubt, there is hardly a nation which would have more respect for anybody who defends his rights than the German nation. No other nation has glorified her heroes more in song and literature, in legends and fairy tales, than the Germanic nation. Lohengrin was not a Belgian Consequently, if Belgium should be annexed, if the Walloons and the Flemish should be incorporated again in Charlemagne's former empire, it would not only be no injustice but, from an historical angle, a logical development. This same [Anglo-American] press looks upon the unification efforts of all Slavs as a "natural development". With the Teutons, the same urge seems to be nothing less than rape. The Allies--France, England, Belgium, Serbia and Russia all are fighting for their independence; Germany and Austria, which have more vulnerable frontiers than the others, cannot be conceded the same right, it seems.</p>
   <p>England would not have put so much value on that "scrap of paper" which <span class="page-break">4</span>guaranteed Belgium's neutrality, if Belgium had permitted English and French troops to march through her territory toward the Rhine. In that case, that "scrap of paper" would probably have been used by the British for a quite different purpose. But there are plenty of other reasons why the Anglo-American press has no moral right, at this early date, to lecture Germany on the "Ten Commandments". How was that again: What did Cuba do to us? Why did we establish a protectorate there? How about Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines? Why didn't we grant those "courageous people" the same right which that "righteous" press, so full of admiration for the eternal right of Belgian independence, would like to see preserved for the latter? It is the same calculated and deliberate slander of German political morals as the British indulge in.</p>
   <p>The Germans claim it to be their inalienable right--and the English-Americans and American-English should know it--to do whatever they deem necessary to preserve their national and economic independence and security. A hundred years ago, they had sacrificed everything to liberate themselves from the yoke of Napoleon, and they will also free themsleves from the British yoke, regardless <span class="page-break">5</span>of the damage that may result to German commerce and industry. And, as a good beginning, Belgium will and must become Reich territory, in spite of all Anglo-American warnings. Neutral Holland will gladly become Germany's ally.</p>
   <p>Kitchener's bluff, that the war will last three years, and that Germany's food supply has been practically stopped already, will not make any more impression than all other bluffs. Napoleon could not carry out his continental blockade against England. In spite of better and more effective measures, England will find out that there is no weapon so terrible that a way to combat it can not be found. England has already learned that she was ill-advised; Now she knows that her army is nothing but a bunch of Boy Scouts. And the English boast about the three years' war they plan to fight. Nothing but bluffs! They can fool only people who don't have the right dope on English "resourcefulness".</p>
