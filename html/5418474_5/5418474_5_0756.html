   <p>The strained relations existing between "Dear Olde England" and her somewhat truculent stepchild "Uncle Sam" afford us an opportunity to reminisce. Just a few days ago-- according to a pious publication printed in the United States--hundreds of thousands of people in England were on their knees thanking God for having made it possible for the two related countries to live at peace with each other for one hundred years. What they refer to is the peace treaty of Ghent, signed in 1815. An elaborate anniversary celebration of this peace was planned. Americans living on the eastern seaboard, did not want to let the opportunity pass to make us forget the leading role "Dear Olde England" played during the Civil War, so they prepared for a splendid celebration. The program committee was carefully selected to eliminate any danger of somebody snooping in the past or finding some faded old documents in hidden corners that might be a source of embarrassment. No danger of that! The "illguided" <span class="page-break">2</span>child would certainly not be so tactless as to expose to his "Dear Old Mother England" the red welts on his back, which she had inflicted upon him while he was engaged in a life and death struggle to preserve the Union. Humanity certainly had nothing to do with the fact that the "Old Lady" did not tear the arms and legs off the unruly fellow and made a separate creature out of the South, something like Canada is in the North.</p>
   <p>Those hundreds of thousands of Christians have done well to thank their Anglo-Saxon God for the preservation of peace. That God accidentally happened to be on the side of the Union. What if He hadn't been? England would not have become what she is today. She would not sit at the Nile, and not in India. She would not dominate the seas! Therefore, she has every reason to thank God.</p>
   <p>Let us go further back in history. We see the British general put his heavy and dirt encrusted riding boots on the desk in the President's study in the <span class="page-break">3</span>White House, Washington D.C. He is surrounded by the "most perfect gentlemen" of his army. "Those in favor of our destroying this dive of a most insolent democracy, say aye." "Affirmed" cried the first of the "gentlemen". And thus it happened. Did I hear somebody mention the name of Belgium? Oh, yes! It was an American, who became a British subject so he could bask in the radiance of their British majesties. English diplomatic tricks and ruses have been preserved in England in their original from.</p>
   <p>When the Colonies proclaimed their independence, the European courts slammed the doors into the faces of the American emissaries. Only France recognized them, but no American has ever claimed that that was done because of sympathy with the new, free Union. France, as well as the Netherlands, was in conflict with England, which explains the French attitude. Of all states which could be counted on to recognize American independence eventually, Prussia was the only one. Her history was in effect nothing else but a permanent revolution against established conditions, one reason why England "kept a watchful eye on Berlin."</p>

   <p>In May, 1777, the English government was informed by two of her spies that two Americans, Lee and Carmichael, were on their way to Paris and Berlin. The English minister in Berlin, Hugh Eliott, was instructed to watch the activities of the two most carefully and to report to the Warl of Suffolk. Instead of Carmichael, Lee was accompanied by a Mr. Sayre, a "man of great affluence." However, before the Earl of Suffolk had a chance to inform his minister in Berlin of the change of personalities, Lee and a Mr. Stephens appeared. But the minister could not be fooled. He found out that Lee had had conferences with Count Schulenburg, and that the second most trusted man of the great Prussian King, Frederick II, Count Zeppelin, was on his way to Berlin. Eliott learned that Zeppelin, Lee and Sayre-alias Stephens--lived on the same floor in a hotel. Eliott was twenty-four years old and seemed to be a born English diplomat or had been trained for the job. Of all the gossip he heard about the two Americans he did not believe one word. But he engaged an employee of the hotel and the wife of the owner, promising them a good reward. Through these two he learned that Lee kept a diary in a leather case, which usually was <span class="page-break">5</span>hidden in a dresser drawer. One day Lee and Sayre went to the country. The spy, who was in Eliott's pay, was ordered to steal the papers. Since he could not reach Lee's room unobserved from the hallway, he went in through the window. Thus the British minister learned all he wanted to know, including the purpose of the American emissary's visit. Eliott was sitting at the dinner table with four others when the papers arrived. The four got busy right away making copies. Meanwhile Eliott went away to "call on people". He established as many alibis as he could. At 8 o'clock he went to the hotel to see a Mr. Russbourough. He learned that Lee and Sayre had returned, but he also knew that the papers could not have been replaced yet. Eliott, together with his compatriot Russbourough, engaged the two Americans in a lengthy conversation, hoping that the papers would be returned in the meantime. Suddenly Lee excused himself, saying that he had to write some letters, and went to his room.</p>
   <p>A few minutes later the theft was discovered. Eliott sneaked home, where in the meantime all the documents had been copied. Disguising himself, he took the <span class="page-break">6</span>originals back to the hotel and handed them over to the hotel-keeper's wife, who told the Americans that somebody had left a package on the stairway, giving instructions through the keyhole to whom it should be delivered. The spy was identified by the police soon enough, but when they got ready to nab him, the British minister had spirited him across the border.</p>
   <p>Of course, Eliott invented an elaborate story how he got into possession of the papers. As soon as he had found out that the servant had swiped the papers, he had sent them back, because a gentleman, after all, does not become involved in shady deals.</p>
   <p>These are no "war news" from Germany, although they sound like a story from London telling about the activities of German spies. The story can be found in "American Diplomacy," by John Bassett Moore, who was counselor to the Secretary of State until Bryan took over the State Department.</p>
   <p>Lee's and Sayre's mission ended abruptly. Their primary objective was not so much the recognition of the American Revolution, but to secure munitions, arms, <span class="page-break">7</span>provisions, and officers.</p>
   <p>Why don't Americans read other things besides the "Landing of the Pilgrims"? Are they still afraid that the "Old Lady" [England] might spank?</p>
