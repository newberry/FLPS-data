   <p>Fred Grimmie, fifty years old and living at 54 East 18th Street, refused to stand up as "The Star-Spangled Banner" was being played last night on the Municipal Pier. Neither would he do so when asked by Miss Beatrice Larson and Mrs. Mabel Latimer. The two women then called Seascout Edward Coleman, to whose request to stand up Grimmie paid no attention either. Some other seascouts then seized the man and had him arrested. He will be questioned today at the Chicago office of the Department of Justice.</p>
