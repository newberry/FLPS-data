   <p>For many years sincere men and women of Chicago have considered the problem of simplifying the administration of the city, county, and other local political structures so that they might be operated more cheaply and more effectively. It is clear to everyone with normal intelligence that the existence of several parallel offices with all but the same authority in the very same administrative district produces an enormous expense in administrative procedure.</p>
   <p>The continuance of Chicago and Cook County as parts of the State of Illinois has merely a historical justification. It would be infinitely more practical and economical if Chicago, together with other administrative districts of the County and neighboring counties having the same economic and cultural interests, were made into an independent state. As the State of Illinois <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>grew it really existed only on the map. No one could have predicted at that time the almost unbelievable development of Chicago. That the territory of Chicago is now united into a political unit with the rest of the state represents a condition just as out of the ordinary as, for instance, the Siamese twins.</p>
   <p>It is even harder to realize that even in Cook County the administration, and with it the responsibility, is divided. The city and county should form one unit, and there is not the least justification for the existence of such independent institutions as the Board of Education, the Water Department, and the Chicago park districts. Many years ago Professor Charles E. Merriam of the University of Chicago, who is regarded as an expert in this field, worked out a few plans according to which a number of offices could be united either by simple legislative enactment, or through the more cumbersome procedure of changing the constitution. Nothing, however, has happened as yet, although one might have assumed that these plans would have been carried out energetically in the face of the lowered taxes <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>received in recent years. Professional politicians are naturally against simplification of the administrative machine, on the principle that it will reduce the armies of officials and thereby lessen political patronage. It is remarkable, therefore, that the State of New York recently achieved some successes in this direction. The Senate of the State legislature approved four referendum bills which provide for simplification and economy in the county administration. They are to be submitted soon to popular vote. As reported, there is a good possibility that these bills will be accepted by the lower house.</p>
   <p>The acceptance of these bills by the New York legislature constitutes the end of a struggle which decades ago was started by Alfred E. Smith, then governor of New York. Smith, endowed with a native gift for questions of administrative technique, even during his first term in office as governor recognized the fact that the administration of the counties was very much in need of reform. Accordingly, he took up the struggle against the energetic resistance offered by the party in opposition and by many <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>influential politicians in his own party. As governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt continued the struggle, and now there is hope that at last the end at which they aimed is about to be attained.</p>
   <p>These occurrences are significant and instructive to the whole country, inasmuch as there is not one state in which simplification and modernization of the administration is not only desirable but also necessary. They show that such plans can be materialized by dint of hard work. They also demonstrate that it sometimes takes many decades before an end may be realized.</p>
