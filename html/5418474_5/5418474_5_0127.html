   <p>A large store has announced the sale of a lot of clothing at an especially and conspicuously low price. The day of the sale arrives. The sales staff, which has been increased in expectation of a large number of customers, is ready for business, and then--the expected crowd of purchasers fails to come. Only a relatively few buyers appear. The manager of that particular department is asked, "What is the reason?"</p>
   <p>"Oh," says he, "I had my doubts from the very beginning. But I wanted to experiment anyway. The prices are too low, The bargains are too good. The people do not believe the advertisements. The prices cause the prospective buyers to hesitate. The public could mot believe that good merchandise can be obtained for so little money. People assumed that the merchandise must be of inferior quality. They become suspicious, because the offer was so extraordinarily advantageous; and stayed away."</p>
   <p>Now it appears that the slow progress made in securing subscribers to the Fifth, and last, Liberty Loan must be explained in a similar way. It seems out of the question that the offer was not good enough for the public. For a short-term American Government loan at four and three-fourths per cent is the best investment ever offered. Everybody will readily admit that. It is best because it is as safe as any investment could be, and because the interest (four and three-fourths per cent) is in excess of that paid on savings accounts, and as profitable as many other securities not nearly as safe. It seems possible that the investment looks "too good;" that the average citizen thinks that there must be a "catch" somewhere or so favorable an opportunity would not have been offered. For our public is accustomed to seeing profitable offerings grabbed by big capitalists, banks, etc.; or, at least, it thinks that this is generally done.</p>
   <p>This relatively poor progress in obtaining subscribers is regrettable. It is too bad that the general public did not participate to a greater extent, and it is to be hoped that the people, especially the German element, will make up for lost time. For the more bonds are bought by the general public, the less will remain to be purchased by capitalists, banks, security corporations, etc., and the better it will be for all--for the entire country, for business, and for each individual, whether he is a manufacturer, merchant, professional, industrialist, or farmer; whether he possesses great wealth or nothing but his energy and the will to work.</p>
   <p>The Fifth Liberty Loan will yield four and three-fourths per cent interest and is to be redeemed within five years at the latest.</p>
   <p>It is inconceivable that the value of these bonds could drop below par; it is certain that bankers will accept them at nearly face value as security for loans which should yield no more than six per cent interest. Thus the owner of Victory bonds will not be forced to sell them, should he become financially embarassed in the near future. Bonds may also be purchased on the installment plan, the final payment to be made next November; and in the meantime the money paid will be earning four and three-fourths per cent interest, while money kept in the "stocking" or in a safety vault yields no interest, and the bank pays only three per cent. These facts should make the Loan so popular that financial institutions would not be able to get "even a smell of it".</p>
   <p>Every careful husband should buy some of these bonds in order to increase his income, and thus to insure himself and his family against hard times, unemployment, sickness, and old age. He should subscribe for as many bonds as he can, and should do so as soon as possible. In this way, reconstruction--adjustment to new conditions and requirements--may be facilitated, and thus the beginning of the great economic prosperity which all of us hope for will be accelerated. Reconstruction will progress according to the measure by which our citizens buy bonds, and that part of the part of the loan which will have to be absorbed by financial organizations will be proportionately less. That again will make it easier for manufacturers, dealers, and other businessmen to obtain the necessary money for rebuilding, repairing and expanding their places of business. Also, they will be able to borrow at reasonable rates; thus they will be more willing to increase their number of employees, affording many thousands an opportunity to work at good wages--insuring prosperity for us and for our whole country.</p>
   <p>That is a broad statement; many people may consider it an exaggeration, and point to the commercial experience which they have had. Yet it is true; it is accurate; it is not exaggerated. Any one who does not believe it may attribute it to his own lack of confidence if he passes up a good bargain--in fact, all things considered, the best bargain ever offered to him.</p>
