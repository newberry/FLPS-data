   <p>The meeting of the German subdivision of the Foreign Language Department for the floating of the Fourth Liberty Loan, which took place last night in the North Side Turner Hall, was devoted to the completion of the organization. The chairman, Mr. Paul F. Mueller, told the audience that since the first meeting the necessity had arisen for employing salesmen in the various wards. In each ward the Foreign Language Department has kept several vacancies open for volunteers for the actual selling, in order to give the Germans a fair representation in the sales organization. This is a further step in keeping a close checkup on the share of each nationality in putting over the Liberty Loan. And since a salesman of German descent will naturally watch very carefully to see that the space marked "nationality" in the sales report is filled out correctly, we cannot think of a better means to accomplish this purpose. Accordingly, several volunteers have applied for each ward, and they will start their activities with a house-to-house campaign, especially in the wards where there are a large number of German fellow citizens.</p>
   <p>But this objective can only be accomplished if every purchaser of German descent not only avows his nationality openly and candidly, but also insists that the salesman fill out the space marked "nationality" before his eyes. That is the most important thing. It is the desire and the hope of the German Department that this phase or the campaign be fully and completely understood, so that its work may conform with all that of the other foreign language departments, and that it may serve its purpose to the fullest. If everyone would realize that failure to record one's nationality will lead only to the concealment of the full extent of the loyalty of the Germans, nobody would mind the little bother and everyone would help the supervisors in their efforts.</p>
