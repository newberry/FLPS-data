   <p>The Foreign Language Division, consisting of a group of citizens who were organized to assist in the sale of the Liberty Loan, met in the Morrison Hotel last evening under the chairmanship of Felix J. Streykmans. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce the campaign for the sale of the Fifth Liberty Loan, known as the Victory Liberty Loan. Selling will begin on April 6 and will continue for three weeks. This time, however, an early start is being made, because it is known that it will be more difficult to dispose of these bonds than it was to sell the others. There was general acclaim for the endeavors of the Foreign Language Division and the foreign language press in behalf of the successful disposal of the Loan. Due to their efforts the Loan increased in popularity and circulation. That, according to Chairman Streykmans' remarks, was especially true in the seventh district, which includes Chicago. In this area 3,400,000 bonds worth $625,000,000 were sold, while in the New York district only 3,100,000 bonds worth $1,125,000,000 were disposed of. But in New York there were 492 subscriptions of more than $200,000 each, while Chicago could show only sixty or seventy subscriptions of that amount.</p>

   <p>The chief purpose of the meeting was to listen to an address by Mr. Hans Rieg, chairman of the Foreign Language Division of the Treasury at Washington. He had come to Chicago for a short stay and wanted to avail himself of the opportunity to confer with the members of the Chicago organization, especially with the representatives of the press, on some matters which were necessary to the success of this campaign. The indefatigable chairman [Hans Rieg] spoke impressively and with much warmth.</p>
   <p>He said essentially: "The war is ended, thanks to a gracious Providence, to the endurance of the Allies, and to the splendid qualities which our boys developed as soldiers; thanks above all to President Wilson, who must be classed not only as one of our greatest presidents, but also as one of our greatest statesmen. We have all endured, we have all suffered, we have all made sacrifices. The war has left tremendous changes in its wake, but even at this early date it is certain that the war will have a very salutary effect upon the whole human race. The best proof of this statement is a meeting such as we are holding today, for nearly all nationalities of the earth are represented in it. A meeting of this kind would hardly have been conceivable prior to the war. Many of America's future generations will feel the beneficent effects of these <span class="page-break">3</span>co-operative endeavors of the various nationalities.</p>
   <p>"Experience derived from former campaigns has established that systematic cooperation, through counsel and act, by the foreign-born, or the descendants of the foreign-born, will produce an enthusiastic and very effective participation in the purchase of the bonds by those nationalities which are represented in the Foreign Language Division. Twenty-eight million Americans are in this category, and seven million of these have bought eight hundred million dollars' worth of bonds of the Third Loan. And their subscriptions to the Fourth Loan would have been greater in number and amount, had influenza not forced them to use some of the money with which they had intended to buy Government bonds to pay physicians, hospitals, and undertakers. Their patriotic bearing during the epidemic was remarkable.</p>
   <p>"The Liberty Loan has proved to be a great blessing for the American people. Nobody has learned this better than those of our fellow countrymen who speak a foreign tongue. The objection that hyphenated Americanism is unduly emphasized <span class="page-break">4</span>through the organization of the Foreign Language Division is without foundation. Nothing has served to remove the segregation indicated by the hyphen more than the work of the Division. Every sale of a Liberty bond to a foreign-born person only tightens the ties which bind him to our land, and signifies progress in the process of his Americanization, making each individual purchaser a more valuable part of the whole nation. His interest in his country increases, he becomes more cognizant of his duties and privileges, and feels that he is a welcome member of the community.</p>
   <p>"Never before have the so-called 'simon-pure' Americans realized how many foreign-speaking inhabitants there are, and how immensely valuable they are to the American nation.</p>
   <p>"The activity of the Foreign Language Division has strengthened and deepened the relation between the various elements constituting the population of America. The work of the Division is a bright page in the history of our war work. The foreign-tongued have set an admirable example of patriotism; they have taken the leading part in every phase of war activity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"However, the great object of our people and country has not yet been achieved; the way leading to it has merely been smoothed. The great hindrances to a just world peace have been removed. The destruction has ceased, but restoration is now in order. And that will require money. A great part of the war expense is still unpaid. Our soldiers must be brought back to our country again, and the wounded and crippled must be cared for. And that is the purpose of the Victory Liberty Loan--to wind up the war and to defray the expenses connected with peace negotiations. Great care must be exercised in transferring our soldiers from wartime to peacetime pursuits. Expense must cut no figure in providing for those who were willing to give their lives for their country. It is everybody's duty to subscribe to this Loan--just as much now as it was during the war.</p>
   <p>"The greatness and importance which America has achieved in this war must be preserved. Our soldiers have achieved it in battle. And their achievement must not be obscured by the failure of the next Loan. This time it is not our soldiers' willing submission to danger and death, nor the prospect of future victories, that urges us to successful endeavor, but it is rather our duty to our army and navy, our honor in finishing the work which we began, and our duty <span class="page-break">6</span>to the whole world. Especially the foreign-speaking citizens should let nothing hinder them from putting forth the same untiring efforts which proved to be so successful during the last drive. If the work of the foreign-speaking element during the coming campaign should show less success than they achieved in former campaigns, then the achievements of former campaigns would be nullified. Since freedom has been won for so many nations outside of America, the sincerity and honesty manifested in former campaigns would justly be questioned if the foreign-speaking people of America did not show that same unswerving devotion which they displayed during the war."</p>
   <p>The speaker's appeal received loud and hearty applause. Thereupon a discussion took place, and the following immediate activity was decided upon:</p>
   <p>1. Articles and appeals, written by prominent representatives of the various nationalities, shall be gathered and sent to the Division. The Division shall forward a copy of each to all the foreign language newspapers for simultaneous publication. These articles and appeals shall set forth the great importance of the success of the campaign, and they shall warn against emigration. These newspaper items shall be on hand by February 15.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>2. Speaking tours shall be started immediately. The speakers shall have the duty of informing the public that the Government will care for the needy members of the various nationalities, as is clearly evident from the fact that lately $100,000,000 has been appropriated for this purpose. These needy will receive better help through subscriptions to the Victory Liberty Loan than they would through direct individual contributions.</p>
   <p>Howard Chandler Christy has made the sketch for the Foreign Language Division's poster. It is a roll of honor containing the names which are typical of the nationalities whose members died fighting for America.</p>
   <p>Divers means to increase the influence of the Foreign Language Division upon district organizations were discussed, and Chairman Streykmans promised that those defects in the last campaign by which the participation of the foreign-speaking inhabitants, especially of the industrial workers, was obscured, would be removed.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were passed memorializing the Government to do everything possible <span class="page-break">8</span>to preserve the par value of the new bonds. In a further resolution the firm stand of the foreign language newspapers against selling of bonds below cost and their refusal to aid the "hyenas" who use every possible means to buy bonds at lowest prices, was very gratefully acknowledged.</p>
   <p>Strong opposition to a probable wholesale emigration to the newly created republics and rearranged states of Europe was declared to be an absolute necessity.</p>
   <p>Chairman Streykmans adjourned the meeting after he had informed the assembly that preliminary steps are under way to make the Foreign Language Division a permanent organization for Americanization in all its phases. Mr. Rieg, the representative of the Treasury, stated that laws to this effect are in preparation, so that the work can be started immediately after the close of the campaign.</p>
