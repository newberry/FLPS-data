   <p>Greetings, Turners! How long do you intend to hesitate, brothers? Why continue to deprive the country of your services? Soon you will be forced to serve, for conscription is imminent. Why not enlist as volunteers, and do under favorable conditions what you will be forced to do after August 15!</p>
   <p>There are turners in every army of the Union. However, our country is hard pressed, and our brother turners, who are facing a terrible enemy on the battlefield, are in need of immediate help. So why defer your entry into the army any longer?</p>
   <p>Brothers, we have been practicing the noble art of using weapons long enough, and have spent much time hardening our bodies through strenous physical exercise. Now is the time when we are called upon to demonstrate our skill in the use of arms and prove that we are physically able to endure the rigors and hardships of camp and battlefield.</p>
   
   <p>Yesterday I enrolled as a private in Bruening's Company, a part of the New Hecker Regiment. I have already taken the oath of allegiance, and now I ask you, brothers, to take the same step and to unite with me, under the command of Hecker and Sigel, in the battle for the Republic and for liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>So let us up and be doing!</p>
   <p>Georg Heinzmann,</p>
   <p>Assistant Squad Leader.</p>
