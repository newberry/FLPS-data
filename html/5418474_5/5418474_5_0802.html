   <p>The gravity and importance of the critical times in which we are living can hardly be underestimated. But we are also living in a time of glorious achievement, which nobody could have foreseen a year ago.</p>
   <p>The great war, which Europe had anticipated for decades but never really believed would come, finally did break out and has turned into a German war.</p>
   <p>It is the greatest war the world has ever seen. It calls for greater sacrifices and inflicts more suffering than any other war recorded in the history of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>mankind; but on the other hand, this war is developing more willingness to give and greater heroism than any other.</p>
   <p>But the greatness of this war is still surpassed by the greatness of the time in which we live. The war itself is becoming more and more a symptom of the times, and the German war more and more a single expression of the German idea, a means of making the German way succeed and of endowing the coming era with the German character.</p>
   <p>That wonderful Anglo-American protagonist of truth and justice, James O'Donnell Bennett, says at the conclusion of an open letter published January 17, in the Chicago Sunday Tribune and addressed to that arch-libeler and witch doctor, Arthur Conan Doyle:</p>
   <p>"The Germans are not liars. They love truth so much that their loyalty toward it often makes for rudeness in speech. They call a spade a spade and their <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>sincerity sometimes makes them use a coarse word where another one would have sounded more civil." Bennett then goes on to quote Captain Alfred Mannesmann, one of the famed "Mannesmann Brothers" and member of the internationally known firm of Mannesmann and Morat, who, after having expressed resentment over an especially malicious British lie, said: "We hate lies. My father used to tell me and my brothers, 'Be too proud to tell a lie'. And we were reared according to that principle."</p>
   <p>We Germans hate lies! Germans are too proud to lie! And that is why there is war today--a war of Germany and her allies for truth and justice, in which the present conflict is only the initial phase of a greater and necessarily more protracted struggle to come. This war has ushered in a new era.</p>
   <p>The war has done wonders for the German people. It has united them to a degree which they had never attained before; it has cleansed them from all impurities and has brought forth overnight a wondrous flower: the flower of faith, truth-fulness, and justice. "Be too proud to tell a lie!" The Germans over there have proved it, are proving it every day anew--and the rest of the world stands <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>amazed. Let us Americans be worthy of it, we, who are proud of our German heritage.</p>
   <p>German-America</p>
   <p>The Germans of America are profoundly stirred. They cannot fight on the battlefields--and God forbid that they ever may have to--but they like to participate in that greater struggle that is going on, and they will have to, whether they want to or not!</p>
   <p>There cannot be any doubt that the German element had been waiting a long time to become active. They were so eager in their desire, that the export of arms [to Germany's enemies] offered that long awaited opportunity. The idea that America exported weapons which would be turned against their brothers over there, hurt them deeply and the demand for an arms embargo found them solidly behind it.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>This demand (for an arms embargo) is a matter of sentiment for German-Americans. Whether it is also prudent is open to controversy. We have very good reason to believe that the German Government looked askance at any German-American movement to enforce an arms embargo. There was a very good reason for the belief that this movement would, inadvertently, hamper the American Government as well as the German Government in their actions and would do more harm than good for the achievement of a higher, more conclusive objective, namely, a general and universal arms embargo which would force the Allies to make an early peace. The [German-American inspired] movement for an embargo would also jeopardize future political actions of the German-American element.</p>
   <p>These objections are still valid. However, the step has been taken. The German-American element is pledged to the arms embargo, so to speak. That cannot be undone. Therefore, the watchword now should be: Unity!--to follow the example of the old country and go through with it, come what may!</p>
   <p>Accordingly, the Abendpost is asking its readers to send the letters printed <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>below, properly copied, to the two senators of their state (one to each), or to the U. S. representative of their Congressional District. If the German-American element is to speak up, at least let their voice be loud and resonant.</p>
   <p>To the Senators and Congressmen</p>
   <p>(Letters to be Copied)</p>
   <p>To Senator....Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Honorable Sir: As an American I respectfully ask you to vote for and lend your active support to Senate Resolution 6688, so that it may pass the Senate at this session of Congress; and I also ask you to impress upon the Committee on Foreign Relations the fact that the majority of the people of your senatorial district (sic) are in favor of such law.</p>
   <p>(Sign name and give address.)</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>To Honorable....Representative in Congress, Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: As an American I respectfully call your attention to House Resolution H. J. 377. I ask you to work actively and to vote so as to make this Bill a law during this session of Congress; and I also ask you to impress upon the Committee for Foreign Affairs the fact that the majority of the people of your district favor such a law. [Translator's note: The above two letters were original in English and not translated].</p>
   <p>We hope it'll do some good. We are willing to suffer the consequences, and in order to be better prepared for it and to continue the struggle for the German way of life and for truth and justice, it will be necessary to work for a closer co-operation between Germans, German-Austrians and other pro-German groups, and to agree upon a work program. That will prove to be quite a difficult task. Rash actions, lack of good judgment may easily lead to mistakes and to nowhere. The Abendpost will devote itself to this matter and open her columns for <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>suggestions and short, practical discussions.</p>
