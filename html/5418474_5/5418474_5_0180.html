   <p>It is reported from Washington that 4,500 patents (chiefly on dyes) which the United States granted to German inventors have been sold at the ridiculously low price of $250,000 to the Chemical Foundation (Incorporated), a company which was especially organized to make the sale possible.</p>
   <p>This report sounds so incredible that one might be inclined to consider it a newspaper hoax, were it not for the fact that it is taken from an account which Mitchell Palmer made of his activity as Alien Property Custodian. Mr. Palmer is now United States Attorney General. The report states:</p>
   <p>"The amendment of November 4 to the Trading with the Enemy Act offered the first opportunity to perform what, in my opinion, is the greatest piece of <span class="page-break">\2</span>constructive work which has been possible in my department. Before this amendment was accepted it was not possible to take possession of German patents. These patents were a great hindrance to the development of the American dyestuff industry. Apparently they were taken out without the least intention of using them in manufacturing in this country, and the patentees evidently did not fear that American manufacturers would successfully utilize them, owing to adverse conditions which prevail here, such as the high cost of materials and the lack of able technicians and trained workers.</p>
   <p>"However, after more deliberation, it appeared that these patents might offer a possible solution to a problem which was formerly considered to be insoluble, namely the protection of the American dyestuff industry against German competition after the War. If they were not taken out to prevent American competition, they must have been obtained to serve as a weapon against competitive imports. If they were adequate to keep out the <span class="page-break">\3</span>products of Swiss, French, and English dyestuff manufacturers, they would, perhaps, serve Americans in preventing the importation of German dyestuffs.</p>
   <p>"Thus the thought presented itself that if the German patents could be given to an American organization which would be sufficiently strong to protect them, importation from Germany after the War could be successfully barred and, at the same time, the American industry could be released from the obligation not to manufacture valuable dyes. Accordingly, the matter was put before various organizations of chemical manufacturers, especially before the Dyestuff Institute and before the Association of American Chemical Manufacturers. The suggestion received immediate and enthusiastic assent, and, as a result, a corporation was organized under the name "Chemical Foundation (Incorporated)". Practically all American manufacturers are stockholders and members of the Corporation, and their object is to obtain the German patents through purchase and to possess them as trustees of the American industry.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Corporation is capitalized at $500,000, of which $400,000 is to be preferred stock at six per cent interest per annum, and $100,000 is to be common stock, which is also to yield dividends at the rate of six per cent per year.</p>
   <p>"According to a government measure which was made in agreement with the terms of the law, I have sold to the Corporation about 4,500 patents for $250,000, and the other $250,000 is to be used as working capital, so that the Corporation is able immediately to enter, and vigorously prosecute, a suit for infringement of patent, when the first attempt is made to import German dyestuffs."</p>
   <p>So much for the official report. The gist of it is that after the war the German inventors are to be deprived of the fruits of their labors through the sale of the patents which were awarded them in the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>As much as we desire that our country be independent of foreign countries, as far as the dyestuff industry is concerned, we certainly cannot agree with the procedure proposed by the former Alien Property Custodian. Legal, practical, and ethical objections to it are too weighty.</p>
   <p>The special legislation on which the sale of the German patents is founded, specifies that the Alien Property Custodian is empowered "to dispose of all institutions which are harmful to native industries, in order to Americanize them and benefit science and industry." When it accepted this measure, Congress had only commercial institutions in mind such as factories, docks, and the like, but not patents, which can be defined as "institutions" only by a forced interpretation.</p>
   <p>From a legal standpoint, it is evident that it is not permissible to extend the provisions of the Congressional measure over patents. For every patent represents a mutual covenant of performance agreed to by the inventor, on <span class="page-break">\6</span>the one hand, and the government of the country which awards the patent on the other hand. The performance of the inventor consists in his revealing the secret of his invention to the government and his declaring that he is willing to relinquish the utilization of his invention to the inhabitants of the country when the patent expires. The government on the other hand, assures the inventor of the sole utilization of his patent during the time it is in force.</p>
   <p>Naturally, mutual agreements may not be declared terminated by either of the two parties. As soon as one party has accepted the performance of the other it is duty-bound to reciprocate. If it does not it can be forced by legal procedure to keep its agreement, and must submit to the accusation that it is guilty of breach of faith.</p>
   <p>Now, how about the situation in regard to the German patents? The German inventors have kept their part of the agreement; they have revealed the <span class="page-break">\7</span>secrets of their inventions to our Government; and our Government has granted them patents, thereby assuring them of protection for these patents. It obligated itself to furnish unhindered utilization of their patents during the time for which the patents were to be in force. Now neither party to the pact may reconsider, since the German inventors cannot withdraw their part--the revelation of their secrets.</p>
   <p>Mutual contracts often contain a clause which permits either party, or both, to transfer obligations and privileges to a third party. The patent contract (of our Government) grants the patentee the right to transfer to others the privilege and protection assured in the patent. Therefore it is wrong to speak of "selling" a patent. The business transaction referred to consists in this, that the owner of the patent merely conveys the patent protection to someone else. Since the patent protection is profitable, the owner of the patent receives remuneration for the transfer. Nobody can force him to relinquish his patent, and certainly the other party to the <span class="page-break">\8</span>agreement (in this case our Government) has the least right to convey the patent rights to a third party. But this is what the Alien Property Custodian intends to do with the German patents. Mr. Mitchell Palmer simply decrees that henceforth our Government shall be released from the obligations of the contract which it made with the German inventors, and he transfers their privileges to the Chemical Foundation (Incorporated), an organization which he himself founded. We cannot understand how Mr. Mitchell Palmer's procedure agrees with the amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act.</p>
   <p>Much less can we comprehend how a number of pending patents could be included in the 4,500 patents listed in the report from which we have quoted.</p>
   <p>A "patent pending" is no patent. This term is used to designate an inventor's application, on which the Patent Office has not yet taken <span class="page-break">\9</span>decisive action. In such cases the inventor has performed his part of the proposed agreement by disclosing his secret idea, but the Government has not yet decided whether or not, it will be a party to the agreement and assume the obligation of assuring the applicant of its protection.</p>
   <p>Our patent law prescribed that employees of the Patent Office must exercise the utmost secrecy with regard to applications for patents. When a patent is granted, the fact is published in the official patent news, the Patent Gazette. If the patent is not awarded, then the details of the invention may not be divulged.</p>
   <p>These provisions of the Patent Law have not been voided by the amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act. How then can Mr. Palmer justify the sale of applications by Germans for patents? And how can an application for a patent be "sold," since the application is merely an offer to enter into an agreement, and nobody knows whether or not the agreement will be made? It is self-evident that it is impossible to determine the selling <span class="page-break">\10</span>value of an application for a patent, and as everybody knows, it is absolutely necessary to establish the selling price before the sale can be effected.</p>
   <p>These are legal reasons why the procedure taken by the Alien Property Custodian should not be maintained. We have ignored international agreements concerning patents, because these agreements, like all other provisions of international law, have become mere "scraps of paper".</p>
   <p>In another article we will publish the practical and ethical objections to the "sale" of the German patents.</p>
