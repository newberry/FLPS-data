   <p>The President represents the nation to countries abroad. But this representation is by no means unlimited. It is true he appoints the Secretary of State, who conducts the diplomatic intercourse with foreign powers, but any agreements which he makes with foreign nations must be confirmed by two thirds of the Senate. He has no power to validate any pact which has not the approval of two thirds of the United States Senators. He will always find it hard to conclude any treaty if the opposition party in the Senate is well represented. If he cannot be sure of a dependable two-thirds majority, and the foreign policy of his opponents deviates from his own, he is always bound to make them concessions which will be in proportion to the strength of the opposing minority. If the opposition party in the Senate is in the majority he may have to abandon his program entirely.</p>

   <p>This goes for treaties of all sorts and gives the problem of the political composition of the United States Senate an added importance whenever it becomes necessary to conclude a vital treaty, or if there is a probability that the Senate will have to occupy itself with formulating a treaty in detail. This will make the citizens realize that seldom, if ever, in the history of the country, was there an election so important as the coming one, for it will influence the composition of the United States Senate, and the Senate, in turn, will decide and ratify the peace treaty.</p>
   <p>At present there are fifty-two Democrats, forty-two Republicans, and one Progressive in the United States Senate, with one seat vacant. The terms of office of thirty-two Senators expire on March 3, 1919. Nineteen of these are Democrats, thirteen Republicans; the Democrats will probably be succeeded by thirteen Democrats, and the Republicans certainly by nine Republicans, unless the original ones are re-elected. Of the present Republican seats in the Senate, five, at the most, can be called doubtful, of the Democratic seats, six. Among the doubtful Republican seats is that of Michigan, thanks to the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>candidacy of Henry Ford, who was nominated at the request of the President, and who must be considered the President's candidate. Among the Democratic seats which seem to be in danger at Present is that of Illinois, for which Senator James Hamilton Lewis is running again at the express wish of the President.</p>
   <p>It is the senatorial election, especially, that makes this campaign of the greatest importance for Michigan and Illinois; and also the special circumstance that Henry Ford and James Hamilton Lewis are running for election at the direct request of the President and therefore must be considered personal representatives of the President. Their success or defeat will be interpreted by all the world as either an approval or a repudiation of the President's war and (especially) peace policies.</p>
   <p>This holds true for James Hamilton Lewis and Illinois more than it does for Henry Ford and Michigan, for during the last few years, Senator Lewis has been the mouthpiece and "faithful servant" of the President in the Senate. Senator Lewis puts his services unreservedly at the President's disposal. He is <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>not running in this election as James Hamilton Lewis, but as the tried and completely reliable follower of the President, and as the champion of Wilson's policies.</p>
   <p>A vote for Lewis is a vote for the President (who fights only the German government, and not the German people, whom he loves) and therefore a vote for a lasting peace, which will do justice to all the people and whose speedy attainment is the President's aim.</p>
   <p>A vote for any other senatorial candidate is a vote against the President and his humane and truly democratic policy, and a vote for the continuance of the war; a vote for the war against the German people, a war to the finish, whose object is the smashing of the German Reich to bits and the complete destruction of the German people.</p>
   <p>A vote for the Republican senatorial candidate is a vote for the war aims of the Entente and a vote for a peace treaty dictated by the Entente <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>powers and our own Lodges and Roosevelts and all other enemies of everything German. The same holds true for every vote for the Socialist senatorial candidate, for each vote of this sort is a rejection of Wilson's policy and is completely thrown away.</p>
   <p>Each vote for James Hamilton Lewis is a vote for the American and democratic peace which Wilson advocates, and for the man who stood and stands like a rock against the surging hatred of the German people and everything that is of German name and origin in America.</p>
   <p>Now go ahead and vote!</p>
