   <p>The British agent, Gilbert K. Chesterton, who writes his hatred-inspired, anti-German articles in the New York Times for the consumption of a patient American public, does not deserve to have a German paper earnestly deal with the unqualified claptrap which this so-called "American" has crust enough to dish out to his fellow citizens. It is simply incomprehensible how a man, supposed to have common sense, can write such nonsense. That the Times prints that kind of stuff is not so amazing, because this paper gobbles up lies and calumnies about the Germans--the more the better. It is unfortunate that there are still Germans to be found who take the trouble to send in articles to the Times and similar British propaganda agencies, trying to justify the German cause. Such a justification is no longer necessary. Americans who care to learn the truth have now plenty of opportunities to do so. And those ill-advised Americans who are determined to follow England's hypocritical politicians through thick and thin will certainly not change their minds by reading articles from German sources, especially if the editorial in the same issue offsets their effectiveness. Such people we can leave alone with their own stupidity and maliciousness. They'll learn only by hard experience.</p>
   <p>German-Americans will not let the Chesterton articles sink into oblivion, but will remember them when the proper time arrives. Such occasion may not be so far off as the Times would like to have us believe, in its present arrogance.</p>
   <p>The time will come when this New York yellow sheet, now so busily engaged, with the aid of a Chesterton and other worthy contemporaries, in slandering and defaming the homeland of one fifth of the American people in the most contemptible manner, will beg for the very aid and support of the same fellow citizens whose most sacred feelings and sentiments are now brutally trampled under foot. If the Times were out to split the whole country into two hostile camps, it could not do it more effectively than by printing these smutty articles, intended to poison the minds of its readers.</p>
   <p>It need hardly be said that those articles are full of clumsy lies and calumnies. The author of these contemptible scribblings, which may not even find their equal in England, would not get very far by telling the truth, so he has to resort to falsehoods and clumsy defamations to accomplish his purpose. It is an old saying that "he who becomes abusive must be wrong". And Chesterton is not only abusive, but downright filthy. And that's just what the Times wants, because it makes its otherwise indigestible stuff spicy and sensational, and so promotes circulation. On the other hand, it is a good indicator of the low moral level which this New York newspaper has reached.</p>
   <p>In his latest article, Chesterton makes the rather questionable remark that the Russian czarist regime is not nearly as despotic as the rule of the German Kaiser. We can spare our readers the reasons he advances for this argument. Just to mention one of the "facts," he claims that the Poles were much better off under Russian rule than under the Prussian. Probably that is why the Poles are now fighting on the side of those hated Prussians and Austrians, and the Polish representatives [in the Polish parliament] have voted unanimously for war appropriations to fight Russia. In the same article, Chesterton says that the Germans had no right to complain about the enlisting by the British of the aid of the Mongolians [sic], because the Germans had protected the Turks in Europe, and had prevented their being driven back to Asia. The only people who had opposed the Mongolians were the Russians, who had driven back the Tatars. History certainly is one subject Chesterton did not learn in school; otherwise he should know that the Tatars were decisively beaten by the Germans in Silesia in 1241, and that the descendants of that Mongol tribe are leading a comfortable existence in Russia today. In various parts of European Russia there are living today about a million and a half of them. Otherwise there is no analogy between the protection of the Turks by Germany and the enlistment of the Japanese by the British in the fight against Germany. Chesterton should be ashamed to make the assertion that the Germans, or the "Prussians," as he insists on calling them, were never to be found when a fight for liberty was to be waged. On which side did the Germans fight in all American wars, and where did the British stand?</p>
   <p>America is a free country, and anybody may give vent to his feelings, unworthy though they may be, but it would be desirable to have them kept within the bounds of propriety and decency. We consider it beneath our dignity to take issue with Chesterton's vituperations against the German Kaiser, although such diatribes look strange in the columns of a newspaper which the President has cautioned, together with all other papers, to make strictest neutrality their foremost duty. Anyway, we don't have to defend the Kaiser, because the monarch stands so high above this little scribbler that he cannot be harmed by mudslinging.</p>
