   <p>In large sections of the country there is a suspicion that the sympathies wealthy Jews in America are on the side of the Russians, English, Japanese, Serbs, and French. To make sure of this it would be necessary to interview some rich Israelites, because we would not say offhand that there was any truth in this rumor. But we do know for a fact that there has been no lack of effort to make the rich Jews--who'd bother about the poor ones--come into the British camp. Very popular are those strong-arm business methods which characterize the British war effort. For instance, the "liberal" British Government adheres to and enforces the medieval principle that an Englishman (a private individual or a bank) who owes money to a citizen of a state or nation with whom England is at war does not have to make payments to his creditor, but to a "trustee" appointed by the British Government. The money <span class="page-break">\2</span><span class="gap">[gap]</span><span class="page-break">\3</span>still Albion's "army". With this army, always mobilized, she has conquered one-fifth of the world's territory.</p>
   <p>This terrorism of business, exercised at present on the international bankers, is designed to a large degree to hitch "Jewish wealth" to the chariot of British imperialism. It amounts to an enforced loan which the Israelites have to extend to the British Government; all foreign assets in England are frozen, and if the American Jewish bankers--Kuhn, Loeb, Schiff, Warburg, etc.--do not want to make any loans to the Russians, French, Belgians, and Serbs, these frozen assets will be loaned out by the "trustees of the British Government". That's the English way! Do not be amazed. It always was the English way as long as history can remember.</p>
   <p>From an ethical point of view, we could compare this procedure with a highway robber saying, "Stick 'em up!" to his victim. But at least these "Knights of the Alley" do not claim to represent a liberal Christian Government. If they were caught, their last plea for defense would be to say that they "only wanted <span class="page-break">\4</span>to hand over the loot to a trustee for safe keeping, who at some later date would surely restore the property to its rightful owner". No burglar would be stupid enough to assume that a judge would permit such a plea of not guilty. Anyone who knows British policy would feel like that judge. No more than the sea would give up its dead, would John Bull let go anything that has come with-in reach of his tentacles.</p>
   <p>Besides financial strong-arm methods, there are still other ways to exert influence on the "wealthy Jews". The poor ones naturally do not count, because you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip. That well-known Tribune correspondent, Wile, first in London, then in Berlin, then in Chicago, and now back in London, for whom the honest name of his father, Weil, was not good enough, or not English enough, has seen fit lately to have his [anti-German] propaganda articles written by less notorious authors than he, himself, turned out to be. Two weeks ago he sent in a literary hodge-podge by an author named Galsworth (sic). Before that, G. B. Shaw got into the Tribune, and last Sunday we could <span class="page-break">\5</span>enjoy Zangwill. Maybe next Sunday another Jewish literary genius will grace the editorial page of the Tribune.</p>
   <p>The British Government probably expects Zangwill to make a tremendous impression on the Golden International. [Translator's note: G. I., a term adopted from the Red International. Meaning here Jewish international finance.] This name is a sure-fire hit, because he is the author of a dramatic play with a terrific climax, although the solution of the problem betrays the mentality of a ten-year old. This pact, and that's what makes him suspicious, is being employed as the latest big gun to fire away at Prussian militarism, using the Tribune's columns as a medium. You can bet your life that if authors like Shaw, Galsworth (sic) and Zangwill start to talk about Prussian militarism, they have obtained their information, and maybe their remuneration, from the official London Press Agency [propaganda outfit]; for the word "Prussian militarism" is a specific London term which stuck in the authors' throat, because they really meant to call it "German barbarism". When a British author believes himself to be <span class="page-break">\6</span>somebody, he is careful not to refer to the Germans as barbarians, generally speaking, because he'd be ashamed of such calumny. There is some sense of decency left in any human being, even if he is an author in London. The only exceptions are Americans, as, for instance, a certain Sullivan. He knows that he is a nobody, so he does not have to bother with a sense of ethics, as can be seen by the latest issue of Colliers Weekly.</p>
   <p>Zangwill's diatribes are pure British stuff. England should pay him one pound [sterling] per line, because America's "rich Jews" are now probably going to fall for Britain hook, line, and sinker! And if they don't, it certainly isn't Zangwill's fault. With his last article Zangwill has extinguished a great name. In the future he will be remembered as one among many literary nonentities.</p>
   <p>What he said about Germany and Prussia we must forgive, because just like any other Englishman, he does not know a thing about its social structure. About Russia he should have displayed better judgment, remembering the persecution of <span class="page-break">\7</span><span class="gap">[gap]</span><span class="page-break">\8</span>be impossible. Russia would immediately have to elevate her people to the democratic 'standard' set by her allies, England and France. This is the point that Jews should keep in mind. Great Britain--to say nothing of France--freed from the Prussian nightmare, will bring pressure on Russia to make her declare the emancipation of the Jews.</p>
   <p>"In a letter to me, Sir Edward Grey has already pledged himself to encourage Russia to liberate her Jews."</p>
   <p>That's enough! There are many more pearls of the sheerest nonsense contained in this communication to the Tribune, thinly camouflaging the deliberate betrayal of his people by the author. His reference to the British Foreign Minister, Sir Edward Grey, shows clearly enough on whose direction this letter was written. Wile and Zangwill--there you have two worthy renegades of their race.</p>
