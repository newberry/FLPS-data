   <p>A noticeable opposition to too oppressive peace conditions is apparently rising in Germany. This is not surprising, for five months have already elapsed since the Armistice was signed, and the United States and the Allies have not yet agreed upon the peace conditions which are to be imposed upon Germany. And these five months have left their mark on the Germans. Life runs swiftly during revolutionary times and the development of political acumen is more rapid than it is during peacetime. It is said that the Germans are insisting that peace be concluded on the basis of Wilson's Fourteen Points and are determined to reject all conditions which are not included in the President's plan, even if their (the Germans') demands prevent the conclusion of peace.</p>
   <p>The Entente may look upon this as a meaningless threat, a mere bluff; but, all things considered, what have the Germans to lose, if peace is not brought about? <span class="page-break">\2</span>The economic and political situation in Germany could be made no worse than it is now, even if the endeavors of the peace makers should be in vain. What if the transportation of food to Germany is again made impossible? During the War the Teutons learned how to endure hunger. It would be nothing new to them. However, the moral impression which such a procedure of the Allies would make upon the world in general would certainly not be favorable. Again, let the Entente occupy all of Germany with soldiers. Perhaps that would not be unwelcome to many Germans who love order. Then the country might be secure against the danger of Bolshevism.</p>
   <p>If dishonorable conditions of peace are forced upon Germany, as irreconcilable chauvinists would like to do, then the Ebert Government, which is preserving law and order in Germany at present will not be able to maintain itself. It would be overthrown immediately, and would very probably be succeeded by Bolshevism. And the Allies would find it much more difficult to negotiate a peace with Bolshevists. For if an eventual German Bolshevik Government were patterned after the model of Lenin and the other Russian leaders--and one would <span class="page-break">\3</span>have to expect that owing to present conditions--it would be all but impossible to establish a basis upon which peace could be concluded. Russian Bolshevism has the quality of jelly or gelatine. If one presses it at a certain spot, it gives way and a depression results; but if one then releases the pressure in order to transfer it to some other place, the mass runs back, and the depression disappears. Even the wisest statesman could not negotiate a lasting peace with jelly-like creatures which have such changeable shapes.</p>
