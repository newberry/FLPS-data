   <p>Various German circles have indignantly protested in letters to the Abendpost concerning the attitude displayed in news reports and editorials of local English language newspapers. The reason for this antagonism is the cause for which the hoary ruler of the Dual Monarchy was forced--as a matter of honor--to draw the sword, and as a result of which the German nation may also be forced into the war as a faithful ally of Austria-Hungary.</p>
   <p>In all of these letters exception is taken to the malicious way in which both Austria-Hungary and Germany are treated by the English language press. In these newspapers the rulers of these countries are pictured as disturbers of the peace of the world and destroyers of twentieth-century civilization, while the ruler of the Slavs is portrayed as one fighting a desperate battle for freedom. Many of the writers express the opinion that it is high time to unite <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>all the Germans of Chicago in a demonstration to halt these incitements.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost, having received word that the board of directors of the local branch of the German-American National Bund will meet today to discuss the question of calling a meeting of all the Germans in Chicago to issue a mass protest, made an inquiry among the officers of some of the best-known and most influential German societies in the city, questioning them on their attitudes toward the matter. The result of the inquiry follows:</p>
   <p>Eugene Niederegger, president of Genefelder Liederkranz: "It is impossible to find words adequate to describe the effrontery which the English language press displays in persecuting Germany. Of course, it is the old story--'The Negro has done his duty'. We Germans helped the United States to attain its present prominent position among the nations of the world, but this fact is forgotten in this hour of Germany's sore distress; and now the American press gives to the Slavs the place which rightfully belongs to the Germans. I hope that the present situation of the Germans of America will prove to them that it is very <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>important that they unite, that there must be harmony among them as there is among our brothers in our native land. It is clear that I, as president of the Senefelder Liederkranz, will try to promote the good cause by bringing all my influence to bear upon the members of that organization, and also upon the members of the Schwaben Verein, which I served as president for many years. I think that the protest by a mass meeting will prove to be an effective means of opposing the persecution by the English language press." A similar opinion was expressed by Mr. F. W. Hess, now president of the Schwaben Verein.</p>
   <p>A. W. Discus, president of the Interstate Round Table Club, the membership of which includes about three hundred prominent businessmen, said: "As an American of German descent I naturally follow the events in the old homeland with great interest, and I am astonished to note the stand which the English language press takes in this matter. I cannot understand how the Chicago press could dare to take this attitude toward the Germans, for they have served the city well. In my opinion a mass meeting would be the most effective means of protesting against the persecution."</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Philip Jahn, former secretary of the Hessen-Verein, writes: "The Germans of Chicago seem to have finally awakened. They have permitted the English language press to kick them around long enough. Apparently such a trying hour was necessary to show us that we must unite firmly. A vigorous protest by a mass meeting would open the eyes of the English language press."</p>
   <p>Frank Gusinde, president of the Lake View Krieger Verein: "I shall do all I can to make the proposed mass meeting a success--at least as far as the organization over which I preside is concerned. It is a shame that the English language press has taken such an attitude toward us and our former fatherland in this extremity, but it seems that we are to blame, inasmuch as we have not been active enough. I welcome the movement for united action."</p>
   <p>Theodore Pilzmann, president of the Junger Maennerchor: "Now the Teutons seem to notice that they have always been kept in the background by the English language press. I have expected the persecution. Therefore I hail the idea of a mass protest. I hope that it will have the desired effect."</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Matthias Hibbler, past master of Mythra Lodge (Masonic), and president of the Center Street Improvement Club: "It is time for the English language press to be enlightened. The Germans have tolerated such treatment too long. In my opinion a mass meeting would prove to be effective."</p>
   <p>Fritz Nebel, former president of the Harugari Maennerchor, and a prominent member of Liedertafel Eintracht: "I am glad that the Germans of Chicago are finally taking up the fight against the unscrupulous local English language press, which offends every German's sense of justice. I think that a mass meeting is in order and would not fail to yield the desired results."</p>
   <p>John Heidemann, president of the Wicker Park Maennerchor: "The behavior of the English language press makes me angry, and I can assure you that the members of the Wicker Park Maennerchor share my resentment. We are only waiting for an opportunity to co-operate in a united effort of the Germans of Chicago."</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Peter Willem, president of the Richard Wagner Maennerchor: "Although I was born of German parents in Philadelphia, I am a one hundred-per-cent German, and am proud of the successes of the Germans. The agitation by English language papers which are hostile to Germans has long incensed me, and at last there is to be a strong protest against it. Certainly I, and every other member of the Richard Wagner Maennerchor, are willing to do our share."</p>
   <p>E. Taeubert, secretary of the Schiller Liedertafel: "I am of the opinion that the time has come to show the English language press and the American people that while the German Michael can be passive and patiently submit to the many injustices to which the German people have heretofore been exposed, he can also put up a vigorous defense. As far as we are concerned, we shall be most happy to do our bit."</p>
   <p>O. Krueger, former president of the Harugari Liedertafel: "I think that an English language paper should be established to represent Germans and defend <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>the German Government. Something certainly must be done to put an end to the present intolerable conditions."</p>
   <p>Charles Breede, secretary of the Schleswig Holsteiner Saengerbund: "I am willing to defend the rights of Germans as much as I possibly can, and I think that the patience of our Teutons ought to be exhausted by this time. Our society will surely be present at the mass meeting."</p>
   <p>Alexander Lampe, secretary of Lessing Lodge (Masonic): "It is evident that I, as well as my Lodge, condemn the persecution by the local English language press. The chief object of our Lodge is to promote the interests of the German community. But I doubt that I, in my capacity as secretary of the Lodge, can assist in the movement to enter a protest, since the members of the Lodge are on vacation during the month of August, and consequently no meeting can be held. Then, too, I shall be leaving on a trip within the next few days. Nevertheless, I wish to state most emphatically that we approve of all the measures which may be necessary to curb the persecution by the arrogant English language press and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>and will always defend the honor of the German name."</p>
   <p>George Tag, grand secretary of the Bairisch-Amerikanischer Verein: "I shall introduce this matter for discussion in the meeting of our society next Sunday, and recommend that the board of directors take a stand on the issue and pass a resolution endorsing the plan to call a mass meeting for the purpose of protesting. But it would require at least four weeks to mobilize our six hundred members...."</p>
   <p>Max Hirsch, secretary of the Vereinigte Saenger: "I am always ready when it becomes necessary to promote the interests of the German people. I shall do everything I possibly can to persuade the Vereinigte Saenger, of whom I am president, to participate in the proposed protest meeting."</p>
   <p>Lorenz Mattern, president of the Veterans of the 24th Illinois Regiment: "The contribution to your 'Vox Populi' is correct. Austria-Hungary's demands on the accomplices of those murderers who perpetrated the most ghastly deed imaginable <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>was not unjust. I am in complete agreement with the proposed steps to curb the slanderous English language press. I am convinced that the English language press is well aware of the contributions which Germans have made to the successful development of the United States, and that the English language publications are motivated by sheer malice. I do not doubt for a minute that my comrades are of the same opinion."</p>
   <p>E. Guntermann, secretary of the Deutscher Militaer-Gesangverein: "Every member of the organization which I am serving as secretary is willing to fight for the honor of Germany. Therefore, we shall not fail to join the movement against the malicious persecution by the English language press, and, if the planned meeting is called, we shall be present in a body."</p>
   <p>Paul Wenzel, president of Gesangverein Harmonie: "I shall put the matter before my organization for discussion. I shall be only too happy to use all my influence to have a resolution passed that the protest meeting be attended by all our members. In any event, the mean persecution by the English language <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>press should be counteracted as soon as possible."</p>
   <p>E. Buerler, president of Vereinigte Schweizer-Vereine: "Since I have not followed the editorials of the English language press lately, I cannot judge whether or not a protest is in order. However, if it is, the Schweizer-Vereine will most assuredly make the cause of the German people their own. I am astonished that the editors of our English language newspapers, who must surely be familiar with the cultural work of the Germans, should espouse the course of the Slavs. In this matter we side with the Germans. I shall bring it to the attention of our members when we hold our next meeting and recommend that, if it is necessary, all who are connected with our organization attend the protest meeting."</p>
   <p>Henry Walsch, secretary of the Tiroler Und Vorarlberger Verein: "I have taken note of the peculiar attitude of the English language press, and I have sought a reason for it. Is it rooted in ignorance or in malice? It is time that something be done about these persecutions, and a mass protest would no doubt be <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>the most effective way of dealing with the situation. My society will most certainly accept an invitation."</p>
   <p>Andreas Kost, secretary of Vereinigte Oesterreichische-Ungarische Vereine: "It has not occurred to me that the English language press favors the cause of the Slavs in its war reports. My social contacts are limited to German circles, it is true, yet up to the present time I have heard no complaints. However, if what you say is true, then something must be done, and that very soon. Our society is a member of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer National Bund, and is that organization calls a mass meeting, we shall be in attendance."</p>
   <p>Charles Roule, secretary of Liedertafel Vorwaerts: "It is a fact that the Slavs are oppressed in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. I am speaking from experience, for my father was a Czech, and I myself was born in Austria. I can see a reason for the attitude of the English language press, for American is the land of liberty and considers it her duty to champion the cause of freedom. However, my personal leanings are toward the Germans, and the Liedertafel Vorwaerts will undoubtedly be present at a mass meeting, if one is called."</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Joseph Schlenker, president of the Deutscher Kriegerverein: "It is a shame that the English language newspapers grant indiscriminate use of their columns to the heckling and firebrands of the Slavs. It is high time that the Germans, who constitute more than one third of the population of Chicago, take measures against these slanders and vilifications. The American press seems to have forgotten that the Germans furnished hundreds of thousands of soldiers when the fate of the Union was at stake. Where were the Serbs at that time, and the other Slavs who now shout so loudly? I am heart and soul for expressing the indignation of the Germans through concerted action. I fully agree with the contemplated measures of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer National Bund, and will introduce them for discussion in our meeting next Sunday."</p>
   <p>George A. Von Massow, president of the Verband der Veteranen der Deutschen Armee: "I fully approve of the plan to oppose the biased attitude and the evident favoritism of the English language press by united action of all the local German societies. The proposal of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer National Bund is <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>very timely. All German and Austrian organizations should be invited. It is certainly about time that the Germans of Chicago express themselves very emphatically concerning the shameful way they are being treated by the English language press. I shall most assuredly recommend that our organization, and others with which I can get in touch, act as the National Bund suggests."</p>
   <p>Gustav Schaetz, secretary of Herder Loge (Masonic): "I cannot take a stand as an officer of a Masonic Lodge, but as a German I am in full accord with the plans of the National Bund to take a united action against the persecution of Teutons by the prejudiced English language press. It is a shame that these publications permit the Slavs to use their columns to slander everything that is German. It is high time that effective measures be taken. We Germans of Chicago have great power and influence. United application of them will undoubtedly have a wholesome effect."</p>
   <p>Charles Wurster, secretary of the Germania Club of Chicago: "The English press does not treat us as we deserve to be treated in view of our numerical strength <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>and our past accomplishments in behalf of our country. Innate modesty prevents a German from advertising his deeds in a newspaper. He is not in the habit of doing his fighting with pen and ink and behind the protection of walls, but rather with gun and sword, and on open battlefields. It is high time that the Germans protest against the biased conduct of the English language press. The suggestion of the National Bund is certainly in order and most timely. The members of the Germania Club of Chicago will naturally support every German movement which is intended to secure for Germans their rightful place among our citizens."</p>
   <p>Ernest Kusswurm, first speaker of the Chicago Turngemeinde: "If we believe that the English language press is too one-sided, we Germans should explain our side of the matter to them as clearly and impartially as we possibly can. It cannot be denied that the English language press is influenced more by England than by Germany, or that it expresses English wishes more than German wishes. However, the Germans and Austrians have only themselves to blame if the English language newspapers do not give them the same consideration as the <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>Slavic nations receive. If the Germans would participate in public life more energetically and zealously they would have just as much influence with these publications as the English-speaking elements of the population. In that case they would probably accomplish more than the Slavs. Since the Germans remain aloof from public life and politics, we need not be surprised that they have little or no influence upon other nationalities and the English language press. If we remain calm in these days when excitement is increasing we will accomplish more. I do not think very much of a mass protest--I doubt that it would be very effective."</p>
   <p>Emil Mihlke, president of the Deutscher Militaer Verein: "I fully approve of the plan to hold a mass meeting. Of course I shall attend and see to it that many of my comrades also are present."</p>
   <p>Robert Wagner, president of the Verein Deutscher Reservisten: "Of course we are accustomed to reading lies about Germans in the English language press. Now we will have to show our colors. Anyone who does not is a big coward. Naturally I approve of the plan to hold a mass meeting, and I believe that my <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>society will unanimously indorse it."</p>
   <p>Gustav Geleng, president of the Zentralverband Deutscher Militaer Vereine and the Verein Deutscher Veteranen: "We need not suffer this malicious persecution by the English language press and the local Slavs any longer. When we think of that murderous deed which also included the taking of a woman's life, we can have no sympathy for the perpetrators of the deed. I will do everything within my power to make the proposed meeting a success."</p>
   <p>Otto Drews, president of the Deutscher Kriegerbund: "You may depend upon my society's full attendance. I live in a part of the city where Slavs recently tore down an American Flag and an escutcheon bearing the coat of arms of the United States and trampled upon them, and I am highly indignant about the affair. We certainly do not have to stand for such acts."</p>
   <p>Albert Naumann, president of the Verein Deutscher Waffengenossen: "I fully agree with the proposed plan to have a mass meeting for the purpose of protesting <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>against the slander heaped upon Germans by the English language press, and I shall gladly put forth my best efforts to persuade my comrades to attend."</p>
   <p>Herman Rosenblatt, president of the Deutsche Krieger Von Sued Chicago: "I am in full accord with the plan of the National Bund to hold a mass meeting for the purpose of protesting against articles in the English language press which are a travesty on truth, and which are intended to glorify the Slavic nations during the present European crisis. If the proposal of the National Bund is adopted I shall recommend that my organization attend."</p>
   <p>Konrad Gleiser, former president of the Deutscher Soldaten Verein Der Suedseite: "I have often wondered why protest meetings have not been called long ago. The cartoons and news items of the English press are abominable and must fill every true German with righteous indignation and anger. I do not tolerate these tools of persecution in my home, and I would be glad to attend a mass meeting. But it must be a real mass meeting, for otherwise it will be of no effect."</p>
   <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>
   <p>Georg Studenroth, grand bard of the Harugari: "We are German and will co-operate with the Germans of Chicago in case a meeting is held to protest against the insidious falsehoods of the English language press. I am very sympathetic with the movement, and would gladly act upon a definite request."</p>
   <p>F. A. Egger, president of the Schweizer Liederkranz: "It is evident that the Swiss who side with the Germans are very deeply offended and are highly incensed because the English language press espouses the cause of the Serbs and Slavs. Personally I am heart and soul in favor of the mass meeting and I am certain that the majority of the other members, especially our president, with whom I have conferred on the matter, share my attitude. I shall introduce the proposal of the National Bund for discussion in our meeting this evening."</p>
   <p>Walter Oesterle, member of the Technischer Verein: "The stand recently taken by the English language press over and against Austria-Hungary and Germany, and the blind partisanship of English language newspapers for Serbia and Russia have made me very angry, because I still love my native land. I am very much <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>in favor of a mass meeting and know that the majority of the members of the Technischer Verein will be present if the plan of the National Bund is adopted."</p>
   <p>Karl Bergl, member of the Saxonia Verein: "I have just finished reading the excellent contribution to the Abendpost which advocates that categorical means be devised and applied to force the English language press to cease slanderous attacks upon Germans. I am in complete agreement with the contributor. It is a shame that the Serbs who have never had even an atom of good culture, should be preferred to the Germans and Austrians. Our society meets tomorrow evening and I shall be only too happy to discuss the situation with the members."</p>
   <p>Balthasar Rau, member of the Sozialer Turnverein: "The English language newspapers deserve severe censure for assuming such a stand in this matter. In today's editorials the European powers are advised to follow the principle of 'watchful waiting,' as President Wilson did with reference to Mexico. Yet these same newspapers condemned him because of his policy. However, we should <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>beware of proclaiming race hatred, and perhaps it would not be a bad idea to practice 'watchful waiting' now. The Slavs also are members of the Verbuendete Vereine, and hence they are confederates of the Germans. Of course, I am speaking for myself only and cannot say what the Sozialer Turnverein or the Illinois Turnbezirk think of the matter."</p>
   <p>August Kropp, member of the Accordia Loge (Masonic): "The English language press is business-minded; it thinks it will have the approbation of its subscribers if it sides with the Serbs. If the Germans would stand united as the Serbs do, they would make a better impression upon the press. Accordia Loge will have no meeting until September, so I do not know what it will do."</p>
   <p>Jakob Kraft, secretary of the Pfaelzer Verein: "I believe that I speak not only my own opinion, but also the opinion of all the members of the Pfaelzer Verein, when I say that a mass protest against the continued efforts of the English language press to put German effort and achievement in an evil light meets our hearty approval and will have our combined support."</p>
   <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>
   <p>Ferdinand Neukranz, grand master of Plattdeutsche Gilde: "The Germans of Chicago must be endowed with more than a lamb's patience if they continue to tolerate the glib lies which the English language press has spread. The English language newspapers are inciting our citizens against our Austrian friends because they are confederates of the Germans. I am convinced that the nine thousand members of the Gilde will adopt a resolution to attend the proposed meeting."</p>
   <p>August Lueders, secretary of the Vereinigte Maennerchoere Von Chicago: "Anyone who lived in Chicago prior to the year 1870, as I have, and struggled against the attacks which were made upon the German people and culture at that time, knows how necessary it is to curb such persecutions, and I believe that a mass meeting would be just as effective as the one which the Germans were forced to call during the Spanish-American War. It is certain that the members of the Vereinigte Maennerchoere Von Chicago will be found in the front ranks."</p>
