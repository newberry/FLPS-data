   <p>From all sides we have reports about peace offers. In connection with these a further word of warning to the German people would not come amiss.</p>
   <p>Now, of all times, they should realize how hard it is even for the most magnanimous victor to negotiate with those liberal minded powers who have recently come to the fore in Germany, considering the prevailing conditions here even if they pretend to agree with the basic terms formulated by President Wilson. [Translator's note: the famous Fourteen Points.]</p>
   <p>The rulers in Germany seem suddenly to realize where the shoe pinches, now that the fortunes of war have taken such a decisive turn thanks to America's entry.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Reforms are resorted to, but reforms from above. One even considers--listen and marvel!--calling the Social Democrats into the Ministries of the Reich.</p>
   <p>True reform of lasting quality can only originate with the people themselves, a procedure which, within the German Reich unfortunately is still looked upon as "from below". They have not learned yet that in every state or nation the people must reign supreme. This alone makes for democracy. And America is fighting for the victory of the democratic ideal.</p>
   <p>The German people must, therefore, as we have repeatedly said before, take over themselves. They must change the Constitution of the Reich. How?--that is up to them. They even have to go about it in a different manner than has been done recently in order to establish the sovereignty of the people. Article eleven of the Constitution of the German Reich reads:</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The Emperor represents the Reich in its relations with foreign nations; on its behalf he declares war and concludes peace; he enters into alliances and agreements with foreign powers, and accredits and receives ambassadors. To declare war in behalf of the Reich the consent of the Bundesrat (Federal Council) is necessary."</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: in the Bundesrat all the German states and Kingdoms of which the German Reich was composed at that time were represented.]</p>
   <p>What does all this imply? Nothing else but this: The Emperor alone has the right to conclude peace.</p>
   <p>In negotiating peace terms, not even the Bundesrat has one word to say. One should again read the above quoted article of the constitution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>According to the Constitution of the German Reich the German people, tortured and suffering, have not even the right to decide whether or not they can live at peace again with other nations of the globe. The Emperor alone, at least according to the Constitution of the German Reich, could decide whether the mass murder be continued, even if the German people in their overwhelming majority favored peace.</p>
   <p>This is a mockery of all modern state procedures, autocracy of the worst sort, and a caricature of all democratic ideas. And this is what the German people have to change, and as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>But how? Again, according to the Constitution of the Reich, fourteen votes in the Bundesrat could block a change in the constitution by veto. This provision was instituted by Prince Bismarck and was well meant. He wanted to make a <span class="page-break">5</span>concession to the Kingdoms of Bavaria, Saxony, and Wuerttemberg, which together controlled fourteen votes in the Bundesrat. He wanted to give them the power to prevent Prussia from ever extending its sphere of influence still farther within the Reich. But Prussia, which in reality means the king of Prussia or the German Emperor, controls seventeen votes of a total of fifty-eight in the Bundesrat and therefore it is again the Raiser who, alone and independently, can prevent a change in the constitution, because the seventeen votes of Prussia are given according to his will.</p>
   <p>Here in America we do not know, and probably neither do the German people, whether or not the Kaiser is at present agreed to a change in the constitution. Nor does it make any difference.</p>
   <p>What we and what the whole world do know, however, and what the German people should know, is that an autocracy of this kind cannot and must not continue to exist, since by it world peace will always be disturbed and prevented. This, <span class="page-break">6</span>in fact, is the only inner affair of the German Reich which also concerns the outside world. In other respects how the German people would like to be governed is their own business and of no concern to anybody outside the borders of the German Reich. President Wilson has repeatedly emphasized that nothing could be farther from his mind than to interfere with the internal affairs of another country and no other nation should be allowed to do so, either.</p>
   <p>The question now is, will the German people take matters into their own hands and bring about the necessary reform? American citizens of German stock will give them encouragement. They want to help them. For this purpose they have even founded an association, called "American Friends of German Democracy," which is devoting its efforts to enlightening and encouraging the German people, just as has been done in the series of articles of which this will be the last. Americans of German descent are acting from their innermost conviction that not only must the world be made safe for democracy, but also that this same democracy will be the final salvation of the German people. We over here, <span class="page-break">7</span>Americans of German origin, know what terrible suffering the German people have sustained, and for the sake of old love and loyalty for our compatriots we want to deliver them from their plight. We have no right to discuss the nature of possible peace terms, until or unless autocracy has been abolished and the real representatives of the German people bid for peace.</p>
   <p>But this is our sacred belief: the quicker the German people act the sooner peace will come, and the quicker peace is established the easier the peace terms that will be imposed. These, to be sure, America will decide, according to the plan formulated by that great American statesman, President Wilson.</p>
   <p>May the German people find enlightenment and thereby the courage of their conviction, to act in the interest of peace and democracy!</p>
