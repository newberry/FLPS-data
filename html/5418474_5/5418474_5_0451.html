   <p>The Chicago sharpshooters association had as luncheon guests the Commander of the 11th Illinois Infantry Regiment and his staff.</p>
   <p>What German's heart does not beat faster when he remembers the lovely times he had while a member of the Sharpshooters Association in his German home town. And where is there a German woman today who does not remember the ball at the Sharpshooters festival when she danced the first polka with the grayhead at her side? How proudly he marched as the Sharpshooter King amidst the flagbearers, King's medal pinned to his breast, and how proud he was when he lead the polonaise with her on his arm! Is it therefore surprising, that the Germans of Chicago founded a Sharpshooters Association, as far back as 1865? Even if it is called, today, Chciago Sharpshooters Association, it remains a rifle-men's club, and has gained, amongst all nationalities, so much approbation that it stands as one of the most flourishing associations of Chicago. The idea, to hold a mutual luncheon, pleased everybody and the first was held yesterday, in the banquet room of the Hotel Atlantic. It was the more interesting as Colonel James E. Stewart of the 11th Infantry Regiment and his staff <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>were invited as honorary guests. Uniforms among the guests predominated, because some of the members belonged to the Regiment. The army chaplain of the regiment, J. A. Jenkins, said the prayer, and the President of the society, George Kersten, acted as toastmaster. He welcomed the guests and members, and presented. Colonel Stewart, who, in his address praised the uprightness and courage of the country's German citizens. He himself has participated in the Civil War and he named Germans whom he knew and respected, among others being Adolf Georg and Peter Hand, who was a member of the Sharpshooters Association. J. A. Jenkins also spoke and both speeches were accorded great applause. Colonel Stewart thanked, in his own name as well as for the staffs, the association for the invitation, and was greeted with a "Hip, Hip, Hurrah" several times. He invited the hosts to visit the 11th Regiment, an invitation which was accepted with shouts of jubilation.</p>
