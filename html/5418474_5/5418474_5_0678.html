   <p>The fast liner Lusitania was sunk yesterday afternoon off Kinsale Head, eight miles from the Irish coast. There is no more doubt about it. It is a fact. Anything else we may hear in connection with the incident has to be confirmed yet. Rumors and assumptions have still to be proved correct.</p>
   <p>So far, very little is known about the causes of the sinking of the proud ship. The quartermaster of the Lusitania claimed that the vessel was hit by two torpedoes while the passengers were having their dinner. Another report mentions seven torpedoes. That is all we know. Not a word that a German submarine was sighted. Not a word from any of the ship's officers about what happened. Care in judgment is therefore indicated, but the verdict has already been pronounced: The Lusitania was torpedoed by the Germans, and without warning at that.</p>
   
   <p>That may be so, but it is by no means certain. The first reports agreed that all the passengers, as well as the crew had been saved, which seemed plausible, because the weather was good and the sea calm when the Lusitania went down, and dozens of boats were at hand almost immediately to give aid. But later reports, telling of a great loss of human life, grew steadily worse. They mention 1400 to 1500 casualties, because so far only between six and seven hundred survivors have been landed. We know that there were many more rescue boats on hand than have come into ports since--especially a large Greek steamer which reached the scene immediately after the catastrophe took place. But one does not wait to hear from them and gives up as lost all those boats that have not been reported yet. There seems to be something fishy, as if an effort were being made to have the number of casualties--especially American ones--appear as large as possible, to get the American people good and mad at Germany. It is possible that the disaster cost as many lives as was reported, but it is not yet certain. The well-known unreliability of British news reports, and the fact that it is to the obvious advantage of England to make the catastrophe appear as disastrous as possible,  justify hopes that the first reports were closer to the truth, and that only few lives were lost.</p>
   <p>Supposing the Lusitania was sunk by German torpedoes without warning, and more than a thousand persons, including many Americans, had perished. What then? Who is responsible for the American lives--and only these concern us here--that were lost? The Anglo-American newspapers unanimously voice their outrage at Germany's "brutal murder of innocent people," and categorically demand that America take revenge. But we must not take this seriously. It's just an outburst of sentimentality in which reason plays no part, and it just signifies how completely pro-British the general attitude is. At a second and more sober consideration, these papers will use more moderate language. After some reflection and meditation, they might even come to the conclusion that they themselves are partly to blame for this loss of American lives, which otherwise is the responsibility of the British government.</p>
   <p>If a German submarine torpedoed the Lusitania without warning and before passengers and crew members were safe, it certainly was against all former rules of warfare and against previously established international regulations, but it was not Germany which initiated violations of international law, but England with her warfare against innocent women and children and other noncombatants, by announcing a hunger blockade against the German people, which she implemented by cutting Germany off from any and all supplies, thus brazenly flouting the trade rights of all neutral nations. We have to go by existing conditions, not by theories, and international law was first robbed of its potency and reduced to a dead theory by England.</p>
   <p>When Germany declared her submarine war against England and announced which waters she considered combat area, she acted in justified self-defense and was deadly serious with her announcement, as it should be with any emergency measure. For reasons she herself knew best, England did not take seriously this declaration of submarine warfare by Germany, or at least gave that impression, and Anglophile American felt the same way about it. The same newspapers which are now foaming at the mouth at Germany's latest "crime" outdid their British prototypes in scoffing at the German paper submarine blockade and laughed at German efforts, through advertisements and special warnings, to make the American public realize the dangers of a trip on British vessels through the war zone.</p>
   <p>Those Americans who traveled on the Lusitania trusted Anglo-American newspapers more than they did the German warnings. They relied on the assurances of their British travel agents that the Lusitania was too fast for submarines and could not be sunk by a torpedo anyway, or they depended on the British Admiralty to send a few warships to meet the precious vessel and take her into convoy and through the war zone. After the express warning which Germany had given with respect to the Lusitania, the passengers were justified in their expectation of special protection. But the mighty British fleet did not come to the assistance of the Lusitania, and those who trusted the assurances of the British and the Anglophiles, and laughingly disregarded the German announcements and warnings, considering them just a bluff, are now at the mercy of the waves or sleep their eternal sleep in a watery grave.</p>
   
   <p>Germany does not boast or bluff; she never did. She announces what she is going to do and then does it. The history of the past nine months demonstrates that. It explains the Lusitania disaster, assuming that the reports we have are correct. We hope that this will prove a convincing lesson for pro-British America and England and her allies. The quicker and better this lesson is learned, the sooner this horrible war will be over, the cheaper Germany's enemies will get off.</p>
