   <p>The World War not only exercised great influence upon our ideas and way of thinking, but it also enriched our language with numerous new words. New terms are now used to designate old ideas, and old terms are used to designate new ideas. We call attention to the words "camouflage," "over there," and "Bolshevism". In the latter category we find also the expression "German propaganda". Not many years back this term was used to designate the endeavors of Germany, or of the German Emperor, to acquaint foreign nations with German science, German art, German music, German methods of developing the body, and other achievements and accomplishments of the German people which are known to the civilized world under the name "culture". Only since the United States entered the war was it suspected that this kind of propaganda was also being used to help the enemy. But even when the inflamed passions of our people threatened to overwhelm all calm deliberation, the authorities at Washington continued to distinguish between a German propaganda which was intended to gain friends and greater respect for German life and industry, and a German propaganda intended to harm the American cause (war).</p>
   
   <p>However, our English publications and the greater number of societies which were allegedly organized for patriotic purposes only, such as the "Security Leagues," "Defense Leagues," "Liberty Leagues," etc., were almost entirely devoid of impartial judgment. They condemned all German propaganda and all mediums of transmitting it--opera, kindergarten, dyes, lenses, the German language, toys, etc. Everybody will wholeheartedly approve of the judgment pronounced upon the efforts of the former German Government to influence the public opinion of our people through American newspapers which German agents purchased expressly for that purpose. But in this connection we must not overlook the fact that nearly every other nation, in one way or another, tries to create an interest in its national products among other nations. And so long as these efforts do not conflict with our interests there should be no objection. But many of the objections which were raised against German propaganda are equally applicable to her chief rival for the favor of the commercial world, England. It was hardly necessary to engage in the recent bitter argument in our Senate and in our House of Representatives in order to impress this fact upon the minds of the American public. Decades ago England sent graduates of its universities and representatives of its banks and of its commercial and industrial enterprises to the "land of unlimited possibilities," and saw to it that these "envoys" were placed in suitable spheres of American life. For obvious reasons special attention was given to the press, and today there are few large daily papers published in the management of which at least one Canadian or one Englishman has not a leading part. No wonder that England's conduct and actions are looked upon and discussed from a different, from a friendlier viewpoint, than are the conduct and actions of other nations. No wonder that facts which would harm England's name or business are recorded in such inconspicuous places in our newspapers.</p>
   <p>In many cities schoolbooks have been purged of all historical references to Germany which favor her, to protect youthful minds against evil influences, or to influence these young people. Any such procedure, if aimed at England, would be of no avail. England has not limited itself to pleading its cause through schoolbooks and through the daily press. It controls nearly all magazines, weekly and monthly periodicals, which are printed by the millions in the United States, and through these publications it carries on a propaganda which is just as effective and enduring as the influence exercised by all the other newspapers which are printed in our country. The novels and romances which have appeared in these journals have been contributed by English writers, who never fail to sing the praises of the great, noble, and all powerful British nation. In these stories the role of the dunce, the fool, the intriguer, the traitor, or the criminal is always given to Germans, while the hero, as a rule, is the second, or third, or fourth son of some English lord of very ancient nobility. Nobody will deny that such one-sided descriptions will lead our young Americans to fundamentally wrong conclusions, not only in regard to England and Germany, but also in regard to our own country. Englishmen and Americans of English descent occupy commanding positions in our chambers of commerce, in our industrial organizations, and even in our "Councils of Defense". An English-American who was Chairman of the board of defense in a large western state admitted shortly before he took office that he had violated his American citizenship by performing semiofficial war service for England while America was neutral; and even the citizenship of this gentleman is doubted. The president of a certain New York society which was organized to oppose the German press of our land and to counteract the influence of some "pro-German" American newspapers, was--an Englishwoman. The president of an organization established to suppress German music was of the same nationality. The extent of England's influence in America is evident from the fact that immediately after Great Britain declared an embargo on American goods a large part of the press of our country, and the chambers of commerce of New York and other cities, declared that this procedure was fully justified, and even advantageous to our interests.</p>
   <p>Not only German propaganda, but every propaganda is to be condemned if it proves to be troublesome or prevents unreserved adherence to American principles, and it should not be tolerated whether it is carried on in behalf of Germany or Greece or China or England. Americans, too, have learned from the World War that every nation has complete claim to the loyalty and devotion of its citizens, irrespective of whether they are citizens by birth or by naturalization. American citizens, no matter where they were born, should be intent upon the national, political, and economic advantages of their own country, if they wish to concern themselves with propaganda. It behooves every American to confine himself to American propaganda. [Translator's note: No doubt the author meant to say "propaganda in the interest of America".]</p>
