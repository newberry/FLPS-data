   <p>Great activity prevails at the home of Mrs. Centa Wengenmeyer, 2216 La Cross Street. The club members sew diligently and ceaselessly for the German Red Cross. Mrs. Wengenmeyer succeeded in obtaining the necessary material for night-gowns, hospital-shirts, and other articles for wounded German soldiers. The supplies were procured from liberal donors and will be converted into suitable items by a number of members from the Women's Club of Former German Soldiers and Sailors. The ladies work as diligently as bees and even curtail the usual lunch time. Such a splendid example should be emulated.</p>
