   <p>Judging from the numerous reports that come from Washington, there are far-reaching differences of opinion within the government with respect to the next steps to be taken for the reconstruction of economic conditions. One group in the administration is in favor of a thoroughgoing building program on a colossal scale. To this latter belong Ickes, Perkins, and Hopkins. Another group, to which Farley, Walker, Moffett, and Richberg belong, is decidedly against it. Either group is in a position to cite plausible arguments for its opinion.</p>
   <p>It is absolutely undeniable, and has been long acknowledged, that a real economic revival cannot be expected without a colossal increase in building activities. During the years 1925 to 1928, inclusive, 2700 million dollars were spent each year, on an average, for the building of dwelling houses alone. In the year of the great crash, 1929, this sum fell to around 1900 million; in 1932 and 1933, this sum was less than 300 million, and, in the current <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>year, it is not expected to be much higher.</p>
   <p>The causes for the catastrophic collapse of building activity are generally known. In the years of great opportunities, the building trend was so distinctly upward that there were too many houses when the crash came. This applied to buildings for industrial and commercial purposes, as well as to dwelling houses. Meanwhile, however, the situation has changed in this respect. In the five years since the start of the economic breakdown, numerous houses became overage, and many old factory buildings needed to be replaced by new ones. As is evidenced from various reports, this latter branch of the building industry shows a small improvement.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the building of dwelling houses is somehow making no progress and for this reason the government wants to offer a helping hand here. Opponents of the plan, however, point out that it does not pay to build dwelling houses, because building material is too expensive, and the wages of artisans are too high. The most important factor here is the wages of workmen, who are <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in a strange predicament. For years, they had no work, or only little of it. Therefore, they argue convincingly that they have to demand high wages because they get so few hours of work.</p>
   <p>Although nothing can be said against this argument, it is a fact that construction workers would get more hours of work if they consented to accept lower wages. At any rate, opponents of the building program are right in their assertion that the construction of dwelling houses would not pay until rents have risen considerably. This, however, is out of the question, for, if considerably more houses are built, it is reasonably to be expected that rents will become lower, not higher.</p>
   <p>It is, furthermore, pointed out that the carrying out of a large building program by the government would cause hardship and injustice to the present owners of houses, as their property would become lower in value as a result. This argument is undoubtedly justified, too. Where, then, is a way out of this dilemma? The question is not hard to answer. The best thing the government <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>can do is to do nothing. It has already tried a number of measures to increase building activities, and the effects of these attempts will become apparent within a few years. Anyway, there will be a solution to the apparently insoluble problem which at present confronts the building trade. Everything finds a level. It has always been like that, and will be so this time.</p>
