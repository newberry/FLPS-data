   <p>Perhaps because, for the first time since public singing in German was successfully suppressed here, German singing could be heard again, and in the presence of Federal officers; perhaps because of the deep emotion which had seized everyone as a natural consequence of the bloody sacrifices of war, which Americans of German descent also have made, the convention which took place in Wicker Park Hall yesterday assumed a singularly solemn aspect. The deep impression it made on all the fourteen hundred present was reflected in the speeches made by the Illinois superintendent for War Savings Stamps, Martin A. Ryerson, and the secretary of the War Savings Stamps Committee for Illinois, Professor Shailer Matthews. Seldom can one hear "The Star-Spangled Banner" rendered with such deep feeling as it was sung by the Vereinigte Maennerchoere (United Male Choruses) and the Vereinigte Saenger (United Singers).Professor Matthews acknowledged this fact frankly and had no less praise for the German songs, "Das ist der Tag des Herrn" (This is the Day of the Lord) and "Sonntag's ist" ('Tis Sunday), which <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the chorus, conducted by Marl Reclkzoh in a competent manner, rendered in German.</p>
   <p>The singers seemed to sense that the wall of hatred and slander was breaking down, a wall erected by people who, as Mr. Leopold Neuman observed in his speech, do not amount to anything and only aimed to advance themselves by their anti-German propaganda. In the future nobody can claim to do a patriotic deed if he tries to prevent the best and most loyal Americans, as those of German descent justly consider themselves, from using the German language in speech and song.</p>
   <p>Realizing the basic purpose of the convention, the chairman, Judge John Stelk, conducted the ceremonies from beginning to end in German. He said in his introduction that the Americans of German extraction found themselves at present in a precarious situation, but that he could see the sun breaking through the clouds. In the near future they will again occupy their rightful place among the nationalities of which the American people are composed. This is no time <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for arguments and dissension among citizens. The Government does not oppose the German language, but does not declare itself for the German nationality, in order not to antagonize other parts of the population in turn. The speaker emphasized that the hateful resentment against Americans of German origin does not reflect so much the sentiments of the Yankees [Translator's note: the word here means people of genuine old American stock] as those of the Czechs and Poles and other nationalities which are in conflict with Germans over there. Even the British Canadians admit that the Germans here are treated unfairly. The excellently loyal attitude of the Germans is all the more appreciated by the Government, which fully realizes the difficulties arising from hatred and suspicion. "Our loyalty," said the speaker, "is one hundred per cent. Only we mustn't make the mistake of going about with a chip on our shoulder and thus justifying our adversaries. At this time there are two hundred and fifty thousand boys of German extraction under the command of General Pershing in France. It is therefore fitting to celebrate Pershing Week by a solemn demonstration of loyalty and to renew our promise to give the Government effective support by means of the Liberty Loan as well as the War Savings Stamp Loan, in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>order that our boys over there may not want." Judge Stelk then added that the Government itself would issue reports in German. This would effectively put an end to the controversy regarding the German language. After that, Director Martin A. Ryerson made the following speech, which was enthusiastically applauded:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Chairman, and citizens! 'Citizens', an expression which has been abused by stump orators of petty politics, has assumed a new and powerful meaning under the pressure of a grave emergency, for at this time our citizenship is being tested most severely and our share of this citizenship has taken on an importance never before dreamed of. Not only must this share arouse in us the sense of civic solidarity on which the expression 'citizen' is usually based, but we must become conscious of a higher sense, namely, sacrifice, one heart and soul for the welfare of our country.</p>
   <p>"The differences of opinion, the competition, the idiosyncrasies, which may find social and political expression in time of peace, must give way, during the crisis which we are now facing, to unity in thought and action which comprise <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>political life as a whole.</p>
   <p>"We must put aside for the moment all personal or group interests which do not influence favorably the main problems of the day, and we must dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to those tasks the support of which is the common duty of all loyal American citizens.</p>
   <p>"No discrimination of race, religion, or party must for one moment obliterate the most important fact, that we are as one in our adherence to our country and that it is our duty to stand shoulder to shoulder in mutual trust and mutual protection.</p>
   <p>"The present World War, into which were drawn all the countries from which our population, to a certain extent still polyglot, originated, has created a situation which makes the acceleration of the Americanization process, which in normal times is rather slow, a necessity.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"This process is a decisive one and requires the transformation of deeply rooted standards and ideals. The standard which it aspires to is in a state of change itself, and it is therefore difficult to draw a clear picture of its final form, but we have a liberal conception of the term 'American' and we share certain ideals which it represents. But we approach this conception from so many different ways that in reality we were not always conscious of a unifying impulse and at times wondered if our neighbor had violated our national unity, whether he was the same kind of patriot as we were ourselves.</p>
   <p>"In times of peace and prosperity such thoughts did not bother us very much, but if we are suddenly confronted with a national emergency, if the united action of the people is necessary for the maintenance of our national honor and prosperity, then every lack of mutual understanding and trust becomes a source of confusion and weakness.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>"The multiplicity of our origin is reflected in certain groups of our people which cherish a sentiment for another country, their former homeland or their ancestors. Each of these groups, held together by common language and tradition, maintains the consciousness of the difference of opinion within the other groups. It is known by a name, and names are used for their associations, clubs, and other common activities, where the word 'American' is connected by a hyphen with the designation of a foreign race or language. This is the natural manifestation of a sentiment which within legal bounds is promising for the new homeland, but which must be so well guarded that we do not give others the impression that sentiment for the old country cannot be reconciled with loyalty to the new.</p>
   <p>"During normal times these group activities and this hyphenation would seem unimportant, but in times of national emergency and danger, when we are asked to stand together for the defense of our country, anything that would indicate a lack of co-operation, no matter how insignificant it may seem, is a source of weakness for us and a consolation for our enemies.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>"A hyphen, which ordinarily would not have any political significance, would then assume quite a different meaning. The hyphen may cease to have a purely sentimental meaning in the eyes of public opinion, and may look as if our Americanism were with reservations; and it may make us with one stroke different from our neighbor.</p>
   <p>"It is therefore necessary for those who have united themselves for sentimental reasons, for the sake of art, mutual assistance, welfare, or social activities, to demonstrate by words and deeds that the purpose of their organization in no way interferes with their sense of duty and true loyalty toward our country; it is necessary for them to show fellow citizens who are not so organized their willingness to put the facilities of their organizations at the disposal of every patriotic activity to which they are invited, at the service of the Government, and to subordinate their own ambitions to the great cause of winning this war.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>"The National War Savings Committee, recognizing the existence of the various national groups, has, in order to put their great power at the country's service, created the foreign language departments.</p>
   <p>"You have been invited to this meeting by the German department of the War Savings Committee for Illinois, whose chairman is Judge Stelk.</p>
   <p>"Our committee is aware that many of our fellow citizens of foreign birth or origin find themselves in a very painful and precarious position due to this great war, and especially is this the case with those of German origin. They are asked to fulfill the duties of citizenship under conditions which make this task a difficult one. Many of them are undergoing, during these days of stress, an ordeal which calls for the greatest steadfastness on their part and a sympathetic understanding on the part of their fellow citizens. We trust that neither will be lacking.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>"Americans of German birth or origin have played an important part in the development of our country. They have demonstrated an understanding of the spirit and purpose of our democracy and a conception of civic responsibility which have stood the test in every great crisis of our country. So it was during the great Civil War, and nobody who has seen the casualty lists of our soldiers over there can fail to overlook the many German names on the honor roll. We are certain that the people of German descent are glad now, as they have always been, when it is shown how they demonstrate their love of country. Confidently we have called you together, therefore, to show you how you can render your country a great service by active support of the War Savings movement.</p>
   <p>"Many of you are already familiar with this War Savings plan and have purchased War Savings Stamps, but the increasing importance of our enterprise has caused us to spur our fellow citizens to new efforts, in order to make this a success here in Illinois. We urgently ask that you participate generously, personally and through your clubs and organizations. We suggest that you adopt the War <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>Savings Plan and through your co-operation give special expression to your patriotic support of our government. For this purpose the plan is admirably suited for large groups, and its requirements are within the means of every man, woman or child. Furthermore, the plan calls for personal service in the conservation of the resources of our country, in order to satisfy the requirements of our army and navy, a daily and hourly demonstration of our loyalty, in which everybody can take part. In Judge Stelk you have a wonderful leader. Please give him your full co-operation."</p>
   <p>After the first two songs--"Das ist der Tag des Herrn"--and after Miss Lucy Hempe, accompanied by Miss Ruth Eppling, had sung Schubert's "Serenade" in German, Mr. Henry W. Huttman expressed the sentiments of the meeting on behalf of the Vereinigte Maennerchoere in the following speech:</p>
   <p>"I have been asked by the Vereinigte Maennerchoere, consisting of thirty-three male choruses the members of which either were born in Germany or are of German descent, to express their grateful appreciation to the distinguished gentlemen <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>who have come here to address them.</p>
   <p>"We are well aware that these hard working men, enjoying the absolute confidence of the Government and standing at the head of administrative departments, have made a personal sacrifice by giving their valuable time to be with us here tonight and to advise us on the plans of the Government regarding the conduct of this war and also to inform us how we should co-operate.</p>
   <p>"We are all Americans and love our country just as much as all other loyal Americans regardless of heritage or origin. There is not one among us who does not hate Benedict Arnold. We know well that there are today only two kinds of Americans: those who are loyal and those who are not.</p>
   <p>"But even loyal Americans can be divided into two classes: those who in these times of distress endeavor to do their duties with all their hearts without being asked, and those, who, although they are loyal in their hearts, are content to give little and not to their full capacity.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>"The Vereinigte Maennerchoere belong to the first group. They desire to do anything humanly possible.</p>
   <p>"With just pride we call attention to the fact that their members, who are mostly in moderate circumstances, have bought four hundred and fifty thousand dollars' worth of Third War Loan bonds. Proportionately they will do as much now to meet the needs of the day and to honor General Pershing and our boys over there.</p>
   <p>"The United States owes its greatness to the wonderful medley of peoples who have become its citizens. The people emigrated because of oppression and unsatsifactory living conditions, which go hand in hand with autocracy. Here they have found the democratic form of government they desired. For this reason they are in many cases more loyal than the natives. In this respect those who came from Germany are no different from those who came from other countries.</p>
   <p>"The present war is waged against an autocracy from which they fled. Even if they speak the enemy's language, they are not less loyal on that account. This <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>war is not conducted against a language, but against a government, just as in 1776 the founders of the Republic--blessed be their memory!--did not conduct war against the English language but against the arrogance of the English autocracy of that period. They were victorious, just as we will be against the German autocracy of today.</p>
   <p>"The native tongue of the men assembled here is the German language. 'Mother tongue' means the first sound which the child hears, the language in which his mother teaches him his first prayer. This the reason why a man loves his mother tongue, and that is why we enjoy singing in the same language as our mothers did. And this cannot make anybody less loyal or less patriotic.</p>
   <p>"The unfriendly things which are sometimes heard or printed about those in our country who are of German origin are the opinions of people who do not know the character of those criticized.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>"An honorable and loyal person can be hurt less by a stab with a knife than by the unjust impugning of his patriotism.</p>
   <p>"Therefore we derive consolation from the assurance of confidence which the distinguished speakers tonight have given us by their words and presence. They justify the hope that the American public will gain a better understanding of their neighbors and fellow citizens who by chance had their origin in a country with which we are engaged in a war. I can promise that the vote of confidence which the Government has given us will encourage all of us to greater efforts of co-operation in accomplishing the task before us."</p>
   <p>The chorus then sang "Des Burschen Abschied" (The Fellow's Departure) and the impression of this rendering was enhanced by the fact that it was sung without a score. Afterwards Mr. Leopold Neumann delivered a short and inspiring address in German. He said that he had always held the opinion that the Germans need not make any demonstrations of their loyalty, because they were always aware of their oath of allegiance to America. They proved this in the past by <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>standing by this country in every danger, and now they were proving it again by giving their sons and their fortunes. The Germans of Chicago have subscribed over seven million dollars to the Third Liberty Loan, which is far more than any other nationality. But a meeting is in order to clear up many misunderstandings. And while the presence of men like Ryerson and Matthews shows that they fully understand the viewpoint of citizens of German origin, the Germans should always declare again that their loyalty is not below that of others, but they should also stand up for their rights and decline to become second-class citizens, just because it happened to be the German Government against which, as representative of the autocratic idea and of militarism, the American people stand in arms to fight for the democracy of the whole world.</p>
   <p>The last address was made by Professor Shailer Matthews, who spoke frankly, and whose witty observations were met with lively applause. He professed to be a full-blooded Yankee, and four of his ancestors are said to have come over on the "Mayflower" while his wife was the descendant of the first child born <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>to the Pilgrim Fathers at Plymouth. But his son, of the Thirty-third Prairie Division, is fighting proudly side by side, and under the immediate command of, comrades of purely German origin. In Japan the speaker has not only removed many misunderstandings between Japanese and Americans, but he has also learned to be proud of the ideals which America represents, and of which he became fully conscious as he explained them to the Japanese. Though America is not yet completely matured, he would not like to have it called a melting pot, but rather a garden in which different kinds of plants are being crossed for the purpose of improvement and perfection. The product will be still better than even the Mayflower people could be. Professor Matthews compares the purchase of Savings Stamps with a gold piece which one takes from a pocket with a hole and puts it in one without a hole. Two billion dollars, two thirds the cost of the Civil War, are supposed to be raised with these stamps. This is by no means a small and insignificant job. By taxing the very wealthy heavily, the Government distributes this money in the form of high wages among the people, who lend back to the Government by buying War Savings Stamps from which the purchasers derive only benefit. He expects <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>lively co-operation for the good and great cause from an audience which seems distinguished and prosperous.</p>
   <p>After this speech the following resolutions, proposed by President Wm. Arens of the United Singers, were unamiously adopted by a rising vote.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we assure the Federal Government in this critical hour of our full co-operation, in order that the war may be concluded victoriously as quickly as possible and the ideals of true democracy can spread all over the world.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, as all other loyal Americans, express our pride in the victories won by General Pershing and his army.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we pledge ourselves anew to the purchase of War Savings Stamps and ask all citizens to help the Federal Government by refraining from all other unnecessary expenditures.</p>
   <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>
   <p>"Be it further resolved, That we express the hope that this, our assurance of loyalty, as well as the fact that we gladly put our sons and our money at the disposal of the Federal Government, may contribute to a better appreciation of the attitude of American citizens of German origin and put an end to the slander."</p>
   <p>"America", which the whole audience stood up to sing, concluded the meeting, which served more than its immediate purpose, being skilfully prepared and tactfully conducted by the committee, consisting of Messrs. John Stelk, John Koelling, Leopold Neumann, Wm. Arens, August Lueders, Albert Wehrwein, Max Hirsh, Ferdinand Rixmann, Joseph Sieben and Chas. Kautz. Judging by the conversations of the visitors, who stood about in groups, it was clear that many felt greatly relieved that the German language and German songs were on their way back.</p>
