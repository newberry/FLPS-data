   <p>The government is busy building great power plants in various parts of the land. The public utilities, being in private hands, are by no means elated about it, but, until now, their struggle against these undertakings has been futile. The utilities are in a precarious position. For years they have been publishing articles in which they explain their management and their business methods to the public, trying to win them over to their viewpoint. This is why they are accused of spending, for propaganda purposes, part of the money taken from their customers by charging exorbitant prices.</p>
   <p>We cannot blame these firms for spreading propaganda, for they are exposed to continuous and acid assaults by politicians, and one cannot in truth condemn them if they put up a defense. At present, the electric power <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>plants have to put up with the most violent assaults from their opponents. It is perhaps remarkable that the public assumes an unfriendly attitude toward the corporations to which it pays a relatively small price for services received. Here in Chicago, a family occupying four to five rooms pays an average of about three dollars a month for electricity, for light and other household purposes. This amounts to only ten cents a day.</p>
   <p>In spite of this, assaults upon the utilities by politicians meet with strong approval on the part of the public. The reason for that is not hard to find. The public has found out that rates for electricity are still too high, and that the heads of utilities have used large sums of money to corrupt politics. What, in this respect, has come to the light of day, was scandalous in the extreme. It has been established that, at state and local elections, the utilities have bought the heads of both parties before main elections, and the most promising candidates <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>before the primaries, so that, under any circumstances, an administration should be in office which would take orders from them.</p>
   <p>In such cases, it is quite useless for voters even to go to the polls. They are betrayed and sold out before they get there. That such revelations have brought up immeasurable bitterness is easy to understand. Added to this is the fact that the heads of utilities, frequently represented in the press as demigods, have turned out to be mere bunglers when the depression set in. The people who entrusted them with their money suffered terrible losses and, as is generally known, the utilities used financial methods which could by no means be called irreproachable.</p>
   <p>As a matter of fact, many millions of Americans use the streetcars, elevated and subways. These means of transportation are, in most cases, inferior and costly, although there are few cities with such miserable transportation facilities as Chicago. The millions who depend upon these means of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>transportation are well aware of the fact that they could ride in modern and comfortable cars for considerably less money, if countless millions of dollars were not stolen by the utilities which are in cahoots with the politicians. Now, many utilities are bankrupt, and their present officers or receivers cannot be blamed for existing conditions. This does not alter the fact, however, that the public has been exploited for decades, and is bound to suffer under this exploitation for a long time to come.</p>
   <p>The persons responsible for these swindles have long ago disposed of their bonds and stocks, and it is not fair to blame the present bondholders and managements of these corporations for the wrongs committed by the former heads. The utilities now attempt to defend themselves against the attacks of the federal government. They have entrusted the well-known attorneys, James M. Seck and Newton D. Baker, with the representation of their interests. These attorneys intend to eliminate competition by the government by proving that many practices employed by the TVA and by the PWA, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the two great organizations for the building of power plants, are unconstitutional. Whether their attempts will be successful remains to be seen. At any rate, the unpopularity of the utilities is not going to decrease because of that. This is important, for here is one of the few cases in which public opinion has succeeded in assuming an active political aspect.</p>
