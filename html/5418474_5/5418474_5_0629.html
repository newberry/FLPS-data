   <p>In order to make the American people amenable to the huge armament program, dreadful pictures of an invasion are being dangled before them by the so called well informed sources. It is akin to the pattern of seven years ago, when that tearful play "An Englishman's Home," just about burnt up the English stage, and permeated the English people with cold chills from contemplating the terrors of a German invasion.</p>
   <p>In the February number of the Metropolitan News, a certain Mr. Reuterdahl (sounds almost German) takes care of the commendable task of providing the horror aspect for the American taxpayers, all in the interests of "preparedness;" and resorts to the ringing title, "If Germany Should Win." (Another one from the "If" association, Ed.) This forms a nice counterpart to yesterday's editorial in this column, "Hopes of Victory Among The Allies."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Henry Reuterdahl, the tonsorial image of Kassandra, bamboozles the Americans in this way:</p>
   <p>"If the Allies lose, then Bermuda, Jamaica or Newfoundland will be German. (He is strangely silent about Canada; but in this case Uncle Sam will grab it, so that it may not become German. Ed.) Then we must fight for the Monroe doctrine. (Who must start it?) The Bermuda Islands are only two days distant by steamer: New York and Washington are within the flight radius of Zeppelins. To start a war with us is child's play, like robbing a blind man.</p>
   <p>"Fifty per cent of the German merchant marine, ships of more than 5,000 tons and a cruising speed of 12 knots, can transport an army of 400,000 men. Within 15 days, 387,000 German soldiers (that's already 13,000 less, you can trade with that fellow!) will be on American soil, all veterans, splendidly supplied. Fast cruisers and destroyers would protect the troop-ships against the few lame ducks, which are dubbed American submarines. The German organization is so perfect that the transport vessels could deliver another batch of 440,000 for <span class="page-break">3</span>re-enforcements, during the second month. Or, they might use the Panama Canal, which they will surely have confiscated by that time, and then with a congenial understanding with Japan, swallow California.</p>
   <p>"If one controls the sea, then that is not an impossibility. Did not 126,000 British soldiers, fully equipped, including artillery, disembark at Gallipoli, an enemy position held by a large force? And this landing was accomplished by protecting the ninety-eight troop-ships with heavy artillery. A few days before, nobody in Alexandria knew when the expedition would depart or arrive.</p>
   <p>"A half million men would be the smallest number with which to ward off the enemy. But where shall we find them? No one would volunteer. If we resort to conscription, we would incite riots. Actually, we would not be able to organize such an army on the spur of the moment not to mention providing its supplies. It would be slightly better than a mob."</p>
   <p>This American Reuterdahl, seems to have a very bad opinion of his countrymen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>They would not enlist -- that's a pretty strong brand of tobacco! The good man bases his conclusions on the conduct of the golden English youth, and thinks the American are similar. We are convinced that his inference is wrong, just as fallacious as his idea about the invasion.</p>
   <p>Evidently when Reuterdahl wrote his alarming article, he was unaware of Lloyd George, and that British Munition Minister's victory fanfare: "How can the Allies lose? England has the greatest sea power and will 'eventually' have the greatest army of the world?" - And, in accordance with the unanimous decision of all the military experts, the "sea power" must win "in the end." - Why all the worry! But there is another disturbing question on the horizon.</p>
   <p>Why does not this apprehensive patriot look upon England as an "Invader?" England has more transport ships than Germany, besides she possesses the Bermuda Islands, Jamaica and Newfoundland, even Canada. Besides, it has <span class="page-break">5</span>had practical experience and brilliant results, in transporting large numbers of troops. Reuterdahl says so, himself. Of course, the actual outcome at Gallipoli, might "cool" such ardor in the future. Germany will not be inclined to try the costly experiments of a frivolous England. After the peace declaration, which, it is hoped will not be far distant, Germany will be concerned with more important affairs than the good, old Monroe Doctrine. Its political and economic problems gravitate in other directions. As far as the German invasion is concerned, the American citizen may slumber contentedly and Uncle Sam need not have a single soldier. Also the "bad conscience" of the Washington Administration may rest tranquilly on the pillow of German magnanimity. The German government is preoccupied with more serious affairs than seeking vengeance because of Wilson. If Wilson needs punishment for his foreign policies, the American people will mete it out at the ballot box. Germany's invasion schemes, therefore, enable us to put our preparedness plans in the clothes locker.</p>
   <p>Such foolish, incendiary articles by patriots of the Reuterdahl type can <span class="page-break">6</span>only hurt a good cause. But the good thing about the whole preparedness propaganda, is the one thought which was finally conveyed to the masses - the wonderful example of Germany aroused them at last - that the people, unitedly without class distinction, must defend their domain. It is, intrinsically, an honor which all must shoulder. Away with the hired soldiery! Give us a National, a people's Army! General conscription.</p>
   <p>It is a wonderful education of a people, a discipline which is so urgently needed among us Americans!</p>
