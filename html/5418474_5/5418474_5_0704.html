   <p>Is it not strange that every American, regardless which side he had favored previously, will in most cases become a follower of the German cause as soon as he has had an opportunity to observe the situation directly and at close range? It is not exaggeration to say that all Americans who have been living in Germany during the war, are convinced of Germany's just cause, and express their greatest admiration for the dignified attitude of the German people. They have unlimited praise for the valor of the German troops, and concede Germany and Austria-Hungary to final victory. Innumerable Americans, who have come home since, have made the attempt to agitate for the German cause because they were shocked at the shameless behavior of a hired Anglophile press, at the brazen insolence, with which British propaganda and lies were printed in its columns, at the gullibility of the American people who swallowed and enjoyed all this calumniation and slander hurled against Germany-- <span class="page-break">\2</span>press, which puts business and dollar profits above honor and ethics any time. Just like the voice of the prophets in the wilderness; nobody listened to them or believed them, because England, craftily and with great haste, had arrived ahead of them to poison the minds of the American public. All the foul mouthings that were yelled over here from Downing Street, London, from the Neva [St. Petersburg, Russia], from the Seine [Paris], and from Piraens [Greece], were accepted as gospel truths, against which even irrefutable facts could not prevail, but had to hide in corners.</p>
   <p>Gradually, however, as time goes on, a change in American opinion is inevitable and the present German-baiting will be followed by a moral hangover. This hangover will be all the more violent the tighter one closes one's ears against the warning voices of Americans who know wartime Europe from their own experience. A newspaper called the Continental Times is being published in Europe by Americans and for Americans who have taken permanent or temporary residence on the continent. This paper is circulated in all European countries and, since it maintains correspondents everywhere in Europe, is better able to judge European conditions than many native American papers and is well posted on the <span class="page-break">\3</span>attitude of its readers, who are almost exclusively Americans. The publication, which miracously has escaped British censorship thus far, has maintained a pro-German attitude since the beginning of the war, because it was firmly convinced that Germany, being surrounded by treacherous enemies, had justice on her side.</p>
   <p>In one of the latest issues of this paper, a correspondent of the Boston Journal, having recently returned from Europe, expresses his utter disgust at the hatred for Germany which he has found over here. It is his opinion that the [American] press alone is to blame for its existence. At the beginning of the war they had condemned Germany hastily and indiscriminately and now were afraid to lose a lot of business if they would print the truth as it has revealed itself since. It may be bitter medicine when the author of this article calls his Anglo-American fellow citizens dupes and ignoramuses, who prefer to let other people do the thinking for them, and any unbiased observer has to agree with him. Certainly all Americans living in Europe do. So much fuss had always been made about our freedom of the press, this correspondent continues, that until the war started he had always entertained the idea that when events of world-historic importance <span class="page-break">\4</span>were under discussion, our [American] press would stick to the truth unfalteringly, even if circulation should take a drop of a few hundred copies. He had been of the opinion that the American people would have enough decency to listen to the truth without wanting to lynch the messenger who conveyed it. He, personally, was not at all sure that Germany was one hundred per cent right. But neither was she always wrong. At any rate, the Germans had a right to demand that the truth and nothing but the truth be told about them. They do not ask for more.</p>
   <p>The remarkable article of the former correspondent of the Boston Journal concludes with these significant words: "If the Germans can stand the truth, why not the Americans?" If the author had cared to express himself in a positive way instead of in a negative one, he probably would have said: "He who knows the truth, but does not tell it, is a miserable knave indeed!" The name of this Boston correspondent is not Friedrich Schulze or August Lehmann, as our anglophile friends probably think, but Halleday Witherspoon. And neither was he born at the river Spree, or at the Elbe or at the Danube.</p>
