   <p>Very few of our fellow citizens have the least conception of the work that has been accomplished by the 1,522 camp groups of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and the 8000 Indians who have been organized separately in similar groups. And yet this work has assumed such proportions that it well deserves to be publicized in wider circles, at least in its principal parts.</p>
   <p>According to the statistics before us, no less than 12,671 miles of new road have been laid, 4299 bridges built, 5058 new telegraph lines erected, 1700 watchtowers and tool sheds constructed, and 25000 acres of land provided with trees. At the same time tree nurseries have been established and their yield during the coming few years will be sufficient to provide useful trees for 50,000 acres of land.</p>
   
   <p>Special care was taken to preserve forests, as is evident from the fact that about 800,000 acres were protected from harmful insects. In addition, 47,000 acres of land were freed from poisonous weeds, 3,566,000 acres were put under rodent control, and tree and plant diseases that do untold damage every year were fought successfully within an area of 1,765,000 acres.</p>
   <p>Forty thousand work days were required to fight forest fires, and 129,962 acres of woodland were protected against devastation by instituting and applying proven preventive measures.</p>
   <p>Nearly 68,000 work days were spent in the nurseries during these six months. At the same time a vast area of woodlands have been converted into forests by the removal of old trees and other obstacles, and this land will be very useful after some time, whereas it otherwise would have remained utterly without value.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances all credit is due to the initiative of President Roosevelt, who is sole creator of the Civilian Conservation Corps, and he deserves our gratitude, even though we were somewhat skeptical about his plans at first, and maintained that we saw nothing in them but a weak attempt to decrease the army of unemployed. We did not take into account the benefits which would accrue from the work of 300,000 young men under able and intelligent leadership.</p>
   <p>Due to reasons easily understood the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps will prove to be more beneficial to future generations than to the present one; however, even the present generation, in consideration of its own best interests, has every reason to give this peacetime work the credit which it deserves.</p>
