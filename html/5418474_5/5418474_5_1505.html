   <p>Huey Long claims to have discovered the slogan for the redistribution of property. Actually the idea is heavy with age, and it has always found followers, too. For it is a self-evident and an alluring idea for people who have nothing to get something of what others have. The complete abolition of private property is generally taken to be a rather delicate thing, and the majority of people in this country would scarcely accede to it. On the other hand, even less radical persons point out that almost the entire wealth of the country is concentrated in the hands of a few multimillionaires.</p>
   <p>It is contended, on the part of these people, that eighty per cent of the national wealth is to be found in the hands of two per cent of the population. The contention is absolutely untenable, but it is repeated time and again. The same people assert that persons who actually do nothing productive have appropriated control over enormous industrial and commercial enterprises of the country through unscrupulous <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>maneuvering of the markets, and now use this control to the detriment of all. Such cases have occurred, but one must not generalize about them. One has only to point to the greatest industrialist of the country, Henry Ford. It is generally known that Henry Ford built his gigantic enterprise without manipulating the market.</p>
   <p>Very informative in this connection is a report recently published by the Brookings Institute, which is recognized as reliable. The report, based upon very careful investigations, establishes the fact that twenty per cent of the farming population pocket nearly fifty per cent of farm incomes. In the other professions, in commerce, and in industry, almost the same proportion prevails, because in these fields also, twenty per cent receive fifty-eight per cent of the total income accruing from industrial and commercial occupations.</p>
   <p>On the other side of the economic fence, there is the same phenomenon. The poorest twenty per cent of the farmers must needs be content with four per cent of farm incomes, and the poorest twenty per cent of the persons engaged in industry <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and commerce likewise receive four per cent of the incomes from these occupations. Now, it is a fact that the farmers do not earn their incomes by the manipulation of bonds and stocks. They do not have the slightest opportunity for it. Yet, the income from farming enterprises is very concentrated, and is just as unequally distributed as the income from other occupations. Thus the contention that the heads of the great corporations have earned their influence and their incomes by unproductive activities stands upon a very weak foundation.</p>
   <p>As a last resort one will have to get back to the commonly acknowledged truth that men are not equal, but are basically different from each other. Some are diligent, others lazy; some thrifty, others frivolous: some gifted, others not. These fundamental differences must naturally find expression in occupational life by bringing success to some and failure to others. Of course, numerous exceptions to this rule may be found, but it remains the rule all the same. This is also the reason why all plans aiming toward the redistribution of property are nonsensical and fantastic. For, if today property were distributed among the population, it would again become unequal in a few years.</p>
