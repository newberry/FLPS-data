   <p>[From the latest edition of the German Democracy Bulletin we quote the following:]</p>
   <p>We wished they would all be like that--like the Milwaukee Herald. We should like to say of the entire German language press that it could grasp the significance of the times as clearly as the Herald in Wisconsin. This newspaper, one of the most influential of its kind, welcomed the first opportunity, as soon as we entered the war, to proclaim in clear and forceful language its change of attitude and undivided devotion to everything American and what an active participation in the fight against Prussian-German autocracy could amount to.</p>
   <p>This same newspaper, again clearly recognizing the value of organizing the friends of German democracy, and well aware of the valuable aid that an alliance of Americans of German origin could give, to find a safe way to <span class="page-break">\2</span>express one hundred per cent Americanism and to serve in the great struggle, has commented emphatically in favor of the objectives and principles of our organization.</p>
   <p>It was godparent to the founding of a branch organization in Milwaukee, it managed to interest such well-known fighters for the cause of democracy as General Winkler, Mr. Vogel, and Miss Mary Jussen, the niece of Carl Schurz, whose services and accomplishments have earned him recognition and appreciation all over the west. If today we give excerpts from the editorial of the Herald of August 26, it is not done to give our organization a "lift", but in order to show the rest of the German language press a way to broader activities and increased usefulness. Whatever it can do to promote the interests of our organization, which has been acknowledged by the president, by the American press and patriotic societies as a completely American and trustworthy organization, it does in its own interest.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The Herald, after declaring that German-Prussian democracy must be blind to believe even today, after America's entry into war, in the possibility of a victory, writes: "They don't seem to care if the unfortunate German people are bleeding to death. But the German people shall not die. They shall help themselves. And we over here will give them aid.</p>
   <p>"For this purpose a society has been formed in this country, which calls itself the "American Friends of German Democracy". Its objective is to obtain peace and liberty for the German people before they collapse completely or bleed to death.</p>
   <p>"It can become a patriotic organization of far-reaching significance, if once a million members, mostly of German origin, belong to it. In this way it can furnish the best proof that citizens of German descent want to assist our country in this war with all their heart, until its unselfish <span class="page-break">\4</span>goal is attained. And then the association can help to shatter the simple-minded and un-American attacks made on citizens for no other reason but their descent. This is another good ground why citizens of German origin should join. Who would not stand by the German people over there as well as faithful and loyal citizens of German extraction over here?</p>
