   <p>We, too, are getting our medicine now. Very gently, without arousing suspicion, John Bull has grabbed Uncle Sam by his suspenders and is dragging him, into the treacherous maelstrom of the seas, right into the midst of British dreadnaughts, cruisers and destroyers and German submarines.</p>
   <p>How did this happen? When war broke out, there was not the slightest cause for alarm. "Let's be neutral!" we said. "Let's remain strictly neutral," the President cautioned, and by God, everybody tried to be so--except?</p>
   <p>Well, except those who just wouldn't keep their mouths shut. The Anglo-American press let go full blast for action against--Germany. That was neutrality as a great nation interpreted it. Certain political circles in Washington flirted ostentatiously with England. Prominent personalities <span class="page-break">2</span>like Big Stick Roosevelt and Professor Emeritus, by the grace of Carnegie, Eliot voiced their regrets that this Republic did not rally to England's side and fight for civilization and the Muscovites. Numerous members of the world of science could not and still cannot get over the fact that we stood idly by and did not lift a finger when "Belgian neutrality" was so shamefully ravished. In the forest of English newspapers, books, and literature a veritable hailstorm broke loose of insults, insinuations, falsifications, and lies about "German Kultur" and "Kaiserism".</p>
   <p>During all these months you would not have found one prominent man in our Republic who would have dared to champion Germany's cause openly. A small group of scientists, who knew Germany and the German people, had sufficient courage to state what they had learned from their own observation, and still others, like Professor John W. Burgess, Professor Ferdinand Schevill, Professor James G. McDonald, Professor Smith of Johns Hopkins, Professor Shepard of Columbia, and Professor George L. Scherger, as well as war correspondents like McCutcheon, Bennett, Swing and a few more, came out for truth <span class="page-break">3</span>and justice. In spite of the fact that Germany's rightful cause was clearly and irrefutably established, America's leading circles remained stubbornly hostile toward her.</p>
   <p>But it became increasingly evident that a change in public opinion was taking place. To a large extent this was due to the fact that lies are short-lived, as the saying goes, and even the credulous and gullible began to look with suspicion on the British cable and newspaper reports, and a more critical public began to draw unfavorable conclusions from these false messages, doubting the veracity of British and Allied reporting altogether. Neither must we leave out of consideration the courageous action of the large German-born and German-minded element of our population, as well as the informative and enlightening service supplied by the German-language press.</p>
   <p>Now we are told time after time, day after day, that any thinking American who has a claim to culture and an independent mind stands on Germany's side, <span class="page-break">4</span>notwithstanding the strong bonds existing between Anglo-America and England. There is no way to refute the sincerity of these statements. And we have one piece of circumstantial evidence which may convince the reader. With the exception of a few papers which have "purely English blood in their veins," the Anglo-American press, in general, has practiced some reserve lately, and the press always knows from which direction the wind is blowing. They are beginning to realize that one cannot insult entire nations without unpleasant repercussions. For the time being, we can be satisfied with so much success anyway.</p>
   <p>With official America it is another story. It seems to be caught in the British net--lock, stock, and barrel. Denmark, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and Spain are painfully aware of it, according to the press. England's policy is obvious: she puts complete trust in the affection among relatives, but she overreached herself, with the result that our Government was jockeyed into a position which is similar to that of Europe on July 30, 1914. We are at the eve of a conflict! That is entirely <span class="page-break">5</span>England's doing, and now Germany is held responsible for it. The text of the notes sent by our Secretary of State to Germany and to England is so worded that the German reply will be polite but equally firm and of the same quality as Mr. Bryan's note. It will read somewhat like this:</p>
   <p>"Since England has announced that she will starve out Germany, and since she is seizing all ships, neutral as well as German, we intend to send all British merchant vessels to the bottom. If British methods against us are asserted to be within the frame work of international law, then we make an equal claim for our measures against England. In order not to endanger neutral shipping in this struggle with England, we have issued a warning [to neutrals] to stay out of waters which we consider zones of operation. And in case a ship is hit which flies the colors of the United States without being entitled to do so, we must regard this as a matter for the United States to settle. It is up to them to protect their flag from fraudulent use."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The German reply could not read otherwise. England's reply to the [American] note is an entirely secondary matter. They're not in a hurry with it, and Bryan's note will have the same effect which previous protests had. At this time England will pay no heed to it because she has accomplished her purpose, which was to bring Germany and America into conflict. Now we shall have to keep a cool head and be on guard! Something is likely to happen now which would have been impossible without Englands' perfidy.</p>
   <p>And that would be the net result of all the efforts made by so many patriots [to keep the United States neutral], a result which the President surely tried to prevent, together with millions of German-born American citizens. But it seems that political corruption, British gold, and England's world-renowned Machiarellian tactics will triumph over honesty, morality, and humanity.....</p>
