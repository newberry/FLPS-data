   <p>In an address which he delivered prior to our entry into the World War, President Wilson made the noble statement that the same moral and ethical principle which governs the relations between individuals should be the decisive factor of intercourse between nations.</p>
   <p>When considered from this viewpoint, the sale of the German patents must be looked upon as a very deplorable act.</p>
   <p>This is not a war measure: it is not a measure to relieve a distress brought about by the War; and neither is it an attempt to supply the lack of dye stuffs which could not be transported from Germany, owing to the fact that <span class="page-break">\2</span>commercial contact with that country was severed, for the law has permitted the utilization of the German patents for the duration of the War. Moreover, Mr. Palmer expressly stated that the measure pertains to the period after the War; during the coming period of peace, German chemists in the United States are not to enjoy the fruits of their long and laborious endeavors. The confidence which they placed in the Federal Government when they revealed the secrets of their patents, the confidence which was not shaken even during the War, is finally to be outraged after peace negotiations have been completed.</p>
   <p>This breach of confidence itself is deplorable, but it merits especially severe condemnation since the Trading With The Enemy Act contains special provisions to induce enemy inventors to apply to Washington for patents, even during wartime, and to pay the prescribed fee. "Any enemy, or ally of an enemy of the United States may apply for a patent or a trade-mark, and may follow up the application and pay the fee in accordance with the <span class="page-break">\3</span>existing laws"--Section 10. Meanwhile the Commissioner of Patents has the authority to extend the time allotted by law to submit applications for patents and to pay fees--thus legally establishing claim to priority rights--to nine months after the conclusion of peace.</p>
   <p>Every logical person can interpret these provisions to mean only that our Government offers assurance to enemy inventors who continue to reveal their secrets to the Patent Office that they will receive patents, and their secrets will not be made public. We do not know if any inventors have availed themselves of these provisions, but it is probable that some applications have been made, and the respective fees paid.</p>
   <p>When the Custodian of enemy-owned property proceeds to sell the patents, he simply invalidates these legal provisions. And what term would one ordinarily apply to such an act? Would such procedure not be subject to legal prosecution, and would it not savor of moral turpitude? <span class="page-break">\4</span>And now let us take a look at the price which was paid for the patents. Only two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for forty-five hundred patents! These patents form the foundation of the great German dye industry which supplies all of the markets of the world. The value of the products manufactured under these patents is more than one million dollars annually.</p>
   <p>For the use of the enemy-owned patents, according to the Trading With The Enemy Act, five per cent of the gross value of the products must be paid to the Alien Property Custodian, and will be remitted to the owner of the patents after the War. Assuming that goods valued at only three million dollars were manufactured under these patents every year, then five per cent of this sum would be exactly two hundred and fifty thousand dollars (sic)--the amount received for the "sale" of all the patents. Confidentially, each of the many "sold" patents is worth much more than a million dollars.</p>
   <p>Thus it is evident that the "sales" price was not established on the basis of expert evaluation, which is the accepted guideline in any common commercial <span class="page-break">\5</span>institution. According to the official report, evaluation was partly arbitrary. While the sale of all other enemy-owned property, such as factories, ship docks, stock companies, etc., was advertised, or took place at public auctions, Mr. Palmer departed from the regular routine and arbitrarily set a price which did not even equal the fee and legal expenditures which the inventors had paid to acquire their patents.</p>
   <p>"Francis P. Garvan, a member of the New York Bar Association, who devised this plan, and to whom I am indebted for his clear vision and indefatigable energy, will be the first president of the Chemical Foundation (Incorporated)," says Mr. Palmer in his report. Mr. Garvan received further recognition for his services when he was chosen to be Mr. Palmer's successor as Alien Property Custodian. The American people will not thank him for working out a plan which is contrary to all sense of ethics, and which was made, not in the interest of the whole country, but for the benefit of a relatively small number of capitalists. That is proved by our practical objections.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>If the sale of the patents is upheld, the immediate result will be that the dyes involved, that is, the best and most valuable dyes which can be purchased in the market, may no more be imported from Germany and other countries to the United States. The Chemical Foundation (Incorporated) will have exclusive manufacturing rights and will transfer them to various American dye manufacturers. As a consequence of the embargo on all foreign dyes. American merchants will be able to charge as much as they wish for their dyes.</p>
   <p>Just how high these prices will be may be deduced from information which was given by a factory representative who attended the annual convention of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, which was held here last January. According to this man's statement, the current cost of manufacturing a certain color of aniline dye is eighty-five cents per pound, and, when material and labor costs decrease, his firm hopes to be able to reduce the cost to sixty-five cents per pound. Prior to the War this type of dye was imported from Germany, and sold for fifteen cents per pound.</p>
   <p>Dye works and cloth factories will raise their prices accordingly, and our <span class="page-break">\7</span>dreams of purchasing clothing for less money after the War will be shattered.</p>
   <p>Then too, knowledge of the descriptions contained in the patents is no guarantee of the quality of the products which are made in accordance with them. An article published in the Abendpost some time ago called attention to the fact that, despite all advertisements, the aniline dyes which have been manufactured in the United States heretofore have lacked much in quality. So we may be certain that the new dyes, the production of which has just gotten under way, will be inferior to those which were previously produced in this country. Thus the American consumer will receive inferior dyes at greatly increased prices.</p>
   <p>It is evident that we must not suppose that the German inventors or patent owners will willingly assent to the "sale" and make no attempt to have it voided by the Federal Court. Very likely their procedure will be to ignore the existence of the Chemical Foundation (Incorporated), and to sue every individual manufacturer for infringement. A great number of lawsuits will <span class="page-break">\8</span>result, and the courts will have to make a decision as to the legality of the "sale". And the outcome of these suits is very doubtful, as one may see from what we have said about the legal objections to the "sale".</p>
   <p>But let us assume that our courts will declare the "sale" legal. In that case we may be certain that the Government of Germany will not leave its citizens in the lurch, but will find ways and means of protecting their interests. The German Government might immediately force the protection of the German inventors' rights by declaring null and void all patents granted in Germany to American inventors. If this were done, all these inventors, whose products were sold in great quantities in Germany before the War, could thank Mr. Palmer for the loss of this market.</p>
   <p>This "patent war" would result in the complete disruption of the whole international patent system and of all international agreements for the protection of industrial and intellectual assets.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>It seems queer that the counsel for the Chemical Foundation, Mr. Choate, should be traveling around the country just now, seeking to obtain stockholders for the Corporation and to create a favorable attitude to the law by which, in accordance with the example set by France and England the importation of dyes to the United States--with the exception of those dyes which cannot be produced by local manufacturers--is to be prohibited. Our industrialists are not satisfied to have gained the protection included in the "sale" of the patents; they also fear the importation of those German dyes which are no longer protected by patents. It is very likely that the least valuable dyes manufactured in Germany will be of better quality than dyes produced in this country. These laws would result in an increase in price and a decrease in quality, and the only one to suffer would be the consumer.</p>
   <p>In view of these facts we conclude that the "sale" of the former German-owned patents cannot be deferred from a legal standpoint, but that, <span class="page-break">\10</span>ethically, it is a deplorable act, and that it is not practical, since it will increase the cost of living of the American people.</p>
