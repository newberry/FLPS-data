   <p>p. 4.. The Republicans of Cook County held their first campaign meeting last Saturday under the auspices of the Maine Township Company. A large gathering composed mostly of Germans attended the picnic. The principal speaker on that occasion was Richard Yates, the Republican candidate for governor.</p>
   <p>He said: "The general opinion is that the German-Americans are deserting the Republican Party. The reason is supposed to be the continuance of the war in the Philippine Islands. But I am convinced to the contrary.... I know for certain that the German-Americans are very good American patriots.</p>
   <p>"They believe in national authority, and if necessary in the use of power.... When you German-Americans will realize the danger to which the American nation is exposed you will give your whole-hearted support to our country."</p>
