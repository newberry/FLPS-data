   <p>The special action taken by the Chicago Medical Society against the well-known specialist, Dr. Louis E. Schmidt, who has also won high esteem by virtue of his philanthropic activities, has occasioned a general feeling of astonishment and surprise. For with this case, a problem of great significance is brought to the fore. By his expulsion from the local medical organization, which automatically entails his expulsion from the national organization of physicians, Doctor Schmidt has become the standard-bearer of a movement which had its inception some years ago but which now for the first time appears in all its significance and importance before the forum of public opinion.</p>
   <p>What is involved here is nothing less than the questions: Is the medical profession in our country a professional group whose foremost duty consists in serving science and the great mass of humanity in a spirit of self-abnegation? Or is the medical profession a group which seeks primarily to gain material <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>profit through exploiting the knowledge bequeathed to it by unselfish scholars and scientists?</p>
   <p>These fundamental questions present themselves to the layman who has followed the previous developments and happenings bearing on the problem and who has watched the course of events which led to the expulsion of Doctor Schmidt. The latter has willy nilly become the leader of those physicians who uphold the old traditions of their profession, whereas the Chicago local of the American Medical Society now appears as the champion of a modern conception. These moderns have inscribed on their banner the traditional ethics of the physician; but they have given them an interpretation which not only is fundamentally different from the traditional interpretation but which actually contradicts it in many essential points. How else is one to explain the action of the Chicago medical group in expelling a colleague of irreproachable integrity and great distinction--a man whose only "crime" consists in his constant endeavor to provide the large sections of the population in the low-income and middle classes with adequate medical assistance for their ailments <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and maladies at a fee which is adapted to their income and their circumstances?</p>
   <p>What are these so-called ethics which the Chicago local is so zealously bent on preserving and against the spirit of which Doctor Schmidt is said to have offended? It is not necessary for the layman to study their wording. Their formal expression is of no particular consequence to him. What is of significance for him and for the hundreds of thousands of sick people of limited means is their effect and their influence on the medical profession as a whole. The manner in which the medical profession conducts its relations with the great mass of the sick, the manner in which it fulfills its foremost obligation to fight against illness without regard to the status of the patient--these are the decisive factors in the eyes of the masses and therefore of the nation. These ethics or rather the manner in which they are interpreted should serve the practicing physician as a protective rampart against unhealthy influences coming from the outside. They are intended to maintain the profession on a high level, to serve its practitioners as a shield against a world intent on self-aggrandizement. How strangely then must it strike the layman when he perceives that these <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>ethical principles are being perverted in order to promote within the medical profession the self-same harmful tendencies which these principles are intended to prevent from penetrating into, and spreading throughout, the profession!</p>
   <p>Although almost all of Chicago's physicians are members of the above-mentioned organization, there is still reason to hope that a large percentage of them do not approve the expulsion of Doctor Schmidt and therefore do not sanction the condemnation of his activities and efforts in behalf of the public welfare. At the meeting in question only a very small fraction of the physicians of this city was present. The decision in favor of expulsion cannot therefore be regarded as an expression of the will of the Chicago medical profession. It is the judgment of a group which, it is to be hoped, is in the minority.</p>
