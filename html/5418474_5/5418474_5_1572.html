   <p>In Washington a conference for economic security is in session. What is to be understood by "economic security" cannot easily be defined, because opinions differ greatly. In the most comprehensive meaning of the phrase, "economic security" means a state of affairs in which citizens are protected under all circumstances from having to resort to public charity. This aim is to be achieved by far-reaching social legislation, that is, laws providing for unemployment and old-age insurance, and insurance against sickness and accidents.</p>
   <p>There does not seem to be much likelihood, however, that such a comprehensive program of social insurance will be undertaken in the near future. President Roosevelt fears that such plans might disturb the program for economic <span class="page-break">2</span>reconstruction, and he is trying to avoid anything that might have such an effect. The President received a committee from the conference in the White House. He took this opportunity to make an address which naturally was meant for the whole nation.</p>
   <p>In this speech he stated that he would submit only one bill on unemployment insurance to the next Congress. He revealed only a few details in regard to the bill. He laid particular emphasis on the fact that the bill provided for insurance, not relief. The necessary funds were, therefore, to be secured from premium payments,and not from taxes.</p>
   <p>The administration of these funds is to be, according to Roosevelt's plan, in the hands of the National Government, while the disbursement of the funds is to be left to the states.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Therefore the states must decide whether they are willing to introduce this kind of insurance or not. The President expressed the hope that those states whose legislatures meet in January of this year will enact a law of this sort. This expectation is certainly not going to be fulfilled in all instances, but there is good reason to believe that, under the pressure of public opinion, the states will one by one agree to this unemployment insurance. Naturally, care should be taken, right from the start, to see to it that these laws are not turned into fantastic plans for making the people happy. A strong and irrefutable argument for unemployment insurance lies in the fact that, in the long run, it will do away with unemployment relief. Therefore, while industry, trade, and commerce will be burdened in one way, in another it will be relieved. President Roosevelt declared emphatically that he is in favor of a comprehensive plan for social insurance. But he wants to move slowly, and step by step. He has again taken the wind out of the sails of his opponents, who wish to represent him as a radical, a socialist, or a communist.</p>
