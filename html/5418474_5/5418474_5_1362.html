   <p>The nameless atrocities which Spanish beasts are committing in Cuba with the express approval of their king, Gottlieb (Amadeus), begins to reconcile the American public opinion with the idea of intervention against the Spanish murder gang.</p>
   <p>This is not an annexation of Cuba that is being aimed at, perhaps not even an armed intervention. For the time being the United States should only raise a threatening protest in the name of outraged humanity. Such a protest really should emanate from all civilized powers, like the protest, fifty years ago, against Turkish atrocities in Greece....If this is not sufficient to impress the Spanish murderers, then a common armed intervention might be advisable...</p>
   <p>An intervention of this kind would be in full harmony with the traditions of the United States. For the much quoted and so frequently misunderstood Monroe Doctrine was originally nothing else but a protest against the re-subjugation of Mexico by Spain. And the correct application of the Monroe Doctrine to Cuba, means not: Cuba for the United States, but, Cuba for the Cubans!</p>
