   <p>Wednesday evening at eight o'clock, a number of German citizens met in the German House for the purpose of organizing a German home guard. Through an oversight, the minutes of that meeting were not published in yesterday's issue; we herewith present a condensed report:</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Fidel Schlund, whereupon Mr. Joseph Huhn was elected chairman, and Mr. Carl Haussner, secretary. Mr. F. Schlund emphasized the necessity of a home guard, and the assembly immediately and unanimously voted to organize such a body. Mr. Haussner recommended that an organizing committee of five men be appointed and that this committee make inquiries concerning the facilities that would be offered to a German home guard. It was resolved to meet again on the coming Wednesday to hear the report of the committee. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
