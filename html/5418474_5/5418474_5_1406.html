   <p>As our readers know from yesterday's telegraphic dispatches, the Twelfth Illinois Cavalry Regiment (Colonel Davis) is to be increased to its normal strength through recruiting. Captain Dyhrenfurth has been authorized to enlist a company for the third battalion of his regiment and has opened a recruiting office in his father's school of commerce at the corner of Wells and Lake Streets.</p>
   <p>The regiment referred to is the one that fought so bravely at Harper's Ferry, and every man can consider it an honor to belong to it. The bounty is $402 for veterans and $302 for others. Captain Dyhrenfurth has proved that he is an able officer, and we urge all who want to fight for the cause of the Union to entrust themselves to his leadership.</p>
