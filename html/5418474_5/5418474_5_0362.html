   <p>What makes the enmity of America so terrible is the fact that it fights for ideals and not for profit. One can negotiate about profits, but not about conscience. When America declared its entry into the war--not for material gain, but for the defense of those human rights which are the national faith--over there they said mockingly: "Phrases!" Where the system "His Majesty, God &amp; Company" has deprived the people of its self-determination together with its conscience, and in exchange has offered it economic prosperity--a pottage of lentils for a birth right--it is hard to imagine that there is a people whose conscience is a power. If they were not afflicted with the blindness of those whom the gods would destroy, they would have found a parallel to the present war in the last great inner conflict of the nation, the Civil War. A fateful day for the German people, when it sees the gap which separates a government responsible to a free people for its principles and policies, from the government of the "all-highest", the existence of which depends upon success. That is the essence of American <span class="page-break">\2</span>democracy, that its policies always find motive, direction, and changes in the conscience of the people, and that the latter finds its guidance in the great ideal of July 4, 1776. This the history of the Civil War could have taught them, if they still could be taught.</p>
   <p>In 1917 national conscience spoke from the president's chair. During the thirty-five years before the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, a voice was heard from a miserable print shop in Boston, and the name of the speaker was William Lloyd Garrison, abolitionist, compositor, author, and editor of the Liberator; agitator, prophet, criminal, and saint.</p>
   <p>Without faith in the equality and liberty of all mankind, justification might be found for slavery. Older than the nation, it had law, church, constitution, public opinion, and business on its side--but not the spirit of 1776, which had given birth to this nation. The constitution failed to declare that black skin is human skin, out of fear of the slaveholding South. The divergence between the beautiful phrases of equality for all <span class="page-break">\3</span>men and the disgusting practice of slavery made the life of the nation one great lie. Nobody knew just how to restore righteousness. Proposals for reform were as cheap as blackberries, but the South answered attacks on its privilege with threats of secession. It did not mind reform as long as nothing was changed. The last, bitter controversy between the Northern sense of justice and the Southern slave interests ended in 1820 with the strengthening of the latter by the admission of Missouri into the Union as a slave state. "This terrible problem," wrote Jefferson, "keeps me awake at night like the ringing of a fire bell, and fills me with horror. To me it seems the knell of the Union." Politics, business, and society were one in their desire under no circumstance to be reminded of this skeleton in the closet and to leave the solution to time.</p>
   <p>Gradual liberation seemed to be the most that the abolition movement could hope for; to be patient, and declare that slavery is an evil, the best that one could do. America then still believed in the possibility of a compromise between injustice and conscience, until, on January 1, 1831, in Garrison's <span class="page-break">\4</span>first edition of the Liberator, conscience raised its loud voice and literally cried out to the nation: "You shall not sleep any more. I mean it--I will not compromise--I am not going to retreat one inch--I will be heard--I demand immediate emancipation of the slaves!"</p>
   <p>In his truly terrific sheet, which he himself edited and composed, sometimes standing fourteen hours in the composing room, undernourished, sleeping on his worktable, with a book as a pillow; fearless, a man whose one idea consumed his life, Garrison, then twenty-five years old, put the nation on trial, which had come within an inch of the end of its existence and the downfall of the Union. For thirty-five years there flowed from the workshop of the gentle modern volcano a red-hot stream of flaming and inciting language, so uninterrupted that, within a few years, the North and South were aflame. He possessed the gift of the genuine prophet to exasperate everybody and turn everybody against him; the well-meaning people in the North who shunned his "fanaticism," which attacked even the Constitution <span class="page-break">\5</span>and the Union; the church, which gave its blessing to the existing order with cool reason and comfortable piety; the business world, whose position a prominent New York merchant succinctly described thus: "We are not so stupid as not to look upon slavery as a great evil, but the founders of the Republic condoned it; the Constitution approved of it; under the protection of the Constitution the South invested its money in it, and we are doing a million-dollar business with it; are we to let the abolitionists destroy all this? Never!"--And the South? The excitement there rose to raving madness. New Orleans offered twenty thousand dollars, Georgia five thousand dollars, for Garrison's capture, dead or alive. With every legal and criminal means attempts were made to smother the movement. The conspiracy reached from the president down to the last rowdy on the street corner. Terrorism paralyzed the North. Mob violence committed murder and arson. Abolitionism seemed to be stamped out for the time being.</p>
   <p>But the irony of the whole thing was that otherwise the nation would never have realized the true nature of slavery, its brutal, unscrupulous <span class="page-break">\6</span>oppression, which constituted a peril for the nation--that while its advocates seemed to win, the cause of slavery lost more and more--the same irony, which prevails in the case of Germany's power politics today. The lone fighter, Garrison, now found scores of fellow fighters, Browditch, May, Wendell Phillips, Chas. Sumner, the German Dr. Follen and others. Antislavery societies sprang into existence by the hundreds. Until 1840 Garrison had done the work alone. Five years earlier, his had been the voice of the prophet in the wilderness, but after 1840 abolition was uppermost in the minds of the people. His contemporaries found it hard to look at the matter as he did, namely, that immediate emancipation was the only solution and not mere fanaticism! Where would it lead to? In the words of Wendell Phillips: "The only way to liberty for the slaves, if it isn't to be a bloody one, leads through the ruins of the church and over the grave of the Union." Did the prophet of immediate abolition see any other way? No, in later years it was realized that the monster of slavery, in order to continue, had to bring the North and its politics under the slave-whip, <span class="page-break">\7</span>and would stop at nothing to do so. The evil, if it was to remain, had to grow and smother the spirit of the Republic. Garrison's work had shown the alternative. It was with a feeling of discomfort that the House heard Lincoln summarize the situation, using Garrison's words of 1855: "A church and a government which accords the same privilege to slavery as to liberty is a house divided against itself, which cannot stand." Conscience was aroused; the people were ready for a decision. While its political leadership still thought of compromise, a shot was fired on April 12, 1861, in the harbor of Charleston,--the evil had taken destruction in its own hand--it forced the North to take to arms to bring justice to the disfranchised-- as Germany's power politics does today to America's democracy.</p>
   <p>Perhaps it was the greatest thing which this fearless knight ever accomplished, that he quietly returned to the life of an insignificant citizen when a career of public honors was open to him. False ambition he did not know. He did not care to be anything but the conscience of his nation.</p>
