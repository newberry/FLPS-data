   <p>As many weeks have passed since the publication of the lists of income tax returns, judgment may now be passed as to the usefulness this policy had for Uncle Sam. Frankly, it is quite nil. Its advocates have, some time ago, made the statement that the Treasury's income will be increased because the taxpayers will be on guard against defrauding, knowing that their neighbors, friends, business competitors, and other pleasing contemporaries may get wise to their tricks and denounce them to the taxing office. Congress then, by making the tax lists accessible to the public, appealed to the ugliest of man's instincts, to envy and joy at the other fellow's misfortune, in an effort to enforce some honesty among the taxpayers.</p>
   <p>Had they in the Capitol been somewhat clearer in the head, they would have known that to achieve a certain aim not all means are applicable or advisable. False and blameworthy as it is to lure cheats into a trap by making police officers incite them to commit another felony, it is as erroneous to wake the <span class="page-break">\2</span>good instincts of the taxpayers by discharging bad instincts upon them. The natural and inevitable result of the mistake committed was that the rich invested larger portions of their wealth in tax-free securities, thus withdrawing it from the snooping of the curious. At the same time the less wealthy suffered loss of credit as a natural result from the tax payments made public, because their figures may be short of the sums for which their business friends gave them credit.</p>
   <p>It is said that the tax officers have been almost flooded with protests against publishing the tax lists which came from none else but from the so-called little man. This effect upon the procedure will be something of a surprise to Congress, as the ordinance to make the tax list accessible to the public was aimed at reviving the need for curiosity at the hands of the large masses. It assumed that the people would be highly interested to know what the president of the U. S. Steel Corporation, or the cashier of the Oconomowoc cheese factory, or Galli Curci, or Marshall Field IX., or Secretary Kellogg has paid <span class="page-break">\3</span>in taxes, to gain an image of the existing or non-existing wealth in the hands of these persons. But it is to be regretted that the data contained in the tax lists, so far as the public may see them, are not sufficient to make a plausible reconstruction of the actually owned wealth or even the actual income of the taxpayer in question. There may be one who pays very little in taxes and yet disposes of considerable wealth, while there is another who pays relatively high taxes and yet has a hand-to-mouth existence. Loyal neighbors and devoted friends have, in general, proven to be much better people than Congress insinuated. We do not know so far, of one case in which Uncle Sam could enlarge the contents of his money bag on account of denunciations.</p>
   <p>There will perhaps be nothing left for Congress than to take cognizance of the facts at its session which is to begin soon and to draw the consequences from them. Its appeal to the lower instincts availed nothing. It might therefore be wise to do without their cooperation and to trust in the honesty of the taxpayer. The treasury will then get as much out of it as when good habits prevailed. It is quite unpleasant to see the government stick its nose into <span class="page-break">\4</span>the private affairs of the citizens; but if it makes others snoop around, then it humiliates the citizens and takes part of their self-respect from them.</p>
