   <p>Reports from Washington state that President Roosevelt does not intend to veto any of the bills which Congress passed during the last stormy hours of the session. To-date he has signed three of these bills and has thus given them legal status. They are the Guffey Bill, which provides regulations for the mining industry, the Frazier-Lemke Bill, which establishes a three-year moratorium for farm mortgages, and the Railroad pension Bill. The latter two bills have been redrafted and adopted by Congress. They had been in force previously, but were declared to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
   <p>Congress endeavored to delete those parts which the high court found to be objectionable. Time will tell whether or not our representatives succeeded.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Guffey Law provides for wide Government control over the coal-mining industry. This industry, as everybody knows, is in a very poor condition, and has been for several years. There are far too many mines and too many miners, and too little work.</p>
   <p>It appears to be doubtful that the new law will remove those features of the industry that are responsible for the plight of the miners. It is self-evident that this law too will be attacked in court, and the entire industry will be in a state of uncertainty until a decision is rendered on the constitutionality of the act.</p>
   <p>The new tax on large incomes and inheritances has had unexpected effects. Several multi-millionaires have given a part of their wealth to members of their families in order to evade this exorbitant tax. Of course, they will also find other ways of escaping the tax, or of loading it onto the shoulders of other people. It is an old principle derived from experience, that taxes <span class="page-break">\3</span>fail in their purpose if they are so high that they verge on confiscation. Unfortunately, our Government did not observe this principle when the spokesmen for the Administration forced Congress to adopt this crude act.</p>
   <p>Several other laws will have a similar effect. They were whipped through Congress. There was not sufficient time for adequate consideration and debate. Congress certainly does not know what results these laws probably will have. In many instances it has no knowledge whatever of its acts. It would have been much better, had the gentlemen in the Capitol energetically opposed the wishes of the Administration and postponed action on most of the bills until the next session of Congress, for even at this early date it is evident that recent legislative efforts of that noble body will cause our country considerable trouble.</p>
   <p>Take, for instance, the social insurance law. Section 909 reads thus: [Translator's note: The author has tried to translate this section of the Social Security Act into German. He did not translate the whole section.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The net results is not very intelligible.]</p>
   <p>Such colossal nonsense! What the man who wrote this section thought, or what Congress thought when it passed the bill is a great mystery that is just as inexplainable as is Section 909.</p>
