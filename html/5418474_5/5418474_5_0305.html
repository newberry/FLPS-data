   <p>The war is over. German autocracy and capitalism have collapsed because of the capitulation of their allies. There was nothing else for the German people to do but to accept the hardest terms that have ever been imposed on a nation since the dawn of history: terms which they will not be able to bear. From a nation that has been defeated one can demand anything, but will she fulfill the demands? Must the German people perish and pay for the sins of their autocratic leaders and capitalists? America's Allies demand the dividing up of Germany and her colonies in order to be reimbursed for their war expenditures. The burden of this infamous war, from which the capitalists of both sides have reaped millions and millions of dollars' worth of profits, is to be placed upon the German people. Is there any thinking person who honestly and <span class="page-break">2</span>earnestly believes that, in this twentieth century, a nation could be enslaved for generations to come? It is argued that the German people are at the present time the strong wall resisting Bolshevism, which is trying to force its way towards western Europe. Against this wall--against the character of the German people, against the German race with its orderliness, discipline, and self-restraint, gained in the hard school of adversity--the flood of Bolshevism will come to naught, or else it will spread devastatingly all over Europe and, perhaps, over here. The above lines speak volumes. Capitalism over here is getting an inkling of the impending danger.</p>
   <p>Unless America intervenes in the eleventh hour, the German people have nothing to hope for any more, nothing more to lose. Even after the war thousands of their fellow citizens will remain as slaves in prison camps, victims of autocracy and capitalism. Under these conditions, can anybody expect the German people to let themselves be used by their <span class="page-break">3</span>enemies as a wall against Bolshevism? There can be no peace if the German people are to be kept in chains for generations.</p>
   <p>America will decide whether or not the tidal wave of Bolshevism rolls over Europe and eventually comes over here. An ostrichlike policy during these fateful days would be a grave mistake. The people no longer believe the great newspapers. They have printed too much "baloney".</p>
