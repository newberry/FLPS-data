   <p>During the present year and also during the coming years the Federal Government will need more money than it did prior to our entry into the European War. Our citizens will have to raise this money in some way, since it is not feasible to provide for all expenditures, though most of them are unusual, with borrowed money. So it will be necessary to raise the money through taxes. In former years the Government derived its income from direct and indirect taxes. Recently the opinion has been voiced that indirect taxation is not just because the poorer citizens are affected by it more than the more prosperous citizens are. Therefore a system of graduated income taxation was introduced. But its proceeds were not sufficient to cover all the financial needs of the Government. They would have been sufficient in normal time if large incomes had been taxed, as they were of necessity when war broke out. However, under present conditions the Government has but one recourse--indirect taxes, though they are exceedingly obnoxious to our citizens. The time may come when the income from inheritance and <span class="page-break">\2</span>income taxes will be adequate to meet the expenses of the Government. Until that time the proceeds derived from customs and other forms of indirect taxation will be a sizeable and welcome financial help for our federal officials.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile Congress ought to exercise the greatest possible care and diligence in assessing these indirect taxes, so that they are made payable by those who are financially able and not by those whose standard of living would be lowered to such and extent that their life would be made Miserable if they were made responsible for payment. Articles which are indispensable for the maintenance of life, such as food, exclusive of delicacies, and clothing which cannot be classed as luxury, should not be taxed. The simplest forms of amusement are also a part of the necessities of life, and they should not be taxed. Admission to movie theaters, to large amusement parks, the cheaper sections of "legitimate" theaters, opera houses, and concert halls, etc., should not be taxed, for they are a source of necessary recreation. Of course, this applies only to <span class="page-break">\3</span>normal times. Extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary measures. It costs money to carry on war, much money, as we have learned, and all citizens must contribute their share. But now, since war demands are no longer being made on our national treasury, there is grave danger that Congress, when it reorganizes the system of taxation, will fail to observe the principle of placing the burden of taxes on the shoulders of those who can bear it, and of sparing those who need all of their income to live.</p>
   <p>This anxiety emanates from the experience which taxpayers have had with Congress. And the last Congress is no exception. When, after the close of the War, a reduction of the total taxes which were to be levied was discussed, not a few of the people's representatives showed a perilous inclination to begin by decreasing the tax on luxuries. For example, many people are still wondering why the recent tax act imposes a levy of ten per cent upon sporting goods and a comparatively smaller levy on jewelry. It is true that only the rich participate in certain kinds of sport, and these forms of recreation or amusement should be heavily taxed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>They who would be required to pay could do so without harming or inconveniencing themselves. But the legislators seem to have forgotten that there are forms of sport which are practiced principally by our youths and children, not only by the wealthy, but also by the poor, and that these forms are not a luxury, but a necessary activity and, for that reason, should not have been included in the list of taxables, or, at least, the levy placed on them should not be larger than that which is placed on the jewels which a Rockefeller or a Pierpont Morgan buys for his wife. That is not just, and is only one of many instances which should be food for thought for our citizens. These injustices can best be removed by gradually abolishing all indirect taxes and retaining an income tax assessed according to a sliding scale. This form of taxation would hardly please the wealthy, but would be welcomed by the majority of our people, who have heretofore borne a disproportionately large part of the tax burden.</p>
