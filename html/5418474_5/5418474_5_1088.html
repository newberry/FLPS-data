   <p>Hard times, danger and tribulation are the real test of a nation. The German and the Austro-Hungarian people have passed the test with honor. They were and are one in thought and action, in fighting spirit and sacrifice. And generally speaking, their fellow nationals over here in America have been no less true and loyal during the critical weeks just past. The overwhelming majority of the local Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians, i. e., the American citizens of German and Austro-Hungarian origin, have openly and frankly espoused the cause of their native lands. They have been joined by many Americans of non-German blood,--American citizens of Irish, Swedish, and also truly American descent. During recent days and weeks, many in the latter category have sent in protests to the Abendpost, voicing their indignation over the kind of reporting and the hostile attitude of the so-called American press toward Germany's just cause. The editors of this paper have received spoken and written requests to publish a few enlightening articles every day, and to give reports from the war fronts in the "American" language, in order that citizens who cannot read German, but who are not Anglophiles either, may get a better understanding of what is going on, so that they can form their own judgment. From the above-mentioned groups come the most violent protests against the Anglophile campaign that is being conducted in this country. And this is natural enough, because these truly American-minded sections of our population have no press of their own; because in this great America there is practically no newspaper writing the language of this country.</p>
   <p>The majority of the German and Austro-Hungarian population in this country have proved themselves to be faithful, undaunted, and ready to make sacrifices. The list of contributors to the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society (Hilfsgesellschaft) testify to this. The German Hod Carriers' Union contributed five thousand dollars, and the rest of the German workers would not be outdone by the hod carriers. Without being solicited and even though it meant great sacrifices for them, they have been mailing their contributions to the Abendpost office and to the treasurer of the Aid Society. And non-German groups are also sending gifts to the Society.</p>
   <p>But where there is light, there is also shadow. And our case is no exception. Among the more well-to-do German-Americans, there are not a few who look with disfavor upon this relief work, who do not even care to show any pro-German sentiment. They justify their behavior by pointing out their duty as American citizens to remain neutral, or by saying that they have to make concessions to their republican sentiments and to their business associates and acquaintances of non-German origin. A large part of our fellow citizens of non-German blood use similar phrases. They think it their duty as citizens to emphasize their republican sentiments and their disapproval of monarchism and militarism.</p>
   
   <p>When we hear arguments like these, especially from German-Americans, we are likely to become angry, but then we remember the words of Jesus Christ: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!" Those persons of German blood who talk and act in the manner just described do not realize that this war is directed not only against the German Reich, but against the Deutschtum in general and against anything that is German. They do not realize that the German element, should it act humbly and meekly at the present moment, will have to resume the fight [for recognition] later on under worse conditions, or else they will perish as an entity and become absorbed by the Anglo-Saxon sphere of influence and culture which is predominant in this country, if not actually become veritable hirelings of Britain.</p>
   <p>Other groups in this country, Americans of non-German and non-English origin, do not know that this fight is directed not against militarism or monarchism but against the German people, and this for the sole reason that the German nation is the greatest rival and challenger of British world domination; they do not know that in the event the Germans are crushed and subjugated, the next strongest power will be tackled; that as sure as night follows the day, England will turn against America and will incite her "allies" against this great Republic as soon as the latter dares to infringe upon Great Britain's domination of the seas or otherwise attempt to rid itself of British guardianship. England is determined not to tolerate any rival power. Today she looks upon the United States as a sort of "dominion," like Canada, and is trying hard to make this Republic completely English. And America has no press that speaks her own language. It is high time for her to get one.</p>
