   <p>The present war situation in Europe makes it necessary to insist that the English language press of our country be persuaded to publish just and unbiased reports of the causes and progress of the war.</p>
   <p>The German-American National Alliance feels that it is the duty of that society to call a meeting for the purpose stated above. This meeting will be held at the Auditorium, Wednesday, August 5, at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>Qualified speakers will explain and discuss the war situation. All Germans, German-Austrians, and Swiss, as well as all others who are friendly to the German cause, are hereby invited to attend this meeting and to pass resolutions which are in keeping with the spirit of this appeal.</p>
