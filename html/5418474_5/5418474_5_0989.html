   <p>Don't misunderstand us! We are not against philanthropy and charity. Let the Belgian orphans come over here and be adopted! Collect money for the relief of the war victims! But do not forget to request your "British cousins" on the other side of the big pond to let foodstuffs pass through to the European continent. That would soon stop the distress over there, even in Belgium. "Oh, Mistress of the Sea, Have Mercy!"</p>
   <p>Witnessing continuous German-baiting on behalf of Belgium and for Albion's greater glory, it becomes necessary for us, once and for all, to set this matter straight, and to call attention to the one all-important and pertinent fact, that the Belgians did not get any more or any less than they themselves asked for, according to all calculations. Their women and children should certainly not have to pay for this, but sentimental considerations must not allow us to condone <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>deliberate falsification of facts without a protest.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the war, it was possible for hypocritical England and her hirelings to make political capital out of the violation of Belgium's neutrality. The chancellor of the German Reich, who took painstaking care not to be ambiguous, had announced that Germany had to violate Belgium's neutrality. The chancellor was acting in good faith by assuming that Belgium was a neutral state. But at that time he did not have any knowledge of those secret military documents which later fell into the hands of the Germans when Brussels was taken. These documents give irrefutable proof that the chief of the Belgian general staff in Brussels and the British military attache, Lieutenant Colonel Bernadiston, had worked out all the details of landing a British expeditionary force [in Belgium]. The plan originated in England on April 10, 1906, and was officially approved by the chief of the British general staff, Lieutenant General Sir James Griersson. Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne were designated as points of debarkation. There were also documents outlining a spy system for the Rhine provinces.</p>
   <p>Another important document which was found proves the existence of a Belgian- <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>French alliance before the war. It includes a map informing the Belgian general staff of French army positions. The date is December 23, 1911. There are some more documents which prove beyond all doubt that Belgium would have let the French and the English pass through to the Rhine. Conclusion: Belgium neutrality did not exist, and could, therefore, not have been violated.</p>
   <p>Belgium forced Germany to make a tough war. Nothing would have been destroyed if the [Belgian]army had not put up resistance. And when that army was beaten, women and children would have remained unharmed. No German soldier would have touched a hair of their heads. Why did this stupid rabble, living less than half a day's journey from the Rhine, believe all those wild and superstitious tales? Of course, there is an extenuating circumstance: Great sections of them cannot read! This "luxury" a "wise" Belgian government could not afford for its people. Frenchwomen do not take to their heels when they hear that the Germans are approaching. Instead of remaining in their homes, these foolish Belgians grabbed the arms which had been distributed among them according to a plan; the fair sex was no exception. But only when this practice became a habit did the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>German military authorities resort to the inevitable war measures against snipers.</p>
   <p>Thanks to these irrefutable facts, Germany can now afford to stand on international law. If homesteads were destroyed in Belgium, if women became widows and children orphans, Germany can reply: "You can blame your allies for it, and yourselves. 'Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.'"</p>
   <p>But the Belgian incident is being kept alive on purpose. The fund-raising mania and the sudden love for orphans serve as the means to continue the agitation against the Germans under a camouflage. If it were inspired purely by charity and philanthropy, why is it necessary to emphasize those "German atrocities" and to keep on playing that old ditty called "neutrality," played to death long since?</p>
   <p>Nobody takes this pretense of indignation seriously any longer!</p>
   <p>But we do know how England and Japan have respected Chinese neutrality. Only <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>by violating neutral Chinese territory were those yellow scoundrels able, with the aid of their British pals, to make war on the Germans in Tsingtao [German colony].</p>
   <p>And how will England and Russia justify their attack on Persia? Did not an American named Shuster give the world the whole dope about it? The "scrap of paper"--an agreement between England and Persia--guaranteeing the latter's independence, was torn up by the same Sir Edward Grey who, sitting on his high horse and turning pious eyes toward heaven, prayed: "Oh Lord, I thank Thee that I am not like those." And what did that crooked, bloodthirsty, yellow ally of Grey do? Russia, France, and England, together with Japan, had "guaranteed" the independence of Korea. With the knowledge of her three allies, Japan grabbed Korea, but not until her hired assassins had first removed the queen in about the same way that Alexander and Draga had been removed in Belgrade. Grey and his pious accomplices remained in the background, rubbing their hands. But, to the world, they showed their well-known innocent faces.</p>
   <p>In order to conquer the Boers, the British army, without qualms of conscience, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>marched through Portugese territory and landed troops in Delagoa Bay. As a reward for that, Portugal had to send troops there, allegedly for protection against German attacks, but in reality to help defeat the rebellious Boers. When and where did these British diplomatic scoundrels ever respect their own signature or keep their word of honor, unless it was an advantage to do so? A true friend of humanity feels righteous indignation, watching these hypocrites whine about the "distress of the Belgians," which was nobody's fault but their own and that of the Allies.</p>
   <p>A few years ago, when money was collected for the starving Hindoos, the German Kaiser headed the list with ten thousand dollars, if we remember correctly. Using the most powerful magnifying glasses, nobody could have found the names of the British royal family on that list. Now they like to show off as good Samaritans and "heal the wounds" which they themselves have inflicted, the dirty hypocrites!</p>
   <p>There is one more thing of which we want to remind our Americans who, just <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>like the English, shed crocodile tears after Louvain, the "city of science," was destroyed. The incident took place on August 27, 1914, and was an act of wanton vandalism, according to our English cousins. Exactly one hundred years and three days before the destruction of Louvain, on August 24, 1814, these British cousins burned down the White House in Washington. What do you think of that, fellow Americans, whose hearts are beating so warmly for England? If that wasn't vandalism, what was it?</p>
   <p>Go ahead and alleviate distress; it's a fine thing to do. But cut out the hypocrisy. We have some more aces in the hole!</p>
