   <p>In this struggle of the Germans against the united powers of the European continent, the Anglo-American newspapers provide proof each day, and to an ever-increasing degree, that they are ignorant of their own [i. e., American] history, if not worse than ignorant. It seems as if these newspapers, completely devoid of any national pride themselves, are turning their fury against a nation who, in her relations with other peoples, is guided by national pride. If one did not know how England has always managed, even after the separation of the [American] colonies, not only to keep the United States in cultural and ideological bondage but also to make this country economically dependent on her, this psychological puzzle could not be understood. But since we do know how perfectly American culture blends with English culture, we can understand, though we can never condone, the attitude of the Anglo-American press. This is the reason why the American press does not know the pride <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of independence, but we can never forgive this "World Power" [the press] for neglecting the education and enlightenment of the American people as it is doing at present. The newspapers not only deliberately refrain from teaching their readers the role which our government and people should play in this struggle, but they agitate in an unscrupulous manner against Germany. The New York Times said a few days ago: "German ambition is proving a serious, even an alarming, matter for us (America), for it is as sure as fate that, after Russia is defeated, France crushed, and Belgium and Holland annexed, a war with us, on some pretext or other, will not be long in coming. We cannot welcome the necessity of investing our fortune in a struggle with Germany for military supremacy."</p>
   <p>The above-quoted newspaper is a good example of the "influential" Anglo-American press! The underlying motive here is not so much to prejudice the American people against Germany; the insinuation that Germany, once having finished her enemies in Europe, would attempt to attack the United States, is too idiotic to be taken seriously by anyone. No, the point in question is contained in the last sentence of the foregoing quotation. Of course, if <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the premise is false, if Germany has no "designs on the United States," then we do not have to worry about heavy military armaments being imposed upon the country, but if attack is considered inevitable, it will become an inevitable necessity to "invest our fortune" in military preparations. The press knows that there is not the slightest sentiment in this country in favor of such expenditures during times of peace. But if the country is in danger, then, of course, that is a different matter!</p>
   <p>Now, [the question is] how to avoid these expenditures? The article is a hint to the Government; a hint to an eventual peace negotiation; a suggestion to our Government that, regardless of the circumstances, Germany must be deprived of the fruits of victory if she should win the war. The United States Government was the first to offer its services for the restoration of peace--a fact which is almost self-explanatory. We enjoy the moral prestige which America gains by this act, even though the initiative was not free of British suggestion. But this article in the Times advises American diplomacy in no ambiguous terms to prevent a victorious Germany from taking advantage of her <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>victory, because Germany might become too powerful and might constitute a danger for America. Since our American people are under the influence of British commercial "ethics," this reasoning is also British. No sacrifice for an army or navy--that costs money. And since we hate to have to spend money for armaments, this dangerous Germany must not be allowed to rise [i.e., become great].</p>
   <p>Anyone who follows these arguments to their conclusion must admit that the recipe can only be found in England's political cookbook. In the Times editorial quoted above, we can see that England's business is already taken care of very efficiently; we also can see public opinion being prepared for the idea that it would cost the United States huge sums to be armed to the point where it could successfully defend itself against Germany. These things are no longer in the realm of conjecture; there is method in this agitation which will soon prove to have practical results.</p>
   <p>You take a chance when you leave everything to the people's common sense. In <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>most cases, common sense only begins to function when it is too late. Public opinion is more easily influenced by propaganda of fear than by arguments of reason. Before fear is overcome, reason has been dead a long time. Of course we can unmask these political agitators and expose their criminal intentions. But something is bound to stick. Not everybody can tell a falsehood from the truth. Of course, if the American people would remember the role England has played since the days of American independence, we could calmly watch the course of events and leave everything to the common sense of the people. But this [i.e., to await developments, etc.] would prove disastrous.</p>
   <p>Germany is fighting today for the same thing France fought for before the days of the Declaration of Independence, namely, the freedom of the seas. England, as early as the Seven Years' War, considered herself mistress of the sea. At that time, she told France what she later on had the colossal brass to tell Germany: not to build a navy. After this interference with the growth and progress of France, came the struggle with England, and as a direct consequence, France's support of the American efforts to become independent. Lafayette's <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>army and ships were not paid for and maintained out of his own pocket but by the treasury of France, and it was not Louis the Sixteenth's love for the Americans but his desire to weaken British world commerce which led him to support Lafayette in helping America gain independence from England. Because overseas colonies, then as now, were England's source of income, Frederick the Second [the Great] of Prussia knew where his duty lay and was the first to recognize the United States.</p>
   <p>With every means in her power, England later on supported the South in the Civil War. During that struggle, she trampled neutrality underfoot and destroyed the merchant ships of the Union. The infamous conduct of this "model" liberal England cannot even be whitewashed by the fact that after the war she had to pay heavy indemnities. All the ships in the service of the Confederacy, which blockaded the Union harbors--the "Florida," "Tallahassee," "Shenandoah," "Austee," and "Nashville"--were built and manned in Great Britain. At the end of the Civil War, the merchant marine of the Union had ceased to exist and the "great" press of this country, being in the service of England, <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>has managed until this very day to prevent America from building a new merchant marine. It is this press which keeps America down in the interest of England.</p>
   <p>These are all historical facts with which Americans should be familiar. Why cannot the American people draw logical conclusions from these facts? Well, the day may come when they will have to. Then the Americans will find out who their real friends are. And the British won't be among them.</p>
