   <p>Shortly after the signing of the armistice, at a time when unavoidable chaos reigned in Germany as a result of the overthrow of the Imperial Government, voices were heard here and there, predicting that the German people would soon be reorganized and that they would soon regain prosperity, power, and prestige. In the weeks and months which followed these voices grew in number, in spite of the fact that Germany had to face more and more hardships as the terms of the so-called peace treaty became better known. The clamor grew louder and more persistent. It was claimed not only that Germany would soon become strong and powerful again, but that at this time she still was (or had become again) a military danger, and that if peace in Europe was to be maintained and if the victors were to enjoy their spoils (but of course one did not call it "spoils" but "achievements", she should be still further disarmed <span class="page-break">\2</span>and shackled. Special emphasis was laid upon the great diligence and the enormous efficiency of the German people which was believed to be based on their extraordinary general industrial and scientific knowledge and education. Of much greater danger, therefore, than her political and military prowess was Germany's economic [commercial and industrial] capacity.</p>
   <p>Such reports and opinions originated almost entirely in the enemy camp or in sources such as France, which were hostile to the German people. The fact that they [the reports] predicted not only Germany's rapid economic recuperation, but also the reawakening of the German military spirit, and that they clamored for the strictest measures as a protection against Germany, rendered them highly suspicious. Fear of Germany was evident--which permits us to assume that they honestly believed what they said--but they also aroused the suspicion that the main reason for describing Germany as a land replete with vitality was to afford them an excuse or an alibi for subjecting Germany to further exploitation and <span class="page-break">\3</span>oppression. To the unbiased observer the unlimited admiration for the German people which was the undertone of these warnings and prophecies did not seem to ring quite true. Until recently, everything that we heard from the same or similar sources breathed nothing but hatred and contempt [for Germany], and conditions in Germany, according to public and private reports, still seemed to be very unstable and to leave much to be desired; we heard tales of general laziness and epicurean pleasure seeking among the masses, and of a considerable increase of crime.</p>
   <p>The suspicion was justified that the praise and admiration of the energy and efficiency of the German people--this praise which came from anti-German sources--was prompted by the desire for more plunder and by the fear of German revenge, and that it aimed at the further exploitation and oppression of Germany. However, a careful observer must have gained the conviction that this apprehension was justified, for the present-day situation leads to the conclusion that those voices which predicted so rapid a recuperation and reconstruction for Germany that this country <span class="page-break">\4</span>would eventually surpass the Entente nations economically may not have been so far wrong.</p>
   <p>For, even if in Germany everything is not yet the way it should be, the situation in England, France, and Italy (just to mention the neighboring countries) is still less satisfactory. While Germany is being reorganized, conditions in the Entente countries are becoming more confused every day. While Germany's future takes on a brighter aspect, this cannot be said for England, France, or Italy. We let the Chicago Tribune speak. This paper, well informed on Western European questions, says in an editorial:</p>
   <p>"Are some nations of Europe determined to commit suicide? A fight for a radical revolution may well be the end of Britain. In France, a low birth rate has kept the population stationary for generations, and an equally conservative spirit has prevented economic expansion and modernization. In Italy, imperialism and red radicalism are about to wage a <span class="page-break">\5</span>suicidal battle. Russia...has begun to destroy instead of to reconstruct. Thus the great nations of Europe seem to stand on the brink of self-destruction at present, ready for exhausting internal struggles beneath the ruins which their international jealousies have brought about, instead of working together for reconstruction."</p>
   <p>So much for the Entente countries. And how about Germany? The Tribune continues with its editorial: "There is, however, an exception. The German people alone seem to have grasped the all important and vital necessity of peaceful work. Although they had to undergo one of the most trying ordeals and moral reactions in the history of nations, and were for a brief period face to face with anarchy, they have regained their mental equilibrium with uncomparable speed. The destructive radicalism was subdued. The German people faced a trying situation courageously; the inevitable was accepted without despair and rehabilitation had begun.</p>
   <p>"This marvelous success is due to racial traits and national intelligence. <span class="page-break">\6</span>We may have our own opinions about the German national character, but Germany today sets an example for her rivals and it would do them good to reflect on it. If the Germans produce and toil hard, while the Britons, French, Italians, and Americans indulge in strikes, curtail their industry, shorten working hours, decrease even the output during this shorter period, and raise wages to a point where capital cannot make any more profit, then the results must be clear to anyone. Work produces prosperity, especially if it is directed as intelligently as in Germany. Idleness destroys. Germany will recuperate and outstrip her rivals, if these rivals remain idle, go on strikes, and waste their substance while Germany works and saves."</p>
   <p>We may well disregard the conditional "if" of the last sentence. The German people will surpass their rivals for they must and want to work, while their competitiors, particularly those in Europe, will not work and save as diligently. They had been promised wonderful things in case of victory, even "the blue in the sky," so to speak. Well, they did win.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>And now they like to get something in return, the more the better. Their masses want money, and goods, and time to enjoy life, and they cannot get enough, since pleasure by itself somehow does not seem to satisfy. They are going to take what they want and their greed will know no bounds, until Germany's rise will make them realize that there was a price to be paid for victory just as for anything else on this earth.</p>
