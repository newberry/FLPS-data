   <p>Germany has declared war on Russia, and thus hostilities have begun. Germany demanded that France halt her mobilization and other preparations on the frontier, and that she explain her plans; but before France could deliver an ultimatum, Germany massed a great number of troops at the boundary of France. Moreover, Germany has taken possession of the railroads and telegraph system of Luxemburg, has sent an army of one hundred thousand men to Luxemburg, and has permitted the army to cross the French boundary at Cirey, a point forty miles west of Nancy--yet no declaration of war against France had been made by either of these countries, and all the great powers of Europe had guaranteed the neutrality of Luxemburg in the Treaty of London made in 1869!</p>
   <p>Germany--the German nation, the German Kaiser as supreme war lord of the German Empire--apparently is the aggressor. Everything that has been said branding the German nation, and especially the German Kaiser, as a disturber of peace and an enemy of civilization, which can endure and progress only in time of peace, seems to be true. Germany has caused the war which for years has been feared as a horrible specter by Europe and the whole civilized world!</p>
   <p>Apparently, yes; in reality, no! The truth is that the enemies of Germany have succeeded in forcing her into the role of a disrupter of the peace by constantly and systematically endeavoring to deprive her of that (sic) which served in a measure to balance the great power of her enemies, and which may enable her to defend her existence and good reputation, honorably and successfully in a war long agreed upon by her enemies.</p>
   <p>Russia's procrastinations, her evasive answers, and her recent dickering with Austria-Hungary were merely subterfuges to gain time for mobilization, and to deprive the German nation of the effect of rapid armament preparations. France's pretended reluctance to go to war, her spurious cautiousness, and England's alleged endeavors to preserve the peace, had the very same purpose, and were also intended to brand Germany as a disturber of the peace in the eyes of the world, and, above all, to discredit her and destroy any sympathy the United States may have had for her. In reality, both England and France armed with the utmost rapidity. In reality, they, together with Russia, are the disturbers of peace, since they had agreed upon a general war against Germany before Russia requested an explanation for Germany's mobilization, before Austria-Hungary demanded satisfaction from Serbia, and before the successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne was assassinated in Sarajevo. This war would have come years ago if a plausible excuse could have been found; and the enemies have not even taken the trouble to conceal their determination to humiliate Germany. The war was deferred only because Germany was previously able to extricate herself time and again from the difficult situations into which she was placed by her foes. And the war would not have been averted in this instance, but would merely have been postponed for a short while, even if Germany had found ways and means of withdrawing honorably.</p>
   <p>Actually the three powers have been at war with Germany for a long time, and in war the end justifies the means. This is true though these means be the cunning and deceit which were applied to force Germany either to throw the gauntlet into the face of her enemies--to start the war, and to violate neutralities--or to forfeit those advantages which she had gained by great sacrifices and hard work, and to deprive herself of every possibility of carrying on the war honorably and successfully.</p>
   <p>Appearances are against Germany, but we are confident that the American people will not let themselves be deceived by appearances for any great length of time. Their common sense--the proverbial "sober second thought"--and their love of justice have always asserted themselves. The American people will see that Germany was forced to go to war, that she is opposed by superior numbers, and that in this battle of life and death she cannot observe treaties which were actually broken and cast into the wastebasket long ago. They will admit that the German Kaiser, the German Government, and the German people would have been stark mad to cause a war without good reason, to take up arms against a superior enemy, and to jeopardize her very existence. And Americans--that is, Americans whose opinion is decisive--will be just to the German nation.</p>
