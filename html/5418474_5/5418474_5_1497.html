   <p>Yesterday, Congress passed two bills of the greatest importance, one dealing with social security and the other with the introduction of compulsory arbitration boards in labor disputes. The former had already been passed in the House; its passage in the Senate was effected after a short and passionate debate. The opposite took place with the second bill. Both bills have been extensively discussed. They are a part of the New Deal program, and in principle they are both undoubtedly correct and timely, but it is extremely doubtful whether they are workable in their present form.</p>
   <p>The opponents of the Wagner-Connery bill, providing for arbitration courts in disputes between employers and employees, contend that it gives the American Federation of Labor unlimited control over all industry and that it does away with the so-called "company unions". This contention is palpably a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>false one. The bill merely provides that employers may no longer dominate labor organizations or support them financially. It also stipulates that a majority of workers shall choose their representatives within a certain unit, and that these representatives shall have the exclusive right to appear for the workers in negotiations with employers.</p>
   <p>No one can foresee how the act will work in practice. It has, for its aims, the end of wasteful strikes and lockouts, and this is surely a desirable aim. The aim can possibly be attained if there is, on both sides, a wish for profitable and harmonious co-operation, and if both groups show tact, skill, and moderation.</p>
   <p>The other bill, providing for social security, is so far-reaching in its dispositions that we cannot yet express an opinion as to its effectiveness, or as to the way it is going to be carried out. Social security is bound to come. But whether the act adopted by Congress can be carried out in practice, whether industry can shoulder the burden and still carry on in the competitive <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>markets of the world, no one can decide as yet. At any rate, by passing the two bills, Congress demonstrated incredible levity.</p>
   <p>The bills were whipped through in both houses. There was no sign of any serious or pointed debate, or of a detailed discussion of each individual clause. Numerous amendments were introduced, but nearly all of them were voted down. It was clear, from the wording of these amendments and from the remarks made during the debates, that the senators and congressmen were guided by the idea of making an impression upon the voters, with the attitude they were assuming. Some of them did not want to spoil their chances with industry, others wished to keep friendship with the American Federation of Labor. Their attitudes were determined exclusively by these considerations.</p>
   <p>Added to this is another point. Both houses refused to discuss the question of whether their measures are or are not constitutional. A representative from Wisconsin, Thomas O'Malley, exclaimed that constitutional arguments give him nausea, and with that he probably expressed the opinion of most of his <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>colleagues. In the Senate, Huey Long hit the nail upon the head when he said: "I do not think that this bill is constitutional; but the 'braintrusters,' nine of whom are sitting in this hall, think otherwise. It seems to me that we no longer permit our own opinions to prevail, but instead we depend upon the 'braintrusters'."</p>
   <p>The temperamental gentleman from Louisiana described the situation clearly; there is no doubt about that. Following the decision handed down by the Supreme Court on the question of the NRA, Congress should have dealt in greater detail with the question of constitutionality. But it seems that it lacked courage to do so, and finds it more convenient to pass the bills and lay the responsibility for their constitutionality at the door of the Supreme Court. How much economic insecurity results, or how much the return to prosperity may be retarded, does not seem to be the gentlemen's concern.</p>
