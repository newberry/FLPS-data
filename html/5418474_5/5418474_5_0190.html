   <p>The War is ended. Peace is assured. Peace will soon be concluded and a further large Government loan is in prospect--not in spite of the fact that we have peace, but just because of that fact!</p>
   <p>Although the War is past, the cost of the War has not yet been paid, And among the unpaid war debts there is the cost of demobilizing our fighting forces and war industries, upon which the conclusion of peace hinges--in other words, the cost of reconstruction.</p>
   <p>Four large bond issues have already been financed, and a fifth will soon be placed on the market. The former were called "Liberty bonds," while those to be issued will be known as "Victory bonds." The former were sold to finance the War through which peace and the victory of liberty were to be attained. The purpose of the impending loan is to heal the wounds of the War and to make amends <span class="page-break">\2</span>for losses incurred through it.</p>
   <p>When the former bonds were issued, nobody knew how many more issues would be necessary. It was an immensely great, a very difficult and an extremely costly enterprise which our country resolved to undertake. Prospects were not bright. And yet when the Government asked our citizens for billions of dollars, when the great Liberty Loans were floated, the requested sums were soon subscribed for--and billions more. Our people bought willingly, because they considered it to be their duty to put the means to carry on the war and obtain the victory at the disposal of the Government.</p>
   <p>Victory has been won, peace has been attained. Now the Government needs an additional sum of six billion dollars. But what for? Partly to redeem obligations, partly to defray expenses connected with the return to peacetime conditions, to accelerate readjustment, and to facilitate the transition from war to peace.</p>
   <p>"He who greases well, rides in comfort." Money is the grease which keeps our <span class="page-break">\3</span>national machinery in good running order. The object of the new loan is to provide our Government with the necessary money.</p>
   <p>Will the new issue be sold quickly? What a question! Would a ship owner whose vessel has reached port safely after a severe storm spend the money necessary to remove the traces and damages of the storm and to put it into first-class condition, making future profitable trips possible?</p>
   <p>If our Government officials were worthy of our confidence during the War, how much more do they deserve it now that the War has been successfully concluded? The pending Victory Loan will be the last and best.</p>
   <p>It should be subscribed and oversubscribed in less time than the prior loans were.</p>
