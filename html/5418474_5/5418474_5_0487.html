   <p>Extraordinary conditions call for extraordinary measures.</p>
   <p>President Wilson has decided to participate personally in the Peace Conference in France and to remain abroad as long as it seems necessary for him to accomplish the objectives of his international policies.</p>
   <p>That is something quite unusual. Never before in the history of this country has a President visited Europe during his term of office. If, as is expected, President Wilson not only opens the Peace Conference, but also takes an active part in the negotiations, and thereby serves as America's delegate, an unheard-of precedent will be established. During the President's absence from the national capital and while Congress is in session, all legislating will be suspended--which is also quite unusual--because Vice-President Marshall, as President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House have entered into an agreement with the President to withhold their signatures, until the President returns, from all bills which Congress may adopt.</p>
   <p>The word "extraordinary" is hardly strong enough to characterize the great deviation from firmly established customs and habits which these decisions and measures entail, but then the conditions, the whole situation, and the objectives in the pursuit of which these measures were decided upon, are more than extraordinary. They are so new, and of such immense importance for America and the whole world, that they justify the widest deviation from old customs, providing that they seem desirable and imperative for the welfare of America and the rest of the world. Is this the case?</p>
   <p>The special correspondent of the Chicago Tribune at Washington informs his paper that President Wilson has five main objectives in mind which he hopes to accomplish by his participation in the Peace Conference, namely; the establishment of a league of nations to enforce peace; an agreement regarding disarmament; an agreement which would guarantee the freedom of the seas, during peace as well as during war, by the [proposed] league of nations; a square deal for the German people; and aid for Russia.</p>
   <p>It is said, in this connection, that it is the President's ambition to go down in history as the man who banished war from the world. Just recently he stated that he had entered the war to end war for all times--an utterance, which, by the way, only confirms, the opinion of him and his policy long held by all those who think they know him well. He hopes to reach this goal by establishing a league of nations which would be a permanent court of arbitration and which would also exercise police power over all nations. The [proposed] league of nations will also, according to the President's plan, rule the seas and protect the trade of all nations from any kind of damage or restrictions during war or peace.</p>
   <p>By the expression, "a square deal for the German people," a peace agreement is understood which would not stand in the way of a free development of the German people under democratic institutions; an agreement which would be helpful and would provide for moderate reparations.</p>
   <p>"The President does not want to see the German people burdened with a debt load which would make slaves out of them for a generation or even for a century."</p>
   <p>Who does not agree with that? Who would hesitate to wish the President good luck in this great work? Who would hesitate to give wholehearted approval to the President's decision to go to France himself; to further his peace program with the full weight of his personality and his high office, no matter how extraordinary and unheard-of this procedure may seem, and regardless of how little enthusiasm it may arouse in certain people who have different interests.</p>
   <p>The President has assumed a gigantic task which will require great courage and resolution. He earnestly desires to work for the good cause and, if it is at all possible, to establish peace for his country and for all humanity. This he proves by his present venture. We pray that he will be rewarded with success.</p>
