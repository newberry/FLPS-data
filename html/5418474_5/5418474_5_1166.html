   <p>In an article which appeared in the Monday edition of a local English language newspaper, a Mr. R. J. Psenka, an American of Czech extraction professes to be in sympathy with a demand made at the great German-American mass meeting, August 5, where a request was made for an un prejudiced evaluation of the war causes, etc. Mr. Psenka demands the same justice, caution, and impartiality from all Americans for his Czech brothers, especially those of German mixture, and their native lands. [Translator's note: by native lands is probably meant regions or districts.] He declares "with regret" that the Slav is seldom mentioned in the German language press without such attributes as "Barbarian," "Asiatic," or at least, "semi-Asiatic," and he asks, "Is that fair play?"</p>
   <p>It wouldn't be, if true. But it is not true. The designations about which the man complains were applied, if at all, to Russia, and Russia only was meant by them. Where Slavs were mentioned distinctions were always made, and only <span class="page-break">2</span>Southern Slavs were considered semi-civilized, but not "Barbarian" or "Asiatic". But this is true of the South Slavs who live under the influence and sovereignty of Russia. Otherwise Mr. R. T. Psenka is right. Whatever the Germans, or rather the German-Americans, ask for themselves they must grant others, too, and they will, gladly! And if they sometimes have not clearly emphasized the difference between Slavs in general and Russia-dominated South Slavs in particular, it was certainly done unintentionally, in the heat of battle, so to speak. Above all, the Germans like to be fair, and only a slight criticism of their manner of expression is sufficient to make them check up on themselves. Regarding Mr. Psenka's article, one of our readers writes the following:</p>
   <p>"It seems to me that it would be wise if the local German language press did not condemn the Slavs in such general terms. After all, it is not the Slavs we have in mind so much as the Russians. The Bohemians, for instance, are on the same cultural level with the Germans, and the eastern part of Prussia is more or less Slavic. The cultural values are the things that matter, and although it is true that today's culture is essentially German, it would be <span class="page-break">3</span>wrong to misjudge others who have associated themselves with it."</p>
   <p>That is the way to be. That is the way the German-American shows his love for fairness, his thoroughness in judging phenomena, situations, and people--including himself--in other words, his German culture. But it's a different story with at least a part of our English language press. Psenka's article was favorably received, almost enthusiastically one would say, only the conclusions drawn from it were wrong. The English language press recommends the attitude, evinced in the German and Czecho-American appeal [the German appeal refers to the mass meeting on August 5, the Czech appeal to Mr. Psenka's article], for others to practice, but not for themselves and the type of people they represent! They see the mote which may be found in the German eye, but not the beam in their own. A Chicago morning paper writes:</p>
   <p>"When we leave our homeland and voluntarily go into a country where a foreign language and foreign institutions prevail, and when we assume a new citizenship and the duties that go with it, we obligate ourselves to break with the old ties, because they have to be broken sooner or later...."</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>So they speak, but they do just the opposite, because the sentiments of our Anglo-American press are predominantly English. Just now, in the problems of this World War, they seem more English than England herself, because in England the voices about the responsibility for this terrible war are still divided, but the Anglo-American press unanimously accredits the Kaiser with the German Reich. In the British Cabinet there were heated arguments as to whether or not England should participate in the war against Germany, and Burns and Morley announced their resignations when war was decided upon. But the Anglo-American press of our country acts as if there could not be the shadow of a doubt about the justice and necessity of England's war against Germany, as if England's participation in this war were a cultural necessity and a noble deed on behalf of civilization and political and intellectual progress.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. J. Psenka is right. The Germans have frequently done the Slavs injustice, even the South Slavs, even the Russians! Because the former are goaded and stirred up by Russia and the Russian people have no voice in their <span class="page-break">5</span>Government. And the Russian Government was done too much honor [Translators' note: meaning a questionable honor.], because they did not cause the war. Even in an alliance with France, Russia never would have dared to force war upon Germany. Only because she had the definite assurance that England would make common cause with her, did she drive Germany into the war. In the final analysis England alone is responsible for this war, but our English language American press is so Anglophile, so tangled up in their dependence on and admiration for England that they fail to perceive England's sordid commercialism [a nation of shopkeepers] and see nothing but "English Red" [Englischrot]; but at the same time they make unctuous speeches, telling other people of the necessity to be nothing, absolutely nothing but American!</p>
