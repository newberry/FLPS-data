   <p>Mass meetings were held last night in the North Side Turner Hall and in the nearby Bush Temple for the purpose of preparing the way for embargo legislation on war materials to the belligerent powers, because it is argued that, under present conditions, Germany's enemies are the only ones to benefit by these shipments, which is contradictory to true neutrality. It is assumed that such an embargo would soon put a stop to the bloody slaughter. The meetings were supposed to be German-Irish demonstrations, but, although the German-Irish Alliance had issued an announcement to that effect, very few Irishmen could be found in the audiences. But the Germans came in such numbers that both meeting places were filled to capacity one-half hour before the beginning, so that the police had to close the doors. A few hundred people could be accommodated in the gymnasium on the ground floor of the Turner Hall, but the rest had to remain outside. In order not to disappoint these people altogether, a number of speeches were given outside.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The North Side Turner Hall, just like the Bush Temple, was decorated with German and Irish flags, flanked by the Stars and Stripes. In order to entertain the public and create a patriotic atmosphere, Ballmann's orchestra played a few German and Irish folk songs, military marches, and so on, and shortly after 8 o'clock the chairman, Mr. Horace L. Brand, opened the meeting with an address in which he explained the purpose of the demonstration. The Vereinigte Maennerchoere (The United Male Choruses) sang "Das teure deutsche Herz," after which Congressman Richard Bartholdt, of St. Louis, was introduced to the audience; he was wildly acclaimed. He delivered the following speech, which was received with great applause by his listeners:</p>
   <p>"It is a matter of great concern which has brought us together here tonight. We don't want to take sides in this issue, but merely render a verdict. Somebody once said that the human heart could never be completely neutral, that it is inclined to be partial, and perhaps he was right. But it is a totally <span class="page-break">3</span>different matter when the official policy of this country is involved. In that case absolute neutrality is imperative. As American citizens, we have a right to find out whether our Federal Government is actually neutral, and today we are going to make use of this right. We want to make sure that our government can command the same respect among nations after the war as it enjoyed before.</p>
   <p>"To begin with, we have to concede frankly that there exists no law concerning war contraband. The sale of arms is not mentioned any place in the statute books, and is therefore not prohibited. Thomas Jefferson was of the opinion that, regarding the export of arms, nothing more was involved than the each belligerent would attempt to confiscate the shipments destined for the other party, and this rule has prevailed ever since. If, therefore, the American manufacturers would sell their products to Germany and Austria-Hungary as well as to the Allies, we would have no reason to complain. But the whole thing takes on a decidedly different aspect if we sell to one side exclusively, as is the case now. Since England dominates the seas, as we all know, Germany <span class="page-break">4</span>and Austria-Hungary are automatically excluded from any overseas trade, which fact makes for a violation of the neutrality spirit.</p>
   <p>THEORY VS. FACTS</p>
   <p>"It is argued that it is not our fault if one of the belligerent parties is unable to buy from us, but in my opinion this excuse is not valid enough to clear us of the accusation of being partial. Grover Cleveland once said that there was a difference between mere theories and concrete facts. And in this case we are dealing with facts. The former Attorney General and Secretary of State Knox recently made the statement that, in his opinion, Germany and Austria-Hungary certainly had a legitimate cause for complaint. As a prominent authority on international law, Knox surely must know what he is talking about. British purchasing agents can buy everything they want over here. One cargo ship after another, loaded with war materials, is leaving our ports for the war zone. It goes without saying that business activity is temporarily stimulated by it, and that a number of workers will find temporary employment <span class="page-break">5</span>at high wages, but are we not selling our neutrality for British gold? Would not the friendship and good will of one hundred million Germans and Austro-Hungarians be more worth while for our country in the long run than the profit which some wealthy manufacturers are reaping now?</p>
   <p>"A short while ago I brought this matter up before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, pointing out that, under the circumstances, our neutrality was nothing but a farce. The matter was referred to the State Department and I have never heard of it since.</p>
   <p>UNITED STATES RESPONSIBLE</p>
   <p>"If things continue to be as they have been in the past, the United States will have to assume the responsibility for the continuance of this most terrible war, because it is only too obvious that the arms and munitions sold by us make the continuation of the conflict possible. The Allies are determined to annihilate Germany! As if they would ever be capable of doing that! <span class="page-break">6</span>Behind those three million German soldiers fighting at the front stands the entire German nation, willing to make the supreme sacrifice in order to live peacefully in the future. England is rich because she transferred the treasures of India and Africa to London, but Germany is richer, because all she owns was earned by the sweat of her working people. How could a nation like that ever perish? But Germany will not be the only one to enjoy the fruits of victory. It is probable that for Ireland, too, the dawn of long-expected liberty will break.</p>
   <p>AT THE END OF THEIR ROPE</p>
   <p>"The Allies are at the end of their rope. Their war supplies are exhausted, and if the United States would stop sending them materials, the war would soon be over. Is it right that we provide the means for its continuation, that we lend a helping hand to further bloodshed, just so some manufacturers can get rich? The gold that flows into their coffers keeps that blood flowing in the German trenches. The President of the United States can stop <span class="page-break">7</span>the conflict with one word. Will he speak it?</p>
   <p>"There is enough precedent to enable him to adopt such a procedure. In 1898, Congress adopted a resolution empowering the President to put an embargo on coal and war materials; in 1905 President [Theodore] Roosevelt issued a proclamation prohibiting the export of arms to the Dominican Republic, and only recently did President Wilson lift the arms embargo to Mexico for the purpose of putting the insurgents on an equal footing with General Huerta.</p>
   <p>"In order to bring the matter to a head, I will introduce a resolution in the House of Representatives on December 10, which would empower the President to put an embargo on war materials of all kinds until further notice. This would enable the chief executive of our nation to replace his preached neutrality with practiced neutrality. It is impossible for me to imagine how any American can remain indifferent to our charge that we are actually marching, together with Russian barbarians and English shopkeepers, to destroy Germany's culture. We want to make American neutrality honest and aboveboard, so that the day may <span class="page-break">8</span>not be far off when peace will reign again in this world. We want to be prepared, when the time comes, to act as a mediator of peace, as befits the greatest of all neutral nations. The United States has the power to bring about an early peace, and we hope it will take advantage of this opportunity."</p>
   <p>The next speaker was the well-known Irish leader, Patrick O'Donnell. He first read the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Ten nations of the Old World are at present engaged in the greatest war the world has ever witnessed, not only exhausting their own resources, but also importing huge quantities of war materials and munitions from the United States; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, These arms and war materials, supplied by the United States, tend to enlarge the world conflagration in Europe and to step up the loss of human lives, already terrific, and to destroy property and lay waste whole countrysides and to prolong this most horrible of all wars; and <span class="page-break">9</span>"Whereas, We, as a people, raise our voices and pray for the cessation of hostilities, yet, as a nation, are keeping this war going by putting our privately owned arsenals at the disposal of Europe's belligerents; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Our government has declared for strict neutrality and has given assurance to us American citizens of all races, as well as to the belligerent powers, that we will not give support to either side or by our actions as a nation jeopardize the good will and friendship of any of these [belligerent] nations with when we are living in peace, and, although we do not want to cause strife and dissension in our own country among our citizens [of foreign extraction] by showing partiality towards their homelands, we nevertheless have supplied war materials and equipment to nations ready and able to buy them, knowing full well that England, with her century-old domination of the seas, also controls all the contraband, and that she and her allies alone could profit by this unholy trade, and that by our departure from strict neutrality we are hurting our old friends, Germany and Austria, by every possible means short of actual warfare; and <span class="page-break">10</span>"Whereas, The American people had once before delegated power to our government to withhold arms and war supplies from warring nations, when this government put an embargo on munitions shipments to our neighbor state Mexico, whose armed hordes were arrayed in battle against each other, but which now is putting unlimited quantities of fighting equipment at the disposal of the most powerful nations ever engaged in a conflict; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The United States would not remain true to its traditions if it kept a foreign war going by supplying the means for its continuation while this nation is passing through an economic crisis and hopes only for peace to regain its former prosperity; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, who are assembled at this German-Irish mass meeting in the city of Chicago, declare that it is the duty of the Congress of the United States immediately to enact the necessary laws which will give authority to the President of the United States to put an export embargo on all war contraband, excepting foodstuffs, thus depriving the belligerent powers of any support by this <span class="page-break">11</span>Republic for the continuation of the war. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we express our agreement with the efforts of the Christian churches of this country in imploring God for an early peace, but that we reject the hypocrisy and nonreligious commercialism of this country, which responds to our peace prayers by shipping instruments of destruction and death to the fighting armies of Europe. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, as united nationalities who have contributed our part to the preservation of peace under the American flag and have worked for American Christianity and American civilization, appeal to all Americans with the request to join us in our efforts to have strict American neutrality enforced, not to give support to any of the belligerent powers, and to see to it that American resources are prevented from abetting the destruction mania and slaughter going on between nations with whom we enjoy friendly relations. Be it further <span class="page-break">12</span>"Resolved, That the chairman of this meeting appoint an executive committee whose job it will be to work for the enactment of a law which would provide the President with the necessary authority [to enforce neutrality], and that this committee send a copy of these resolutions to every member of the House, the Senate, and the Cabinet of the United States."</p>
   <p>O'DONNELL'S SPEECH</p>
   <p>Following the reading of the resolutions, Mr. O'Donnell made an address, the topic of which was the demand for an arms embargo.</p>
   <p>"The Irish have contributed a goodly share to the civilization and development of this country," he said, "and therefore have the right to be heard now. It has always been the policy of this nation to treat all her citizens alike, and to give comfort to the oppressed. But lately all this seems to have changed, because we can notice a hostile attitude of America against her best citizens. When war was raging in Mexico under President Diaz, and bullets were flying across the border, the United States stopped the export of war <span class="page-break">13</span>contraband to that country, thus making it impossible for the insurgents to murder their fellow citizens. This arms embargo met with general approval at that time. Then we heeded the laws of humanity, because we could not bear to see our Southern neighbors cut each other's throats. Then the Congress gave the President the power to prohibit the export of arms. Why can't it be done now, when it is so much more important? Every ship that we are loading with war materials, every gun that we sell, means further bloodshed. When the war broke out, everybody over here knew that our arms trade would benefit only England and her allies. Arms exports and neutrality are two irreconcilable things. We arm Germany's enemies, let them ride into battle on American horses, supply them with cannon, powder, and lead, and at the same time claim to be neutral.</p>
   <p>WANT TO SHOW THEIR GRATITUDE</p>
   <p>"When the Irish came to the United States from their Emerald Isle, they were considered a bunch of ignoramuses. It was said that they lived on a very low <span class="page-break">14</span>level of culture in their homeland, and that they wouldn't be much good to their adopted country. It was the Germans who dissipated this prejudice by unearthing the treasures of Old Irish literature and pointing out the beauty of the Irish [Gaelic] language. Ireland has every reason to be grateful to the Germans, and this debt of gratitude the Irish mean to repay now.</p>
   <p>"There is much talk about the violation of Belgiums' neutrality by Germany. But when, a few weeks ago, 25,000 Canadian troops, on their way to the battle front, marched through the entire state of Maine, nobody raised a complaint. There is also much talk about German militarism. Is it not strange that Americans suddenly object to it, whereas formerly they never complained about it? When our armies were wading in blood at Valley Forge, when the dispersed remnants of a defeated army followed the heroic George Washington, was it not a German, Baron von Steuben, who taught these Americans military tactics and made real soldiers out of them? Did anybody object to German militarism when the integrity of the Union was imperiled, and thousands and thousands of Germans followed the call of Abraham Lincoln? It is not German militarism that <span class="page-break">15</span>is threatening the world, but British navalism. In the name of a poor and oppressed country I say to you, put an end to British tyranny. Only when that is done will Ireland's green flag wave gaily in the breeze again."</p>
   <p>Following this address, the chairman appointed a committee consisting of Messrs. J. T. Clarke, M. L. Carmody, Peter Ellert, M. English, G. F. Hummel, J. L. Meyer, Charles Heckl, August Lueders, P. H. O'Donnell, James O'D. Storen, Joseph E. Ryan, George Landau, and Horace L. Brand, who are to take care of all further details.</p>
   <p>The third and last speaker was Henry Weismann, president of the German National Alliance of Brooklyn. He spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Never before in the history of the United States," Mr. Weismann began, "has it been more necessary for us to stand firmly together, to preserve the peace, our self-respect as a nation, and the security of our future. Before many months will have passed, the Old World will turn to us for help in this <span class="page-break">16</span>conflict which threatens to engulf the globe. The fighting is now so bitter and murderous--it is no longer a battle between armies, but between whole nations and races--that the end cannot be predicted. It is a horrible aspect that is unfolded before the eyes of those whom divine providence has still blessed with peace. But this very fact offers us an opportunity to interfere. A sacred duty is assigned us--to reconcile as quickly as possible the warring nations, to restore peace, and to save of civilization what is left to be saved.</p>
   <p>TWO IMPORTANT TASKS</p>
   <p>"Two tasks are confronting us, if we want to do this successfully: We must try to obliterate the wrong impression which certain elements are trying to create concerning Germany's responsibility for this war and her intentions in case of [a German] victory. We must insist on the observation of true neutrality on the part of America, a neutrality in letter and in spirit, a neutrality which does not aid the war efforts of either of the belligerent parties, either directly or indirectly. We must insist on strict neutrality, <span class="page-break">17</span>which would refuse to render any support to a warring power, thus making the continuance of the war impossible.</p>
   <p>"If America cannot keep her shield of honor clean from the blemish of partiality, and cannot overcome her prejudice against the Germans and their cause, she will not only fail in any eventual attempt to restore peace but, in case Germany should win the war, which seems pretty certain now, the mother country [England] will become enraged and alienated, and there is no telling the economic and political consequences, which might prove disastrous for the United States.</p>
   <p>WHAT GERMANS AND IRISH SHOULD DO</p>
   <p>"It is the patriotic duty of those of our fellow citiznes who can read the handwriting on the wall, and who are not blinded by petty prejudices, to assume leadership in this important movement. This wonderful demonstration tonight is an indicator of the course that must be followed, and shows which <span class="page-break">18</span>elements must pursue this mission.</p>
   <p>"These elements," the speaker continued, " are the German and the Irish elements in the United States, which have always fought shoulder to shoulder in all the battles for their adopted country. These two elements must take it upon themselves to fight against the anti-German prejudices which exist in this country, and which certain parties keep going by all possible means."</p>
   <p>"After describing the causes for these prejudices, which can in part be traced back to historical developments, and after making a brief comparison between Germany on one side and England and Russia on the other side, the speaker discussed the second topic of his address, namely, the maintenance of strict neutrality on the part of the United States.</p>
   <p>THE BLUNDERS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</p>
   <p>"Our country and people are being misled by false reports and the machinations <span class="page-break">19</span>of shyster diplomats in the service of the Triple Entente, who are trying to dupe our Federal Government. On behalf of Germany and her ally, and in the interest of America, we demand that all exports to Europe be stopped, with the exception of foodstuffs. Every shipload of arms and munitions which is sent to Europe under the present circumstances means aid to the Triple Entente and a continuance of the war. Our [American] assurances that we want to restore peace are pure hypocrisy, as long as we permit the export of arms and munitions to Europe. The same goes for our neutrality. Washington made a blunder in favor of England by closing the [transatlantic] wireless station in Tuckerton. Washington made a blunder in favor of England and her allies when it afforded the Belgian commission an opportunity to disseminate officially the propaganda stories of atrocities in Belgium. Likewise, when Washington refused to listen to a reply by our own [German-American] citizens, who tried to erase the bad impression which these stories had made on the American people. Washington made a mistake when it refused to come to the aid of German-American citizens whom the British had taken off neutral ships, brought to England, and put in jail. Every day Washington forgets to <span class="page-break">20</span>interfere when British warships off Sandy Hook stop and search neutral ships. Washington committed a grave error when it acted as England's policeman by demanding information from a South American country about the wireless service used by German warships. Wahsington made a great mistake when it permitted Japan, without protest, to occupy German possessions in the Pacific Ocean. Our Federal Government is making the gravest mistake right now by permitting the sale and export of arms, munitions, war supplies, trucks, cannon, horses, and barbed wire fences to the amount of two hundred million dollars, despite official German protests. These supplies will bolster the sinking morale of the other side [Allies] and prolong the bloody struggle.</p>
   <p>LASHES LLOYD GEORGE</p>
   <p>"Some weeks ago, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, Lloyd George, did something which can be considered an infringement on American independence. With typical English tactfulness, which is a hallmark of British civilization, this gentleman reminded us that we owed England five billions. That is <span class="page-break">21</span>the golden chain with which Lloyd George is trying to strangle American independence, whose shrine will then be removed from Philadelphia to Wall Street. He forgot to add that actually we owe only two hundred millions, and that the rest is British capital which is safely invested in lucrative American enterprises. These are the methods employed by men like Lloyd George, Asquith, Winston Churchill, and Grey, in order to show the world that America is espousing England's cause. To preserve our independence, we must fight now.</p>
   <p>BLAMES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</p>
   <p>"We have to ask ourselves whether we want to condone any longer the attitude of our weak-kneed State Department and President. Our over-zealous State Department had to admit that it made a mistake in the case of the Tuckerton wireless station. It had to permit the reopening of the station which, strange as it seems, immediately afterwards had to shut down again because of a mechanical breakdown.</p>
   <span class="page-break">22</span>
   <p>"I should like to refer Mr. Bryan to the Blue Books of the Monroe Doctrine, compiled by President Cleveland's Secretary of State Olney in the Venezuela case, and ask him to submit them for study to the British. Instead, he [Bryan] submits to the demands of Great Britain concerning the South American republics, and makes the State Department a stooge for British interests.</p>
   <p>AMERICA'S GOOD NAME AT STAKE</p>
   <p>"On October 4, the entire American nation, at the request of its chief executive, turned to God Almighty in prayer, to put an end to the bloody conflict in Europe. Immediately afterwards the news spread all over the country that America's factories and shops are manufacturing hundreds of thousands of instruments of death and destruction to be sent to Europe. Can anybody imagine a more shameless hypocrisy? If such a thing is possible, have not Europe's people the right to accuse us of hypocrisy, to point a finger at us, and to consider our assurances and holy speeches as pure eyewash?</p>
   <span class="page-break">23</span>
   <p>"For the sake of America's reputation, for the sake of the friendship which has united us with Germany and the German people for over a hundred years, for humanity's sake and, last but not least, to make a return of prosperity possible, which only the conclusion of the war can bring about, I myself, and millions of German-Americans in the East, join in the demand of the citizens of Chicago that Congress enact a law prohibiting the sale and export of any kind of war materials to Europe while fighting is in progress, foodstuffs being the only exception."</p>
   <p>After the audience had sung "The Star-Spangled Banner," the meeting came to a close.</p>
