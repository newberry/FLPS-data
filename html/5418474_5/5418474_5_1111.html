   <p>The priceless heritage of civilization is peace. Only in times of peace can people and nations grow strong. War only weakens and devastates.</p>
   <p>The strong alone can strive successfully to alleviate the sufferings of mankind, or to add the pleasures and benefits of living. To work for peace; to strive to maintain peace is a sign of strength, not of weakness. The world needs peace. We wish to see the world at peace.</p>
   <p>The most powerful country in the world today is the United States. Everyday that we remain at peace with the world and with ourselves, enables us to grow stronger.</p>

   <p>May our President, our Government, our people, be strong enough to initiate a movement and to carry it to a successful ending, a movement for peace. The war must end and peace again must reign over the now fighting nations of the world.</p>
