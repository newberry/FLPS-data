   <p>In these hard times which have come over Germany as well as over the German-Americans, light is very much needed. Light for us that we may recognize the way which leads to respect, and light for our adversaries so that they may be able to find the truth from the chaos of lies. And while this newspaper is honestly endeavoring to create light - light for the Germans and light for our opponents - another German newspaper made it their mission to cross our endeavors; to leave the Germans of Chicago in the dark about their own position and rights in this country and to speak a word in favor of our opponents.</p>
   <p>President Wilson has, disregarding all diplomatic usage, received the envoys of a belligerent nation, who complained about cruelties which never took place, while he at the same time showed a cold shoulder to German citizens who in all politeness requested him to preserve the neutrality of this country and not allow the hatred of foreigners to get further nourishment. Why? Wherefore?</p>
   
   <p>President Wilson permitted the Allied-inspired lies free entrance and full publication while he censored the wireless stations. After the station at Tuckerton, in a peculiar and unexplained manner got out of order and finally through the energetic intervention of Messrs. Horace L. Brand and Fred Britten again was put in order, the government decreed again yesterday that Tuckerton should be closed once more until further notice. Why? For what?</p>
   <p>President Wilson proclaimed the strictest neutrality, and even dared to prohibit the citizens of German descent from expressing our sympathies for our afflicted fatherland. He has, with unctuous mien, ordered prayers to be said for the finish of the war, but at the same time showed himself well pleased that the Allies are given every means to continue the war.</p>
