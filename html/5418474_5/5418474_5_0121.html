   <p>During the first two weeks of the present Liberty Loan campaign in Chicago, eighty-eight million two hundred thousand dollars worth of bonds were purchased. Chicago pledged itself to buy bonds of this issue of the Liberty Loan to the amount of $189,225,000. Thus the city must subscribe to $101,000,000 in bonds during this (the last) week of the campaign, or to approximately $16,838,000 per day.</p>
   <p>Is that possible? It must be done! Must be done if Chicago, if every citizen of Chicago, is to be safe. Without a doubt Chicago will subscribe to its quota within the alloted time if the people of the city know how serious the situation is--and how great the advantages which this particular issue offers.</p>
   <p>Owing to present conditions, the Secretary of the Treasury felt it necessary to direct an urgent appeal to the citizens through the press of the country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Secretary asks: "Is it possible that the American people would permit the Victory Loan to become a failure?" And he supplies the answer: "Now that the War is ended, to dishonor the nation by deserting the flag would be as unreasonable as for the nation to dishonor her people by deserting them."</p>
   <p>It was probably no easy matter for Mr. Carter Glass to issue such an appeal. That such an appeal was necessary does not add to our national prestige. The only reasonable explanation would be that there is a lack of adequate financial power--that our citizens do not have sufficient money. But that is not so. Never in the history of America has there been so much money in circulation among the masses, and never before has money been so easy to get. Again, never before has the purchase of Government bonds--the best in every respect--been made so easy; never before were prospects of an imminent business prosperity as favorable as now. And the people--the people, not the tycoons and great financial institutions--are subscribing to the Loan.</p>
   <p>An American prides himself on his business acumen, which makes it more difficult <span class="page-break">3</span>to understand the present delay in buying these securities. For, even if the wane in patriotism (of which so much has been said) can be attributed to the fact that the War is ended, it is not clear why business acumen should also subside because hostilities have ceased. Or has our knowledge also declined--the knowledge that debts incurred must be paid, and that a debtor's credit expands only if he disposes of his obligations promptly? Debts do not decrease, but rather increase, the longer payment is deferred.</p>
   <p>Just as it is incorrect to assume that our people do not have the means to buy--entirely incorrect, because the entire Loan does not amount to more than our national income for two months, whereas the Government plan allows subscribers seven months to pay--it is also incorrect to assume that American citizens are not aware of the value of the investment and the necessity of placing the Loan quickly. In all probability, indifference is responsible for the slowness in subscribing for the Loan. Our people did not even take the trouble to learn about the situation, and since the War excitement has subsided, the well-known "let George do it" spirit has again become the guiding and ruling principle.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>And we must add to these explanations the fact that private interests are advising and operating against the Loan.</p>
   <p>No person who carefully studies the situation can ward off the suspicion that a hostile force is working against the Loan in some circles, or that joy would reign in certain quarters if the Government's plan to dispose of the issue within three weeks did not succeed, because of the difficulties with which the present administration would be faced, and because later on political capital could be made of the matter.</p>
   <p>Let whoever wishes to become involved in such a scheme do so. If the scheme is successful he will find it hard later to explain his actions to the public, to his own conscience, and even to his pocketbook. Good Americans--and that includes Americans of German extraction--will not co-operate. They will not let it be said that the loyalty which they showed was forced; that they bought Liberty bonds because they had to do so; that they not only renounced their duty <span class="page-break">5</span>toward their country and themselves but also cast aside all business judgement and prudence as soon as they felt that they were no longer under compulsion; or that they worked hand in hand with those who oppose the American peace policy because this policy is a hindrance to the rapacity of their fatherlands, or because of any other selfish reasons.</p>
   <p>We are certain that our citizens of German descent will buy all the bonds they possibly can when they have learned the true nature of the situation. For then they will know that the procrastinators, the faultfinders, and the open and secret opponents of the Loan, are their worst enemies; that it is essential to their own best interests that efforts to place the Loan are successful; and that citizens of German descent should be conspicuous for their large purchases. Now is the time to show who is a genuine American and a true patriot, and who is not.</p>
   <p>The sooner the Loan is subscribed for, the more quickly peace will be effected. If the campaign should be prolonged, peace will be deferred, which would mean that the suffering and trials of the German people would be prolonged, and that <span class="page-break">6</span>the danger which threatens them would be increased. These facts, too, should be given due consideration.</p>
