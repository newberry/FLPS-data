   <p>On Monday, President Wilson addressed the following words to the representatives of the press at Washington, and thus to our people in general:</p>
   <p>"In view of the situation in Europe, it is evidently very necessary that you use all diligence to avoid increasing the alarm. For obvious reasons, Europeans are very much aroused, but this alarm should not spread to America. Some difficulties are making themselves felt in the money market and in the grain market; America, however, is equal to the demands of our time and is able to meet them without creating any disturbance. The only thing which could possibly prevent this is unreasonable fear and unnecessary alarm.</p>
   <p>"I would like to possess the proud feeling which emanates from the ability to say: Even if no other country and people has preserved its self-control, America has, and she is ready to aid the rest of the world by her calm deliberation and good judgment. And we can do this and thereby gain great and lasting honor if all of us co-operate in preventing anybody from losing his head."</p>
   <p>These are the words of a proud man, of a man who knows whereof he speaks. And they are justified. What the President said concerning the financial security of our country is true, and there can be no doubt that the fear and distrust which have appeared here and there must give way to calm deliberation, or have already been dispelled by it. The measures taken by security corporations and banks may have aroused some anxiety and suspicion, but quiet reflection should soon show that such measures are necessary precautions.</p>
   <p>That savings banks especially have availed themselves of their right to demand a certain length of time within which to satisfy requests for withdrawals is not only excusable, but also in keeping with present conditions. And, in taking recourse to such measures, the banks are intent on the interest of their depositors no less than on their own welfare, since the two are very closely related--actually, they are one. The greater the sums which are suddenly withdrawn from a bank, the weaker the latter becomes, for the nature of its business demands that a bank carry only a comparatively small amount of its deposits in cash. If it wanted to be in a position always to be able to return all money entrusted to its care, it would have to place the deposits in its vaults and leave them there until the depositors requested their money. In that case, it would not be a bank, but merely a custodian of deposits, and it would not be able to serve the business world; it could not accommodate merchants or manufacturers with loans in times of financial exigencies; nor could it pay any interest on savings accounts, but would be forced to charge a fee for acting as a custodian.</p>
   <p>This is so evident that it needs no detailed explanation, and it is just as evident that a sudden demand for repayment of a large sum of money by many depositors must have an adverse effect upon the whole financial and business structure of a bank. It can be seen, therefore, that it is in the interest of the community and of each depositor to prevent such withdrawals as much as possible, and that the system of requesting a certain length of time to refund a fairly large sum is the best means to that end, since it affords opportunity for sober reflection.</p>
   <p>The banks were right in taking such precautionary measures, just as the Government was right in permitting them to do so. They will be fully able to protect the finances of the nation. And every word that the President uttered is true, especially the statement that America's calmness and judgment can and will help the whole world. It can hardly be otherwise, since this great Republic will be called upon to alleviate the physical distress of Europe, and to put an end to Europe's war. America is especially qualified to act as a mediator during peace negotiations, and we may be sure that she will be a just mediator.</p>
