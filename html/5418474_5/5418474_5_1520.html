   <p>President Roosevelt is at present holding conferences with the Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives with regard to the bonus bill. This means, obviously, that the President has given up the fight. He defeated the bill in the last Congress after it had been passed by a big majority in the House; but he obviously sees that he cannot have his own way much longer. Many arguments have been advanced for the immediate payment of the veterans' bonus, and some of these arguments are completely sound.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, it cannot be forgotten that the Federal Government is now spending billions for the relief of the needy, so that no one need suffer, and least of all the war veterans. The immediate payment of the bonus would mean that veterans who are on relief would receive another nice little sum of money, for the bill does not specify that they are to be deprived of relief <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>upon receiving the bonus.</p>
   <p>Another fact which cannot be disputed is that the Government has already spent over fifteen billion caring for the veterans, and that it has been more generous in its treatment of veterans than any other government in the world. But all this does not change the fact that the veterans are demanding the bonus, and that most members of Congress lack the courage firmly to reject these demands. The President is not willing to be the cause of a strained situation, or to expose himself to the possibility of a defeat in Congress. Hence he is prepared to make a compromise.</p>
   <p>It is always the same story. The organized minorities get their way, and the great organized masses must pay for it. This is what they call "democracy".</p>
