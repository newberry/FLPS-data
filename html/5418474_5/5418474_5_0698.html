   <p>We used to think that the American magazines were above the level of party politics. We are accustomed, by now, to see the daily press putting party first and truth second, but we could expect the magazines, weekly and monthly, to remain neutral. The disappointment has come. If you don't know Collier's Weekly yet, and care to climb to the apex of hostility toward Germany, take Editor Sullivan as a guide up that hill which he has artifically piled up. Way on top sits that corrupter of a magazine literature, which until recently was regarded all over the world as a pleasant counterpart to the daily press. The editor of a magazine is not expected to attempt to corrupt public opinion; he is expected to exercise an objectivity, which will treat even the adversary with fairness. But you don't find that sort of thing in Collier's. There is a real hushranger at work, who poisons public opinion and the heart and soul of his readers with deliberate delight, using calumny and hatred. We'll give you a few samples of the brain activities of the Collier's editor:</p>
   <p>"Prussia and peace! Prussia has done more during the last months for the achievement of peace, than Carnegie and the Peace Society combined, not to forget Tolstoi [Russian author and idealist]. Prussia's vain attempt to terrorize her enemies has had the opposite effect, in that it has created hate against Prussian militarism." The sinking of the merchantman Falaba is called "a battle lost for the 'Fatherland'", because "she was torpedoed while the lifeboats were being lowered, and one hundred persons were killed (including one American)--murdered just for the sake of murdering. That was a decisive defeat for Germany, the consequence of which cannot today be evaluated." The baseness, to accuse the Germans of having murdered just for the fun of it, will also have incalculable consequences, or at least should have.</p>
   
   <p>Herr von Jagow's [Secretary of the German Foreign Office] reply to England's challenge makes our editor specially mad. He is angry because von Jagow accuses the British Government to have pushed Belgium into the war. He calls that "humorous mendacity" and adds: "Doesn't the Secretary of the [German] Foreign Office realize that we neutral countries are not in the mood to stand for this "slapstick comedy" which he stages at the expense of brave little nations? To insult our intelligence like that can only prove the deficient intelligence of a Herr von Jagow."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sullivan uses the plural form, for America of course, and does not understand that he himself is only a very insignificant "I", whom to convince Herr von Jagow surely never intended. That "we" are not in the mood to pull jokes or have jokes pulled on "us", we can easily believe of a choleric patient. But who in the world will pay any attention to his gray-green vaporings! We "recommend" this magazine to all and sundry.</p>
   
   <p>The latest German note has also rekindled the inexplicable hate in the daily press. In order to conceal it, a legal cloak is put around it. The entire English [language] press is indignant that Germany, in her note, tells the Americans quite unequivocally, that they are the ones who make it possible for the Allies to continue the war, by supplying them with arms and munitions. America rejects this contention in arrogant terms, but humiliatians by Great Britain are humbly swallowed. The reason? "We" are doing a wonderful business with England at present, therefore "we" have to abuse Germany to whom "we" cannot sell, in order to remain in the good graces of our English customers. That is sound "business" practice. Every day we encounter this vulgar habit of the parasites and vultures. For all practical purposes, they have already taken over Germany's trade and are growing fat from South American profits that used to flow to Germany.</p>
   <p>Not only here, but anywhere in the world, the idea prevails that "business is business". In other words, honest and sensitive people, displaying a tender or even effeminate disposition, can turn into bloodthirsty tigers when business is involved. People like that do not only have two faces, like the Janus head of Roman legend, but also two souls and two standards of ethics. Nobody can deny that the American is a fairly good-natured person. Undeserved misery touches his heart, and he never shirks his duties toward the poor. In voluntary contributions to charity, this country probably surpasses any other in the world. But where business is concerned, he shows no mercy. Business says: "We stand on moral ground if we supply the Allies with as much war material, munitions, cannon, airplanes, horses,and equipment as we can possibly produce. But after we have made our pile we go to church, Christian or Jewish, and pray to God to give us peace.</p>
   <p>It is considered an effrontery if Count Bernstorff [German ambassador in Washington] tells our government that we are about to create a whole new industry for the manufacture of lethal weapons. With the profits we have made from it, we inspire poets and artists, and pay them well to attack the savage forces now on the loose in Europe, using oceans of printers' ink for that purpose. Business justifies everything."</p>
