   <p>Under the heading "America for Americans," a certain Paul H. Burglund, writing to the Chicago Tribune, recommends that the citizenship of all citizens of German decent be revoked for the duration of the war, "to give us complete control of all offices in the country." A great idea--from the enemy's point of view! Without citizenship rights, German-Americans would, of course, also be exempted from the fulfillment of many important duties as citizens. Their sons, who are so bravely dying in France for America's cause, would be without a country; their daughters would not be admitted any longer to the Red Cross service to nurse the wounded; their wives would not do any more knitting for our boys in Khaki; and it would be doubtful if these "second-rate" citizens that are thus to be created would be allowed to purchase Liberty Bonds, War Savings Stamps and Thrift Stamps. If the foreign-born give up their former nationality and swear allegiance to Uncle Sam, he grants them full, equal, and unlimited civil rights and protects them in these rights as long as they comply with the <span class="page-break">2</span>duties imposed on them. Under the most difficult circumstances imaginable, German-American citizens have evinced an exemplary zeal for duty, and their faith in Uncle Sam's word will not be shaken by the infamous attacks of some hysterical super-patriots. Mr. Burglund, apparently of Swedish extraction, talks about "offices" which "we" then could control ourselves. May we ask to which "job" this "old Swede" thinks he has a claim?</p>
