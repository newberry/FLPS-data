   <p>Our boys are returning home. Last Saturday we welcomed a number of them on the occasion of the Appomattox celebration. All that remains is for us to pay the War bills; and this article is intended as an appeal in behalf of the Liberty Loan. We ask that you not only subscribe to the limit of your financial ability, but that you also speak a good word to others in the interest of the Victory Loan, and thus promote its success.</p>
   <p>I have been repeatedly asked why a further loan is necessary, since the Armistice was signed five months ago. The answer is simple enough: To dispose of the obligations we assumed in order to win the War. Today no one doubts that had it not been for our extensive preparations the War would still be going on, or that by now thousands of young Americans would have sacrificed their lives. Your boy, the man whose name you so proudly had inscribed on the honor roll, and from whom you parted with a smile and suppressed anxiety, might well have been listed as a casualty. Should not the fact that he returned to you in robust health persuade you to strain your resources to the utmost to help pay the inevitable expenses.</p>
   <p>There have been complaints about extravagance. It could hardly be avoided in a War machine as large as ours. One of our boys remarked: "We had an automobile factory larger than Ford's; a locomotive factory larger than Baldwin's; and our refrigeration and storage plants were larger than any others in the world. Nobody had believed that we were capable of accomplishing this, least of all the enemy, and it is probably due to the enemy's knowledge of this fact that the War was ended so quickly. These astonishing preparations, this extravagance--if it existed--was the greatest economic triumph of any nation. Thousands of lives were saved thereby. Is it not better that we pay the cost of such preparations, than that we pay a like or larger sum for war materials to continue fighting? All of us should grasp and understand this principle, and if we do, we will not only buy, but do everything in our power to recommend the Victory Loan to others.</p>
