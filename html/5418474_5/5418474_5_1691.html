   <p>May 1 is but six weeks away, but its approach is less noticeable this year than it has been in previous years. Few people will have failed to notice that unusually few "For Rent" signs are visible. But it would be wrong to consider this as proof that the inhabitants of American cities, especially of Chicago, are becoming more settled, are moving less. No, wandering from one flat to another is still the pleasure of Chicagoans. If they do not indulge in it this year as much as they formerly did, it is because of unforeseen and unwelcome circumstances. It is alleged that there is a shortage of houses. It is questionable whether or not this is true to the extent claimed for, although Chicago has enjoyed the usual increase in population during the last twelve months, it is not very likely that the increase was so large that the houses which are vacant prove insufficient. Experts set the percentage <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of increase at from twelve to fifteen per cent. Nevertheless, the profiteering which landlords began to practice shortly after the armistice, has taken on such proportions that it may well serve as a model for many a war profiteer.</p>
   <p>Rentals for stove-heated quarters are twenty to twenty-five per cent higher than they were last year, while owners or agents of steam-heated apartments are asking five to ten dollars per month more than they demanded a year ago. As far as an impartial observer can see, there appears to be no necessity for increasing rentals for old-fashioned houses, that is, houses which lack steam heat and ultramodern accommodations. On the contrary, the increased demand for so-called modern flats should lower the rents for old-fashioned houses or flats. Owing to the cessation of building activity during the war, the number of available modern houses and flats is not sufficient to supply the demands of the renting public. Anyone living in modern quarters will, therefore, make every effort, even pay more rent, in order to retain them another year.</p>

   <p>Some real-estate publications and local morning newspapers record discussions of landlords and agents concerning the widespread increase in rentals, and, in general, their arguments are valid. Taxes are higher, fuel costs more, wages of janitors have been increased, and plumbers, roofers, cabinetmakers, carpenters, etc., have climbed a few notches on the union scale. Relief from this depressing situation may be had only when building activities are resumed. In order to stimulate the latter, our Government has lowered the freight rates on building material of all kinds and has provided arrangements to give shipments of building material preference to other freight as far as time is concerned. So Chicago's renters will have to be patient until next year. We recommend that those whose raised rents are proportionate to their income look about and purchase a home in one of Chicago's suburbs. In most cases it will be found that this step is easy on the pocketbook and good for the health.</p>
