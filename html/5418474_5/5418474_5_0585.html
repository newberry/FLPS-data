   <p>The German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society of Chicago received a letter of thanks, dated Jan. 31, 1916, from a German war prisoner at Fort Kingston, Canada. Part of the letter is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Please accept my heartiest thanks for your most liberal and suitable shipment of clothing, etc. You have performed a most worthy service to your compatriots who are confined here...." [As the man so unwillingly hibernating in this northern latitude is not a Chicago German, the translation of his interesting letter is omitted.]</p>

   <p>Clothing and other items are being sent to the war prison camps through the friendly co-operation of the Ladies Aid, 160 N. La Salle Street. The good work of the society deserves generous support; particularly, tobacco in any form (cigars, cigarettes, pipe or chewing tobacco), pipes are also welcome. Further particulars may be had at the office of the Ladies Aid. A helpful member can be found there every day from 10 A. M. to 5 P. M. (Saturday from 9 A. M. to 1 P. M.) who will be glad to give any information desired. Please address, or bring all donations to the Ladies Aid, 160 N. La Salle Street, Chicago, Ill.</p>
