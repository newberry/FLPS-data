   <p>If one were to believe a certain kind of newspaper or certain plays which are now being performed, the morality and dignity of the German people must indeed have reached a low level. Are the German people supposed to have suffered sudden and complete degeneration? No, and no again, this is not true. Certain unscrupulous newspapers and the producers of these plays are primarily interested in the almighty dollar. These gentlemen speculate, successfully as always, on the base instincts of the masses. They seem to feel themselves justified in using any means, no matter how despicable, provided that it serves their purpose. The President has declared repeatedly that he respects the German people and he has also repeatedly called attention to the fact that the United States owes much to the German-Americans; furthermore the President has earnestly cautioned us not to foster hatred and so endanger the unity of the American people.</p>
   <p>Would it not be a good idea and to the advantage of this country and its citizens, if a law were enacted which made the use of the above-mentioned disreputable practices impossible? All Americans of German origin to whom the word "honor" is not an empty sound, agree that besmirching the memory of their parents and relatives, and all that is and was German, for the benefit of their present homeland, can and must not continue under any circumstances. He who sows hatred will reap discord.</p>
