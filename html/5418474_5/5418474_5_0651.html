   <p>We Americans are talking too much about right.</p>
   <p>We are insisting with great emphasis that our rights must be respected.</p>
   <p>We talk too little about our duty and scarcely ever insist that duty is a higher sense than right. We are acting the part of the swaggerer rather than that of the patriot.</p>
   <p>A continuation of this course will lead us into greater difficulty and may involve us in war.</p>
   
   <p>Our President is right; Dr. Dumba is wrong. The foreigners, whether diplomats or laborers, sojourning in the United States must obey our laws.</p>
   <p>Inciting others to break the laws of our country is illegal. Strikes are not illegal, therefore, inciting others to strike is not illegal. Walkouts as well as lock-outs are not illegal, hence inciting others to walkout or to lock-out is not illegal. If Dr. Dumba incited his countrymen, who are sojourning here, to walk out of American factories, thereby crippling their efficiency, no illegal act was committed by Dr. Dumba.</p>
   <p>Still, I say, our President is right and Dr. Dumba is wrong. For duty is a higher, a nobler sense than right. Dr. Dumba thinks it is his duty to prevent non-naturalized residents of the United States from manufacturing arms and ammunition for the allies. Americans unjustly criticise Dr. Dumba for desiring to do his duty as he sees it. But Dr. Dumba is in the United States of North America and the President of this republic has a duty to perform. It clashes with Dr. Dumba's and Dr. Dumba is wrong in insisting upon his legal rights, in defiance of the duty which President Wilson has toward his countrymen.</p>
   <p>So President Wilson is right in acting as he thinks his duty calls upon him to act.</p>
   <p>Personally I think that American citizens should consider it their duty to prevent all in the United States, except the government, to manufacture arms and ammunition, and consider it the best policy for our country.</p>
   <p>Personally I think, that President Wilson's first and greatest duty to his countrymen is to prevent involving our country in conflicts with foreign powers. Therefore, I think his first and most important duty was to inform the American people of the facts in the Dumba case and to officially inform Dr. Dumba of the facts, as President Wilson believes the facts, and to officially request Dr. Dumba to cease those activities which embarrass the President and hamper his official freedom and action.</p>
   
   <p>Personally I think, that it was somewhat hasty to demand Dr. Dumba's recall and involve our country in another crisis. But President Wilson has taken a decided stand. We all approve it. German-Americans will approve it. It is a stand for non-interference, even in a legal way, in our internal affairs by foreigners.</p>
   <p>It is a poor rule that does not work both ways. Americans may not hereafter, even in a perfectly legal way, interfere in the internal affairs of Mexico, nor of any other foreign country, without incurring the condemnation of President Wilson.</p>
   <p>It is an unjust and unenforceable rule that does work against Ambassador Dumba and does not work against Ambassador Cecil Spring-Rice. With the same promptness and equal severity, the rule now pronounced as effective, should be applied to the French, the German, the Russian, and the Italian ambassadors.</p>
   
   <p>The rule announced is - stripped of all verbiage - that it is President Wilson's duty to his country to prevent foreign diplomats, even in a perfectly legal way, interfering in the internal affairs of the United States.</p>
   <p>It is a good rule. May it be enforced against all foreign diplomats with great firmness and alacrity.</p>
