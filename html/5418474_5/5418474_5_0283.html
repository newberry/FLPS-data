   <p>The British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, declared that those men who were responsible for the war should not be allowed to go free just because they were crowned heads, but should be tried before an international court. Other British statesmen and leaders have joined in this demand and, in addition, have asked that those men also be brought to trial, who were guilty of "unspeakable atrocities toward prisoners and civilians in the occupied territory". At the same time, they declared, it will have to be ascertained to what extent the submarine commanders acted under orders which they had to obey, or to what extent they operated independently. And those that could be proved to have committed atrocities on the high seas on their own initiative should be punished most severely.</p>
   <p>That the plotters of the war should not be allowed to escape just because <span class="page-break">\2</span>they were "crowned heads" is self-evident. That the men who are under the suspicion of having plotted this war wilfully should be brought to trial is highly desirable, if not imperative, and the proposal that the case be tried before an international court seems reasonable. Before such a court, it is likely that a thorough investigation and impartial justice could be expected, which must prevail in a trial of the "men who started the war" if new and worse damage is to be avoided. Only an international court would enjoy the confidence of the masses of all peoples--including the German--who would look upon the verdict--no matter what it might be--as a just one.</p>
   <p>Friedrich Wilhelm, the former German Crown Prince, is said to have told the reporter of an English newspaper: "You English are trying, to get my father and me out of Holland. We are 'down-and-out', and my father is a broken man. Isn't that punishment enough?"--Punishment enough? That sounds like a confession of guilt. It also sounds like begging for mercy and should find an open ear with those who desire to bring the Hohenzollerns to trial, and who have the power to punish them as the men who are under suspicion of <span class="page-break">\3</span>having started the World War. It seems like a plea to those who believe that exile to a lonely island, or execution by the firing squad or on the gallows, would be a worse punishment for the Hohenzollerns than to ignore them completely by treating these formerly crowned heads like ordinary, insignificant, and obscure human beings, more or less contemptible and pitiful. There are many who doubt very much that the first-mentioned punishment would be the worst.</p>
   <p>However, the personal punishment can only be considered as a side issue in view of the main objective which the trial that has been demanded undoubtedly must accomplish, if the case is to be submitted to a great international court at which all nations will be represented. The main objective of such a trial--the immense advantage for which we can hope--should be to ascertain, beyond the shadow of a doubt, how such a horrible war could ever have been unloosed, whether the accusations made against the Hohenzollerns have any foundation, and whether they, alone, or others also, non-Germans, had a hand in fomenting and bringing this war about.</p>
   
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>That is the problem. All nations must be interested in having this problem satisfactorily solved; most of all the German people. If the trial demanded for the Hohenzollerns affords an opportunity to give a just answer to the question of who started the World War, then the German people must and will welcome this trial wholeheartedly. If a great international court investigates the atrocity accusations, the German people must welcome that chance, for the German people have suffered most of all. They have fought and bled and gone hungry because of their belief in what their masters had told them. They have been robbed of the flower of their manhood, their wealth and power, and even their good name. They long to have it made clear, and ascertained beyond a doubt, whether they really owe their great misfortune to their belief and trust in their rulers; whether they were deceived and led to the slaughter by those who pretended to take a paternal interest in them.</p>
   <p>It will be hard for them to believe it. A thorough investigation by an international tribunal will bring the truth to light.</p>
