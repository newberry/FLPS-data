   <p>"War!" At any time and in any language this word has had, and still has, a terryfing sound, full of ominous meaning. Whenever and wherever this word is pronounced, men stop in their work; laughter and conversation cease. Anxiety is reflected in people's faces, women tremble and raise their hands in protection against the spectre.</p>
   <p>"War is Hell!", said Sherman, who knew war as well as anybody, and the world agreed with him.</p>
   <p>At that, one always visualized a war made less brutal by modern civilization and international agreements and regulations. In other words, a war conducted by the military machines of the opposing states [nations]; a war not participated in by the civilian populations and not directed against them; a war <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which respected the private property even of nationals of a hostile power, where non-combattants were not only spared, but enjoyed protection. When we thought of war in our present day and age, we visualized a war like the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, but "gentler" yet, with less involvement of nonmilitary elements, with still less privations to be suffered by the civilian population.</p>
   <p>It turned out to be different. The great war, which started seven months ago, was fought right from the beginning harder than the last great war between civilized nations, and as the months passed by, it has assumed aspects quite different from the kind of warfare our generation knew, and which they had in mind when they spoke of war. What in 1870-1871 became a fact only at the later stages of the campaign, namely the participation of civilian elements, was an initial occurrence of great magnitude this time (Belgium). And what <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>seemed to be at one time entirely out of the question and which nobody would have believed possible, namely, that the civilian population of an enemy nation would not only be exposed to danger, but actually be fought, has today become a commonplace.</p>
   <p>England and her Allies today are making war in Germany's civilian population. Because they cannot prevail against German warriors, they are making war on Germany's aged and on German women and children, in order to force Germany to her knees. Their armies and navies, the only weapons which they should make use of in a manly and civilized war, cannot cope with German armed might and German courage and perseverance. Since the German soldiers are protecting their women and children, the Allies are resorting to the most despicable means, starvation, thus making a mockery out of all international humanitarian regulations. "We will starve the German people out", prominent statesmen of "Christian" and civilized" England announced some time ago, and yesterday the State Department was informed officially by the British and French ambassadors that a war of starvation against Germany has been decided upon and will go <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>into action.</p>
   <p>Germany and her Allies are to be cut off from any supplies, and from any trade with the outside world. All vessels, including those of neutral nations, which trade between European ports are to be intercepted and searched, and all goods coming from Germany, Austria-Hungary, or Turkey, or destined for any of these countries, or which might find their way there, are to be confiscated. This is not "war" in the way we knew it and understood it. This is something so vile, so heinous and contemptible that we have to find a special word for it.</p>
   <p>In the war which we knew, the rights of neutrals were carefully observed. In the horrible war of today they are trampled underfoot. If England and France carry out their program, neutral nations will have no rights any more whatsoever. This program is directed against neutrals as well as belligerents; its implementation means heavy economic losses for them [neutrals] and their citizens, who, finally may feel the pangs of starvation, too. Are the neutrals going to stand for that? Especially, is the United States, the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>greatest and most heavily affected neutral power, willing to give in to this program of desparation of the Allies and thus become equally responsible for the misery and distress that is bound to follow, American citizens not excepted? That would be unthinkable! Now for a strong word, and if that does not help, for some forceful action! Otherwise our country too will be drawn into the maelstrom and disaster will be in store for us.</p>
   <p>The night is darkest before the dawn. An augmentation of the fierceness of this catastrophe seems impossible. The end must come soon, and it seems that the United States could bring it about by a definite attitude, by saying, "Stop! So far and no further!"</p>
