   <p>Anyone who still has a drop of German blood in his veins, anyone who knows what German culture, science, and art have done for this country, anyone who knows that German Turners, especially, shed their blood and sacrificed their property in the war between the North and the South and helped in no small measure to preserve the Union--which cannot be said of any of the nations esteemed so highly by the American press at this time--anyone who knows all these things should not fail to respond to the appeal of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer Nationalbund, but should go to the Auditorium on Wednesday to add his voice to the protest against the American press, which has recently tried to belittle German civilization and force it into the background. Let us show these hypocrites what we are made of!</p>
   <p>Turners are requested to assemble in their halls and proceed to the Auditorium in a body.</p>
   <p>Heinrich Kraeft,</p>
   <p>secretary of the Illinois District</p>
