   <p>When, in January of this year, the legislature opened, it appeared that quite a lot would come of the sessions. Great tasks were to be solved. Some of the bills were approached with a fiery zeal. In the press voices were heard to the effect that a refreshing breeze was going through the legislature and that there was something to rejoice about.</p>
   <p>Then, some kind of germ must have played a trick, and the legislature was seized with paralysis. The legislators arrived on Tuesday, stretched themselves languidly at Springfield, and adjourned on Thursday. They seemed to have more business at home than in the assembly house, although the number of bills continued increasing.</p>
   <p>Pretense reigned until election day in Chicago. All ticklish problems were <span class="page-break">\2</span>put aside, and all debated in the committees was mighty little. A few special committees made inquiries. In short, one whiled away the time as well as they could.</p>
   <p>Then, of a sudden....for weeks they fought over amendment bills to the state constitution. A political battle burst into flame that assumed sharp proportions such as has rarely occurred before in the history of the state. The ruling party was not able to impose its will upon a united and determined minority.</p>
   <p>The repercussion within the 'New Deal' seems to have aggravated the paralysis. One still hears that some of the things would have to be debated over again, but June is here, and by the end of the month the legislative period is over.</p>
   <p>The preparations for adjournment are already being made, and the pending bills are to be subjected to revision by next week. There are more than 1,600 bills on the roster, but by far the largest part of them is bound to die a pleasant <span class="page-break">\3</span>death.</p>
   <p>You may shake your head and ask: "More than 1,600 bills pending? How is this possible?"</p>
   <p>That is nothing to be wondered about. The legislature must occupy itself with many things that could be decided by local governing bodies whose decisions would be much better. During the election campaign of 1932 there was much talk about home rule, but it seems that the gentlemen of the legislature cannot part with the feeling of delight over the power they exercise.</p>
   <p>Looked at it in this light, 1,600 bills are not many, for the state is large and manifold are the needs of its population.</p>
   <p>The dangerous part of it is that the really important bills are easily smothered by the small fry. The school problem of the state, for instance, has not been regulated as yet, nor the problem of permanent registration of <span class="page-break">\4</span>voters. The budget, above all, is in a very sorrowful plight. Under the law, the budget should have been presented on February 15, and it has not yet come much further than beyond the initial stage. Then, at the eleventh hour, appropriations are passed that should have been kept from the budget altogether. Thus it happens that it becomes hard to establish an orderly financial state economy.</p>
   <p>Now, the governor declares that he will call as many special sessions as are necessary to pass all important unfinished bills. But such special sessions cost money. And then, participation on the part of members of the legislature leaves much to be desired. One does not like to attend sessions in the summer.</p>
   <p>It would, therefore, be really well if, in this case, the governor were also infected by the paralysis germ.</p>
