   <p>The war committee of the Union League Club has sent a request to the Senate Committee on Military Affairs that the Congress enact a law providing for the deportation of all interned enemy aliens without giving them a chance ever to return. From various other sides too, the Senate Committee has received similar demands, and steps regarding this matter will probably be taken soon.</p>
   <p>The Club bases its demand, according to its secretary, Allan B. Pond, on the following argument: Already before 1914 German agents in this country were trying to alienate the United States from Great Britain and other countries. After this country entered the war, these agents, with the aid of the friends of the German cause, endeavored to arouse differences of opinion in this nation. The attitude of the Germans cannot be expected to change before this or the next generation and if the interned are turned loose, they can be expected to resume similar propaganda.</p>
   
   <p>In answer to a telegram to Washington,the Club was told that Attorney General Gregory will recommend to Congress the deportation of 3,500 interned aliens. Among them are many Chicagoans.</p>
