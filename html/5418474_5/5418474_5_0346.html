   <p>"Democracy" is the catchword which prevails in our public life today. During meetings, in the newspapers, and in private political talks, always the little word "democracy" is mentioned.</p>
   <p>And why not? This little word is quite momentous after all. It made us go to war and it will bring us peace as soon as autocratic Germany adopts a democratic form of government; because we are fighting for the establishment of a democratic government in Germany.</p>
   <p>And just as our armies are battling gloriously over there for this objective, so, over here, will those who can think, endeavor eagerly, by words and actions, to make the masses, and especially the German element, conscious of the necessity of this aim.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>As far as this German element is concerned, the Friends of German Democracy and the German language newspapers have started an intensive campaign of propaganda among people of German origin; and we are glad to notice that, thanks to this work, the democratic idea and the stern necessity of introducing democratic reforms in Germany with America's aid have taken deeper root.</p>
   <p>A man who listens and reads, and analyzes what he has heard and read, will ask himself the obvious question: Do our brothers in Germany desire this support?</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly this question can be answered in the affirmative.</p>
   <p>The majority of the people in Germany are, without question, democratic in their sympathies, and anxious to break with the present system of government. And it is just as certain that Germany's liberal population will gladly grasp the helping hand we are extending to smash the powers of darkness: militarism, the Hohenzollerns, and the feudal class.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But over there one may also ask the question: Who is it that wants to give us moral and material support in our fight for liberty? Who are the Friends of German Democracy? Are they our blood brothers, or are they our enemies, who aim to foster dissension among us under the cloak of friendship? We gladly accept the helping hand of a friend but no gift from the enemy, is the saying over there.</p>
   <p>And here is where my criticism begins. I follow with great interest the efforts of the Friends of German Democracy. As far as I know, the organization has held only one large meeting here in Chicago so far, and at this meeting English was spoken exclusively. I consider this a mistake.</p>
   <p>I know that the government does not prohibit the use of the German language if it serves to promote the interests of our country. As a matter of fact, the German language is used quite extensively in the Liberty Loan meetings, for example, and rightly so. The language which one has been taught by his mother leaves the deepest impression.</p>

   <p>The dissolved D. N. B. [Editor's note: This is probably the German-American National Bund] would never have attained its great membership, if the language in which it conducted its business had been English. Two thirds of all local German clubs will cease to exist as soon as the English language is the only one permitted at their meetings.</p>
   <p>The Friends of German Democracy will never boast a large membership if they suppress the German language from their meetings and literature.</p>
   <p>This organization, which could, unquestionably, have a brilliant and influential future, must be able to tell those on the other side of the ocean: "We who want to help you are blood of your blood; we understand you and your poets and philosophers, for we speak your language."</p>
   <p>An article recently published in the Abendpost, entitled: "The Fight Against the German Language," is the cause of my writing this letter.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>I am of the opinion that the German language must be preserved in this country and that, if a fight is on to abolish the German language, we must wage one to maintain it.</p>
   <p>We love America dearly, we are ready to sacrifice all we have to advance the great idea of democracy, but we do not want to be the hangman of the German language. Carl Schurz was a good American, he fought for democracy, he fought for the Americanization of America, but he did not fight against the German language.</p>
