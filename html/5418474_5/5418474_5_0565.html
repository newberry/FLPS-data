   <p>Every American loves his native country. The American of German birth loves Germany. That means he loves the meadows and the woods, the town and the village, the house or the hut where he was born. He loves the mountains and rivers and the people who were close to him, his brother and sister--and his mother, if they are still alive. And because he loves them he wants to help them. But he thinks the only way he can do that is in the way pointed out in our first article. What he cannot love is the system over there that has brought grief and misery to his compatriots. This system he means to destroy just because he still loves his native land and his blood brothers over there. It is the system of government which he would like to see smashed. His stay in America has made him realize that class rule and military authority have governed over there thus far. He knows that it is not the German people through their duly elected representatives who decide on peace or war but only the hirelings of the ruling class and of the monarchs and princes--and that even this is only a formality. He knows that the military and Junker <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>class exercised their authority in such a way that they actually could force a war whether the German people wanted it or not. And today he is more convinced than ever that this system is to blame for all the misery that the German people and all other peaceful, patient, and industrious peoples have to suffer.</p>
   <p>He is all the more convinced of it now that the democratic idea has taken hold of him. It is the democratic ideal which the American President has strengthened by his proclamations and decrees and which is inspiring not the American people alone but all civilized nations of the globe. By means of this democratic idea, the lofty goal desired by all peoples--lasting peace on earth--will be reached.</p>
   <p>The American citizen of German descent wants to elevate his blood brothers on the European continent to this high democratic standard. He wants them to understand what America is fighting for today and what her war aims are. He would also like to make clear to them what President Wilson has made clear to the American people but what was concealed from the German people, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>namely, that America has taken up arms against the German Government, the obsolete system, the military autocracy, but not against the German people; that it wants to destroy the former but not the latter; that it has not entered the war for material gains or to conquer. If the German people would only realize this they would overthrow their present system of government and destroy those who keep them in subjection and they could have peace tomorrow. But if they wish to go on being fooled and to keep on fighting for the ancient system, the end of the catastrophe is not in sight. Then we can expect the worst that could happen, a fight to extinction not only against the German Government but also against the German people, and the end would be terrorism as we see it today in Russia.</p>
   <p>With the entry of the United States into the war the outcome could not be doubted. This has been emphasized in all American newspapers, including this one, which contained a long article in September, 1917, devoted to proving conclusively this theory. But the German people were kept in ignorance of the true state of affairs. Otherwise they would have seen the handwriting on the wall and in their own interest would have urged an <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>immediate peace. They were made to believe that certain victory on the battlefield could be gained before the Americans were able to make their appearance. They were kept in the hope that Paris would be captured, as if this feat, even if it were possible, would decide the war; and they hoped this even after America had declared that she would fight on until democracy was made safe in the civilized world. The German people were made to believe that America was so completely unprepared that she could never build up an army and that even if she did, it could never be transported to Europe. Even smaller sized American units could not be maintained on the European continent, since they could never be supplied with the necessary provisions, to say nothing of the necessary munitions and equipment. The submarine would certainly insure victory and if ever any contingents of untrained American troops should appear on the battlefield, they would be annihilated. In this manner the German people were deceived and cheated. If some voices were heard among them, saying that America, with her inexhaustible resources, would in the end cause Germany's defeat, the deceptive propaganda knew no bounds. These warning voices were told that against America the fight had to be carried on to the very last, for <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>America desired nothing less than the complete destruction of Germany. How stupid! But the German people believed their deceivers and rulers, and the troops that were doomed to die were encouraged time and again to attack.</p>
   <p>They became the victims of the insane delusions or grandeur which possessed their masters. It was these same delusions which claimed the terrible human sacrifices this summer. The rulers wanted to save their dynasties. When, during the last offensive of the Army of the Crown Prince (which ended so miserably, since Americans had entered the fight) the Marne was reached and crossed at various points, the German Emperor sent a telegram to the German Empress about "the great victory which Wilhelm (the Crown Prince) had won and how splendidly Fritz (Eitel Fritz) had carried on with his troops". This telegram, which was published, was, of course, intended for the consumption of the patient German people, still trusting after all these years of suffering. The Kaiser did not consider the victims but only the maintenance of his dynasty. There were also reports about Rupprecht's [Translator's note: Crown Prince of Bavaria] "victories": another dynasty had to be made safe. But the most disgusting thing occurred afterwards. No sooner was the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>failure of the offensive realized and the German people aware of it, than Wilhelm and Rupprecht journeyed home and had their press agents declare that they themselves had objected to the offensive from the beginning, but had been unable to prevail against Hindenburg and Ludendorff [Translator's note: field marshal and quartermaster general of the German armies.] If the strategists and troops of a monarchy have won a victory, the princes get the credit; if they meet with defeat the generals rightfully in charge get the blame! What a farce!</p>
   <p>Americans have realized that for a long time. And the American of German descent would like to make this clear to his race brothers over there. He would like to induce them to shake off the yoke themselves before others have to do it for them, causing untold misery for both sides concerned. He would like the German subject to shake off this spirit of subjection and do some-thing on his own accord, thereby helping to secure peace for this world.</p>
