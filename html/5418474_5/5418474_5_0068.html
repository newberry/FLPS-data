   <p>The organization of World-War Veterans celebrated its annual harvest festival last Saturday in the rooms of the Swiss Clubhouse. The attendance was quite good, and the event proved once again that the organization always offers its guests and comrades leisurely and good entertainment.</p>
   <p>A truly gay mood was created by the presentation of the picnic films of the last few years by Comrade K. Schwertfeger. The splendid music made the guests dance; it was furnished by Comrade R. Honigmann Jun, and was well played. Everyone enjoyed the good drink, which was in abundance, and remained in an easygoing, harmonious mood until the early morning hours.</p>
   <p>The festival committee, under the direction of its president, Otto Schwark, spared no time and effort in providing a few gay hours for all guests. The organization is to be congratulated on this celebration. It is expected that the veterans of the World War who have not joined the Society of German World War Veterans will do so soon.</p>
