   <p>The above quotation is one of those catch phrases that are used by the dozen. Some people earn fame by coining phrases like that and the "World's Greatest Newspaper" puts the afore-mentioned motto in bold type over its editorial page. In spite of the danger of being considered poor patriots, we nevertheless regard the famed words of Mr. Decatur, whose political wisdom is probably thought supreme, as a rather hasty and superficial statement.</p>
   <p>An analytical test will show that Mr. Decatur has shot way off the mark; that he borrowed from an ancient idea, but did not bother much to preserve his reputation as a logical thinker. Regardless of the fact that neither "my" country or any other man's country can do right or wrong as such, the political moral that is taught here is an assault against our birthright.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>A country per se cannot do wrong. Maybe a nation could be right or wrong and would have to account for its deeds to other nations, as the case may be. But in all those cases where it becomes compulsory to stand by one's country, "right or wrong", only a handful of people determine what is right and what is wrong. The "country" has no control, and the people have very little control, over the course of events.</p>
   <p>As soon as the relations between Germany and America became somewhat strained, a certain kind of people employed by the political yellow press got busy to find out from German-Americans just what they would do in case Germany became involved in war with the United States. Not all German-Americans are clever diplomats. Many well-known hyphenated patriots fell for this question and answered in the spirit of the above-mentioned quotation.</p>
   <p>In this case the question was, whether the German-born American citizen would fight for Germany or for America. Without batting an eye, the <span class="page-break">3</span>immediate reply was "For America!" Now the essential thing here is not the fighting but, for the time being, who wants the fight and who would start it. We can very well appreciate a position where one would not be able to fight for lack of a ligitimate cause. Is it not a man's duty to find out on whose side is right, before deciding to fight? How, then, can anybody bleat out the answer, "I shall fight for this country!"? This is commonly called patriotism, when in fact it betrays nothing but thoughtlessness. It is like falling head over heels into a trap, just to dissipate any cheap suspicion that a German-born citizen was no American patriot! And is this such a terrible indictment? Did the Germans expect from foreigners, who lived in Germany at the beginning of the war, that they display the same degree of patriotism as native Germans? Not at all! Because that is simply impossible. To experience genuine patriotism [for America] one would have had to be born here, have gone to school here, because these are the prerequisites for a successful assimilation of the foreign-born and their offspring.</p>

   <p>And if the motto "My Country, right or wrong" is supposed to be the supreme patriotic formula, then patriotism seems altogether finished! Only he is a real patriot, who keeps his country--his land and his people--from committing a wrong, not he who supports a wrong. The men at the helm in Washington should steer the ship of state clear of the reefs, and if things should come to a head with Germany, it is our opinion that the crisis would be hatched in the State Department.</p>
   <p>Nobody could claim that Germany wanted a conflict with the United States. What has happened so far is the direct consequence of deliberate or inadvertent committments by our Secretary of State, seconded by an irresponsible jingo press, which forever has been accusing Germany of having designs on America.</p>
   <p>Taking all this into consideration, it would constitute a moral weakness on the part of German-born Americans to fall for this "My Country, right or wrong" stuff. On the contrary, the men in power should be made to understand <span class="page-break">5</span>that it would take a really worthwhile and absolutely legitimate cause for German-born Americans to fight against their blood brothers. We want to go on record with this, notwithstanding the loyalty which we owe our adopted country. If this standpoint, which the German-Americans will eventually assume, should be branded as disloyal by our native superpatriots, we want to reply to them that it is entirely up to our Washington diplomats to avoid complications which would put us in a ticklish situation.</p>
   <p>We have a thousand and one reasons less than any other nation to come into conflict with Germany. And if the premise is wrong, the conclusion must be wrong too. Otherwise, the question itself is a tactless one, and should be treated as such.</p>
