   <p>"Hehler und Stehler" - a headline alluding to a proverb which says that he who receives stolen goods is as guilty as he who stole them. Schurz Westliche Post has suspected the motives of Mr. Raster in his ferocious attacks on Schurz, at the moment when Schurz was uncovering the infamy of the arms trade. Raster explains his fury in the same editorial. He calls the editors of Schurz' paper "spiritual eunuchs" and "little poisonous toads who have in their heads, instead of a brain, only a gall bladder" - by saying that "the hypocritical fence who poses as accuser of the thief arouses in us as much indignation as contempt."</p>
   
   <p>In spite of all that Schurz has said about his efforts to stop the secret arms trade, the fact remains that he shamefully neglected his moral duties as a senator, not to speak as a representative of the German-Americans, as the papers that fawn upon him like to call him. (The Illinois Staats Zeitung follows up its own editorial by reprints from the Freie Zeitung in Newark, N. J., and the Daily National Republican, and by a letter from a "prominent German Democratic leader" in the East. All attack Schurz for his belated action against the arms trade, accuse him of cowardice, make him responsible for the death "of thousands of our decent countrymen" and for having thwarted the will of the German-Americans).</p>
