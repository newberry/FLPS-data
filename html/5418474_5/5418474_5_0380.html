   <p>The Committee on Public Information, at the request of the Federal government, has recently published a small pamphlet which contains an official account of the German plots in the United States, dating back from the time when this country was still neutral. According to this account, the German government has spent not less than from fifteen to twenty million dollars to further these plots. Court records have revealed that German influence has corrupted labor leaders and caused strikes in munition factories; that German agents have destroyed merchant ships and their cargo by hiding bombs in the hold while the vessels were lying in American ports; that they have perpetrated plans for the destruction of canals and railroads; that the movement for the prevention of munition shipments was financed by German sources; that professors as well as travelling orators and newspapers, all paid by Germany, attempted to mislead public opinion in this country; that <span class="page-break">\2</span>German reservists went into foreign countries with false passports; that German sea raiders were equipped in American ports; and that Germany had a hand in the attempts to direct uprisings in India and Ireland from the United States.</p>
   <p>In spite of its connection with these dirty affairs, which was tantamount to a violation of American neutrality, the German government thought it advisable, in a statement to the American press made in December 1915, to deny any participation in these acts. The statement read: "It is self-evident that the German government has never knowingly supported any person or group of persons or any society or organization that attempted to promote the German cause in the United States by means of illegal acts, incitement to violence, disregard of laws, or by any other methods which would tend to offend the American people in their pride or to curtail their sovereignty!" The pamphlet proves that this declaration does not conform to the facts, for the government in Washington, after the outbreak of the war and even before that time, had gotten hold of official documents which easily prove the opposite to be true. Court discussions have revealed, furthermore, that the <span class="page-break">\3</span>number of persons involved in these plots was considerable and that it was not at all limited to native Germans residing here but also included quite a number of American citizens and other nationals. Many of those suspected or found guilty of these neutrality violations or plots have already been sentenced, while in some cases trials are still pending.</p>
   <p>All these things, which should be brought to the attention of every American citizen of German origin, are printed in detailed fashion in the pamphlet. It explains better than any thing else the rapid increase in the resentful attitude toward Germany during the period when our country was neutral, and the determination not to conclude any peace with Germany until the German people have turned their system of government into a democracy. For it would be hard to believe that a democratic government would violate international law and custom in a similar manner. The sources which Professor E. E. Sperry of Syracuse University and Professor Willis M. West of the University of Minnesota have used are the records of the Department of Justice and the court records of the New York, Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco trials. Copies of the pamphlet will, on request, be sent by the Committee on Public Information without charge.</p>
