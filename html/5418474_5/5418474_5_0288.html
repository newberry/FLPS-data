   <p>Mr. James R. Mann, Representative of the Second (Chicago) Congressional District of Illinois and long-time Republican leader in the House of Representatives in Washington, declared last Tuesday: "The Republicans will make no concerted attempt to hinder the President while he is 'over there'. By that I mean that the American people would not have any sympathy for any attempts to belittle or criticize the President while he is absent on such an important errand. I, personally, have no patience with any of the resolutions, regarding the absence of the President which have emerged in the Senate and in the House. I cannot help what single members in the House are determined to do, but certainly none of the Republican members of the House will do anything to embarrass the President or to hinder him in any way, as long as he is engaged in the solution of a problem which is of such great importance for the American people. I think Congress should give him support as far as those <span class="page-break">\2</span>interests are concerned and I am of the opinion that party politics should not be permitted to interfere with the fulfilment of his great task or to give the rest of the world the impression that the American people are of divided opinion in these questions which involve the peace of the world."</p>
   <p>The circumstances which caused this statement of Mr. Mann must be known if one is to appreciate its full significance and to give him due credit for it. For ordinarily it should be a matter of course that all members of Congress, regardless of party affiliations, like all good citizens, stand united behind the President when he leaves the country on such an extraordinary and important mission. But one should know what kind of reception the President was given when he appeared before Congress, on the day before his departure, to speak before the representatives of the people about his plans and ideas, as far as he deemed it advisable under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>All nations, whether friend or foe, declared themselves willing to make peace on the basis of those conditions, clearly and distinctly promulgated by the President, and European statesmen of all nationalities demanded his personal <span class="page-break">\3</span>participation in the Peace Conference as "indispensable for the conclusion of a just world peace." The President had decided to comply with this demand and, on Monday, appeared before the Congress to make a formal announcement. One would think that under the circumstances the representatives of the people would give him a rousing ovation of a kind never before accorded a mortal--but in reality the majority remained cold and indifferent and intent only on showing the President, by their hostile silence and gestures, their disapproval of his great decision. As the President's supporters, exasperated by the cold attitude of the majority, burst into applause from time to time, the faces of the others became still more hostile and leering. "It was the most depressing hour that I have ever witnessed in an American Congress," writes an old Washington correspondent. It should have been the most solemn in all the history of the body which represents the American people!</p>
   <p>Later on, as the Senate and the House were again working separately for the "welfare of the country," both houses proposed bills, which expressed, in a brutal manner, bitter enmity toward the President and--so it seems to us-- <span class="page-break">\4</span>showed an alarming lack of loyalty, patriotism, and good Americanism. And another thing! A Senator--Senator Sherman, who also claims to be a representative of the people of Illinois and, unfortunately, has to be considered such--found it necessary to make the following comment regarding the President's trip abroad: "It is known that the history of nations has been changed by the kiss of a sensuous woman." This was supposed to serve as a basis for the assertion, "In Europe, the whole American atmosphere, which should surround him, was lost for the President." And to crown this effrontery, he concluded: "We should not lead him into temptation."</p>
   <p>The President has left--the spiteful, discordant cackling still ringing in his ears. The great "colonel," [translator's note: Apparently a reference to Colonel House, Wilson's closest adviser during the World War]--"America's greatest tribune of the people and unofficial leader" could not refrain from giving the President his instructions on the day of departure. Through the press of the country, which lies at his feet, he told him, that "the British <span class="page-break">\5</span>Empire absolutely must have the largest navy in the world" and that "we should ungrudgingly grant it the right to a superior fleet." He further told the President that "the Britons should, of course, keep the colonies they had annexed," that his (the President's) "Fourteen Points" were no good and hardly worthy of attention and that, out of a thousand American soldiers, not one had ever heard of them. The "colonel" told the President of the United States that if he had to go over there, he should go, but only to say yes and to give his blessing to everything the "others" might decide and that he should by no means "play the part of an umpire". He instructs the President to interpret the words, "freedom of the seas," in such manner that England's rule over the waves would in no way be infringed upon, just in case she found it necessary to invoke it at some future occasion. In short, the colonel has the crust to tell the President of the United States he should forget about defending America's glory and interests, and the welfare of all nations, but should first and always bear Britain's interests in mind, put his signature under England's demands, and thereby become a traitor to himself and to American sentiments.</p>

   <p>Republicans who talk and act like our James R. Mann, are good Republicans and good Americans. The others may call themselves whatever they want, but good Americans they are not. And they do not deserve to be called good Republicans.</p>
