   <p>As our Washington correspondent is in a position to inform us, President Wilson has, in regard to the resolution accepted here last Tuesday, observed that it is not in his power to prevent the export of war materials. It is only too well known that the president has no law at his disposal to hinder the export. The object of the mass meeting was to create such a law and the burning question is how President Wilson is going to conduct himself towards this plan. At this moment there can be no shirking. The administration as well as Congress will have to own up openly as to their theory about the neutrality of this country whereby war material can be exported, and it is regrettable that the fact that only Germany's enemies may take advantage of it satisfies them, or to take into consideration the fact that an export of war materials is taking place in spite of the possibility of equal treatment of all parties, was excluded from the beginning........</p>
   <p>And if nothing else was gained through the resolutions of the Chicago mass-meeting but only to compel the administration to declare its position, a <span class="page-break">\2</span>great deal has been achieved. The uncertain behind-hand excuses as to the intrenched position of our government are degrading and as we would like to convey the sympathy of this country to the just cause of Germany we would prefer an open, honest partiality towards England against Germany by which England profits - in place of a conduct, totally lacking in energy.</p>
   <p>We find it explainable that President Wilson as an American citizen sympathizes with England.........The historian Wilson should not allow that the conception "nation" should be misinterpreted even if he might wound his own heart by doing so. An American "nation" is only in formation and it can not be made to appear certain that Anglo-Saxon ideas were giving it form and character.......Be it as it may, the fact cannot be denied that those who consider themselves as exclusive Americans take it for granted that they must fulfill national duties towards England.</p>
