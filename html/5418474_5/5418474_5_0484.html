   <p>The following letter and contribution received by Mrs. Eitel to swell her fund towards the purchase of the ambulance for the Red Cross in Stuttgart, Germany, gives ample testimony of our Swabians' sympathy towards Mrs. Eitel's efforts!</p>

   <p>The father is a Swabian who served in the Wuertembergian Army and he has a <span class="page-break">2</span>number of relatives who are now fighting in the war; one of them died recently for the fatherland.</p>
