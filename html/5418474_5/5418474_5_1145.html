   <p>At their annual picnic in Brand's Park yesterday, the Allied Irish Associations appealed to the American Government and the American people to give Germany and the German cause a fair deal in the present war. They asked the Federal Government to lift the ban imposed on the [German transatlantic] wireless stations and to restore the right of their unrestricted operation; they asked the American press to give impartial accounts of the war news and the German cause, and the American people to use fair judgment in evaluating the German claims. These resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, showed unmistakably that Germans and Irish have one thing in common--the enmity against England--and therefore should stick together. This sentiment of solidarity, of justified opposition against a common foe, found expression in the addresses of the speakers and in the attitude of the huge throng which filled the park. One could hear it all over. When James T. Clarke, president of the Allied Irish Associations, made the first speech and pointed out that the Irish in this country, in their long <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>struggle for "Home Rule" in Ireland always could count on the active support of the Germans over here, and that it would be an act of ingratitude on their part not to stand by the German people in their fight for independence, a storm of applause arose. Another storm of applause broke loose when the speaker declared: "We can never obtain 'Home Rule' for Ireland, unless another power first humbles England and the English, and only Germany can do that."</p>
   <p>About twenty thousand people had gathered at the picnic which is held every year in memory of the battle at Yellow Ford in 1598. Germans were present at the gathering where it became known that the Irish would declare themselves in favor of Germany in the present war. All over the grounds the green flag of Ireland with the golden harp was displayed along with the black, white, and red flag of Germany, and over the entrance the German banner waved proudly next to the Irish. Many a son of the Emerald Isle wore the German colors beside the emblem with the golden harp in the green field, and many a German displayed a green band with the inscription "Erin Go Braugh" in addition to the colors of his native country. Hundreds of members of the Schwabenverein were present and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the German-American National Bund was represented by many members under the leadership of President Ferdinand Walther. In addition to the members of these associations, other Germans had come by the thousands.</p>
   <p>The resolutions by which the Irish expressed their sympathy for the German people read as follows:</p>
   <p>"Having witnessed the war disaster in Europe, we direct our thoughts in gratitude and humility to our home and adopted country, America, whose aim is not conquest, but only peaceful endeavor. We appreciate now the wisdom of George Washington's advice, warning of alliances with foreign nations. With the aid of our German fellow citizens we have fought successfully against the conclusion of any alliances, in whatever form they have been proposed. As long as the Republic clings to the ideals proclaimed by the founding fathers, the Irish people, who have been leading the struggle for independence, and who, during war and peace, have always worked for the maintenance of that independence, will remain America's staunchest defenders.</p>

   <p>"The Irish people take great interest in the gigantic struggle of nations which is now raging in Europe. In a war between England and Germany it is clear where their sympathies lie. Opposition against the British overlords is second nature to every Irishman; it has been handed down from father to son during the long years when his homeland was exploited and suppressed. On the other hand, the greatness and the splendid character traits of the German people have always won the admiration of the Irish people. Germany is the homeland of music, art, and science. Her cultural achievements and her civilization are known throughout the world. Centuries ago, Irish friars brought the German people Christianity and the rudiments of education. Today German scientists are saving the treasures of Irish literature from oblivion, and reviving the Irish language. The Associated Irish Societies have always worked hand in hand with the German population of Chicago. The German-Irish Bund is a manifestation of common objectives. This country owes its German citizens a lot. Germany has given this country generously of her substance. It is only natural that now, when their brothers across the sea are fighting against powerful enemies for the integrity of their race and nation, our hearts sympathize with them in their loyalty and devotion <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>to the land of their fathers. We join them in their demand that the Federal Government in Washington, permit the unrestricted transmission of wireless messages in their demand to the American press to publish the truth about the German cause in this war, in their demand to the American people to judge them fairly."</p>
   <p>The case of Germany was presented by H. O. Lange, president of the Germania Maennerchor in the following address which was repeatedly interrupted by loud applause:</p>
   <p>"I have always respected people who have not blacked out the memory of the land of their fathers, the land of their racial origin. Just like you, we Germans happily recall our old country, recall the time we spent there; and we hope that our children after us will not forget it, that they may learn why we were proud to be Irishmen or Germans. One thing the German and the Irish race have in common. Both races are pure. As far back as the first historical records of the Irish race are available, they alone have inhabited Ireland, free from all <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>mixture with other races. The Irish language is an original language, free of any alien forms. The same can be said of the German language. It grew together with the people who used it, who created it in the impenetrable forests where they lived when the Romans first discovered them. But even in many other respects the German and Irish people have things in common. We love music. We loathe hypocrisy. We are glad to be alive. We candidly display our loves and our hatreds. We are not afraid nor ashamed to show our emotions or to shed a tear for a friend.</p>
   <p>"For more than a century the Irish people have tried to establish a government of and for the Irish. I can well understand why an Irishman, looking back on all the years since the time when Henry the Eighth first invaded and claimed Ireland for himself, looking back on all the tribulations suffered at the hands of a brutal and arrogant enemy, will double up his fist, why his blood begins to boil.</p>
   <p>"In Germany we find the same struggle of the people for their ideals. For <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>hundreds of years the German people have hoped and waited for a united fatherland. It was not so long ago that our young people were thrown into jail because they dreamt of a united Germany and thus threatened the existence of potentates who had the country divided up among themselves for their own benefit.</p>
   <p>"The same was true of Ireland. Men were sentenced for standing up for their ancestral right, which was that a people should be allowed to govern themselves according to their own desires. It seemed that the goal was close at hand, that the bill for home rule would be adopted by the British Parliament. But out of a clear sky came this terrible war. Intentionally I have used the expression 'it seemed'. You are dealing with a foe who has but one policy, and that is his own interest. Justice, honesty, and idealism are alien to him. He tried to rule this country in his own interest without the least regard for human rights. When the colonies protested against British tyranny, the English brought mercenaries over here just to prove that the American people had no rights of their own which need be respected. The American people had to struggle for six years before they could throw off the British yoke. In 1812 the English tried again <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>to invade our country. They burned defenceless cities to ashes, but in the end were licked again. During the Civil War they turned their freebooters loose on us. To avoid further bloodshed, we agreed to a settlement of the controversy by arbitration, and they had to pay us an indemnity. That was the so-called Alabama case. Now we have become great and powerful. They are not trying any longer to show off in their arrogant and masterful manner. Now they are wooing us and are only too willing to do our bidding. Now they are bragging to the world about their big brother across the seas. Do you want to be considered their brothers? I don't. And I know you don't either. May the day never dawn when this great and free American people, representing all races, will be abused and exploited by our hereditary enemy for his own selfish purposes.</p>
   <p>"The first man and the first government to recognize this great and free people after its war of liberation from England, was Frederick the Great of Prussia, the ancestor of the man who is now leading the German people in their fight for civilization and a better Germany, against the savage hordes of Russia. Russia cannot be regarded as a Slavic country in the true sense of the word. The Poles <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>are Slavs but hate Russia. They are not of the same race as the Russians. The Russia which is responsible for this terrible war is the Russia of the descendants of the Huns, the Tartars, and the Mongols, who have ruled the Muscovite country for centuries and left a semi-barbaric people. Is the Cossack a Slav? Ask the Poles. Cossacks are Asiatics, Tartars, Huns, foes of all culture and civilization. In my opinion they can never become civilized.</p>
   <p>"Nobody believes that Russia would have started the war if she had not had the assurance of Great Britain's support, and such is the case. Why has Great Britain done this? Great Britain and Germany are the two most highly developed countries in Europe, linked by bonds which should inspire countries like that to co-operate and strive for higher achievements. Two peoples, who since time immemorial had never had a quarrel with each other, whose armies have fought side by side in many a bloody battle, are now arrayed against each other for deadly combat, to smooth the path for the barbarian hordes of the Muscovite empire. Is it envy which has motivated England to take this step? Is it guided by the desire to destroy German commerce and German industry? What is Germany <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>supposed to do? Her soil cannot support her seventy million inhabitants; it is not fertile enough. They have to work with their hands and sell their products in order to make a living. Is it a crime if seventy million produce as much as forty million (sic)? What are the seventy million to do? Remain idle and starve so that England can remain the greatest commercial power?</p>
   <p>"We all realize that our first duty is to the United States. American citizens of German and Irish descent have always been ready to sacrifice their lives and fortunes for the Stars and Stripes. This will always remain so. We know we cannot interfere in this war in favor of any of the belligerents.</p>
   <p>"We Germans ask for fairness. We ask that you will ponder carefully before reaching a verdict on the justice of our cause or forming an opinion from the daily newspaper reports. Do not forget that all news is reported by one side only. I wouldn't know to whom we could better appeal for justice than to the Irish and their descendants. Nobody can prophesy how this war is going to end. But I can assure you that we Germans are firmly convinced of our final victory.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>We'll have to win. We are fighting with our back to the wall.</p>
   <p>"We are fighting for an existence worthy of human beings, just as you have done for hundreds of years. We Germans feel that we have a special right to appeal to you, to ask for your good will and for fairness. When Germany was still a pagan country, art and literature flourished in Ireland. You were a Christian people when our forebears still worshipped heathen gods in the dark forests. It was your Boniface who brought the gospel to us. He sacrificed his life for it but today he is considered one of the great men in the early history of our people. We Germans hate nobody. We enjoy life as much as you do. We want to live the way we like without infringing on the rights of others. As I look at you I am convinced that I have not appealed to you in vain, that I can go back to my German brethren and tell them of your good wishes in this terrible conflict and that the Irish will do us justice."</p>

   <p>A warning of British perfidy was sounded yesterday by Peter J. Ellert, president of the German-Irish Bund at the anniversary of the Fort Dearborn Massacre of 1812. The address was made on the occasion of a memorial service when a huge laurel wreath was laid down at the monument erected in memory of the victims. He pointed out that the United States' experiences with England had all been unpleasant, and he declared that the American people had no reason to go to bat for the English.</p>
   <p>"Now, at the time when so much sympathy is being wasted on England," he said, "it behooves us to point out the many hostile steps taken by the English Government against our Republic, which was then still in its infancy."</p>
   <p>Quoting from the messages of President Madison, Ellert proved that the British never missed a chance to turn against the young Republic and to harm it if they could. He declared that the moral responsibility for the massacre and slaughter of innocent women and children belonged to England. At the conclusion of his speech he said:</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>"In the name of the German-Irish Bund of Chicago, I lay down this wreath in memory of the men, women and children who perished 102 years ago today, victims of British perfidy and betrayal. Let us always remember that."</p>
