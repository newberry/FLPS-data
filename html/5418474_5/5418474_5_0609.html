   <p>The heroic deed of Lieut. Berges and his brave men, who regardless of the danger, brought across the ocean the captured British liner "Appam" to Norfolk, Virginia, aroused enthusiasm for the German Fleet wherever Germans live. It was one of those outstanding accomplishments during the war which will go down in history, with the exploits of the "Emden," "Karlsruhe," etc. This is ample proof that bravery is one of the characteristics of the German sailor.</p>
   <p>This spectacular feat has been received with merited acclaim by our Chicagoans of German descent, and the suggestion to reward these men, who surely suffered privations during their perilous journey, has struck a most responsive chord, if the contributions which have been sent to the Abendpost are any criterion.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost gladly accepts donations for these heroes, whose unique achievement fills every Teuton with pride. We shall print a daily account of such sums in this column. As we are uncertain just how long our German Blue Jackets will remain in America, it is imperative that those who wish to contribute, please do so promptly.</p>
   <p>The total receipts as of today are, $159.50.</p>
