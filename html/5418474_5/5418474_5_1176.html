   <p>The expressions of German affection and loyalty which rang throughout the Auditorium last night will not only resound throughout the United States, but also throughout the Teutons' native land beyond the Atlantic. Called upon to protest against the slanderous lies spread by the Anglo-American press, vast numbers of Chicago Germans and their descendants, men and women from every class, assembled to testify to their great and undying love for their fatherland, and to pledge unstinted support during the most trying times of Germany's entire history. Anyone privileged to witness the great enthusiasm reflected on all faces, and evidenced by the repeated roars of applause, anyone who took notice of the solemn earnestness displayed by the great throng must be convinced that Chicago's Germans are completely united; that they sympathize deeply with their greatly distressed brothers and sisters abroad; and that they are firmly resolved to render every possible aid.</p>
   
   <p>The orchestra had barely finished playing when Mr. Ferdinand Walther, president of the Chicago district of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer Nationalbund, and chairman of the meeting, ascended the rostrum and addressed the assembly as follows:</p>
   <p>"Compatriots, ladies, and gentlemen! It affords me great pleasure to greet you in the name of the Deutsch-Amerikanischer Nationalbund and to assure you that I am grateful for your splendid attendance. It is the duty of everyone present to remain quiet, to refrain from any loud emotional outbursts of pleasure or displeasure. Again I thank you for coming in such great numbers. I now have the honor of introducing to you the first speaker of the evening, the Reverend Alfred Meyer."</p>
   <p>Reverend Meyer spoke as follows: "The die is cast. The dark clouds of war which have been hovering over Europe for years are now discharging their contents. The storm, terrible in its fury, devastating countries and murdering men, has been unleashed. The first bolt of lightning struck in a small corner of the Balkans, when the bullet of an assassin struck the heir to the throne of Austria. Its thunderous blasts resounded in the Urals, and re-echoed in the distant Vosges and across the English Channel. And our dear native land is in the center of the storm's path!</p>
   <p>"We shudder, we are horrified, shocked to our innermost being, for this storm will develop into a hurricane such as the world has never before experienced. And our beloved Germany is in its path! War! War! What a terrible word! Wanton destroyer, hell-born fiend! And such a war in the heart of civilization, fought with the terrible weapons of modern times! May God graciously preserve us from it!</p>
   <p>"Was there no other way out? Was it absolutely inevitable? Could not the strong man in the heart of Europe, Wilhelm the Second, the Protector of Peace, have averted it?</p>
   <p>"Dear friends, if you agree with the propaganda of the American press and its representatives, you will answer in the affirmative with a voice loud, bitter, and full of hatred. 'Yes,' they say, 'it was within the power of Emperor Wilhelm to avert the war. But he did not want to. He sought war. It is he who is extinguishing the light of civilization with an iron hand; it is he who has plunged Europe into misery. He alone is to blame. Has he not declared war against Russia? Did he not permit his army to invade France? He and the German nation must bear the responsibility for the horrors of the conflagration which has engulfed Europe.'</p>
   <p>"Such is the indictment published by nearly every American newspaper.</p>
   <p>"That is a grave accusation! If it is true, what a responsibility indeed! How can the Emperor ever possibly justify himself in the eyes of Germany and before the Lord of Hosts, who is a stern judge, and who always defends the innocent against the wily attacks of evildoers?</p>
   <p>"In the opinion of the American press there is no doubt as to who is innocent and who the evildoer. England is declared 'not guilty,' is said to have made every effort possible to preserve peace. France too, they aver, is blameless, and Russia, too, since the Emperor of Germany declared war on her just because she went to the aid of Serbia.</p>
   <p>"However, we American citizens of German descent do not credit what we read in the English language publications. We know that they are spreading lies. That is why we protest. That is why we demand that the 'other side' be heard by the American press. We demand justice, fairness, and truth, and no more--no favors, no special privileges; we, make our demands because we are an integral part of the American nation, entitled to equal rights with all citizens; we make our demands in the name of those who shed their German blood in the cause of American liberty and unity; we make our demands on the strength of the work which German men and women have done in the interest of this country's development, work without which our nation could not have become what it is today; we make our demands in the name of the benefits which the United States have derived from German culture and intelligence; we make our demands in the interests of justice toward a people which has been at peace with this country and which constitutes the first nation ever to acknowledge the independence of the United States; we make our demands in the name of truth, since it is the duty of those who would guide public opinion to be honest, especially in critical times like these.</p>
   <p>"We know that Germany did not start the conflict, that she was forced to declare war, that she is not responsible for the consequences. We have good reason to place more credence in the German White Book than in the English language press, and the German White Book shows very plainly that the declaration of war was a defense measure employed to preserve the existence of a nation whose destruction had been decreed by a 'combine' of nations; but our convictions are based on reasons other than those set forth in the White Book.</p>
   <p>"Would a nation, the only nation in Europe which had kept peace for more than forty years and had become great thereby, resort to war for which it had no desire? Germany was the battlefield of Europe for centuries; the nation was without a single natural defense; it was trampled upon and kicked about until it had become welded together by blood and iron. Germany's National Anthem is a reflected expression of her soul, a song of defense and not of attack, a song of careful watchfulness-'Firm stands, and true, the watch on the Rhine'--but not of a desire for overwhelming power.</p>
   <p>"This, too, is a war of defense; yea, it is more than that, it is a battle 'to be or not to be'. No person who knows the A B C's of the pre-war attitude of Germany's enemies can deny this. And what are the A B C's?</p>
   <p>"A--The irreconcilable hatred of France. B--Russia's insatiable desire for expansion, with Pan-Slavism as the guiding thought. C--The spiteful jealousy of England.</p>
   <p>"Little need be said about 'A,' for every schoolboy with German blood in his veins knows France's slogan since 1870: Revenge! Revenge on Germany for administering such a severe blow to the pride of the 'grande nation,' revenge for again taking possession of Alsace-Lorraine, Germany's lawful property which was stolen centuries ago by France. That is the reason for the feverish efforts of a nation which has condemned itself to gradual extinction; that is the reason for the intolerable baiting in the German provinces along the French boundary; that is the reason for prolonging the term of military service in France to three years. Even a half-wit could recognize the latter procedure as an indication that France intended to go to war in the near future; for France, in her physical and political condition, could not have borne this added burden very long.</p>
   <p>"The 'B' in the political situation is Russia's insatiable desire for more territory, her attempts to realize her dream of Pan-Slavism. Not content with her vast European and Asiatic possessions, in which her administration has not yet exceeded the limits of barbarism, Russia has always insisted upon expansion. She was friendly to Germany while Bismarck's non-agression agreement was in force, but she changed her attitude as soon as the successor to the Iron Chancellor abrogated this treaty because of a change in the political situation. Enticed and wooed with gold, she succumbed to the wiles of France, and entered into a treaty with that nation; the basic idea and chief purpose of that treaty was to assist France in her endeavors to avenge herself on Germany. However, this pact offered Russia no protection in the East, because England, an enemy of Russia at that time, was extremely anxious about India and made Japan the 'watch-dog' of this colony, and, as a result, the great Slavic nation suffered severe losses. Much weakened, and placated by concessions in Persia, Russia permitted herself to be drawn into the Triple Entente, a treaty made by England and France chiefly to subdue Germany. According to this pact, Russia was to receive some Balkan and Turkish territory as compensation for her services. Thus Russia became a sworn enemy of Austria, whose existence was endangered by the threat of Pan-Slavism; but England had made one mistake in her plans to isolate Germany. The medicine which Edward VII had given Russia in an attempt to weaken her--the Russo-Japanese war--was too strong, and Russia was not able to deliver the intended blow, since Austria was forced by Pan-Slavic incitement to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina; while Germany, true to the custom of the Niebelungs, loyally stood by her ally. Russia was forced to retreat, and afterwards she was even more hostile to Germany who was obliged to make further appropriations and take additional measures to defend her Eastern boundary.</p>
   <p>"The third factor which led to the present war was England's jealousy; it found political expression in the encirclement policy of Edward VII and has culminated in the present European war.</p>
   <p>"It is a known fact that this jealousy was caused by the extraordinary rise and expansion of German commerce and shipping. England, proud Ruler of the Seas, possessor of the greatest commercial power in the world, saw that it was being taken over by a nation of which Lord Palmerton had said in 1861: 'The Germans had better restrict their activity to plowing the land, or sailing in the clouds, or building air castles, for they never had the ambition or the ability to travel the high seas, or even small bodies of water.'</p>
   
   <p>"Permit me to quote some figures: From a commercial power which was only negligible compared to that of England, Germany had developed her facilities to such an extent by 1891 that the combined volume of her exports and imports exceeded one half the trade of England--Germany's trade was valued at 8,000,000,000 marks as compared to England's 15,000,000,000 marks. In 1900 the ratio was 11,000,000,000 to 18,000,000,000, and in 1907, 17,000,000,000 to 23,500,000,000. Thus we see that, at this rate of progress, Germany would have reached England's level in a about fifteen years.</p>
   <p>"Commercial enterprise of such dimensions requires a navy for its protection, and according to England's appraisal of Germany's trade, the latter's navy could have been more than two thirds the size of England's without being disproportionate to its purpose. Thus we see that nothing but sheer hypocrisy prompted England's claim that the much weaker navy of Germany was a threat to English supremacy. Germany never had the slightest intention of attacking England.</p>
   
   <p>"England's true attitude, not only toward the German navy but also toward German commerce, was clearly revealed by articles like the one which appeared in the Saturday Review of September, 1897 in which the author stated unhesitatingly that England's welfare could be secure only if Germany were destroyed.</p>
   <p>"'England, with a long history of successful endeavor, and Germany are competing in every corner of the globe,' declares the author. Everywhere there is conflict between German and English traveling salesmen. Whether it is a question of exploiting a mine, building a railroad, educating natives to eat meat instead of bread or to drink commercial whisky instead of abstaining, you will find Germans and Englishmen in keen competition. A million petty causes will lead to the greatest war the world has ever known. If Germany should be wiped from the face of the earth tomorrow, every Englishman would be richer.' Friends, can anybody conceive of a more brutal or a more abject statement? And the writer continues: '"Germania delenda!"' (Germany must be destroyed.) The growth of Germany's fleet would merely serve to increase the power of the blow which England would deal. Those of her ships which were not taken to English ports as prizes of war would soon lie at the bottom of the ocean. Hamburg, Bremen, and the Kiel Canal would soon be under the fire of English cannon. After we had completed the job we could then say to France and Russia: 'Get your share. Take whatever German property you wish. You may have it. Germany must be destroyed! Down with Germany!' Thus end the words of this German-hater.</p>
   <p>"Arthur Lee, Civil Lord of the Admiralty, an officer of the English government, was even more outspoken. In a public address which he made on the third of February, 1905, he declared that the balance of Europe's sea power had shifted during the past few years, and that it would therefore be necessary for her enemies to cast their eyes on the North Sea. The Civil Lord proclaimed that, if war should unfortunately take place, the English navy could deliver the first blow before the 'other party' had time to read in the newspapers that war had been declared. With reference to this statement, one of the largest and most influential English newspapers wrote: 'If the German fleet had been destroyed in October, 1904, we would have sixty years of peace in Europe. For this reason I think that Mr. Lee's statement, if made by order of the Cabinet, was a wise and peaceful declaration of the unalterable intention of the Mistress of the Seas.'</p>
   <p>"So this was the unalterable intention of the Mistress of the Seas--that 'Germany should be destroyed!'</p>
   <p>"That was the object of the encirclement policy of Edward VII. It cannot be denied that this policy made France and Russia more hostile, acquired the friendship and co-operation of Japan in the East, won Spain through a marriage, and sowed the seed of evil in Italy; in other words, it created the conditions which brought about the present war. What hypocrisy to pose as the bulwark of peace, while spending years furnishing the dynamite to blow up another nation--to state this purpose in blunt and brutal language, and then to play the role of the innocent one after the bomb had done its damage! Albion, we know thy history!</p>
   
   <p>"And now the English language publications of our country dare state that Germany started this war, when they know as well as we do that Germany was forced to declare war, not only to protect her honor and position, but also to preserve her very existence.</p>
   <p>"'Why?,' we ask the American press in righteous indignation, 'why do you thus disregard justice and equality, the most beautiful of America's attributes? Have you so little knowledge of right and wrong? Or do you value justice, equality, and truth so lightly? Why the spiteful cartoons, the misleading headlines, and the insulting articles? Be just, be fair to us!'</p>
   <p>"'Germany must be destroyed!' Germany and her ally, at war with superior forces, yet the result seems so uncertain! What can we do? Very much, if we are actuated by love for, and loyalty to, our fatherland.</p>
   <p>"Our immediate task is to help heal the wounds caused by this terrible conflict by joining the Red Cross. You will be requested to do so. You who display the Iron Cross awarded in the days of Germany's triumph, you who harbor the cross of Christian faith and Christian love in your hearts, will be called upon to assist in caring for the needs of those who are your brothers and sisters by blood and by creed. And may God be with Germany and her faithful ally in this battle 'to be or not to be'."</p>
   <p>After the assembly had loudly applauded the address of the Reverend Meyer, Chairman Walther made the following announcement:</p>
   <p>"More than ten thousand people, our brothers and sisters, are standing outside in the street, just as enthusiastic as we are. I have already sent two speakers out to address them, and now I would like to ask Mr. Leopold Neumann, if he is present in the Auditorium, to go out and speak to them."</p>
   <p>Not all members of the Vereinigte Saenger managed to ascend the stage, since the police had barred the doors earlier in the evening, but those who were able to gain admittance gave full expression to "Fruehling Am Rhein" (Springtime on the Rhine), under the leadership of Karl Reckzeh. After the singing, Ballmann's Orchestra played an inspiring march based on the German student song, "Only in Germany Would I Like to Live Forever!" The assembly joined in the chorus.</p>
   <p>Mr. Walther again took the floor and said: "I have the honor of introducing to you our next speaker, Mr. Karl Zwanzig, President of the German-American Press Association of Illinois."</p>
   <p>Karl Zwanzig's address follows: "Fellow countrymen, men and women of German blood....forget our native land. During these grave times, when our brothers, sons, and nephews are on Russian and French soil writing world history with 'blood and iron,' both the living and the dead of the old country are speaking to us in words which echo through the history of two thousand years; they are singing a song which is a thousand times more sacred to us than the Song of Solomon, for its theme is German honor, love, and loyalty.</p>
   
   <p>"They are speaking to us in words as powerful as the thunder of the heavens and as strong as the rolling of the seas, in words as sublime and clear as the peal of a bell or the tone of an organ. They are telling us to consider our pride in our German race, to defend our German honor, to be proud of being members of the greatest nation--a nation rich in knowledge, keen of thought, proud of its honor, and strong of arm--the nation of which Klopstock sang: 'Thy brow is crowned with the honor of a thousand years; I love thee, my fatherland.'</p>
   <p>"It would be idle to attempt to describe to you the attainments of German culture. They are identical with the cultural attainments of all humanity. It would require hours to describe the immeasurable riches which the German nation has contributed to the world. And it is only natural that such a nation should become the object of the envy and jealousy of an inferior people.</p>
   <p>"For the Germanic peoples are the ruling race of the earth, and it is interesting to know what my esteemed friend, Dr. [Johan A.] Enander, the greatest Swedish- American editor this country has ever known, had to say on this subject. He planned an indissoluble defense treaty of all Germanic nations. He dreamed of this plan and often spoke to me about it.</p>
   <p>"'My son,' he said, 'since ever-raging Pan-Slavism is ready to destroy Pan-Germanism, all Germans will have to unite against this mighty foe, unless they wish to perish!' And he was right! The Norsemen previously saved a people of their race. That was when they sailed south in their high-freeboard dragon ships under the leadership of JarlHarold, and rescued the remaining few thousand valiant Goths, whom Narses The Terrible wanted to deliver into the hands of the rabid Byzantians. That may happen again; for those Norsemen are purer of race than we. They have kept their Germanic blood purer than we who call ourselves Germans.....'</p>
   <p>"We need not be surprised that England saw fit to mobilize at the last minute, for she is an ally of Serbia, and the Serbs have always glorified the assassination of nobles as a means to 'save the state,' and have specialized in the murder of kings. The history of no other nation is as replete with accounts of robbery, murder, and violation of other peoples as England's.</p>
   <p>"If English sailors are as lazy as the British soldiers proved to be in the Boer War, Admiral von Tirpitz need not fear the English cannons.</p>
   <p>"If you have been deeply impressed during this hour which is being devoted to the dedication afresh of our love to our former country, then you must firmly resolve to defend the honor, the dignity, the greatness, the power, and the glory of the German nation.</p>
   <p>"It is an indisputable fact that as long as human beings walk on this earth, the honor, dignity, power, greatness, and glory of the German people will not vanish from the memory of mortal men."</p>
   
   <p>The thunderous applause accorded the speaker increased when the orchestra began to play the Radetzky March. Both the American and German flags were waved on the stage, and this demonstration was accompanied by thunderous cheers. Only with great difficulty did Chairman Walther restore order.</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen", he said, "I ask that you be quiet, Mr. August Lueders will now tell you that the police have attempted to arrest the men who made addresses from the steps of the Auditorium."</p>
   <p>Mr. Lueders then stepped forward and said: "From three to four thousand people were assembled in Grant Park. We had spoken to them and wanted to continue. When Peverend Meyer began his talk, a South Park policeman attempted to arrest him. As good American citizens we did not resist, but submitted to the action of the police and went along with them. I informed the police that I was to blame, and asked them to arrest me also. They have not done so--so far."</p>
   
   <p>Applause, mingled with expressions of disgust and resentment, followed, and when the orchestra played the National Anthem the assembly arose to a man and sang it with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. William Rothmann, a member of the School Board, and the official representative of the Germania Club, was introduced as the next speaker. He addressed the audience as follows:</p>
   <p>"I have been requested to use the English language in speaking to you, although I can see no reason for this deviation from our program. Judging by the interest and applause awarded the previous speakers, even the English people in this audience have understood what was being said in German.</p>
   <p>"First, let me ask you: Why are we here this evening? We came here as German-Americans, but at the same time as representatives of all the German-Americans in the United States. It is not necessary to point out again that we Americans of German descent are just as loyal and true to America as any other group.</p>
   
   <p>Yet no one has the right to expect us to forget that we are eternally bound by ties of blood, race, and memories to the Germans across the Germans the across the ocean. We did not come here to glorify war, for in our hearts we abhor war with its attendant bloodshed and horrors, and we men and women will hail with blessings the day when warfare between civilized nations is made impossible. But in this instance, too, the words of an American President are applicable: 'We are dealing with facts and not theories.' Our brothers abroad are fighting a war of self-defense, if not to protect their very existence. Therefore it is not only our right, but also our duty, to express our sympathy for them, to be active and willing to make sacrifices in order to alleviate the misery this great conflict will undoubtedly leave in its wake. The morning papers published a proclamation issued by our President demanding that we observe the strictest neutrality. But no international law prohibits charitable work. Let us, therefore, make it our duty to be sympathetic, merciful, and always ready to help. Let us contribute what we are able, to make the fate of the wounded, of invalids, of widows, and of orphans more easily endured; and if this meeting leads to the attainment of that end, it will have served its purpose well."</p>
   <p>Supplementing the address of Mr. Rothmann, Secretary Meyer read a letter written to the German Club of Chicago by Mr. Carl Eitel, one of the owners of the Bismarck Hotel. The letter contained a check for one thousand dollars, Mr. Eitel's contribution to the German branch of the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The chairman then introduced the next speaker, Mr. Michael Girten, former judge, who asserted that he had already addressed the crowd outside the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>"In view of the detailed discourses of previous speakers," said Mr. Girten, "I shall confine myself to pointing out facts and setting forth thoughts which may have been overlooked. Apparently there is no foundation for the assertions of the English language press that Austria-Hungary is the aggressor in this war. The dual monarchy tried to prevent Serbia's attempts to murder the heads of governments and to foment riot and sedition in Austrian provinces.</p>
   
   <p>Assassinations like the one committed at Sarajevo are contagious; therefore all nations are interested in seeing order restored in the small kingdom. Serbia is deeply indebted to Austria, for its independence from Turkey was sponsored and won chiefly by Austria at the Congress of Vienna. And when the Bulgarians had defeated the Serbs, Austria again preserved Serbia's independence. And despite all this, Serbia has repeatedly instigated riots in Austrian territory ever since Bosnia and Herzegovina were added to Franz Joseph's empire; and now the Serbs have finally succeeded in murdering the successor to the Austrian throne and his wife. Austria demanded representation at the investigation of the assassination in order to prevent delays and frauds, but Serbia declined, stating that such a procedure would be a violation of Serbia's independence. Yet Serbia had long allowed Austrian officials to come to Serbia and examine animals which were to be slaughtered and exported. Has Austria less right to be represented at investigations held for the purpose of preventing the 'export' of additional assassins?</p>
   <p>"The world showed no interest when France took possession of Morocco, when Italy took Tripoli, when England committed outrages against the inhabitants of India and robbed the Boers of their independence. Germany has lived at peace with her neighbors for forty-three years. She gave clear proof of her peaceful disposition in connection with the Morocco incident, and, four years ago, when the German Emperor observed his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, he was universally hailed as a 'Prince of Peace'. And now the English language press would have us believe that he has wantonly started this war. Austria had a right to force her little neighbor to take peaceful measures; but Russia called out her army to prevent Austria from carrying out the threats she (Austria) made. Only when Russia refused to cease arming, thus endangering Germany's position, did Germany declare war--in self-preservation. Germany was alert, and would not wait until Russia was at her throat. It is said that Germany should have induced Austria to stay out of Serbia; but why did France and England not persuade Russia to stop mobilizing? (Applause). They, and not Germany, are to blame for this terrible war. Western civilization is at stake in this conflict. If Germany wins, as we all hope and have reason to believe, then man's cultural progress is assured; if Russia and her allies are victorious, then Asiatic semi-barbarism will destroy the great accomplishments of man."</p>
   <p>When the applause following this address had subsided, Secretary Wild announced that two additional gifts of one thousand dollars each had been made to the Red Cross, one by the Abendpost through its president, Paul F. Mueller, and the other by Fritz von Frantzius, a banker. This announcement caused loud and prolonged cheering.</p>
   <p>Deep silence ensued when Mr. Zwanzig again spoke and read two telegrams, one directed to Emperor Wilhelm and the other to his brother-in-arms, Emperor Franz Joseph. The telegram to Emperor Wilhelm read as follows:</p>
   <p>"To His Majesty, Wilhelm The Second, Emperor of Germany:</p>
   <p>"The German-American citizens of Chicago, assembled at the greatest mass demonstration the world has ever known, assure Your Imperial Majesty of the undying love of more than two million German-Americans in the state of Illinois for their former country."</p>
   <p>The telegram to Emperor Wilhelm's hoary ally read:</p>
   <p>"To His Majesty, Franz Joseph The First, Emperor of Austria-Hungary, Vienna:</p>
   <p>"Your Imperial Majesty, whom all men love and revere, is hereby assured of the undying love, devotion, and reverence of the Germans and Austrians assembled in the great metropolis, Chicago, at the greatest mass demonstration the world has ever known."</p>
   <p>It was unanimously decided to send the messages.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were read by the secretary:</p>
   <p>"We, the German-Americans of Chicago, representing all elements of the German people, united in mass meeting, greatly deplore the war which has broken out among the nations of Europe, and which threatens to destroy the great accomplishments of years of peaceful work and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, and which in any event, is a retrogression of civilization.</p>
   <p>"We also deeply regret that this terrible visitation has given rise to wretched animosity and race-hatred. We fear that this animosity and hatred may also be transferred to the land of our choice, the United States of America. That perhaps the seed of such an attitude has already been sown is indicated by the way no small part of the American press reports the exciting events of the day, and by the way the causes of the war are described. We assert that it is contrary to the interest of not only our city, but also the whole country and the entire American people, especially the youth, to depict the powerful German Empire, the great German nation to which many of our fellow citizens are related by ties of blood, as enemies of civilization--as barbarians who wantonly brought this dreadful war upon mankind to further their own selfish interests. We therefore appeal to the patriotism of all good citizens, and to the American press, and request that they reserve judgment until the facts and the fundamental causes of the war have been established, and that they do not condemn the German government and the German people without having heard their side of the matter. We ask our fellow citizens and the American press to deliberate well upon the current issues and then to render a just verdict."</p>
   <p>"We, the German-American citizens of Chicago representing all elements of the German race and culture, are assembled at a great mass meeting, and we hereby express our deepest sympathy for the German and Austrian nations to which we are bound by ties of blood. In this hour of severe trial we feel as one with them, and we pledge ourselves to do everything possible to alleviate their suffering, to administer to the wounded, and to take care of the families of those who have laid down their lives for the fatherland. And therefore we appeal to the charitable spirit of all our fellow citizens to support our endeavors.</p>
   <p>"We thank the President of the United States for offering his services to the nations of Europe in their peace negotiations."</p>
   <p>After the reading of the resolutions, Reverend Meyer took the floor and proposed that they be adopted.</p>
   <p>"However," he said, "in one respect the resolutions are too mild. If we Germans would use a tenth of our energies to imbue the Anglo-Americans with the respect which is due us, we would not be satisfied to use the word 'request' in our resolutions. We are fully qualified American citizens of German descent. We can demand, yea, even command. We have been weak-kneed long enough; I am sorry that I must use this expression, but it is as fitting as any other. But we do not want to be too aggressive now, we do not wish to demand. We are content to expect that the American press will be impartial. Yes, that is the correct word. We may use it, for we Germans have done our share to make Chicago what it is today. And so it is only just and right that we receive the consideration which is due us."</p>
   <p>A number of people in the assembly thought that the word "expect" was too mild, too weak. The resolutions were accepted as read, after Reverend Meyer's amendment had been adopted.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Ernst Hummel proposed that the first address, that of Reverend Meyer, be translated into English and one hundred thousand copies printed and circulated. He was informed that the Committee had already taken the necessary steps to publish and distribute the proposed number of copies.</p>
   <p>The chairman then introduced the last speaker of the evening, Mr. O. H. Lang, president of Germania Maennerchor, who addressed the audience briefly, as follows:</p>
   <p>"I shall not say very much, and would not speak at all if I did not deem it my duty to do so. We cannot march onto the battlefield with the German soldiers and fight for our former country which is in grave danger, but we can be active in helping to lighten the burden and the misery of the war. Let us cast aside all petty matters, all petty differences of opinion; let us make a united effort to gain the good will of our local fellow citizens, and of the American public in general. Let us not go too far in our condemnation of matters which are not based on hatred or malice, but which proceed from misunderstanding or ignorance. At present, our chief task consists of collecting funds to care for the needy. On leaving this hall, everyone should ask himself what he can do for the cause; he must not overlook the fact that the German nation is fighting for its very existence--against Tartars.</p>
   <p>"It is our duty to explain to non-German Americans what Germany is fighting for. If we succeed in convincing them that the German people are fighting for their existence and for civilization, and that they wish to preserve their liberty and the right to perfect their culture, then we shall have made a great stride forward. We should not be too severe with our fellow citizens who are not of German parentage. We should not criticize them too harshly, but rather inform them of the true significance of this war. And, if we succeed in these efforts, we shall do Germany a great service."</p>
   
   <p>Thus the official program was concluded, and the orchestra was preparing to play the last number, when Mr. G. von Rottweiler--evidently a reserve officer who was ready to serve in the German Army--asked for the floor. He addressed the assembly thus:</p>
   <p>"Anyone present at the German consulate this afternoon had an opportunity to learn the kind of spirit that prevails among the reservists who have reported. Three thousand of us met there and sang the 'Watch on the Rhine' and other German patriotic songs. This evening we came to the Auditorium in a body, bearing the flags of America and Germany. Many of us have come from distant cities, Kansas City, for instance, and a large number of us spent our last dollar to get here. At the consulate the officials could only tell us that we would have to be patient. But we cannot very well stay here without shelter. And so we ask for your help. Every nickel will be appreciated."</p>
   <p>The speaker was informed that the Executive Board of the Nationalbund would care for him and his comrades. At the same time it was announced that the Red Cross Committee would be augmented.</p>

   <p>The time to conclude this great mass demonstration had finally arrived. Before the first measure of the final musical selection had been played, the entire audience had again arisen to sing "Deutschland, Deutschland Ueber Alles". Immediately thereafter Reverend Meyer asked for the attention of the assembly and said, "Let us unite in the Lord's Prayer for our native country. And in low voices, with heads bowed in great reverence, everybody, young and old, men, women, and children, Protestants, Catholics, Jews, atheists and agnostics offered supplication in behalf of the German nation. After a few seconds of silence the orchestra was again heard, and again spirited voices wafted to the skies--but this time in honor of the adopted country. The meeting was adjourned after the four verses of "My Country, 'tis of Thee" had been sung by the entire assembly.</p>
