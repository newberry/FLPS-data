   <p>A half million enemy aliens were registered as such and, according to law, were subjected to special regulations. Six thousand of them were arrested for internment but only a comparatively small percentage of them were actually interned--only one out of every seventeen thousand enemy aliens, in a population which is composed, to a great extent, of immigrants of various nationalities.</p>
   <p>The report of Attorney General Gregory, whose department has been just and humane in all its relations with enemy aliens, contains a certain praise of that part of the population which, through circumstances and the war, was put in the precarious position of enemy aliens. The statistics prove that the overwhelming majority of Germans from the Reich and Austrians who reside here have exercised tact and have always been mindful of their obligations to the country which offered them protection. In view of the many recent revelations about the extensive German propaganda of the Bernstorffs and their hirelings, aiming at intrigue, murder, and sabotage, this record is quite remarkable.</p>

   <p>But the report of the Department of Justice is doubly significant in view of the fact that Congress will soon be occupied with the problem of immigration. Indeed, if even during war time, when there are enemy aliens and common sense is easily forgotten, only one out of every seventeen thousand enemy aliens was considered dangerous enough to be interned there is little danger for the nation.</p>
