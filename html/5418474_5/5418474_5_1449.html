   <p>Our Government has taken the fateful step. Fremont has been deposed.</p>
   <p>The President's decision against Fremont is irrevocable, and as citizens of the Republic we must submit to it. However, even the War, Which has Already demanded great sacrifices and continues to demand more every day, must not prevent us from expressing our opinion about this unfortunate act. The Constitution still guarantees us freedom of speech. Let us make use of it, German fellow citizens! A mass meeting will be held in the large hall of the German House, Saturday, November 9, 1861, at 8 P. M., and all fellow citizens of German descent who are true to Fremont are invited to attend and to express their opinion about this matter. Able speakers will address the assembly.</p>

   <p>[Translator's note: In the following issue of this paper, November 9, a notice appeared to the effect that the meeting will be held in the North Market Hall instead of the German House.]</p>
