   <p>German World War Veterans were guests yesterday of Company D of the 131st Infantry Regiment of the Illinois National Guard. Seven former German World War veterans, members of local War veterans societies, as well as a reporter of the Abendpost had been invited. They spent a day in Camp Grant which will be long remembered by them, and which, thanks to the hearty welcome offered them, served as proof that in American circles they are striving to bring about a better mutual understanding.</p>
   <p>The names of the seven War veterans, guests of Company D, are as follows: Otto Schwark, Fred Linduer, Theodor Jung, Hermann Berusdorf, Max Gross, Karl Meinke, and J. Schmidt. The German guests travelled in a special car, and with them were the World War veterans of the 131st Regiment. A very gay, mood prevailed, and all were anticipating the coming events.</p>

   <p>After three hours journey, the train arrived at Camp Grant at 12 o'clock, where thousands of sunburned young people appeared to welcome their relations. At the depot, the veterans were received by a military band and accompanied to the center of the camp. After the welcoming address by the Commander of the Regiment, Colonel Allen, the German guests were also greeted by the officers of Company D., and Captain Cottle. He said in a short speech that he and his officers and soldiers were happy to welcome former German soldiers as guests, and to have the opportunity to shake hands with them.</p>
   <p>After this official reception, the visitors went to Company Street "D," where the soldiers were housed in a dozen tents, each of which had six beds. The Company lined up in honor of the German guests and gave them the military salute. Greetings, in general, were next exchanged.</p>
   <p>Soon the machine guns were brought out, and as is usual among soldiers, the advantages of the German and American Machine guns were discussed.</p>

   <p>In the officers' mess hall, Captain Cottle and Lieutenant Preiss told the reporter with unmistakable pride about their German boys. The officers praised especially the obedience and the willingness of the Germans. Special praise was given them by Sergeant Wassmer, who drills the soldiers. After dinner, the airport, the tanks, and all the points of interest were inspected. The reception extended only through the forenoon, because the soldiers have the afternoon at their disposition, during which they repair their uniforms, wash, or play.</p>
