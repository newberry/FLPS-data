   <p>On September 28, the fourth Liberty Loan will be launched, and by October 19 the required amount--probably six billion dollars--must be over-subscribed.</p>
   <p>That means, all who consider themselves good and loyal citizens must subscribe to the Liberty Loan to the best of their ability. All must purchase Liberty Loan according to their means--property and anticipated earnings, since Liberty Bonds may be bought on credit--if they do not want to appear lukewarm or have their loyalty questioned.</p>
   <p>Not only that! Everybody must not only buy as many Liberty Bonds as he can, but must continue in his efforts to make the Loan a great success among his friends, acquaintances, and neighbors. If not, he still will be in danger of being looked upon by others as "disloyal," regardless of how much he himself has subscribed.</p>
   
   <p>This danger exists for everybody, regardless of where he was born or to what "nationality" he may belong. It is just as real for Anglo-Americans as for immigrant Poles or Czechs; it threatens the Irish-Americans as well as those who were born in Canada--but the danger is especially great for citizens of German extraction! For whereas others may render themselves suspect if they do not "subscribe", according to their means or forget to talk in behalf of the Liberty Loan, such an attitude would, in the case of men and women of German origin, only augment a suspicion which already exists.</p>
   <p>Citizens of German descent have done, and are now doing their duty. Their sons are fighting in France under the Stars and Stripes, their money over here for democratic victory. They submitted willingly to conscription and gladly subscribed to the first three Liberty Loans. They showed themselves to be loyal. The natural consequence is a sharp decrease of suspicion--although it has not yet altogether disappeared. It is still smoldering under the ashes.</p>
   
   <p>But where it has apparently died, it may easily be fanned into flames again, if a relaxation of loyalty to duty on the part of the German element would take place, or if their special enemies would be given the opportunity to question their loyalty. Therefore, it is the duty of all citizens of German origin not only to buy as much as possible of the fourth Liberty Loan, but also to talk as much as possible in its behalf.</p>
   <p>"A bird is recognized by its feathers"--a man by his actions and words. It may be against German nature to advertise a loyalty which to him is only the fulfillment of a simple and matter-of-course duty and to demand patriotic credit for it, so to speak; it may be especially repulsive to him during a time when patriotism obviously is being abused in an infamous manner by others--but it has to be done, lest suspicion of the German element within the American citizenry be continued and so remain a danger for all Americans of German descent and America as a whole.</p>
   <p>"Do not put your light under a bushel." This holds true much more in our time than at any other time or any place else. Citizens of German extraction will continue to do their duty to the fullest; they will subscribe to the fourth Liberty Loan as much as possible--they generally have good business sense and realize that Liberty Bonds are the best and safest investments in the "world"--but they will also have to talk about it and let themselves be known as ardent advocates and friends of the Liberty Loan. And they have to see to it as much as possible that Americans of German extraction are given full "credit" for their subscriptions and that the fact of their heavy participation is made known to the general public and held under the noses of their enemies.</p>
   <p>This shall be done. That is the job of the German-speaking Fourth Liberty Loan committee of the Seventh Federal Reserve District. Its successful transaction will mean: the final and complete elimination of suspicion against citizens of German origin; the end of insinuation and agitation against anyone that is of German blood and bears a German name; the recognition of citizens of German descent as full-fledged and first-rate citizens in every respect, in this manner bringing about, in a forceful way, an equal standard of respect and appreciation.</p>
   
   <p>This will be accomplished, if the committee will get the co-operation of the citizens (of German descent) to which we believe it is entitled.</p>
