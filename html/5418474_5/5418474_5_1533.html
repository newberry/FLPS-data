   <p>At the conference for fighting professional crime, a proposition was made that gained little attention from the public. The proposition was made by Ferdinand Pecora, generally known as an able and aggressive jurist. Pecora is an advocate of the abolition of the "foolish" law by which the accused may be found guilty only by a unanimous verdict of the jury.</p>
   <p>It is universally known that, in many instances, the accused, as to whose guilt there is not the slightest doubt, escapes conviction and punishment only because of this legal provision. For this reason, much has been said and written about the reform of jury trials. These popular trials originated, as can be established by any history of law, at the beginning of the ninth century. At that time, King Louis the Pious, the successor of Charlemagne, commanded that twelve trustworthy men should be selected from every community for the purpose of ascertaining the <span class="page-break">\2</span>facts in legal disputes. It seems, however, that these prototypes of present-day jurors exercised no judicial function, and that they were called upon to act only in civil trials.</p>
   <p>This custom must have been later brought to England by the Normans, giving rise to the development of the system of jury trials. In England, trials by jury formed a protective well, right from the beginning, against arbitrary royal procedure. Not until the latter part of the nineteenth century were these people's courts introduced into the countries of Contintental Europe. In the old German Reich, the introduction of jury trials took place in the year 1877. In the year 1924, the institution of juries was considerably altered in Germany, but the essential elements of the old form remained.</p>
   <p>The English colonists, who brought jury trials to this country, had sad experiences with interferences on the part of royal officeholders. The colonists must have realized that they were in need of legal protection against fanatics and religious zealots, and, since at that time quite insignificant trespasses were severely <span class="page-break">\3</span>punished, it was quite natural that they should introduce the clause about unanimity among the jurors.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, trials by jury have evolved in this country into one of the gravest handicaps to an orderly and effective exercise of justice. The generally accepted requirement that jurors must not have formed an opinion about the case under consideration has brought it about that, as a rule, the most ignorant and mentally indolent persons are selected to become jurors. The lawyers have become increasingly accustomed to appealing to the emotions of the jury, and thus confuse their sense of justice. This is the reason that so many court trials have become veritable burlesque shows.</p>
   <p>One does not have to go on assuming that much corruption is practiced at these trials. It is not at all necessary that the defense attorneys corrupt the jurors. If, among the twelve "good men and true," they discover one only (with a weak mind) who succumbs to their tricks, then they may rely on him to resist the conviction of their client with all the iron stubbornness he has in him. All a lawyer needs <span class="page-break">\4</span>is to convince only one juror of the innocence of his client, while the attorney for the state is compelled to convince all twelve of them of his guilt. This is, in actual fact, a situation which makes the dispensation of justice almost impossible.</p>
   <p>In spite of all that, there is a scant possibility that Pecora's proposal will be accepted within a reasonable time. The stipulation that the jurors must be unanimous in their verdict is firmly founded in the Constitution. The Supreme Court issued a decision that Amendments 6 and 7 make unanimity necessary in verdicts given by jurors. Before this practice is abolished, the Constitution will have to be altered. And that is a rather lengthy procedure.</p>
