   <p>The Abendpost organized a collection for the crew of the "Eitel Friedrich," which was interned in Newport News last Spring. The brave blue jackets received many presents, among them several packages from Mrs. Martha Doer, 11359 Michigan Avenue, Roseland. In one of the parcels she enclosed her address, and a short time later her gift was thankfully acknowledged by Zielasko, one of the sailors. Since then she sent additional items to him and also to George Rudies, a stoker, whose name she read in a newspaper. In every instance the recipient expressed profound gratitude. In a recent letter, Mrs. Doer advised them of another shipment and added that she would celebrate her silver wedding anniversary on February 21, regretting to be unable to invite the entire crew. Great indeed was her surprise when the mailman brought two boxes from Newport News, on Monday morning. One contained the handiwork <span class="page-break">2</span>of mariner Zielasko, showing an accurate reproduction of the "Pierre Loti," which was sunk by the "Eitel Friedrich." The picture is framed by a miniature buoy. In the other parcel she found one dozen silver spoons of Japenese origin, which Rudies sent to his benefactress with ardent congratulations. None of the numerous rememberances which Mrs. Doer received in token of her celebration are valued any higher than the offerings of the two German Blue-jackets.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Doer is the wife of Adolph Doer, the music teacher. The family settled in Roseland thirty years ago. The celebrant was born in Trier, Rheinprovinz, in 1862. He is the leader of the Choral Society Frohsinn (Happiness) and members of the Fruehschoppen Male Chorus.</p>
   <p>His faithful companion first saw the light of day in Berlin in 1867 She has been a Chicago resident since 1882. Pastor R. A. John officiated <span class="page-break">3</span>at the wedding ceremony. The festival was given at their home on Monday, among members of the family. The general celebration was held on Tuesday, at Gimmler's Hall, which was barely large enough to accommodate all their well-wishers.</p>
