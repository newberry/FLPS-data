   <p>Judging the latest notes of the United States to the German and British governments it is necessary, if we want to be fair, to be cognizant of the fact that the note to the German government was prompted by an official decree of the German admiralty, whereas the note to the British government was based on nothing more than newspaper reports and a statement made by Germany. Since it had not been ascertained whether the reported use of the American flag by British merchantmen was made on the advise of the [British] admiralty or whether it constituted an arbitrary procedure on the part of the skippers in question, the United States government, in accordance with international courtesy, had to leave this item untouched when transmitting the note [to Britain].</p>
   <p>On the surface, the difference would seem rather great, but in reality it is only a thin camouflage which could not bear closer investigation and would make Britain's argument in this question a rather doubtful one. Germany's position is open, clear and aboveboard, England's is hidden, vague and evasive. Germany <span class="page-break">\2</span>announces which waters she wants to have considered as war zones; she also admits that her submarines are finding it hard in each and every case to distinguish between belligerent and neutral vessels and she warns the neutrals of the dangers which their ships may encounter in those waters, because the enemy vessels are systematically abusing the American flag to deceive German submarines, on advise of the British admiralty. That such fraudulent use has occurred is now an ascertained fact, and to the accusation that the British admiralty was responsible for it the British government answers with silence. No answer is an answer just the same; in this case it is an affirmative one. Nobody can doubt the veracity of the assertion made by the German government, otherwise the British government would not have hesitated one single moment to brand it a falsehood. It follows, then, that the dangers which neutral, and especially American, shipping encounters in English and French coastal waters designated as war zones by Germany, have been brought about by Englands' action, by the systematic fraudulent use of the American flag on the advise of the British government--and Britain must be held responsible for it.</p>
   <p>To declare all waters around the British Isles as war zones certainly was an <span class="page-break">\3</span>extraordinary step taken by Germany, but the Reich was not only justified in doing so, but was forced to it by England's attitude and actions, to wit: England's declared intention to starve out the German civil population--which is against international and martial law, and contrary to the interests of neutral nations engaged in trade. By logical conclusion, the responsibility for the German war-zone declaration must be laid on England's doorstep and whoever would sustain damage or incur danger by this declaration had better ask England to make good the loss.</p>
   <p>Up till now the United States has not done so, though it will have to do it. The United States cannot expect Germany to retreat from its just position, neither can this country afford to condone much longer Britain's abuse of the American flag. The United States cannot and must not lend a hand to the starvation of Germany, and must not acquiesce to the abuse of their flag any longer. By doing the first, they would become vassals of Britain, with her procedures that are a slap in the face of international law, and, by tolerating the abuse of the American flag, the government would lead the country into danger. England is trying, by every conceivable method, to create dissension between Germany <span class="page-break">\4</span>and America. This is in line with her century-old policy. She aims to put off the American government and hopes for "incidents" between the United States and the German Reich--and she'll stop at nothing to accomplish this purpose.</p>
   <p>"Remember the Maine!" Every day of procrastination may precipitate a like catastrophe. Every day that passes without our government taking resolute measures for the protection of the American flag against abuse and attack is an admission of weakness as far as England is concerned. Every day that passes without our government insisting on the right to send the German civil population foodstuffs in American ships, is another day of aiding and abetting Englands' helper and ally. Not Germany, but England has to be held to account by America-and that right away!-</p>
