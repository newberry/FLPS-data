   <p>The social question is to be looked upon chiefly as a moral problem, for its solution depends upon the co-operation of all people in their battle for existence, and the realization that brotherly love, and not selfish material interests, determine the success and extent of their mutual relations in this materialistic world. But as soon as one begins to improve the living conditions of the people, the social question becomes a problem of production; for such improvement is possible only when production increases. With the exception of a small number of wealthy men, a major part of our population, including nearly all employers, merchants, and farmers, live just about as simply, or very little better than laborers. If the latter are to consume more goods, more must be produced; for the distribution of the surplus wealth of the rich would increase the material assets of the poorer classes but very little. And even if this were not true, the masses would have only the money to purchase the coveted goods, but not the actual merchandise, for a sufficient quantity must first be produced. If more goods are to be consumed, more will simply have to be produced. The desired improvement of living conditions also includes a shortening of working hours. If production is to increase, it will be necessary either to employ more workers in the future, or to make up for lost time by intensive work, improved manufacturing methods, new labor-saving inventions, etc.</p>
   <p>The best means of approaching this goal would be the establishing of confidence between employee and employer. A satisfactory solution of the social conflict may be expected only when the energies of employee and employer are used in co-operation with, instead of in opposition to one another. At present both parties are far from this goal. It was only recently that efforts were made in the United States to employ the necessary means of attaining this unity. In other countries people are still wandering around in the dark without the slightest idea that they are headed for a fathomless abyss. One party cannot be blamed more than the other for the common lack of understanding. Both parties are at fault, and both will have to recognize this fact, if any co-operative effort to solve the problem is to be made possible. Let no one believe that a solution can be effected by raising the wages of some workers today, and of others tomorrow. The wage question is but one side of the problem, and probably not even the most important one.</p>
   <p>Why is it so difficult to bring these two groups--workers and employers--together? The answer to this question is very simple: Because both are selfishly bent upon settling the issue to their own advantage, without giving due consideration to the other interests. It is difficult to lead the workers, for they are suspicious and jealously guard their rights, and at times they are very unreasonable. They try to wrest every possible emolument from industry, without giving the least thought to the economic results. Frequently they harm their own cause by resisting progress; and they often brazenly express their desire to rule over industry. They make demands which if granted, would ruin industry's present productive capacity; and they would like to assume responsibilities which they are not able to bear.</p>
   <p>Employers, on the other hand, are often too prone to exercise the great power which circumstances have placed in their hands. They are generally indifferent to the progressive ideas which are offered as a solution of the social question, and apparently they think that the correct policy is to continue in the old way, in the hope that a universally satisfactory balance of social elements will gradually develop from the battle.</p>
   <p>But both groups are in the wrong. A better mutual relation can be brought about only if employers lock upon the problem as their very own and give it the same consideration and attention that they devote to any other manufacturing problem. They must not wait until friction has developed but should immediately recognize and remove the causes. They should know that their success is partly dependent upon the mental condition and the attitude of their employees, and should govern themselves accordingly. Therefore, while they should, and must, defend their own interests against unreasonable attacks, they should also sanction and promote the vitally necessary and logical movement of their employees to improve working and wage conditions as much as possible.</p>
   <p>The majority of workers think only of a more extensive distribution of goods, but do not consider the fact that to comply with their wish it will be necessary to step up production. They look upon industry as a machine which merely "grinds out" wages and profits, and believe that they can change the relation between wages and profits at will, without affecting productivity.</p>
   
   <p>On the other hand the employers seldom trouble to ascertain what effect education, social conditions, and home environment have upon the efficiency of their employees. The workers' knowledge that their own good health is the only thing that separates their families from poverty, promotes feelings of anxiety and discouragement in the hearts of mentally alert laborers, and hatred against our social order. No person should be punished for conditions beyond his control, and neither should his family. Until recently employers thought that they could ignore this matter. That was foolish, for physical, moral, and social factors which influence the efficiency of a worker and his will to work, must necessarily affect him, just as wages and working hours do.</p>
   <p>If the opposition between employees and employers is permitted to increase as the power of labor unions grows, the result will be an economic catastrophe, through which both will suffer great harm. This danger may be averted only by an immediate understanding effected by the two groups. If both factions are inspired by a feeling of good will, such an understanding is entirely possible. Several large firms in the United States have shown that their intentions are aimed in this direction. Of course, for the time being, they are adopting the trial and error method, but a satisfactory method will undoubtedly be found very soon. We hope that these pioneers will soon have a large following.</p>
