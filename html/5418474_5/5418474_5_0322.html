   <p>To back up the government with all our might, out of the innermost conviction that our cause is just--that, in my opinion, is true citizenship and perfect loyalty. It is the only kind of loyalty which can make a country prosperous in peacetime and victorious in war.</p>
   <p>The more we recognize the objects which are at stake in this great World War, the more obvious must become the duty of every American citizen to stand by his country with perfect patriotism in times like these. As these days, momentous for world history, pass by, we must become more and more convinced of the righteousness of our cause.</p>
   <p>A country wages a just war if it has taken up arms because the rights of <span class="page-break">\2</span>its citizens have been encroached upon by a foreign power, and if this power shows no signs of making amends for the injustice or of refraining from further overt acts.</p>
   <p>We are not waging a war of conquest, nor are we engaged in a campaign to avenge injuries inflicted upon us; nor is the primary cause the damage which our citizens have suffered from the unrestricted submarine warfare, though this brought about a state of war, confirmed when Congress made a declaration of war. But rather do we realize in the war aims of Europe's central powers the real danger which threatens our country and the ideals on which its hopes for the future are based, those hopes which Germany imperils.</p>
   <p>I will not consider here the evidence which places the guilt for the present war on Germany. He who has studied the Lichnowsky documents can hardly gainsay the faults of the German diplomats during the July days <span class="page-break">\3</span>of 1914. I am thinking, rather, of the proof of the existence (long before the tempest broke loose on August 2, 1914) of a policy of conquest which had been fostered, to a great extent, within the German people. It was not an idle fantasy, this talk about the world leadership for which Germany was destined, and this talk of a German world empire. Not only in navy circles was Per Tag toasted; not only in the Pan-German press, organs of the Pan-Germanists, and in the leaflets of the Defense League, was the economic necessity for an extension of the German sphere of influence by incorporation of small neighboring states emphasized. It was, rather, for years, an intrinsic part of the German mentality that the ultimate goal would be a German world dominion, established by force. It would pay to study the documents in "Conquest and Kultur" and "Out of their Own Mouths". One recalls the speeches which have been made by German visitors to America for the last fifteen years. And what could be the significance of the fact that, not professional militarists, but 352 professors, 158 elementary-school teachers and clergymen, 145 officials, <span class="page-break">\4</span>182 captains of industry, 252 artists and authors, clamor unanimously for the permanent occupation of Belgium and the iron ore districts of France, as well as possession of the French coast of the English Channel? The masses of the German people may still believe, even today, that they are fighting a defensive war--but the representatives of Kultur recognize as the object of the present war the establishment of a central Europe welded together economically, and the attainment of world power over a weakened England and a prostrate France.</p>
   <p>To frustrate those aims, we are now engaged in the most formidable armament program world history has ever known. What has caused us to do this? Three things:</p>
   <p>First, the submarine warfare. The announcement of an unrestricted submarine warfare constituted an interference with the established privileges of American citizens. Not only the right to make pleasure trips abroad, just as if war did not exist, but also the right of American seamen to <span class="page-break">\5</span>follow their trade and the right of American businessmen to engage in legitimate commerce had been encroached upon.</p>
   <p>Second, a victorious Germany would constitute a permanent peril to world peace as long as the militarist caste directed the attitude of the best minds of the people. The result would be general armament for a new world war which would be more herrible than the First one, and would destroy all human happiness. Who could enjoy life on a smoking volcano?</p>
   <p>If there still remained any doubt whether the military and landed aristocracy in Germany, true to their mottoes, "Might is Right," "We are always right, because there are 87,000,000 of us," and "To the victors belong the spoils," were in earnest, this doubt is now removed if we observe the conduct of the victors in Russia. The revolts against the German administration are, according to Maximilian Harden's dispatch of August 10, a direct consequence of the ruthless and oppressive policy of the conquerors, who "do not have the slightest comprehension of the sacred <span class="page-break">\6</span>value of the personality of a people". In the Ukraine a parliament was formed, but an army officer dissolved it and put the highest officials under arrest. In Lithuania the population is treated as an officer would treat a private, and all schools which did not have German instruction have been closed. Thus Russia is the First to enjoy the German blessing If the spirit of the people rebels, the sabre will go into action. Central Europe is taking shape.</p>
   <p>Then what? Suppose the subjugated nations put themselves under the German double eagle and the whole world has to take up arms against 35,000,000 armed men of a central European empire, if a peace treaty has not cut off the means for preparing for such a war. [Translators' note: I think the author means the arms supply of the rest of the world, which is supposed to battle these hypothetical and enlarged central powers.] A terror with-out end! The welfare of mankind, the welfare of our country demands that such a conclusion of the war be prevented. That is why we are in this war.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>And, lastly, let us not believe that a power like Germany could harm us only by invasion or by a blockade of the American coast. A victorious Germany would mean the victory of principles, the consequences of which would make every inhabitant of our country suffer for a long time to come. A people lives by ideals. By this I mean the principles by which trade and commerce with other nations are carried on in order to safeguard prosperity and the continuance of existence. The American people stand and fall with the principles of democracy. In a world built on absolutism, or, still worse, on the absolutism of the sword, it would be lost. It would either have to commit moral suicide by renouncing the principles held sacred since 1776, and by adapting itself to the principles which would prevail in the world after Germany had won a victory; or else it would have to be content with restricting its trade, and also its economic existence, by severing relations with other nations in order to avoid submitting to absolutism. It cannot be doubted that, by means of an economic "war after the war," Germany would consolidate her spoils and so inaugurate her <span class="page-break">\8</span>world dominion by means of trade agreements which would be concluded at the point of a gun, just as at Brest Litovsk.</p>
   <p>The guiding thought of the ruling class in Germany is that there should exist only two groups of nations, namely, a ruling Germanic group and its allies, and a suppressed one, paying tribute. The theory says: "Conquest is the function of a dominating race. Let no one say that every people has a right to existence."</p>
   <p>The result we can study now in Russia, Lithuania, and the Ukraine. We have even seen it for a long time in German-Poland, in Alsace-Lorraine and in the German colonies in Africa. Everywhere there is suspicion, hatred, and resentful obedience. A world power based on such a doctrine of the aristocracy of a single race would be the deathblow to every principle to which our people adhere with all their hearts, the principle that all nations must be granted the right of free development as an <span class="page-break">\9</span>inalienable right. This principle, which determines our relations with the rest of the world, stands and falls with the victory of the American armed forces.</p>
   <p>And this principle touches upon the innermost privileges which our country guarantees its citizens. Since our entry into the affairs of the outside world at the time of the war with Spain, the trade and commerce of our country have been strongly influenced by events abroad, especially by the trade agreements made by various nations with one another. Our happiness and welfare depend upon international relations. We form an economic unity with the rest of the world.</p>
   <p>Now, if the agreements among peoples were determined by the idea that one race, due to its mental and material power, should be the dominating one, to which all other nations had to pay tribute, then absolutism would rule the world. Here lies the danger for us in Germany's war aims. If <span class="page-break">\10</span>Germany wins, the relationships between nations will be regulated by her claim that she is entitled to world dominion. And so the democratic idea, the guiding principle of which is not the sovereignty of a particular race, but justice, fairness, and free competition, would perish. The whole world trade, our entire import and export trade and, with it, the commercial life of our country, reaching into the farthest village, would be brought under the influence of those who would see in Pan-Germany, which "is always right, because there are 87,000,000 of us," the future master of the world. Central Europe would decide the prices on the world market for cotton and wheat, writing paper and horseshoe nails, and where they might be sold. Nothing else but this is meant by the words "war of world economics," which have repeatedly occured, since 1914, in German pamphlets about the European War.</p>
   <p>Not only the spiritual values, but also, and to an even greater extent, the material interests of our country are at stake in this war. Since a peace <span class="page-break">\11</span>treaty will determine whether democracy or absolutism shall govern the world, it is clear that this war, long before we entered it, touched upon the right of every American citizen to promote his own happiness and that of his country by free competition on the world market. It is, therefore, the duty of every American citizen, and to his own interest as well as to that of all those with whom he wishes to trade in justice and fairness, and not at the point of a bayonet, that he serve the ideal for which we are fighting with all his heart and fortune. The Fourth Liberty Loan affords the most immediate opportunity for expressing this realization by action.</p>
