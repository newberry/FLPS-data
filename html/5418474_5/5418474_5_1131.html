   <p>Even though the unanimous protest of the German-Americans against the biased attitude of the Anglo-American press in favor of Germany's enemies has had some kind of result, nevertheless the success was not widespread by any means. The greater part of the English language press keeps on tooting the anti-German horn; it approves of all measures which perfidious Albian and her motley allies undertake to strangle the German Reich and Austria-Hungary, regardless of the malice and fiendishness behind them, it is still accusing the Germans--fighting hard for their existence--of the most ignoble motives even now, when the mask has been torn off the faces of those English-Russian-French plotters; and it is doing its best to bring the trustworthiness, honesty, and integrity of the Germans into discredit with our American fellow citizens.</p>
   <p>To the charge of having Anglophile inclinations, the newspapers reply that, in reporting war news, they depend almost entirely upon English and French sources, and that they cannot withhold late news from their readers. With this <span class="page-break">2</span>alibi, they are merely beating around the bush. Nobody ever objected to their publishing dispatches from England and France, but to the manner in which it is done, and to their anti-German comments in their editorials, often going beyond the bounds of good taste and tactfulness as befits the press of a neutral country. The German language papers of this country do not have any other news sources either, and are publishing English and French dispatches too, to keep their readers informed and up-to-date, in so far as that is possible. The trouble with the Anglo-American papers lies mainly in the fact that, as a matter of principle, they emphasize anything in the news that is unfavorable to Germany, or could be used to discredit her. This intentional bias is particularly noticeable in the headlines. Four or five columns wide, these headlines inform the prospective buyer of a newspaper, half a block away, that the Germans were beaten by the French, Belgians, and English, or that the Austrian army has been "annihilated" by the Serbs. But, if you read the text underneath those headlines, the battle of "decisive importance" turns out to be an unimportant skirmish, while further down in the column, under a tiny heading, we find that the Germans have made considerable progress some place else. One can always be sure to find reports of <span class="page-break">3</span>alleged atrocities, committed by German soldiers in Belgium, making front page news, and large type headlines are used to attract the attention of the public. Denials of such calumnies by German sources find space in some inconspicuous corner where nobody reads them. If that is considered impartial reporting, it would be interesting to learn how these papers would act if they would admittedly and officially take England's side. They would find it difficult to be more pro-English than they are now.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that, in England and France, and also in Germany and Austria, the impression is prevalent that the United States is lending its moral support to the English and their lackeys. What other impression could one gain, reading our Anglophile press? We German-Americans realize that this impression is artificially created and totally false. In Europe, one does not know that the great American dailies, the New York ones above all others, are obviously under British influence and do not reflect, to any degree, American public opinion. And it is not an overstatement to claim that the greater part of the American people has not adopted the attitude of <span class="page-break">4</span>the English language press in this country.</p>
   <p>The American people is composed of many nationalities. One-fifth of it--many even say one-fourth--claims German descendancy. None of these Americans is at present in love with England. Neither can we consider as Anglophiles the millions of Irish who have found a second home in the New World. The Swedes, and perhaps the Norwegians, too, are taking Germany's side during the present settling of accounts with England and Russia, even though their homelands are still neutral. Even a large portion of the Slavic population may side with Germany and Austria, rather than with the Czar and his allies. The Poles are too familiar with the Russian knout to espouse the cause of its wielder, and the Bohemian Czechs will not be particularly interested in becoming subjects of the Czar. There may be many other nationalities in Uncle Sam's domain which can be counted among Germany's friends, and consequently among the enemies of Russian despotism, British perfidy, and French revengefulness. The impression, created by the English language press of this country (always pretending to be the mouthpiece of public opinion), that America would stand with England as one man, is an arrogance <span class="page-break">5</span>which has to be taken down a few notches, and is also a stupidity which, in time, will come to be recognized.</p>
