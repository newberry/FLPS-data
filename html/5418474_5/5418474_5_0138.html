   <p>My Dear Friend: In your letter of recent date your asked me to tell you why an American citizen should buy as many Victory Liberty Loan bonds as possible. You say that you cannot see why the Government is asking its citizens for more money, or why it is borrowing so great a sum now, since the war with the Central Powers is ended; you hint that something may be "rotten". You say that somebody has told you that the large sums of money raised through the Liberty Loans have not been used honestly, have not been applied to legitimate purposes; and that it is being whispered about that the money is not safe in the hands of the Government.</p>
   <p>Well, I am not a businessman, and it is not a part of my work to advise other people on money matters. But I am an American citizen; I love this country with all my heart; I aim to protect its welfare. Therefore, I shall tell you what I think about the Loan and the objections which you mentioned.</p>
   
   <p>It is true that we are all happy because the terrible war is past, and because our American soldiers were especially instrumental in bringing about the Armistice. But you must not forget that our Government had placed contracts for great amounts of war materials, long before the conclusion of the war; that it was necessary to transport several million soldiers to the battlefield, where they had to be provided with all necessities; that more than a million of them are still "over there" and will have to be supported by our country until they return; that they are to be brought back in due time; and that the Government must care for those who have returned home but are not able to obtain employment, so that they do not employ unlawful means to make a living, for such a procedure would be a grave danger to our welfare. And not millions, but billions of dollars are necessary to carry on these postwar activities. And where is the Government to get this money, if not from the citizens of our country? The Government could raise the sums by taxes, but who, besides the rich, could pay such high taxes? And the Government would rather borrow from us than impose new heavy burdens upon us. Is this not as it should be? We have elected our Government, and have given it authority to declare war against enemies; we have co-operated with the Government in the war against the Central Powers; through our Government we incurred these large war expenditures; will we desert the Government now and say to it: "Of what concern are the soldiers to us? That is your business!" Would that be right? Would it be honorable? Would it be honest?</p>
   <p>A businessman accepts the responsibility for any official act which an employee performs. He will back the employee with all that he (the businessman) possesses. Should not we citizens of the United States back our Government in everything it has done in our name and at our request? No government could maintain the respect of the rest of the world, or of its own subjects, if it did not meet its honest obligations. So we must all participate in purchasing bonds, in order that our Government may keep its good name!</p>
   <p>Thus I have also explained why our Government wishes to borrow so large an amount this time. It is merely because the obligations are correspondingly great. And this is to be the last loan. Previous loans were floated to prepare for war, but this loan is to be used for demobilization and other peacetime purposes.</p>
   <p>You believe that previously borrowed money was not rightfully used. It is true that the newspapers made statements to that effect. Anyone who can bring proof should do so; I am sure that our Government would be very grateful. But consider the speed and quantity necessary in the manufacture of articles used to carry on the War. It is possible that under these conditions many mistakes could have been made. Our Government is no more faultless than its citizens. And if dishonest acts occurred here and there, it should not surprise us. For we know that not all people are honest. But our Government did not make the alleged mistakes intentionally, nor did it tell anyone to be dishonest. Much less did it approve of anyone's dishonest acts. We can only sympathize with our Government if its confidence has been so shamefully abused. But under no circumstances may we withhold our aid in raising the required money. Moreover, all loyal citizens are duty bound to support and strengthen our Government, especially at this time.</p>
   <p>And, finally, it is your opinion that the money might not be safely invested. Who told you that? If you are looking for the safest and most profitable way to invest your surplus money, you can find no better opportunity. These bonds are as secure as our Government. They are secured by all the property of the United States, and by the honest intention of your fellow citizens to pay back the borrowed money. No greater security can be found anywhere. So, why do you hesitate?</p>
   <p>Now I shall sum up the reasons why I think you should participate in the purchase of the Victory Liberty Loan. 1) Because as a good American citizen, it is your duty to help the Government dispose of its obligations; 2) Because mistakes which may have been made in contracting for large quantities of war materials are not good reasons for withholding your help; 3) Because the investment is as safe as any could be, and, at the same time very profitable.</p>
   
   <p>And now, my young friend, do your duty as a patriotic citizen, and buy as many bonds as you possibly can.</p>
   <p>Sincere greetings from</p>
