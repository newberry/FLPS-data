   <p>Whatever may be the political and individual faults of Theodore Roosevelt, he is a very fascinating personality, whose speeches never miss their mark. It was understood and to be expected, that this impulsive person would take the opportunity to express his opinion about the present war. In an article of a New York weekly newspaper, of which he has been an advising editor until recently, he states:</p>
   <p>"I admire and esteem the German Nation. I am proud of every drop of German blood, which runs in my veins. If a nation finds itself in a position of life and death, it is natural and inevitable to act in such a manner to save oneself from a natural death. This refers of course to the so-called violation of the Belgian Treaty, which made it a cause of honor for Great Britain to make war on Germany."</p>
   <p>An other motive has now been found by the enemies of Germany, saying, that the German militarism is an armed danger to humanity, and consequently must be destroyed. Theodore Roosevelt has made Bismarck policy of armed peace his own, when he was President of the U. S. A. Already in the year 1904 Roosevelt announced that the Republic could only be safe from foreign attacks and a guaranteed peace, if she had a fleet big enough to withstand any combination of foreign fleets. In his present article Roosevelt expresses again the necessities of peace, which must be maintained at any cost, even at the cost of War. With regard to the present war, the nations should seriously consider an understanding by which the peace should be maintained by force of arms. Such an arrangement which should specify the inviolable rights of a nation, would be a great relief to the military nations, and would render a partial disarmament possible. If the rights of one nation are violated, the matter should be investigated by the other nations, and settled by arbitration. In case one of the two disagreeing nations should not submit to the findings of the other nations, and wishes to go to war, she should be opposed with arms by all the other nations. Roosevelt has been a great student of the German state's policy. Starting with Bismarck till the present day, the German army organization was a measure for the protection of their own and European peace.</p>
   
   <p>In the last forty-four years the whole world was involved in smaller or larger wars, Germany alone could enjoy the blessings of peace. And just for that reason, that the greatness and strength of the German army commanded peace and other nations who wanted war, dared not involve themselves. It is said that German militarism is a danger. Naturally it is a danger and will remain so for all nations, which intend robbery of land and commerce and wish to destroy weaker nations, but it is a guarantee of peace for all honest nations, who peacefully work and do not wish to be deprived of the fruits of their labor. The article of Roosevelt has given us a sincere pleasure not only because it gives to the Germans their due respect, but also it shows in a logical deduction that the so-called German militarism is a necessity for the maintenance of peace.</p>
