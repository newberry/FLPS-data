   <p>England's sea warfare resembles the practices of the pirates and buccaneers of bygone days. In order to understand this, let the following questions be answered: Who gave England the right to assume police powers on the high seas and to proceed according to her own arbitrary rules? Why did the rest of the nations yield to England's domination of the seas? Nobody could object if a belligerent nation stopped and seized vessels traveling under an enemy flag, but our sense of justice is outraged if ships of neutral nations are stopped and detained under some pretext. The same power which assumes the privilege to disregard utterly the rights of neutrals just because she has the strongest navy, determines also what is to be war contraband and what is not. This is extremely unfair, and the only reason neutral nations put up with it is because they are too weak to make an affective protest. The real <span class="page-break">\2</span>nature of the pirate now becomes obvious. His motto is: "Might before right!" It makes no difference whose trade rights are violated; be it the United States, Holland, Sweden, or Italy, England just laughs about it. She has the largest navy and can get away with it without fear of punishment. And the worst aspect of this brutal tyranny is that the neutral states do not even have the moral strength for a concerted protest against this piracy on the high seas. If England is permitted to declare any kind of merchandise contraband, under the pretext that it might strengthen the war effort of the enemy, then this assumption of power may easily lead to an absolute domination of the seas which should be free traffic lanes for all nations. This is only a step short of actual war, and for all practical purposes England today is engaged in warfare against the commerce of all seafaring neutral nations.</p>
   <p>This piratical nation [England], which is still unjustly called civilized, not only aims to protect herself by cutting the enemy's supply lines, but clumsily attempts to concentrate all world trade in her own hands. That <span class="page-break">\3</span>seems to be her main and ultimate purpose in the present conflict. The chicaneries against neutral shipping can only have one aim: to establish a monopoly for the British merchant marine. The business world will be compelled to do their shipping in British vessels, since neutral boats are so "unreliable". This is the practice of a crooked, unfair, and conniving competitor who would destroy the means of livelihood of a rival by unfair methods. While Russians, French, Japanese, Hindoos from India, and savages from Africa are fighting for their "honor," Britannia is sitting in her office, conducting a business war against Holland, Sweden, Norway, Italy, and America, employing gangster methods. The profit motive is never lost sight of. When the war is over, this "noble," "righteous," and "pious" bunch of highjackers hope to have cornered the larger portion of all world trade. "Might before right!" What the Germans were accused of by these bigoted Pharisees, is now being carried out to the last brutal consequence by the British themselves.</p>
   <p>Britain's objective is to regain the lost domination of the high seas. She <span class="page-break">\4</span>has never fought for ideals, no matter how many times she professes to "fight for European civilization and against Prussian militarism". The world should know by now that such words do not mean a thing when they are uttered by English shopkeepers. Civilization to a Britisher means the monopoly of world trade and nothing else. His strength lies in his geographical position. The English Channel is the gateway through which world trade must pass. John Bull, the pirate, is waiting in his hideout to pounce upon the unsuspecting wayfarer. London is to become the clearing house for all overseas trade.</p>
   <p>Once it was that way. France and the German free cities [Hamburg, Luebeck Bremen] could tell a tale about it. Calais, which is today the most important point on the French channel coast for German military strategy, was once wrested from the British after stubborn fighting. But the French were unable to press their advantage. The English Channel provided a monopoly for that island pirate's nest, a monopoly which neither France nor Germany were able <span class="page-break">\5</span>to break. Before this war broke out, the latter almost put a dent in the British trade monopoly. The present war is being waged because of it. British is hellbent to regain her lost superiority in world commerce. Her very existence and future depend on it. To achieve her purpose will take time, that's why England announces that "the war will last for years". She says she'll never give in. Such statements are supposed to bluff her allies and the rest of the world. It is obvious that Britain cannot gain control over the entire world trade in a few short months. Neutral shipping cannot be wiped out that quickly. Worth-while things take time to accomplish. Therefore, the Allies have to keep on fighting until England has reached her goal. At least that is the secret desire of the London gang of diplomats. But the public is fooled according to a different recipe: "We are fighting for civilization and the independence of Belgium and the little countries, which Prussian militarism would like to swallow."</p>
   <p>The gigantic joke which is being played here on the emotions and sentiments <span class="page-break">\6</span>of people will never work. The arrogance and insolence displayed by a relatively small gang of shopkeepers cannot be tolerated any longer by the world. On the contrary, it is the trend of the times to grant equal rights to even the smallest nation in the great family of nations. Universal democracy will spell England's doom. These hypocrites have done more to discredit the idea of democracy than even the Czarist regime. All idealistic and ethical concepts have been brazenly aborted by this shopkeeper tribe. In view of this fact, we are truly amazed at the tender love displayed by the American press for British interests, to tally disregarding our own American interests. The American press should rise in unanimous protest against England's interpretation of international law regarding contraband goods, and against her arbitrary laws to be obeyed by American businessmen. A German protest would probably have an adverse effect. Our own arguments would a priori be rejected as being subjective. We would promptly be accused of speaking for Germany and Austria-Hungary, and even if we should affirm a thousand times to be speaking for the United States, <span class="page-break">\7</span>it still would do us no good. But a day will come when the Anglomaniacs will come out of their trance. Then we will find out who can claim to have been a "real American". We can safely predict today that precious few of our leading newspaper owners and editors can be counted among them.</p>
   <p>The open partisanship for "Dear Old England," an obvious betrayal of American principles, will bear bitter fruit! There is no civic pride to be gained by it. On the contrary, it seems that some people are beginning to be ashamed of being Americans. But once a people have ceased to fight for their unalienable rights, it will be just too bad. We would not give three pennies for such a state or nation. It is certainly nothing to be proud of to belong to a nation of moral cowards!</p>
