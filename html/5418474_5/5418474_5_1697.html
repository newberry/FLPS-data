   <p>In a recently published monthly bulletin the Federal Reserve Board declared that all factors in production, labor as well as capital, must bear a part of the burden of economic adjustment. But Frank W. Morrison, Secretary of the American Federation of Labor, immediately objected. He declared that organized labor will refuse to help bear the consequences of price fixing, if labor's standard of living is thereby jeopardized. In other words: Organized labor is opposed to any reduction of wages, for it is certain, and natural, and self-evident, that the standard of living of all those whose wages are cut will be endangered.</p>
   <p>As matters stand today, a decrease in income--substantial and general-for union members is out of the question unless the decrease is preceded by a <span class="page-break">\2</span>reduction in prices. If wages are cut, the cost of living must drop, so that a relatively adequate standard of living is assured. In other words, the purchasing power of the dollar must be raised, and this rise must be substantial, if we are to expect organized labor to acquiesce in a wage reduction.</p>
   <p>To find ways and means of making an adjustment as outlined above is a task which is worthy of the efforts of the noblest and wisest, and involves great effort and headaches. As yet no one has solved the problem. And it may be fortunate that it cannot be solved by a program which has been conceived and recommended by any individual or any individual group, but must be delivered to Father Time for solution. That will very likely be the outcome. However, that is no reason why we should remain idle and resort to watchful waiting. Even though reconstruction and readjustment cannot be brought about quickly by the mind and the will power of an individual, it can and will be achieved if every one desires it, and they who are in the fortunate position of being able to contribute toward rapid readjustment, even at a great temporary sacrifice, will be mindful of their responsibility.</p>

   <p>The Industrial Council of the Department of Commerce evidently had this in mind when it decided in favor of the program which it recommended to the Government, and which the Government accepted. Stabilization of the prices of merchandise is the object of this program; and in this instance that means decrease in the price of merchandise--steel, building materials, textiles, and foods. Whenever the wish or request is not heeded and there is no reduction in prices, the Industrial Council of the Department of Commerce will invite the members of the industry involved to a conference and explain the seriousness of the general situation and advise immediate compliance with the Council's request.</p>
   <p>The Industrial Council stated yesterday that an enormous increase in business would occur in every part of our country as soon as the prices for the main commodities have been set within reasonable limits; that lack of stocks, postponement of necessary building activity, and the tendency in many industries to wait in idleness will cease as soon as prices for textiles, iron, steel, etc., drop; and that when this stable foundation has been laid, normal business conditions will ensue under the law of supply and demand.</p>

   <p>"Nothing ventured, nothing gained." It will require sacrifices to shorten the distressing period of reconstruction and readjustment, with its constant worries and ever-increasing losses, and to bring about good times. According to the plan of the Department of Commerce these sacrifices are to be made by those who can afford them, and who will benefit most by the revival of industry and commerce and the prospective good times.</p>
   <p>Industry must bear the first loss in the interest of reconstruction. Then the cost of living will drop to such an extent that wage rates will automatically be decreased without a lowering of the standard of living.</p>
