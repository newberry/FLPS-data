   <p>Unless Judge Elbert H.Gary issues an unequivocal public statement in the meantime, the strike of the steel workers will undoubtedly be the main topic of discussion at the industrial conference which has been called together by President Wilson. But anyone familiar with the circumstances can predict that the conference will not settle any essential issues. The union representatives--they represent the American Federation of Labor exclusively--will dish out a lot of clap-trap about the services which they have rendered to the country during the war. That is their only ace-in-the-hole, and since serious problems of national economics are at stake it is a pretty shabby argument.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The failure of the strike at Charles Schwab's Bethlehem Steel Works, which are not part of the steel trust, gives us the explanation for other strikes which have been ordered at various other plants since the end of the war. We say "ordered" advisedly, in order to point out the intent and the purpose of these radical measures. But it is a different matter with spontaneous conflicts that start without announcement, and to these we will give our special attention.</p>
   <p>In eighty percent of these strikes which have been ordered in large concerns, the system of collective bargaining was already approved in principle by the plant management, and in fifty percent of these cases the system has brought about a noticeable change in working conditions. In two factories where the system had been introduced, the workers, by means of industrial election granted them, had elected a majority of committee members of especially radical attitudes, who liked their new responsibility so well that they became enthusiastic spokesmen of the representative system. Then union officials ordered a strike in several departments of those two giant concerns <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>which I have in mind, and the management was forced to shut the plant down completely for weeks. At the time of reopening, an attempt to re-establish the factory representative system failed, because the former factory committees were falsely accused of having made secret deals with the "business agents".</p>
   <p>But the reorganization of the economic life of the nation presents the same vital problem for the citizens of this country that it has presented the citizens of all the countries in Europe. Therefore, the rational and practical solution of these problems should not be left to an industrial conference controlled by two elements and called together by the President. These issues cannot be settled fairly in this way, because one side does not participate with an honest desire to represent the interests of the huge producing masses, but rather to negotiate shady deals on behalf of a small group of privileged colleagues, and primarily to pave the way for political job-hunting during the next presidential campaign. Fortunately, not all employers and daily papers become hysterical when some one tries to put <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>a finger on the cause of social unrest. Once upon a time, when the tremendous natural wealth of the country made exploitation and plunder the order of the day, there were a few far-seeing statesmen and true patriots who tried to forestall a collapse by pointing out the necessity of producing for a world market in the future. When in those days the thinker and national and economist, Karl Marx, exposed the faulty economy of this country by educational and constructive articles, which were published originally and appeared later in the New York Tribune, there were dozens of theorists who absorbed and attempted to put into practice the basic ideas of this earnest researcher....</p>
   <p>Therefore, it will serve our purpose to show by various examples why more and more employers have ceased to fight this system of representation--which we call the "German system", since it originated in Germany, Bohemia, and Austria--and why operators of entire industries, particularly the textile and clothing industries, have realized the fairness and balancing influence of the system. And we must not forget that an overwhelming majority of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>high-salaried union agents delight in branding the advocates of the German system either members of the I.W.W., whose purpose is to undermine the established institutions of the country, or as German spies (which happened to me, although I am an Englishman by birth). But that did not prevent the more understanding and progressive employers from examining this system very carefully, not so much because they hoped by favoring it to eliminate the class struggle between capital and labor through a sort of harmonious association, but rather because experience had taught them that by conceding joint responsibility in the production process the disciplined workers themselves would be the best guarantee for a well-run plant and that the incentive for greater production would eliminate all inclinations for sabotage. We repeat, therefore, that the return to normal conditions, the beginning of reconstruction, and the elimination of exploitation will be brought about more quickly in this country when labor representation by factory committees has taken the place of labor representation by paid "business agents," who do not labor productively, neither in the industry nor anywhere else.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>But many employers have made the mistake of introducing this system without first acquainting their employees with their decision. The justifiable suspicion which this procedure aroused among the workers, and which was augmented by outside agitators, was the reason why certain elements tried to outlaw the system. These elements, which were governed by material and political interests, found it expedient that the masses of the workers should not be represented by men from their own ranks during controversies between labor and plant management.</p>
   <p>Since the statements made by Judge Elbert H. Gary before the Senate Committee furnish material for comparisons, we will use the following sketch to clarify the essential differences between the two systems.</p>
   <p>The great, uncalled-for [by union agents] strike of the textile workers of Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1912 indirectly affected over a million workers. It was falsely claimed that leaders of the I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the World) had instigated and directed the strike and that they had finally <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>brought it to a conclusion through negotiations.</p>
   <p>Of interest to our purpose is a comparison of the representatives of the strikers who appeared before that Senate Committee, which, like the present Committee in the steel strike, had to search for the causes of the textile strike. Senator Poindexter of Washington was at that time Chairman of the Senate Investigating Committee. During the present investigation of the steel workers' strike, only outside union agents have been called upon to testify. So far not a single steel worker has been asked or invited to testify. According to Fitzpatrick, the reason for this distinction is that no Americans are employed in the shop.</p>
   <p>In Lawrence, and Lowell, Massachusetts, the strikers included twenty-four nationalities. But they did not permit union agents or officials to present their cause before the Senate Committees. They testified themselves, and their children and wives acted as witnesses; even the wife of President Taft was deeply moved when she heard of the testimony of these factory children [sic]. Not a single testimony of these direct representatives of the workers <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>could be invalidated or branded as untrue. But during the cross-examination in the steel strike investigation, Gary has managed to disprove the most important testimony given by union officials.</p>
   <p>The pressure of public opinion at that time forced the American Woolen Company to capitulate. Their willingness to bargain collectively with the workers' representatives for the adjustment of poor working conditions inaugurated the introduction of the "German system" which is outlined above. A person who is not a producing worker is not allowed to perform on the committees, which are composed of ten workers' representatives: ten men and women who represent ten different nationalities; thus they are compelled to fight for their own cause and to bargain directly with their employers on market conditions, values, fair competition laws, and the like.</p>
   <p>The settling of this strike was instrumental in bringing about a better understanding of the system which, as we will undertake to prove further, will inevitably find favor in this country among thinking and progressive- <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>minded workers, since it provides the best guarantee against violent and brutal labor disputes.</p>
