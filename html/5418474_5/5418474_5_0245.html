   <p>"A league of nations in which the small and the great, the weak and the strong will have equal representation?"--a very pleasant dream, indeed; but sometimes dreams come true.</p>
   <p>"A league of nations, which shall decide any and every matter of dispute between any and every state or nation, which decisions shall be acknowledged as binding by all?" Yes, I hear the news, but I do not believe it.</p>
   <p>"A league of all nations for the purpose of preventing future wars and preserving world peace, on a basis of right and justice?" That is the dream of an idealist <span class="page-break">2</span>in his Nepheloccocygia and can merely provoke the compassionate laughter of practical men.</p>
   <p>Such and similar expressions of ridicule and scorn of President Wilson's ideas of an alliance of all nations were heard in all languages as soon as--not before--the resistance of Germany was broken. And people spoke of President Wilson's Fourteen Points in the same sarcastic, doubting, compassionately superior, and condemning manner, as soon as--not before--peace appeared to be imminent, when the belligerents had signed the armistice, to the terms of which the Germans agreed because they relied on President Wilson's peace program. In America, as well as in the countries of the Allies, where some had previously accepted all of the Fourteen Points with loud acclaim, others silently, "voices" were heard, "important and influential voices," stating that now "the matter was entirely different"; that President Wilson's program for a league of nations and for peace was fine, very fine, yes, ideal, but that just for this reason nobody should believe that it could be <span class="page-break">3</span>carried out; because ideals simply could not be realized in this sober, practical world. It is obvious that the President's program would have to be altered so as to provide for eventualities; his Fourteen Points would have to be essentially restricted. When the President made known his resolve to go to Europe in order to insure the acceptance and execution of his program, many crocodile tears were shed because of the grave disappointment and crushing defeat which were in store for him there. "For," it was said, "he will be dealing with the most prudent, most experienced, and most unscrupulous statesmen of Europe. They know what they want. They will "play cat and mouse with our idealistic professor; their politeness and courtesy will take him in to such an extent, that he will not know what is happening to him, when his program has been so altered that he will not recognize it."</p>
   <p>Those who said that matters would be different were right. Matters did turn out altogether different from what the practical and experienced politicians and statesmen of the superpatriotic opposition had tearfully foretold. If a <span class="page-break">4</span>cat-and-mouse game was played during the past weeks by the representatives of the great powers, then the President played the role of the cat. If anyone was taken in by politeness and dignified courtesy, it was not the President. And if anyone was persuaded to agree to something which had hitherto been distasteful to him, without knowing that he was being persuaded, then this "anyone" was the European statesmen and diplomats who declared a league of all nations to be an impossibility and a world peace an unattainable ideal for which anyone should strive as little as he would try to grab at the stars in the heavens.</p>
   <p>For the organization of the league of nations is assured. The league for world peace is as good as established. President Wilson dominates the Peace Conference, and his opponents do as he wishes. As they were forced to agree to the idea of a league of nations, so they will also be forced to grant the German Republic membership in it, and to acknowledge, and conscientiously <span class="page-break">5</span>carry out, the whole peace program of the President, as was stated by Senator J. H. Lewis in a speech which he made in New York on Saturday.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the European powers will not unreservedly endorse the President's plan; nor will they agree to it immediately. They will accede to his demands only gradually, and only conditionally, just as they acceded to his ideas in regard to a league of nations and his plans to secure peace. They will prolong, delay, and postpone negotiations, and resort to every ruse known to them, in order to save their faces. Yes, it will require much time and work to obtain recognition and application of the Fourteen Points. But it is already certain that the President will be victorious. It is certain because he has both feet firmly planted on the ground of law and justice, because the strict execution of his program serves the best interests of every individual nations, of all nations, of the entire world, and because the masses among all nations know this.</p>
   <p>At the Peace Conference the President said: "We are not the representatives of <span class="page-break">6</span>governments, but representatives of peoples. It will not suffice to satisfy certain government circles. It is necessary to satisfy the opinion of mankind." And that is the true situation. It is apparent that the representatives of certain European powers have hitherto demanded only what corresponds to the opinions of government circles. But these demands are very different from those of the masses. The masses demand a lasting, sure peace, the Wilsonian peace, and the sooner the governments yield the better it will be for them. The longer they delay, the greater will be the danger that these governments will be overthrown.</p>
