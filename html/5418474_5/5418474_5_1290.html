   <p>Dr. E. Benjamin Andrews, the former manager of the local public schools and present president of the University of Nebraska, has delivered a speech today at the annual convention of the Cook County Teachers Institute in the Normal School; in which he thought that a war between Germany and England was unavoidable. The latter power would ask the U. S. of America for their support, but in vain. Not withstanding this war will give the inducement to the long feared World War, as regards the just finished War between Japan and Russia, Dr. Andrews said, that it was England which induced Japan to give in. If it would not have been for the interference of Albion, the fight would have been still on. Mr. Andrews does not seem to be in accord with the view of most of his compatriots that in the first place it was Pres. Roosvelt's work, to bring about peace between the two nations.</p>
