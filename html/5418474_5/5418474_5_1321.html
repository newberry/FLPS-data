   <p>Who is right? The peace-apostles or the practical statesmen? Those, preaching peace, will say: The increasing armaments are a war-danger. The statesmen on the other hand are convinced, peace can be kept safe by agreements, which should be backed by a good standing army and well prepared navy. So far, all nations followed their statesmen and kept on arming.</p>
   <p>We believe, that armaments are safe money investments to insure peace and guarantee the existing mental attitude of mutual respect among the nations.</p>
   <p>At the same time, peace-aspirations should be fostered to lessen the tension and jealousy of nations. Peace is necessary to develop and steady the progress of human civilization. War in all its horror should be the last way out, if a nation in its struggle for existence is blocked by bitter, pitiless opponents, who recklessly have rejected any reasoning, which is the last appeal of peace.</p>
