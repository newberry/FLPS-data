   <p>An amendment to the new sales tax bill introduced by Senator Lantz will cause anything but joy among the unemployed in Cook County. Should the bill and the amendment be adopted, the responsibility of the state to care for the unemployed in Illinois will cease at the end of this calendar year, and cities of more than 500,000 inhabitants will have to bear the entire burden of feeding and housing those in their midst who have no work or other means of subsistence. In Illinois there is only one city which has a population of more than 500,000 and that is Chicago.</p>
   <p>Whenever taxes are discussed....the legislature at Springfield is always divided into two camps--one representing the cities, and the other the rural districts; and the latter have always looked upon Chicago as the well-known goose that <span class="page-break">2</span>cannot lay enough golden eggs. That was the situation when the state income tax was discussed; it applies also to the gasoline tax, and it will hold good of the new sales tax should the latter be enacted. Chicago and Cook County are obliged to raise money for the state, but when they themselves need money, they must not ask the state for help.</p>
   <p>Senator Lantz certainly thought that he was very generous when he inserted in his amendment the provision that Chicago should have the right to levy new municipal taxes in order to take care of its needy, who does not shudder at this provision? The sales tax was originally intended solely for relief purposes. The first version of this tax law having been declared unconstitutional, Springfield now offers an improved edition. It is true that this time the sales tax is to be used to decrease old tax assessments, especially those on real estate. And since Chicago must certainly count upon being called upon to support many unemployed next year, it will have to levy new taxes to finance expenditures necessary for relief of these needy.</p>

   <p>Naturally, the question arises, Who is to carry this great burden?</p>
   <p>No doubt the communities should be chiefly responsible for the welfare of their indigent, and under normal conditions that arrangement is feasible. However, present economic conditions are not normal, but very abnormal, and exceptional measures are in order. The counties have always provided for the care of some poor people, but only in a very moderate degree, while private organizations have borne the greater share of the burden of charity. Only when the need increased to such proportions that private sources of help were not adequate to meet the demands for aid, did the state take a hand in the matter by establishing public relief for the unemployed. It is certain that there will be a return to the old method of dispensing charity, as soon as it can be done without danger to the social conditions in the state. However, at present the need is still great, and it would be playing with fire if Chicago tried to relieve the state of its responsibility today and endeavor to carry the entire load alone.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>And who can predict today what conditions in the state will be like at the end of this year? Nobody. Hence the state should wait some time before it proceeds to alter the present method of poor relief. At all events, Springfield should keep one thing in mind: Our people would be satisfied with a sales tax which is just to all taxpayers, provided the proceeds were used solely for financing the relief of the needy. But if it is to be merely a supplementary tax, it will never be approved by the people. Experience teaches us how much value we can place on the promise that the sales tax will be used to reduce the old taxes. Many such reductions have been promised, but the promises have never been kept. So if relief is to be financed by other means, then the sales tax is superfluous.</p>
   <p>The Lantz Amendment, which was passed by the Senate, is another proof that Springfield is often politically shortsighted and selfish. The public has every reason to follow the further development of the proposed sales tax. Our representatives are concocting a medicine which apparently will not be <span class="page-break">5</span>conducive to the health of Chicago.</p>
