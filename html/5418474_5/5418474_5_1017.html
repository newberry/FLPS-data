   <p>The strict preservation of "our" neutrality becomes more difficult every day. From the time that the neutrality regulations were promulgated, telling us how "we" should behave, almost all of these rules have been violated. Neither the press nor the public has paid any attention to them. The English [language] newspapers have hardly changed their original prejudiced attitude. Occasionally, impartial reports, based on incontrovertible facts, find their way into an American newspaper, but the next day, sure enough, the same old unreliable and unqualified news items appear again. The reports, which seem to have an objective character, are so only because the cold facts cannot be denied any longer. Facts talk louder than prejudices or sentiments. Facts cannot be suppressed for any length of time. But these undeniable facts are not welcomed very much and, in some quarters, even tend to increase the dislike [for Germany]. The true sentiment then reveals itself, namely, a hostile attitude toward Germany <span class="page-break">\2</span>and her ally, Austria-Hungary.</p>
   <p>English-speaking lecturers and orators never miss a chance to tell the citizens of this Republic about the noble and sublime cause for which the Allies are fighting. Not only politicians, but even scientists are unable to control their temper any longer, and the more the Allied armies have to retreat before superior German technique and morale, the uglier this temper becomes. Dr. Charles W. Eliot, too old to function as the head of Harvard University any longer, declared that it was the duty of the United States to support England and France. Of the same opinion are Professor Leo Wiener, Congressman Gardener of Massachusetts, our humane."superdreadnaught," Roosevelt, Dr. James R. Day, Chancellor of the University of Syracuse, and many others. In the New England States, a silent sympathy for "Dear Old England" has given way to an openly hostile attitude toward Germany, and this attitude is not frowned upon, in spite of our official neutrality. If any further proof were needed of this secret love for Johnny Bull, it was furnished by that passionate outburst of the long-suppressed feelings of Congressman Gardner of Massachusetts. Let us not deceive ourselves: It <span class="page-break">\3</span>is not the French, it is not the Belgians, who cause those pangs in the breasts of New Englanders, but only and solely the plight and fate of Old England, which New England is still making her own. The Declaration of Independence never meant, to New Englanders, more than a beautiful piece of literature. After all, all they did was oppose some obnoxious tax, imposed by England. Otherwise, there was no quarrel at all between those Puritans over here and the ones across the Atlantic. The spiritual and cultural ties between Old England and New England never did suffer on account of "Independence". On the contrary, they have become more firm and solid. We have to reckon with these facts, and the day may come when those voices which, for the time being, demand moral support for the Allies, will swell to a mighty chorus and openly advocate practical [military] aid for England. This is the whole thing in a nutshell.</p>
   <p>It can hardly be supposed that a Yankee could become enthusiastic over France's political welfare, or that of the Belgian king and his people. Still less could he warm up to Russia and her type of culture.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>When a Yankee talks about the Allies, he has in mind the land of his ancestors and nothing else. We cannot believe that such learned men as Eliot, Day, and Company do not know what Germany has given America. They know that it is sheer nonsense to praise France and England as America's sole benefactors, and from this to assume definite duties which this Republic must fulfill in return. If these gentlemen were really interested, in a scientific way, in finding the sources from which this country gained knowledge and wisdom, they could not name England and France without mentioning Germany also. It seems to us that, with these Anglophiles, it is considered good form to condemn any culture, except the Anglo-Saxon, as a lamentable phenomenon which should really be ignored. Within a short time, this question will become urgent: Is this country still a British Colony or has the American of today, composed of many races, vitality enough to shake off, at last, the yoke of Old England? This Republic is not the land of the Yankees any longer. The blood of all white nations courses in the veins of the present-day American, and the Anglo-Saxon heritage is certainly not the most valuable one in this mixture.</p>
   <p>The fact that the Pilgrim fathers arrived here some years ahead of the Germans, <span class="page-break">\5</span>Dutch, Scandinavians, and Slavs, does not establish any property rights to the country for the descendants of the former. When we watch these "noble" descendants [of the Pilgrim fathers and Puritans] strut their Yankee stuff today, let us bear in mind that their forebears used to colonize according to the proven formula of Old England, namely, by driving the natives [Indians] from their possessions, by slaughtering them, and poisoning those who were left with bad whiskey. The day is not far distant when this "pure-blooded Yankee caste," with its arrogant behavior, will have to step down as the ruling class of this Republic, and hand over the reins to the true Americans. The hyphenated Americans are essentially better American citizens than the Yankees in New England, now going crazy over Old England.</p>
   <p>The Germans and their descendants, who have found a home over here, reject the insinuation that they intended to remodel this country in German style. And just as emphatically do they reject that fixed idea of the Yankees, according to which immigrants are only tolerated here. The latter have not received any benefits from the former. On the contrary, the immigrants proved of immeasurable <span class="page-break">\6</span>value to the Anglo-Saxon American, and helped him to acquire vast riches, which he believes were the result of his own smartness. The Yankee knew well how to exploit the diligence, the conscientiousness, and all the other virtues which characterize a good citizen. It is so typically Anglo-Saxon to let others do the hard work and then claim the credit for having built up this Republic! The credit that Eliot and Company give to the English and, to some extent, to the French, should, for the greater part, really go to the Germans. We do not claim any special privileges for the Germans at the expense of other national groups; we realize, better than any other people (and that includes the Yankees), that every individual within the framework of the community can produce material and cultural values which, in the nature of things, are of benefit to all. But neither do we concede any privity to any other national group, least of all to the Yankee, who is definitely on the decline, who has long ceased to be creative, and is destined to be absorbed as the less vital part in the mixture of races from which a strong American nation is growing. The last stronghold of Yankeedom is in the East. In the Central, Southern and Western states it has no foothold. We are not at all amazed to see men of learning in the Eastern universities try, <span class="page-break">\7</span>again and again, to revive the Morribund idea of the "historical cultural union" between this Republic and Old England. The last representatives of this fossil idea are now attempting, more eagerly than ever, to foist their doctrines on the great masses in this country, knowing full well that their influence is on the decline. The progressive forces in this Republic will certainly not be found in the East among the direct descendants of the British, but rather among the hardy Teutons and Scandinavians and--let us be fair--the Slavs, living in the Middle West and in the Northwest. There is the cradle of the America of the future. At present, we can barely discern the beginning. The speeches of the Roosevelts, Eliots, Gardeners, and Days reflect nothing but an impotent rage at not being able to come to the aid of their "blood relatives" with a powerful army and a fleet. The same people who are raving against "Prussian militarism" would like nothing better than to import a similar brand over here, and with all the trimmings--if they only could! But we say to them that a Yankee cannot be good at everything, and least of all does he possess any talent for organization on a large scale. He will always and forever remain an individualist; community spirit and interest in the common good are not among the things that worry him <span class="page-break">\8</span>much. That is why his pretended sympathy for France and Belgium is nothing but a cheap sham. The Russians are not even worthy of mention. They are hated for the same reasons as are the Germans.</p>
