   <p>An address on thorough Americanism, delivered by Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman before the German club.</p>
   <p>True Neutrality.</p>
   <p>The members of the Germania Club appeared in full numbers at the luncheon in the Hotel Sherman, yesterday, to listen to the speaker of the day, the well-known and greatly respected United States Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman. The president of the club, Mr. Henry G. Zander, introduced the representative of the state of Illinois, in the United States Senate, with a few words, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but it took several minutes, before the applause subsided, with which Senator Sherman was welcomed..........</p>
   <p>Leading over to his theme, the Senator declared, that he found only in New York so many citizens of German descent, as in his own state, Illinois. He always found it true, that in the larger mixture of races, the national character of the Germans, is entirely different from those of the Latin races. While the latter can mostly be found in the cities, the former make their homes preferably in the country. It is the farm, from which everything in the house and hotel comes, and he, himself, who comes from a farm, has found that the Germans and their related tribes, are producing more than any other nationality. If they are not educated in some profession, than they work with their hands, and are not too proud, to tackle most anything.</p>

   <p>He, himself, worked for 23 years with his hands and considers it just as honor-able and useful, as the law, because the farmer gains new products from the ground, is in fact a creator, while the lawyer produces mostly only fights at the cost of those who disagree. The Germans supplied us with many things. In chemistry, medicine, chirurgy, music and literature, they gave us many treasures.</p>
   <p>I am neutral: Just as there are many countries, so are there different governments; but where a person is born, his sympathies must remain there. In our republic all have the same rights to their liberty, the rights to their individuality and possessions.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Here we have a free church, free from the state's influence, but under its protection, but without its support. We have accepted in our development everything from other nations, and all who come here, had personal motives, why they traveled thousands of miles for doing so. I am for military instruction of all men from the 17th to the 55th year. - I am not for a 7 year military service, but if circumstances demand it, the country should possess-a reserve strength, which can furnish protection against all dangers.</p>
   <p>Our country is the greatest Republic on earth, but if we want to preserve, and bequeath it to our descendants, in that case we must work for it.</p>
