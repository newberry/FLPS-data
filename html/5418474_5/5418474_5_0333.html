   <p>The approaching "new time" is the time of the people, the time of the self-determination of the German people; the time in which the German people will be their own master; the time when Germany will be a democracy.</p>
   <p>The tribe to which Count Hertling [Translator's note: then Chancellor of the German Reich] belongs, and "which will die out under the roar of the cannon," is the tribe which, full of arrogance and strength, unyielding and unmindful of the right of the people, was and still is the support and pillar of the "by-the-grace-of-God" idea, and military, as well as feudal, class rule. It is the tribe which, forced by <span class="page-break">\2</span>inherited privileges, represents the doctrine of might and, in its natural desire to maintain and strengthen its privileges and favorable position, always is more or less openly inclined to put might before right and which, for the sake of self-preservation, fights and has to fight the democratic idea which demands equal rights for the citizens and self-rule for the people.</p>
   <p>Count Hertling is no Junker [Translator's note: Member of aristocratic and autocratic Prussian feudal lords.] in the reactionary sense of the word, but a liberal-minded man. He is, however, of ancient nobility and a typical son of his "family", the member of a privileged and preferred class, whose privileges are rooted in the "by-the-grace-of-God" idea and the autocratic system. He cannot jump out of his skin or change his nature. If he had been a staunch representative of might and autocracy he would have made a different speech (recently in the German <span class="page-break">\3</span>parliament) and would at least have earned the applause of the Junkers. He tried to mediate and found himself sitting between two stools. For there can be no compromise between autocracy, on the one hand, and democracy and people's rights on the other. The German people must be given the right of self-rule. They must become their own master. This will happen in the near future and with it will come a just and lasting peace, which Germany and all the world need so badly.</p>
   <p>A new time--a democratic time--is approaching for Germany, and the knell will sound for militarism and class rule. It must be thus. For they alone stand in the way of a just and lasting peace.</p>
