   <p>The final, peaceful settlement of the Lusitania question is now also admitted by the Anglo-American press. Obviously, the admission is tinctured with considerable reluctance, and sour faces prevail almost everywhere. No wonder, the eventual solution did not meet with the approval of the British, their apparently British friends, and the true American pro-Anglo-Saxon papers. They would have preferred a protracted argument.</p>
   <p>This logical conclusion may be deduced from their general conduct during the entire period.</p>
   <p>Since the very beginning, they have used the Lusitania episode as a most convenient excuse to agitate against Germany. Anything, with or without basis, <span class="page-break">2</span>was regarded as suitable material for provocation and sufficed to supply news for a supposedly sensation-hungry public. On the strength of this, new occurrences were featured, a possible rupture with the Teutons was proclaimed, and even an American war was conjured up. It passed. After President Wilson had declared that the note recently received from Germany was satisfactory, and the question was settled, these newsmongers were confronted with the problem of finding new pastures to satisfy the craving for sensationalism. They should have no difficulty in discovering such virgin grazing grounds, since they always brag of knowing the public. They will find, however, that the people are thoroughly tired of the Lusitania episode, as well as the subsequent anti-German propaganda, and are now definitely interested in strong proceedings against John Bull and dispatches about an impending crisis in his relations with Uncle Sam.</p>
   <p>It was not always thus, and it cannot be denied that the death of the 115 Americans who perished with the ill-fated ship, affected and excited our citizens, and aroused thoughts of vengeance in the majority of the pro-British <span class="page-break">3</span>elements. There is no doubt that Wilson's first note to Germany coincided with the general trend at that time and that he acquiesced to public sentiment. Perhaps the communication was not intended to be as serious as its phraseology indicated. The milder tone of the second and subsequent pronunciamentos appears to prove it. Of course, it is also probable that Wilson, observing a gradual subsiding of the clamor, modified his views and desisted from extreme demands, knowing they were not based on justice and, therefore, unsuitable. In spite of this, the old adages, Time is the greatest ally of truth and righteousness, Gain time and win, asserted themselves. The two governments deserve commendation for their settlement of the Lusitania question. Considering time as an important factor, they helped the public to regain its poise, thereby enabling the statesmen to peruse the matter in an unhurried, impartial manner, which eventually brought a settlement of mutual satisfaction, founded on prevailing public opinion.</p>
   <p>Only six months ago such arbitration would have evoked protests, because it does <span class="page-break">4</span>not represent a complete victory for the American administration. After all, Germany failed to answer to one of the most pressing demands, the admission that the sinking of the Lusitania was illegal, and Wilson withdrew his request. The settlement is a compromise and suitable for both parties. In general, it should be approved abroad, as well as here. Thanks for the final disposition of this gruesome specter and its potential danger.</p>
