   <p>Branch Number 1 of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society gave a concert and ball November 18 in the Polish Union Hall.</p>
   <p>Branch Number 1 is the largest and the oldest of all the branches of the Independent Society, and is therefore regarded by all Russians in Chicago as the representative branch of the entire organization.</p>
   <p>This concert, the first of the season, may be looked upon as a highly important social event in the life of the entire Russian colony in Chicago and vicinity. The large hall of the Polish Union was filled to the doors long before the concert had started, and not a single seat was vacant. All of Russian "society" and many important personages of the Russian colony, including the old charter members of the Society, were at the concert. The Russian-American youth also was well represented at the concert. Many of the so-called Russian intelligentsia, especially those who are directly or indirectly connected with the <span class="page-break">2</span>life of the local Russian colony, also were present at the concert. This large assembly of Russian people from many walks of life serves as a new proof of the esteem the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society enjoys in the Russian colony in Chicago and in near-by towns. Let us hope that the esteem and popularity of the Independent Society among the Russian people in Chicago will be translated into increased membership of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. Let us also hope that all those Russians who found pleasure and satisfaction at the entertainment given by the Society will likewise find it beneficial to become active members of the organization.</p>
   <p>The hardest years of the economic crisis in America are over. Business and industry seem to be improving from day to day. This means steady employment and steady income for the working people, including Russians. An improvement in the economic condition of the Russian people would enable us, as a group, to accomplish some outstanding work. The construction of our church could be brought to a successful finish. A few more Russian schools for children could be established. A high school and a college for Russian boys and girls could <span class="page-break">3</span>be opened. The colony would be better able to remove from its midst all enemies of the Russian people, and to bar all evil influence intended to disorganize and weaken the Russian national life in this country. The Russian youth could then be better depended upon for co-operation with the older generation.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society appeals to all Russians in Chicago and in surrounding towns who are not yet members of this organization to join its ranks and thus help it to realize the things which are so important to the Russian cause in America.</p>
