   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is the center, the hub, of the entire Russian colony in Chicago and in the Middle West. This organization is chartered and functions as an independent benefit society. The funds of the organization at present reach a total of seventy-five thousand dollars. The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has twenty-six branches, with a total membership of over two thousand persons. The organization's children and youth department has over six hundred members. This department grows steadily, thanks to the new types of insurance which have recently been introduced by the Independent Society. Insurance in the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society costs less than elsewhere, because this organization employs no salesmen or agents who draw high commissions. In this organization, all its members are the salesmen and agents, working willingly without any commission.</p>
   <p>The second part of the work of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that of educational and cultural activity among members of the organization and among Russian people in general. Possessing the financial wherewithal, as a result of its insurance work, this organization is able to indulge in educational and cultural activities among the Russian people, such as conducting Russian schools, organizing concerts, arranging lectures, national festivals, and other similar affairs which aid in the preservation of the Russian language, culture and traditions. Thus we see that the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is actually the core, the central point of everything that is Russian in Chicago and within a long radius around Chicago. The headquarters and offices of this organization, at 917 North Wood Street, have been known to every Russian in the Central and Western states of this country for the last twenty-four years. The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has suffered many hardships and has felt many twinges at the vitals of its existence during these twenty-four years. In addition to the economic battle which it has had to fight throughout its existence, the Independent Society has had to be constantly on the lookout for the hidden enemies who have striven to destroy the organization (the communists). Now, the Russian <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Independent Mutual Aid Society can consider its economic battle won, and its enemies made powerless to inflict any serious harm. This organization's future is now assured.</p>
   <p>The Saint George Brotherhood, Branch Number One of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, is located in the same building as the offices of the organization--917 North Wood Street. This brotherhood has over five hundred and fifty members and it has over ninety-five hundred dollars in funds. There is also located the Holy Mother of God Sisterhood, Branch Number Three of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, with three hundred woman members and four thousand dollars in funds. The Saint George parish is also in this building. This parish is now building a new church, a new school, and a new hall for meetings. Here also is the Russian youth club, which was organized not long ago. The club has over sixty members. The Russian Loan Association, whose capital is more than one hundred thousand dollars, is also located in this building. The Russian School Council is also located in our building. Everyone knows that this Russian stronghold, with a total wealth <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of over a quarter-million dollars, is an eyesore to, and a juicy morsel for, the Russian-American Bolsheviks, who have tried all the vile and insidious means known to them to get hold of this organization. They have failed, however, because all true Russians have refused to follow the Red comrades, and because every sincere Russian now approaching the portals of the Bolshevik hell sees immediately Dante's clearly written words, "All hope abandon, ye who enter here".</p>
