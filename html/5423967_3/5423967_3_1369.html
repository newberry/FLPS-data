   <p>Each year, just before the annual convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, a group of enterprising politicians, led by Mr. Deviatkin, opens a propaganda campaign for the purpose of undermining the foundation of this Russian mutual aid organization and paralizing its activity. Why does this agitation start just before the delegates gather in the city?</p>
   <p>Deviatkin and his accomplices hope that some of the incoming delegates will take their slanderous statements seriously and will embark on the policy which was pursued by the society RNOV (Russian People's Mutual Aid Society) and which led this organization to become an appendage of the Communist party. But every year something contrary to their expectations happens. The more they agitate among the delegates, and the more they slander the existing administration of the Society the greater is the effort made to eject the venomous reptiles from <span class="page-break">2</span>the organization and from the floor of the convention.</p>
   <p>It is unfortunate that such ejections must take place, but there is no alternative when an organization is confronted with a menace of this sort. The members and delegates of the Independent Society should not be blamed for such actions.</p>
   <p>This year the whole performance is being repeated, or rather, rehearsed, once more according to the pattern of preceding years. The same group of irresponsible people, devoid of all scruples and decency, is engaged at the present time in the most disruptive and abominable type of work--work which is harmful to Russian organizations and the Russian people at large. This group of Bolshevik destroyers issues calls for "mass" meetings in the name of some group of alleged members of the Independent Society.</p>
   <p>These meetings are steered and conducted by the same anti-Russian Deviatkin. Of course, no members of the Independent Society ever honor these meetings by their <span class="page-break">3</span>presence, with the exception of two or three men who were expelled from the organization a long time ago for disruptive activity. Mr. Ribak, who just recently fell victim to the "red fever," is one of them.</p>
   <p>These are the people who constitute the group of so-called Independents. Besides Ribak, there is not a man among them who ever had anything to do with the Independent Society. However, this permits Deviatkin to issue calls for meetings and to stage comedies by make-believe Independents. All such proceedings are widely publicized in the Novyi Mir, in the "red" paper, which gloats over the success achieved by its understudy.</p>
   <p>What is the nature of these comedies, in which the leading role is played by Mr. Deviatkin? In these comedies Mr. Deviatkin plays the role of workers' protector, and slings mud at the Independent Society with all the hypocrisy and invective he can muster.</p>
   <p>Deviatkin loudly proclaims that the Independent Society is a White Guard <span class="page-break">4</span>organization, but where are the facts to substantiate this statement? Deviatkin says that RNzOV forces its members to accept new forms of insurance. Who are the White Guards who stand at the head of the Society? All these statements are false. Where is the proof? Ask any member of the organization, or even Mr. Ribak himself--who tries to emulate Mr. Deviatkin--who forced our members to accept new policies, and when? This is a lie. By lies, chicanery, and slander Deviatkin and his accomplices feed RNOV and by the same means they try to capture our organization.</p>
   <p>"Why are the Independents from Wood Street building a new church?" asks this disrupter of the Russian colony. And what would Deviatkin build? A saloon? Deviatkin shouts that RNzOV has no money. That is another lie. RNzOV has never gone to Deviatkin or anybody else for money to pay death or sick benefits to its members. Each year, the Russian colony can read the financial statements of our organization, which are printed in Rassviet. There was one printed on March 16 of this year.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>And why doesn't Deviatkin mention what happened with the treasury of the Russian People's Society after it was consolidated with the International Workers' Order? None of the statements made by Mr. Deviatkin can be substantiated by a single fact. All his claims are based on insinuation and falsehood, and, alas, on the ignorance of the Russian common people who cannot discriminate between their enemies and their friends.</p>
   <p>It is shameful, indeed, that a man who represents himself as a defender of the working class should engage in malicious lies and calumnies. Can the labor movement advance as long as Deviatkin and others like him stand at the head of it? All meetings staged by Deviatkin and directed against RNzOV resemble the circuses which the public attends only once a year because they can spend their evenings in places where they can derive greater benefit. One thing is certain; Workers in the ranks of RNzOV receive more benefits than do those who attend spectacles staged by Deviatkin. He knows it, too. That is why he and his associates try to fabricate as many lies as they can about RNzOV and thus keep workers from joining the Society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Deviatkin and his group know quite well exactly how much money RNzOV has on deposit in the banks, and they are casting envious eyes at its treasury because they are unable to snatch control over it from those who have guarded it for many years.</p>
