   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is the oldest and largest Russian organization of mutual aid in the central states of the United States. The R. I. M. A. S. is a co-operative fraternal organization of mutual aid. Its chief goal is to unite all Slavic people in America into one, great organization of mutual aid.</p>
   <p>Insurance compensation in case of death and financial aid in sickness--these two factors play an important part in the life of a workingman. Although the United States is the richest country in the world, it has no social security system which guarantees to a wage earner's family a certain income in case of his death or sickness.</p>
   <p>Every day experience shows that when the chief wage-earner of a family dies the family has often no means with which to pay even the funeral expenses--and no <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>steady income with which to carry on the family burdens after the loss of the principal provider. On such cases a five-hundred-dollar insurance policy is the best and most reliable friend of the family. But such a friend must be acquired at the proper time--before the emergency arises.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is an organization of self-aid, where-by all members by combined forces and by combined means bring prompt aid to one another in case of need--moral aid and financial aid. The financial aid consists of sick benefits and life insurance. The terms and conditions of its insurance system are the easiest and most convenient for working people. The Society writes its insurance according to the schedule of the American Fraternal Congress. This is the lowest rate schedule in existence. Its sick benefit fund is operated, also, at the lowest rates. For instance, by paying forty cents a month as an assessment, a member, when sick, receives seven dollars a week for twenty weeks as a sick benefit.</p>
   <p>To better understand the life insurance system of our organization, let us take <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the following example: A man thirty years old joins our organization and takes out a one-thousand-dollar life insurance policy. On this policy he pays one dollar and twenty cents a month, or fourteen dollars and forty cents a year, as a premium. If this man lives to the ripe age of seventy years, he will have made forty annual payments of fourteen dollars and forty cents, totaling five hundred and seventy six dollars. But when he reaches that age he will receive back, not the five hundred and seventy six dollars he has paid in, but a full one thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>There may be some who will say that a man can do his own saving without joining an organization, and have as much for his old age, or in case of death or sickness. But it can be stated with certainty that for the worker with modest wages this cannot be so easily accomplished. Even if he should save one dollar every month through his entire life and deposit it in the bank with the greatest regularity, yet at the age of seventy the total amount of his savings, together with interest, would be much smaller than if he had paid the dollar weekly into an insurance organization. And when one is a member of a fraternal society, the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>society sees to it that his dues and his assessments are paid on time by influencing him morally and by other methods, thus saving him the trouble and effort in keeping up bank savings.</p>
   <p>This is why it is so important for every Russian worker to become a member of the R. I. M. A. S. This organization pays him back with a sizable surplus all monthly dues he has paid in. It raises his living standard and lightens his burdens in time of sickness in his home.</p>
   <p>The R. I. M. A. S. appeals to you, Russian reader, and to your family to join its ranks now for your own benefit, and for the benefit of the entire Russian community. Happiness comes through action. And one of your immediate actions should be joining the society and influencing others to do the same.</p>
   <p>Men, women and children can become members of the organization--adults between the ages of sixteen and fifty, and children between the ages of one and fifteen. The monthly dues for children are twenty-five cents a month. The secretary of the society is Mr. Nicolas Kozak.</p>
