   <p>From the past, the program of the society for Technical Aid to the USSR is known to us. This program has been worked out remarkably well, but not a single item of it has been realized in a satisfactory way.</p>
   <p>I shall try to tell briefly what the Chicago branch of the Society for Technical Aid to the Soviet Russia has done for the Russian immigrants in America.</p>
   <p>The desire to get education was aroused in our colony by the Russian People's University which during the short period of its existence has done for the Russian colony a great deal of good. If the Russian People's University were still in existence all traces of illiteracy would have disappeared from our colony. But this did not happen for the following reason:</p>

   <p>Everywhere, at that time, the party organizations did not allow their members to go to the university and to attend the lectures, because the university had been given by the members of certain parties the name of "University of Kolchak." Personally, I was not bothered by the question as to the source from which the university was getting its support. The fact was that the university was doing a great work, and nobody could deny that.</p>
   <p>At the time when the organizing of the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia was started, many were opposed to this undertaking and tried to destroy this society, but their attempts were unsuccessful. The organization was getting more and more firmly established; and when the leaders of the Communist Party learned that they could achieve nothing by attacking the society from outside, they decided to join it and to do their disintegrating work from within.</p>
   <p>The government of the United States was informed about the fact that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in the school some persons were introducing political propaganda in favor of a certain party instead of educational and cultural work. It was resolved therefore to send to the school a squad of policemen. Fifty policemen with several wagons were sent, and all those who were found in the Soviet school were arrested.</p>
   <p>After the arrested persons had been questioned by the police, some of them were released. The remaining ones were deported to Russia.</p>
   <p>The students who had left the People's University had begun to attend the classes of the Soviet school. Many of these students were repelled by the teachers themselves who did not know how to teach properly. Among the teachers only Grodsky was fit for the work he was doing, and he was practically the support of the whole school. When he left the the school, the latter began to go down, and ultimately there were only about ten students left.</p>

   <p>These ten remaining students tried to revive the school. They did their best to help find some teachers. Many persons willing to teach were found, but to tell the truth they were all only half-educated persons.</p>
   <p>After some time a regular teacher came to the school and agreed to take over the teaching. But now it was found that the society did not have enough money in its treasury to pay the teacher. It could provide only the quarters.</p>
   <p>But to have a place for teaching is not sufficient. Experienced teachers also are wanted, and as yet, no such teachers have been found.</p>
