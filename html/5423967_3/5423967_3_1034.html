   <p>Note 3. The treasurer reports to the general membership of all notices mailed to members in arrears and the results of these notices.</p>
   <p>The Treasury of the Club: The funds of the Club consist of the membership entrance fees of fifty cents and monthly dues at twenty-five cents, and returns from lectures, debates, parties, concerts, enterprises and voluntary contributions. Supplementary to note 1: Dues start from the day of admittance.</p>
   <p>Rights and duties of Members: A member paying dues for a period of three months has a right in case of need to ask the organization for assistance. The sum loaned the needy member must be repaid. Loans are given when two members of the Club act as guarantors. The amount of the loan depends upon the size of the treasury, but does not exceed $10.00. Ten percent of all incomes are earmarked for the special expense fund.</p>
   <p>Note: In case of a strike or serious illness, a member may receive a loan when having two guarantors, previous to the designated three-month period. In case the treasury is exhausted, money necessary for regular expenses, may be drawn from the special fund.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Loans of sums to members of the club, accompanied by two guarantor-members of the club, to avoid unnecessary delays are considered extra expenses. Should the extra expense bring the amount on hand to excess of 5% of the monthly income, then the excess for a period of three months is put into the treasury of the Club.</p>
   <p>All matters of importance are taken up and decided at regular membership meetings. There are regular and special meetings. Special meetings are called to amend or to complete one or several points of the constitution, election of members of a committee, treasurer or secretary, and in cases when the general meeting deems it necessary. A regular meeting is considered legal when there are not less than 15 members present.</p>
   <p>Note: In case of absence of the designated number of members, the secretary informs these persons of the date of the next regular meeting which is considered legal, if not less than 15 members are present. Regular meetings are held twice a month on days appointed by the general membership meeting.</p>
