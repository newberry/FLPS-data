   <p>On Saturday and Sunday, May 12 and 13, the twenty-fourth annual convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (RNzOV) was held at the parish auditorium, 917 North Wood Street. At their conventions, members of the Society review their activity of the past year and plan their future work. The first session was to open at three o'clock in the afternoon, but some of the delegates were delayed in arrival and the opening was postponed for an hour.</p>
   <p>After calling the convention to order, M. Gapanovich read into the record the names of the members of the central executive board of RNzOV, and then the names of the delegates chosen for the convention. A roll call revealed the absence of eleven delegates. Motions were made that the convention continue its business since there was a quorum of the delegates present. There <span class="page-break">\2</span>were fifty-one delegates in attendance.</p>
   <p>President Volos opened the session of the twenty-fourth annual convention of RNzOV by reading a statement from the chair. The full text of the statement is given:</p>
   <p>"Esteemed delegates! For the past twenty-four years, we, the representatives of our people's organization, have gathered in annual convention at this time in order to review the accomplishments of our organization and to make plans for our future activity. We do not do this for our personal gain or advancement, but for the common good of all those who are in a strange land. We do it to preserve our Russian name, for our children, for our young generation in America. We are missionaries of our own people, striving to preserve for the longest possible time all that the name of Russia implies. For this purpose, we have chosen the right path--the path of brotherly love, mutual aid, and cultural activity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"It would seem that there ought to be no obstacles in our chosen path and that the idea inspiring us in our work ought to be acceptable to all. But this is not the case. There are people among us who attempt to disrupt the close ties binding the Russian workers and attempt to gain control of them. Experience has indicated that mutual aid societies created on the initiative of the workers themselves have never been supported by men who seek power and control over others. On the contrary, such societies have been systematically destroyed by professional politicians and paid officials from the outside. We have had such officials in the past and there are plenty of them even now.</p>
   <p>"At every step we can see that somebody is trying to hinder our activity, to make our efforts ineffective, to convert our fraternal organization into a political camp, and to drag us into an environment in which we would stagnate, suffocate, and become powerless.</p>
   <p>"It's difficult for us to fight against such disruptive methods, but we, <span class="page-break">\4</span>convinced of the righteousness of our cause, proudly and honorably resist all such encroachments on our independence. A difficult road lies ahead of us, before we can claim victory--before all the Russian people will be convinced of the need of mutual aid and self-respect. Nevertheless, this road is a straight one; it has no detours to lead us astray.</p>
   <p>"The only slogan we have is 'mutual aid'. These two words mean more to us than volumes of written bylaws and constitutions of various political parties. Let us, then, men and women delegates, understand the need of mutual aid and realize its importance. Let us one and all, imbued with love of our Russian people, quietly and rationally--as befits the servants of the people--formulate for ourselves a policy that will ensure the material and spiritual progress of our organization; a policy that will help us to struggle successfully against all obstacles that we may encounter. Let us, therefore, approach our problems in a spirit of confidence and faith in our ultimate success."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>After his speech, Mr. Volos read the names of the members who had died during the year. The chairman asked the delegates to stand up for a moment to honor the memory of those who had passed away. All the delegates rose from their seats. During the past year, twelve members had died. Several of the deceased had belonged to the Society from the very first day of its existence.</p>
   <p>Later on, the convention appointed a committee on credentials consisting of three members. At the same time the convention selected two delegates to maintain order in the auditorium. After this was done, there was a brief recess to allow the credentials committee time for a checkup.</p>
   <p>Ejection of the Representative from RNOV</p>
   <p>After a while Chairman Volos called the convention to order and proposed that <span class="page-break">\6</span>the report of the credentials committee be heard. Mr. Zhogalsky informed the delegates that all the credentials had been examined and were found to be in good order. Zhogalsky also reported that among the credentials presented to the committee had been one submitted by Mr. Nikolaiuk, a fraternal delegate from the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society, (RNOV) who had come here, in great haste, from New York.</p>
   <p>At once there was a murmur of dissatisfaction and excitement among the delegates. Voices were heard questioning the advisability of admitting the delegate to the floor. Several of the delegates asked Mr. Zhogalsky what the decision of his committee had been, regarding this delegate. Mr. Erin explained that the committee had decided not to honor the credentials issued by RNOV. In a brief statement Mr. Olesiuk said that RNzOV is a mutual aid society, and, consequently, has no political aims.</p>
   <p>Chairman Volos asked the delegate from RNOV to leave the hall in conformance <span class="page-break">\7</span>with the decision taken by the committee. Nikolaiuk, however, remained seated and wrote something on a piece of paper. Ignoring for the moment, the presence of the objectionable delegate, the convention proceeded to deliberate on the matters at hand, and Mr. Nikolaiuk, ignoring the order, remained seated, obviously intent on observing what was going on at the convention for the purpose of later reporting all he had seen and heard to his Bolshevik superiors, and of attacking RNzOV in the Bolshevik newspaper Novyi Mir.</p>
   <p>The temper of the delegates rose; voices were heard demanding the forceful ejection of the delegate. Mr. Erin again took the floor and explained once more to the delegates that even though nominally the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society is a mutual aid society, supposedly a fraternal organization--it does the bidding of its Bolshevik bosses and pursues disruptive political aims. Erin proposed that the convention take a vote on the decision of the committee. The convention unanimously decided to expel the delegate, <span class="page-break">\8</span>and, if necessary, by force. Chairman Volos, for the second time, asked the delegate to leave the hall.</p>
   <p>Members of the Russian Independent Society have a great deal of patience, but their patience was now at an end. They have endured a good deal of insult and criticism from the Bolsheviks. They have heard and read a great deal of slander and falsehood spread by the Bolshevik agents against their society and its members. Nikolaiuk is one of the men who acts as an agent and informer. He was sent from New York for the purpose of confusing and misleading our members and delegates to the convention. Members of our society are simple people, but they have had some practical experience and they know just what disruptive methods the Bolsheviks employ. Our members call themselves "independents" because they have no desire to fall under anybody's control-particularly, guardians and "saviors" from outside, and Bolshevik "benefactors".</p>
   <p>It is hard to believe that Nikolaiuk and other Bolshevik flunkeys, in their <span class="page-break">\9</span>impudence, will go so far as to refuse to submit to the decision taken by the delegates and to disobey the orders to leave the auditorium, as any decent man would. Nikolaiuk showed the real Bolshevik color, and if any of the delegates had respected Mr. Nikolaiuk at all, that respect was gone after the incident. The men chosen to keep order in the hall finally had to eject the Bolshevik emissary.</p>
   <p>The delegates' decision in this matter should be wholeheartedly approved. They showed themselves to be firm where the situation demanded firmness. It would be unforgiveable if the delegates had allowed Nikolaiuk the freedom of Bolshevik action on the convention floor. Independents do not need such caretakers. Among their own members they have men with wider knowledge and more experience than the Bolshevik agents possess. There will be an end to all progress and culture if men of Nikolaiuk's type ever become the teachers of mankind.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Selection of the Presidium</p>
   <p>Then followed the nomination of members for the presidium. The nominations were accepted by Olesiuk, Sabinsky, Dziaiko, and Dr. Chadovich. Secret balloting was held. Dr. Chadovich, who received a plurality, was elected chairman. Sabinsky, Volodkin, Kucherepa were nominated for vice-chairman. Mr. Sabinsky received the majority vote and was elected. During the election of secretary, a short delay occurred which was due to the refusal of some of the delegates to accept the nomination. In order to avoid any embarrassment, Mr. Olesiuk introduced a motion to pay the secretary elected five dollars for his work. The motion was seconded and approved by all the delegates. Nominations for the secretary were reopened. Again there were refusals to accept the nomination. The delegates were in a quandary; they did not know what to do. Personal appeals to Mr. Gapanovich to accept the nomination were made from the floor by some of the delegates. In order to facilitate the proceedings of the convention, Mr. Gapanovich reluctantly accepted the job.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>Mrs. Korsh was chosen to assist him in the work.</p>
   <p>After the selection of members for several other committees, Chairman Volos asked the members of the presidium to take their places. Chairman Chadovich delivered a short speech in which he thanked the delegates for the confidence placed in him. He also reminded the delegates that important problems confront the Society and that the tasks entrusted to them should be approached with due deliberation. Only such work will make the convention successful and beneficial to the Society.</p>
   <p>After a short recess the convention took up the agenda of the day.</p>
   <p>Wires and letters of greetings were read from twenty-seven branches of the Society. Greetings were sent from Detroit and other towns. Branch #14 (Detroit) greeted the convention and assured the delegates that it would abide by their decisions. The Branch recommended that the idea of uniting RNzOV with <span class="page-break">\12</span>ROOV (Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid) not be given up. Branch #24 greeted the delegates in the name of the women belonging to it. Branch #9 greeted the delegates with best wishes for their success. From the newspaper Rassviet, the convention was greeted by Mr. Novin; the speaker declared that both the Society and the newspaper pursue the same aims, designed to benefit the whole Russian colony. Branch #25 greeted the convention and wished it success in its work. From the educational committee of RNzOV, the delegates were greeted by Mr. Bernov.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the proceedings of the preceding convention were read to the delegates by Mr. Gapanovich and Mrs. Korsh. Delegate Volodkin introduced a motion that the proceedings of the present convention be recorded as briefly as possible with only important decisions recorded. Volodkin's recommendation was unanimously approved by the delegates.</p>
   <p>Financial Report</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Kozak, secretary of RNzOV, in his financial report, stated that the <span class="page-break">\13</span>resources of RNzOV at present amount to $80,628. The financial statement was approved by the convention. Treasurer Yakimovich, a member of the control committee, O. Sleznik, and Secretary Kozak, gave satisfactory answers to all questions pertaining to finances. Despite this, the delegates from Branch #2 were not satisfied. This dissatisfaction is explained by the fact that there are Bolshevik microbes within Branch #2 and they are destructive to any organism.</p>
   <p>Report of the Executive Committee</p>
   <p>Chairman Volos reported to the convention that all members of the executive committee of RNzOV were actively and conscientiously performing their duties. Thanks to their efforts, the work was highly productive during the whole year. The executive committee during the year under consideration was forced to divert its efforts from its specific duties to the task of fighting and resisting the wrecking activities of the Bolshevik elements that had succeeded <span class="page-break">\14</span>in obtaining a foothold within the ranks of our society. On the initiative of the executive committee of RNzOV, lecture tours were arranged for the branch members. Successful work was done in enrolling new members. As far as the efforts directed toward enrolling the Russian youth into our organization are concerned, they have not been very successful. If the parents paid more attention to attracting their youth to the organization they themselves belong to, the results would be quite different.</p>
   <p>The Society now has two new branches in the vicinity of Chicago. Circumstances compel the administrative committee to have a permanent paid secretary and a paid organizer to take care of the routine work and to enroll the new members.</p>
   <p>Some of the branches have not been sufficiently active during the year in their educational work, and this was because there was not enough attention paid to this important phase of cultural work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\15</span>
   <p>Following Chairman Volos, Secretary Kozak read a report from which it was seen that the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society's membership toward the end of 1934 had reached a total of 1,329 men and women. The children's branches have a membership of 548. The grand total is 1,877 members. The routine work was performed under great difficulties.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Yakimovich declared that the Society has on deposit $34,818.40. Controller Sleznik confirmed the accuracy of this statement and said that the financial accounts are kept in good order and that the cash account was absolutely correct.</p>
   <p>The recording secretary, Mr. Gapanovich, said that the routine work of all the committees had been performed accurately and without any compensation. Erin proposed that a vote of thanks be extended to the central executive committee for its successful efforts. All the delegates were satisfied with the work done by the members of this committee during the past year. After listening to the reports and the financial statements submitted by the central <span class="page-break">\16</span>executive committee, the convention took a recess for half an hour.</p>
   <p>After the recess, Dr. Chadovich asked the delegates to be seated. The committees continued to submit their reports. The report from the organizational committee was read by Mr. Olesiuk.</p>
   <p>"During these difficult economic times," he said, "not much can be done in matters of organizational activity. On the one hand, the economic crisis is a great hindrance to the progress of our organization; on the other hand, our enemies interfere, to a considerable degree. Despite all the obstacles during the past year we succeeded in forming two new branches."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sabinsky declared that difficult times and lack of money prevent many Russian people from joining our organization, and from paying dues regularly. We have made many attempts to enlist new members, but for many reasons, we have not been very successful in this respect. The advanced age of most of <span class="page-break">\17</span>the Russian immigrants has certain drawbacks. Many of the Russians would like to join our society but their age does not permit admission.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bernov read the report from the school committee. There was little to say about the cultural and educational activity of our society because there was not much done in this field. We have only sixty-two students in our schools. The number of pupils, as you see, is not large, but the classes are held regularly and very efficiently. The school children take a very active part in school and church choirs. We have also been able to form a very good string orchestra. One must admit that the parents do not treat the Russian school problem seriously. The money to maintain the schools was derived, for the most part, from entertainments arranged by the school committee. In conclusion Mr. Bernov appealed to the delegates to pay due attention to the problem of maintaining Russian schools in the city.</p>
   <p>Gapanovich declared that the parents of the Russian school children should <span class="page-break">\18</span>be most interested in maintaining the schools. Parents should take proper care of their children. We have taken steps to create new schools, and so far as quality is concerned, our schools are very efficient.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Svatikova reported on the page taken by RNzOV in the newspaper Rassviet every Saturday. "We have made attempts," she said, "to bring pressure on every man who is able to write to take part in editing this page or contributing something for the readers. Efforts have been made to give space on our page only to material which would benefit our society. The page has quite frequently been used by our enemies for attacks against the organization that financed the very existence of the page. The branches very often failed to supply us with the necessary information on the basis of which we could refute the slanderous accusations. More than that, the branches very seldom supplied us with the information which would reflect their life and activity." Mme. Svatikova proposed that the appropriations for editing the page be increased, and that all the necessary help be obtained so that news of the Society's activities could be properly presented.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\19</span>
   <p>Dr. Chadovich and Mr. Stoliarenia presented their report from the management committee. They declared that the management committee had performed its duties properly and looked after the matters entrusted to it. Metelsky, from the floor, said that some of the delegates who are not closely connected with the everyday functioning of the Society are not clear as to the nature and the necessity of the expenses stated in the financial account. For that reason, he thought that the account of the expenditures made should be presented in a clearer form, which all the delegates could understand.</p>
   <p>Following this request, Stoliarenia gave an explanation of the expense account given by the management committee. He said that the management committee had expected to exchange a piece of real-estate property for a farm, but the deal fell through because the farm proved to be highly unprofitable for our organization. Mr. Volos added that the management committee had investigated many farms, but so far, had not been able to find one which would be suitable for the purposes of the Society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\20</span>
   <p>Reports from the Branches</p>
   <p>In the name of Branch #1, Mr. Olesiuk greeted the delegates of the twenty-fourth annual convention and wished them success in the solution of all the questions presented to the convention. Olesiuk declared that Branch #1 directs all its efforts toward uniting the whole Russian colony in Chicago and vicinity. From May 1, 1934, to May 1, 1935, Branch #1 enrolled thirty-five new members. During the same period, the Branch lost twelve members for various reasons. Eight members have died. At present, Branch #1 has 502 dues-paying members. During the same period, Branch #1 paid into the general treasury $6,213.50 toward the death benefit fund, $2,248.10 toward the sick benefit fund, $583.40 toward covering the administrative expenses, and $193.40 toward covering additional risks assumed by the Society as a result of accepting the provisions of the new policies. From these figures it can be seen that Branch #1 paid into the general treasury of RNzOV a total of $9,238. During the year, Branch #1 arranged two entertainments: one picnic <span class="page-break">\21</span>and one concert. Branch #1 also has a subsidiary branch of young members. There are 250 members in this branch.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bregin greeted the delegates in the name of Branch #2. The Branch has seventy-three members. Many of the members, due to lack of money, are unable to pay their dues regularly. For this reason some of the members have left the organization. In its local treasury, the Branch has $1,500 in cash. It was quite obvious at the convention that the delegates from Branch #2 were dissatisfied with the expulsion of their members from the Society for wrecking activity.</p>
   <p>Madam Maria Ross reported from Branch #3. She stated that the Branch has on its rolls 245 dues-paying members. The local treasury has $4,486 in cash. The delegate declared that the organizational work in her branch proceeds very successfully and that it will be intensified in the future.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\22</span>
   <p>Mr. Fedorovsky, from Branch #4, stated that his local has fifteen members and that there is no money in the local treasury.</p>
   <p>From Branch #5 (Argo, Illinois), Mr. Beresiuk reported that his branch has sixty-one members and that there is $1,200 in the treasury.</p>
   <p>Mr. Metelsky, a delegate from Branch #7, reported that his branch in East Chicago has seventy members and $392 in the local treasury.</p>
   <p>Anna Kraus, a delegate from Branch #8, stated that her branch has thirty-one members, and $115 in the treasury.</p>
   <p>Zinovia Schelkun, a delegate from Branch #10, in Argo, Illinois, reported that the Branch has thirty-three dues-paying members and $839 in the local treasury.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goroschenia, from Branch #15, reported that his local is a young one and <span class="page-break">\23</span>has only forty members. It has $170 in the local treasury. His branch also maintains a school for children.</p>
   <p>P. Abramuk, a delegate from Branch #17 (in the city of Baltimore, Maryland), reports that his local has been in existence for nearly three years, and has twenty-seven members and $147 in the treasury. The youth club has fifteen members. There are branches of ROOV and RNOV in the city which carry on propaganda inimical to the delegate's branch, and consequently its growth is slow. The delegate expressed a hope that his branch, belonging, as it does to RNzOV, an entirely nonpartisan organization would be able to attract all the nonpolitical elements in the city and to give, in the long run, a better account of itself than the branches of ROOV and RNOV, which bear the stamp of communist affiliation and pursue political aims.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dziayko, representing Branch #18, reported that his branch was a comparatively young one. It was organized in 1933 and has at present only forty-five <span class="page-break">\24</span>members. The treasury has a cash balance of $160.51. The local has a children's branch with fifteen members. The organizational work is carried on very smoothly. The business meetings are held regularly each month. The cultural and educational activity lags because the Branch does not have a center.</p>
   <p>Mr. Markovich, a delegate from Branch #25, stated that his local has been in existence only seven months and has thirty-one members.</p>
   <p>Madam Sophia Levkovich, representing Branch #26, stated that her local was organized only recently and has eleven members. There is no money in the treasury as yet.</p>
   <p>Mr. Metelsky, the delegate from Branch #27 in Benton Harbor, Michigan, reported that his branch has forty-four members and $77 in the treasury. The Branch has also established a Russian children's school, but lately it has <span class="page-break">\25</span>been difficult to maintain the school because of lack of money.</p>
   <p>The floor was given over to Mr. Chepelevich, the president of the parochial council of St. George's Parish. He greeted the convention and extended best wishes to the delegates. Mr. Chepelevich, in his speech, touched upon the fact that the Parish has succeeded in erecting a new building with space for an auditorium, and expressed the hope that this new building would serve to promote the Russian cause in Chicago and would help to develop the social activity of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Attorney K. Gugis, appearing as the head of the legal department of RNzOV, told the delegates that his task was to help the central executive committee of RNzOV handle its legal matters so that errors could be avoided in the sale of properties, transfers, and other transactions. He advised the delegates to use the services of new men who, with their experience and knowledge, could help the Society to grow and develop.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\26</span>
   <p>The session was adjourned at 11:20 P. M.</p>
   <p>Rassviet (The Dawn), May 20, 1935.</p>
   <p>The second session of the convention was set for ten o'clock, but its opening was delayed. First of all, the roll call disclosed the absence of eight delegates. The session was opened by Dr. Chadovich, the chairman.</p>
   <p>Olga Gapanovich, a pupil from the Kriilov School [Translator's note: a school maintained by RNzOV for Russian children] appeared on the stage and greeted the delegates. She said: "Esteemed chairman and delegates! I, as a pupil of the Russian Kriilov School, have been entrusted with the task of greeting this convention in the name of our school and of expressing to the delegates our sincere hope that your presence at this convention may be beneficial to the organization. You all know that every organization, in order to grow and <span class="page-break">\27</span>develop, needs a constant and fresh supply of new energy from outside sources. But, one may ask, where can one find such new energy? There is only one answer to this question. The necessary new energy can be supplied only by the young generation. In order to convert our youth into useful members of any Russian organization, they must undergo a period of preparation and training; in order to be prepared, they must attend Russian schools. The more Russian schools we have, the more useful members there will be in the organization. These new members will in time take your places, and will honorably continue the work so successfully begun by you along the road leading to enlightenment. The School hopes that you will help the Russian schools in the city and thereby help yourselves. Dear delegates, I wish you success in your deliberations and a prosperous future for the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society."</p>
   <p>S. Shuran, a pupil from another Russian school, named after Bunin, addressed the delegates as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\28</span>
   <p>"Dear Independents: To my lot has fallen the high honor of greeting you in the name of the pupils attending the Bunin School, organized and maintained by RNzOV. We realize that you are entrusted with difficult and responsible tasks. You are confronted with many problems which you must solve. You will have to chart the course of your society for a whole year. The future of your organization will depend upon your decisions. From the depth of my heart, I wish to express my best wishes for your success in your difficult and responsible work. I hope that you will not forget your young generation. Do not forget that the future of your Independent Society depends upon your children. They will have to carry the responsibility for its continued existence. The latter will be possible only if we receive the necessary preparation so that we can take over the duties which are imposed upon you at present. This preparation we can receive only in schools. Consequently, we ask you to pay particular attention in your deliberations to the problem of Russian schools. Once more I wish you success. Thank you."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\29</span>
   <p>It is quite interesting to note the fact that both Olga Gapanovich and S. Shuran addressed the delegates in a Russian beautiful in form and full of meaning.</p>
   <p>Mr. Shumkov, a teacher, greeted the delegates in the following words: "With a feeling of deep joy, I congratulate the convention of RNzOV. I have given a great deal of thought to the matter of introducing new blood into RNzOV. Formerly there were people in the Society who bred confusion within the organization. This is not the case now. The young generation is already bringing renewed strength and fresh energy to your society. I wish you success."</p>
   <p>Following this speech, the delegates began to discuss the question of employing a permanent paid secretary. Chairman Volos stated that because of the introduction of new forms of insurance, the secretarial work had increased in volume and had become greatly complicated. Furthermore, the Society has grown <span class="page-break">\30</span>to such an extent that it is impossible to conduct the business properly without the services of a permanent secretary. Heretofore our work in the office had been performed by volunteers, who received no pay. In the future such an arrangement will be impossible without detriment to the organization because volunteers cannot possibly do all the work required by the state regulations. N. Kozak declared that he has been forced to spend two hours a day in the office, and two full days, handling the routine work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Volodkin stated that his branch had decided at its meeting that if Mr. Kozak was unable to handle the work on the terms previously agreed upon, the convention would have to find some solution to the problem. If necessary, a permanent secretary will have to be employed, otherwise the Society will suffer, although a paid secretary can be employed only in the event that our resources permit the expense.</p>
   <p>Erin stated that other mutual aid societies employ paid office workers who <span class="page-break">\31</span>also act as organizers. A paid secretary will also improve our organizational work.</p>
   <p>Bernov declared that from his observations of the activity carried on by organizations similar to our society, he had noticed that the organizers play an important part in the growth of such organizations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grib stated that he was not opposed to the proposal to hire a permanent secretary. The important thing was to find a good man for the job.</p>
   <p>Volos declared that a paid secretary was an absolute necessity at the present time. Our present secretary, Mr. N. Kozak, is working only part time, and he is unable to handle all the work.</p>
   <p>Petruchik proposed that a permanent secretary be employed, provided that the organization could find the means to pay for his services.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\32</span>
   <p>Mr. Kichkaylo thought that the permanent secretary might devote part of his time to organizational work and to enrolling new members.</p>
   <p>Mr. Goroschenia supported this proposal and stated that the Society was at a stage in its development where it could not get along without the services of a permanent secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kuyava asked the delegates what they would do if a permanent man would be unable to handle all the work required in the office.</p>
   <p>Volos stated that the central executive committee carefully watched all the paid employees to see that they performed their work properly. If the committee decided that the work assigned was not being properly performed, it would replace the man with someone else.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stolyarenia supported the proposal of having a permanent secretary who <span class="page-break">\33</span>would be useful to the organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Yakimovich did not want to repeat what had been said by the other delegates, but he felt quite sure that the services of a permanent secretary were absolutely necessary to the Society.</p>
   <p>Dziyako declared that if the central executive committee of RNzOV decided to have a permanent secretary, the delegates would have to support the decision. The delegates would simply have to solve the problem of finding the means to pay the secretary for his services, and to determine the amount of money necessary for that purpose. Among those present, there was not a man who would be suitable for the job. The Society would, therefore, have to proceed on the trial and error method. It should employ a man for a six-month period and then determine whether or not the man was capable.</p>
   <p>Pasiuk stated that our present part-time secretary, Mr. N. Kozak, is swamped <span class="page-break">\34</span>in his other work and is unable to do justice to the job imposed on him by our society. The heavy work he is performing for the Society and the work he does in the printing shop where he earns his living, overtax his capacity. Of course, we need the services of a regularly paid secretary. The Society cannot get along without a permanent, full-time secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Markovich was mainly concerned with the problem of finding the means to pay the secretary whom the Society proposed to engage.</p>
   <p>Sabinsky summed up what had already been said in favor of employing a fulltime secretary. He said that the only thing which concerned the delegates was the problem of paying the salary of the secretary. A paid secretary employed for a period of six months, was, in his opinion, useless; a permanent man would have enough time to take care of organizational work, and the membership in RNzOV would increase rapidly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Volos said that the delegates should not be frightened by the additional <span class="page-break">\35</span>expense involved in having a permanent office worker. A paid man in the office, one who can and should devote his entire time to the business of the Society, is indispensable.</p>
   <p>Erin moved that a secretary be chosen, and that if the means on hand were used up, the central executive committee should be instructed by the convention to appropriate additional funds to pay the wages of the secretary chosen by the delegates.</p>
   <p>This motion was immediately put to a vote. Forty-two votes were cast in favor of employing a permanent, full-time secretary. One delegate was opposed.</p>
   <p>Dr. Nedzelnitsky appeared on the stage to deliver a message of congratulations to the convention. He greeted the twenty-fourth annual convention of RNzOV and wished it all possible success in its undertaking. "We are growing old," he said, "and this is only natural. But we must find replacements among our <span class="page-break">\36</span>young people for the positions we are about to relinquish in the ranks of RNzOV. It is imperative that we attract our youth to the organization. Mr. Volos and H. Pasiuk have already done a great deal to accomplish this, but still the work in this direction must proceed until the ultimate goal is reached. It will be necessary for all members of the Society to put their shoulder to the wheel and bring the young generation into the fold of the Society. The founders of the organization are tired and old men. Twenty-four years of constant effort have had a telling effect on their stamina and the work now being performed by the older people must sooner or later fall on the shoulders of the young people; this transfer of responsibilities is inevitable. By all and every means, we must call our youth to the service of RNzOV."</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Dr. Nedzelnitsky made a moving appeal to the Russian parents to enroll their children into the ranks of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\37</span>
   <p>The Question of Office</p>
   <p>Mr. Volos declared that the delegates had voted in favor of having a permanent paid secretary, and that now the convention had to decide the question of finding a suitable office. Heretofore, the part-time secretary had maintained his office in his own home. In order to perform all the secretarial work properly, the Society needs a permanent office. It's impossible to continue under the previous arrangement. As far as the expense of maintaining such an office is concerned, it should not be large.</p>
   <p>Erin proposed that the central executive committee should be entrusted with [the task of] finding suitable quarters for the office and arranging the terms on which the office space is to be rented. The question was put to a vote. The delegates voted unanimously in favor of having a permanent office.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\38</span>
   <p>On Time of Convening Future Conventions</p>
   <p>Volodkin made a motion that future conventions should be scheduled for September, for an autumn month. The motion was seconded and carried by a majority of the delegates. Thus, in the future, the conventions of RNzOV will take place in fall instead of spring.</p>
   <p>On Salaries of the Officials</p>
   <p>Chairman Volos declared that the president of the Society at present receives $80 a year; the secretary--$350; the treasurer--$80. The rest of the officials perform their duties gratis. Metelsky proposed that since the Society was going to have a permanent full-time secretary, the salaries paid to the president and the treasurer should be abolished.</p>
   <p>Bernov objected and said that the president had to devote a great deal of time <span class="page-break">\39</span>to the affairs of the Society, and, therefore, the president should continue to receive some remuneration for his services. In his opinion, the president of RNzOV devotes a great deal of time to organizational work.</p>
   <p>Chairman Volos (he is the president) said that it was not up to him to speak about the president's salary, but he wanted to caution the delegates against becoming the victims of a false economy and against reducing the small remuneration received by the president. Erin proposed that the president's salary be left at the old figure because the president is sometimes forced to engage other men to do some of the things he is supposed to do himself. Volos insisted that the president's salary should not be changed.</p>
   <p>Most of the delegates spoke in favor of leaving the president's salary the same as heretofore, and voted accordingly. Metelsky's motion was not even seconded. As to the salary received by the treasurer, the convention decided to reduce it by $20; instead of $80, this official will receive only $60 per year.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\40</span>
   <p>On Secretary's Salary</p>
   <p>After a general discussion, a majority of the delegates voted in favor of paying the secretary $20 per week. The work of the recording secretary will be performed by the treasurer in the future. There then followed a forty-five minute recess.</p>
   <p>Rassviet (The Dawn), May 22, 1935.</p>
   <p>After the recess the convention again began to consider the matters on hand. A statement was made that M. Grigorieva, a member of the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society (RNOV) was among those present at the convention. She was declared to be a disrupter and a wrecker, and by a majority vote, she was expelled from the convention.</p>
   <p>Election of the Central Board</p>
   <p>Thirteen men were nominated for chairman, but all of them declined in favor <span class="page-break">\41</span>of Mr. Volos, who had held the job previously. Mr. Volos also declined the nomination on the ground that he needed a rest. Delegate Zhogalsky pleaded with Mr. Volos to remain on the job for another year. A second nomination of candidates took place. This time, eleven were nominated for chairman. The delegates voted and Mr. Pasiuk received a majority of the votes; he thus became chairman of RNzOV.</p>
   <p>Voting for vice-chairman resulted in the election of Dr. Chadovich to that position. A discussion took place regarding the nominations for secretary. Mr. Grib thought that the old secretary, Mr. Kozak, was the best office worker. Grigorchuk also favored the appointment of mr. N. Kozak for the secretary's position because he is an experienced man and knows both languages, English and Russian.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dziayko also spoke in favor of Mr. Kozak as an experienced man and suggested that Mr. Volos take upon himself the duties of an organizer. Volodkin <span class="page-break">\42</span>also recommended N. Kozak for the secretarial job. Mr. Erin declared that the secretary of RNzOV is the main figure in the organization. Mr. Kozak is a very good office worker, but he does not possess the qualities of an organizer. Mr. Erin advised Mr. Volos to take the secretarial job. Metelsky thought that it was impossible for one man to perform both the secretarial duties and those of an organizer. Another man is needed to organize new branches and Volos would be the best man for the job. Dedovich claimed that the secretarial work could be performed only by Volos, Kozak, or Goroschenia. Volos and Goroschenia declined the nominations. Only Mr. Kozak remained eligible for the job and the convention unanimously elected him for the office of secretary of RNzOV. At the same time, the delegates decided the question of having a permanent office. After a brief exchange of opinion, the convention proposed that the board of directors rent quarters suitable for an office.</p>
   <p>G. Volos and Mr. Vorobay were nominated for assistant secretary. Volos <span class="page-break">\43</span>received thirty-five votes and Mr. Vorobay--fifteen. Mr. Volos was elected for the office of assistant secretary.</p>
   <p>Nominations for treasurer were accepted by O. Sleznik and Mr. Parfeevetz. The results of voting were as follows: O. Sleznik--forty-nine votes; Parfeevetz--five votes. The election of assistant treasurer followed. Nominations were accepted by Mr. Yakimovich and Mr. Bregin. The results were as follows: Yakimovich--thirty-five votes; Bregin--eighteen votes. Seventeen delegates were nominated for the board of directors. Seventeen members were elected with three substitute members.</p>
   <p>Amendments and revisions to the bylaws were then discussed. Mr. Kozak explained that in connection with the introduction of new forms of insurance, the Society has to introduce new provisions into its bylaws. The convention resolved to accept three amendments to the bylaws.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\44</span>
   <p>Right Reverend P. Nirvanna, pastor of St. George's Parish, was called upon to say a few words. He said: "I have been with you only a week, but the name of your society is known everywhere. In the past, I did not know just what the size of your society was. Your society is a link which unites the Russians and preserves their language and culture. You have come here from various cities in order to weld the Russian people into a solid entity. It would be highly desirable if all the Russians would join your society. The Society has to work for the enlightenment of the Russian colony. Lectures can be arranged for the people in Chicago and suburban towns. This is the opportune time to carry on educational and mutual aid society work. We need to teach our children Russian. We should strive for creative effort in all aspects of life and we should teach people the ideal of brotherly love. We shall advance; we shall move forward if we believe in the power of truth."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\45</span>
   <p>On RNzOV's Youth</p>
   <p>Mr. Kozak pointed out that the Society attracts a comparatively small number of young people. Letters were sent out to all branches to encourage the individual branches to attract as many young people as possible. However, so far, the parents are not trying hard enough to enroll their children in the ranks of RNzOV.</p>
   <p>Chairman Volos explained that this youth problem includes children up to the age of sixteen. There are many young people who are eligible, but their parents neglect to enroll them in the Society. The problem of attracting the youth into the Society aroused the interest of all the delegates. Fifteen delegates asked to speak from the floor.</p>
   <p>Each of the speakers express his personal view on the subject of the Russian youth, and all stressed the point that our youth must be brought into the fold <span class="page-break">\46</span>of the Society to take the place of the older members and to do the work their parents had done previously. Suggestions were made on the question of how the Society should approach the youth and how they [the youth] can be organized within the framework of the Russian colony for the Russian cause. The speakers were not limited in time and they approached the subject of the Russian youth from different points of view. They were in search of ways and means of attracting Russian children to the organization. Proposals were made to organize youth branches in connection with all locals; there is no other way of uniting Russian youth around the Society. The convention recommended that the board of directors send out organizers to each branch at least three times a year. The duties of such organizers will consist in carrying on widespread propaganda among the Russian youth calling upon Russian youth to unite around the Society, and instilling in the minds of Russian young people the importance of and benefits derived from mutual aid organizations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\47</span>
   <p>About RNzOV's Schools</p>
   <p>Mr. Bernov, a member of the school council of RNzOV, said that it would be much better if parents paid more attention to the problem of Russian schools. During the past year, there have been only three schools in Chicago, and yet the number of schools and of pupils can be increased considerably if parents will take a greater interest in educating their children.</p>
   <p>Svatikova stated that there is only mild interest among the parents toward Russian schools. Attempts have been made to develop their interest in the schools, but they have not been crowned with much success.</p>
   <p>All the speakers agreed that the future of the Russian schools depends entirely on the local branches. If they continue to work actively toward organizing new schools, one may expect that their efforts will be successful.</p>
   <p>The convention resolved that in the future, the school council should work in <span class="page-break">\48</span>close collaboration with the branches and keep close contact with the board of directors.</p>
   <p>On the Rates of Interest</p>
   <p>Mr. Kozak declared that in the opinion of the board of directors, the rate of interest on mortgages is too high, and instead of charging 6% the Society should lower it to 5%. Many of our members are dissatisfied with the rate and demand a reduction. Their demand should be granted. A vote was taken to lower the rate to 5%. All the delegates, except two from Branch #2, voted in favor of the reduction.</p>
   <p>On the Farm</p>
   <p>Mr. Volos stated that there was not much to say with regard to the purchase of a farm because this question had been definitely decided last year by the convention, and that now it was only necessary to work out a practical plan to carry out this decision. The convention charged the board of directors <span class="page-break">\49</span>with the task of selecting a suitable farm.</p>
   <p>On Creating a Fund for Needy Members</p>
   <p>Sabinsky stated that some of the members, as a result of unemployment, are not able to pay their dues. Volodkin introduced a motion to the effect that each branch should pay out of its treasury the dues of its unemployed members. The motion was taken to a vote and was carried unanimously.</p>
   <p>The committee on expenses submitted its report on the expenditures connected with calling the convention; the total spent was $78.54.</p>
   <p>The work of the convention was almost finished.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sabinsky proposed that the question of the advisability of calling a congress of all mutual aid societies be discussed. The speaker pointed out that <span class="page-break">\50</span>in the United States there are many independent societies that are not affiliated with any Russian central body. Such a congress, in the speaker's opinion, could lay the foundation for uniting all Russian mutual aid societies into one solid central body and could work out a plan of action for all of them.</p>
   <p>Following Sabinsky, only a few delegates expressed their opinion on this point because it was getting late. Consequently, the convention did not take any decision on the matter. The convention closed its second session at 11:45 P. M.</p>
   <p>One must mention that the twenty-fourth annual convention of RNzOV was notable in many respects. There were very few sharp controversies. The delegates conducted themselves with dignity and restraint. The convention revealed the solidarity and progress attained by RNzOV during its existence. the impressions received give one ground to hope that in the future, RNzOV <span class="page-break">\51</span>will spread its activity into wider fields, not only in the state of Illinois, but in other states as well.</p>
   <p>Friendliness and solidarity among members of RNzOV will be the moving factors in their future practical work. They will help the Society to grow and prosper for the benefit of the Russian colony and of the Russian cause in general.</p>
