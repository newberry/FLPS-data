   <p>In many cities of the United States, there are Russian schools for children. In some cities, as for instance, New York, these Russian schools flourish and develop, while in other cities they are in a pitiful condition. Many of them appear to be merely a parody on well organized schools. Most of the Chicago Russian schools are in the same lamentable condition. Some have a solid financial foundation, but lack good teachers; others have qualified teachers, but are not on a sound financial basis.</p>
   <p>This conclusion was reached at the convention of the Federation of Children's Schools, which was held in Chicago during July. The delegates of all the Chicago schools claimed that work in their respective schools was in general conducted satisfactorily, but yet there was room for improvement. It is regrettable that not a single delegate committed himself to explain the reason for this state of affairs.</p>
   <p>What hinders the improvement of the schools in Chicago? First, according to <span class="page-break">\2</span>our opinion, the primary cause for the present situation is that not all the Russian colonists are interested in fostering school work. Some of them even consider it their duty to avoid sending their children to the Russian schools. Secondly, some of the teachers appear to lack proper education to such an extent, that when teaching the Russian language, they mutilate it unmercifully. For example, it is a well known fact to us that certain teachers are even incapable of writing the minutes of the school meetings correctly. Undoubtedly, such tutors can not teach the children. Thirdly, many members of the council, as well as the teachers, are more preoccupied with politics than with the routine work of the schools and, therefore, they conduct their work accordingly.</p>
   <p>In regard to the aforementioned statement, same was made at the convention of the Federation of Children's Schools, which convened in Chicago. For instance, at this convention there were thirteen delegates from eight schools and nineteen from twelve "friendly" organizations, who had not the slightest connection with the schools or their work. Among these "friendly" organizations were, likewise, such associations as the Workers' Choir, Union of the Atheists, and the Russian section of the Bolshevik party and White Russians' organization; and strange as it may seem, there were present more delegates from these "friendly" organizations than from the local schools. This convention proved, after all, to be not a convention for the schools, but for the communist organizations.</p>

   <p>It is clear, therefore,why the following four resolutions were passed;- two resolutions in regard to the work of the federation, and two political resolutions concerning the Chinese imperialists and Soviet fliers. In fact, even the first resolution is not strictly in line with the pedagogic purposes of the schools, since in the third article it clearly states that the federation must endeavor to acquire such teachers as could inculcate the fighting spirit in the youth.</p>
   <p>All this proves, therefore, that many Russian schools in Chicago lead a pitiful existence and do not contribute to the education of youth, but become institutions of political propaganda. Such schools do not differ greatly from the parochial schools. The only difference is that parochial schools teach the prayers and the Bible, while these other schools teach the catechism of atheists and the various dogmas of the Bolsheviks.</p>
   <p>The members of the school council forget, it seems, the basic truth that schools can flourish and render beneficial results only when they are freed from religious and political influences; and when the Russian language is taught by competent tutors who are well acquainted with the psychology of children, and are real masters of that language, and not half-illiterate teachers with political inclinations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Many of the schools have opened now and the doors of the rest will be open in the very near future. This is the time when the school council should obtain qualified teachers and remove from their institutions those who play politics. If the above plan is not carried out, the condition of the schools will not improve, and many of the children of Russian emigrants will vainly waste their time in attending them.</p>
