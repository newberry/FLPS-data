   <p>The school council of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society held its regular meeting October 17. The school committee and the executive committee of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, as well as the representatives and the teaching staffs of the several schools participated in the meeting.</p>
   <p>After the minutes of the last meeting had been read by the recording secretary, each delegate read his report of the condition in his particular school. From these reports, supplemented by the remarks and additional comment offered by the instructors, it was seen that the entire school work is proceeding satisfactorily and according to schedule, and that the number of pupils is steadily increasing in all the schools maintained by this society. In some of these schools, classes in music and singing have been introduced. The delegates <span class="page-break">2</span>submitting reports emphatically stressed one point--the lack of sufficient financial support, which retards the development of the Russian grammar schools in the Chicago area.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Bernov, chairman of the school committee, pointed out in his extensive report that the school council has been receiving many letters from Russian young people in Chicago asking that the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society open a Russian junior high school for the benefit of those Russian boys and girls who wish to continue their studies in the Russian language. This question precipitated a lively discussion among those present. Some members of the school council had serious doubts as to the possibility of establishing and maintaining a Russian high school because of the large expense connected with such an ambitious project. It was pointed out that the school council has very limited funds at its disposal and can hardly meet the expenses of the existing Russian grammar schools supported by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. The final vote, however, showed that the majority of the delegates favored the establishment of a Russian junior <span class="page-break">3</span>high school by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. It was decided to open a campaign among the members of this organization as well as among all Russians in Chicago and vicinity to raise a school fund by voluntary contributions. During the discussion of the school fund question, one of the members contributed five dollars to get the campaign off to a start.</p>
   <p>It was also decided at the meeting to arrange a season of lectures and talks having for their aim the arousing of interest in the Russian language among the Russian people.</p>
   <p>The school committee and the delegates also decided to express publicly, in the pages of Rassviet, their bitter disapproval of the radio speech of Reverend Dzeltonoga, in which he severely and unjustly criticized the school activities of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. In the opinion of the majority of those present, Reverend Dzeltonogas statements regarding <span class="page-break">4</span>the schools were untrue and harmful to the efforts of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society in behalf of schools.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting was adjourned the school committee,the delegates, and the instructors of the Russian grammar schools maintained by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Scoiety all expressed the hope that their efforts to raise funds for establishing a Russian junior high school would meet with the approval and the active support of all Russians living in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
