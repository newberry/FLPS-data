   <p>On Saturday, February 10, Branch 18 of RNzOV (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) held a lecture. The subject discussed was: "Will the Russian colony die with us?" The lecturer, who had been invited for the evening, was Mr. A. Cherepuk-Zhmager. Prior to the lecture the floor was taken by Mr. N. Grib. As a member of the organizing committee, he said a few words about RNzOV and its aims. He pointed out that the Society is confronted with serious and immediate problems which must be solved. One of them as the speaker pointed out, is a membership drive, particularly among the youth, and the development of cultural and educational activity. Mr. Zhmagar, who delivered the lecture, followed Mr. Grib. The topic under discussion was quite absorbing; it is timely and reflects the attitude of the Russian people in America. The question--Will the Russian colony die with us?--disturbs the mind of every Russian living in this country. Everyone of us older immigrants, should ask himself: If we older immigrants die out in about ten or fifteen years, who will take our places? Is the Russian name to be obliterated from the annals of American history? If all of us begin to think seriously about the problem, we will realize that the task is a very difficult one, but it must be solved by every means at our command. With this thought in mind, I went to hear Mr. Zhmagar.</p>
   <p>I thought that the lecturer would paint a true picture of the future, and would draw certain conclusions which might help us to find ways and means of preserving our Russian identity from total extinction in America. Judging by the topic, it seemed to me that the lecturer would devote the major part of his attention to the problem of the Russian youth in America and would discuss ways and means of attracting the youth into our ranks, of instilling a love of the Russian language of Russian culture and customs into our children. But my expectations were not justified. The lecturer not only did not point out ways and means of approaching the problem, but seemed deliberately to avoid the subject completely.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Zhmagar began his lecture with a dramatic monologue, as though he were an actor appealing to the emotions of his audience instead of their reason. Afterwards he began to attack the Russian colony, claiming that it had not done anything worth while, that it was lazy and lacked the spirit of enterprise, that we Russians in America were incapable of independent action and that we were devoid of creative thought and creative power.</p>
   <p>On many points one might agree with the lecturer, if he had made any reservations to his charges. Everything in the Russian colony is not dead; we can still see some activity. We have done things in the past and we will continue in the future. After the lecture, in an open discussion, N. Grib, Moroz, the author of this article, and others pointed out to the lecturer his errors. In their remarks, they stated that either Mr. Zhmagar did not know the history of the Russians in America or he did not care to know it, and [therefore] disregarded it entirely. In many ways we fail here not because we are lazy or apathetic but because most of us did not come here to stay, but simply to earn some money and so back home. When our fathers, mothers, or wives bid us good-by, they expected our return in a year or two. Everyone of us left the mother country with this thought in mind.</p>
   <p>But suddenly war was declared and we were stranded. Everyone of us had left somebody behind. Some of us left father and mother, others--a wife and children, a third group--beloved friends or sweethearts. Besides, we were very young and naive. We could not even think of getting properly settled because every Russian who came here prior to the Great War, during the first years of his residency here, thought only of returning home. We could not think of getting organized when each one of us was lonesome and dreamed of native forests and fields, of dewy mornings and quiet evenings in the villages of the mother country. This was the first tragedy that we had to endure during our early years here. The author of this article has lived through such a period. The first two or three years were the most difficult ones for every Russian immigrant who had torn himself away from the quiet life of the Russian peasant. I remember how my young friends, my village neighbours [in Russia] wept bitterly during the first years here and cursed the hour which had sent them away from the native village; I too wept bitterly.</p>
   <p>But no matter how difficult it was to reconcile oneself to the situation and to adapt oneself to a life of loneliness in a strange country, we overcame every difficulty, for we still had hope, and we were confident that we would return home as soon as the war was over. We lived with this hope and faith until the revolution definitely shut the door before our eyes and we were left stranded here, in America. At first we believed that the social upheaval which had overtaken our country enhanced our chances of a speedy return to our native soil. Of course, as the years rolled by, we realized more and more that our hopes were in vain. This time we had to live through the second and most fateful tragedy. We began to realize fully that we had been only dreamers during all this time, that we just lost and wasted our lives without doing or creating anything worth while, although during those long years we could have accomplished something.</p>
   
   <p>The lecturer might have deserved credit for pointing to our short coming if he had gone to the trouble of examining the extenuating circumstances which had left us inactive and in a state of suspense, but Mr. Zhmagar did not do so.</p>
