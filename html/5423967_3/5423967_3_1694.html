   <p>The eyes of the Russian colony of Chicago, and the so-called "Middle West" of the United States are fixed on the convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. At this time it is late to discuss the question as to what kind of delegates should be elected to this convention. The only thing that we can say at present is: Will all the delegates understand the seriousness of their task? Man always learns from his past experience. We must carefully look into the achievements of the R. I. M. A. S. committee.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to ask oneself a series of questions: Had the committee accomplished that what the society expected from it? Did said committee conduct its work in such a way as one expects from a normally developing organization? How does the society stand financially? Is the growth of its membership considerable and finally what is the activity of this organization in relation to the rest of the Russian colony?</p>
   <p>One may answer that the R. I. M. A. S. committee has earned esteem for itself as well as for the society, by fulfilling successfully all the tasks entrusted <span class="page-break">\2</span>to it. The committee has taken energetic steps to foster the further development of the society. The increase of the number of men members is above normal, and if we take into consideration, that in the whole country as well as all over the world there exists the worst unemployment for the last twenty years, we must admit that the result in the increase of the number of new members is really very large.</p>
   <p>The treasury of the society is in a brilliant order, the capital of the society is also increasing. The reputation of the society stands higher than before. With the help of the society the unification of the Russian colony was successfully achieved. Some evening enterprises sponsored by the society met with a great success, and their popularity continuously increases.</p>
   <p>At the present time the committee put forward the idea of uniting all the brotherhoods and societies, and this not by mere talk, but by action. The R. I. M. A. S. committee has worked out a new "charter," such as is not possessed by any other Russian organization. This would place them under the control of the state. Only under the regime of unity and state control, one can now be assured that after his death his relatives will receive the money, or that after his death his burial expenses will be paid.</p>

   <p>The committee of the society already met with a success on this path by affiliating with the R. I. M. A. S. fifty branches of R. M. A. S. (Russian Mutual Aid Society) and gave the imetus to other organizations to affiliate.</p>
