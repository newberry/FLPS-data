   <p>The most dangerous thing that can happen to any public undertaking is a plot to keep silent about it. Criticism - a healthy, honest criticism, a criticism not of personalities but of the idea and of the way in which it is being realized - however severe such criticism may be, is for the reading public the best source of information about every public work; it is also the best help to those who are doing some constructive work.</p>
   <p>Every fool can destroy and ridicule; but when constructive work is being done, men of character and knowledge, sincere men devoted to the work are needed.</p>
   <p>An idea can be destroyed only by rational arguments, by truth and by realization in life of that which is considered to be good, sound and useful.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Abuse, sarcastic remarks and insinuations prove only the insufficiency of the arguments, the absence of ideas and ideals and the moral cowardice of the person who uses such methods.</p>
   <p>It is deplorable that the newspapers, which should give to the public the true facts of life or illumine these facts with the light of the idea which they represent, allow their pages to become a kind of sink into which moral filth and abuse thrown at one person by another are being poured.</p>
   <p>A feeling of horror makes me shiver when I read in the Russian newspapers not a criticism of the work done by the Russian People's University, but just guesses, insinuations and aspersions cast on those persons who have taken upon themselves the task of carrying into the life of the Russian colony ideas of enlightenment, of which this colony is in such need. Not one of these critics has visited <span class="page-break">3</span>even once the university; not one of them has taken the trouble to find out personally what is being done there, what is taught there and what kind of theories are being explained to the students during the intervals between lectures; whether it is "Kolchak's idea of all Russia," or the ideas of the Social-Revolutionists, or those of the Bolsheviki, or the tsarist idea pure and simple? Of course, it is necessary to find out all that, in order to give an honest criticism of what is being done there.</p>
   <p>But all this is unnecessary for one who wants to write a libel and to pour some abuse on certain persons. All that such a writer wants is to wield a wicked pen, to have a rich vocabulary of abusive terms and to possess the boldness of a drunkard.</p>
   <p>If such libels had appeared in the American newspapers, it would not have been such a dire calamity. Americans read the newspapers chiefly in order to learn some news. As to the interpretation of the facts, <span class="page-break">4</span>the American takes it from that newspaper which agrees best with his political views; but at the same time he understands perfectly well that all the American newspapers are being bribed by certain political and economic organizations, that they all tell lies, and that the reading of newspapers is just a matter of habit rather than a means of satisfying one's desire to learn the truth.</p>
   <p>With the Russian immigrants, however, things are very different. That small part of the Russian immigrants which reads the newspapers has not acquired yet that citizens' "habit" of reading the newspapers which characterizes the Americans. The Russians regard the newspaper not just as a source of information about world events, but as a bearer of truth. They seem to think that the articles and even the advertisements published on the pages of the newspapers are almost Gospel truth. Not without reason did the members of the Russian cooperative society in Chicago give some of their hard-earned money for the founding of the newspaper Free Russia. These men, most of <span class="page-break">5</span>whom can read only with great difficulty, are sacrificing their labor and their savings in order that their newspaper could disseminate the truth among their still more ignorant fellow workers, and help them to some education. To darken the minds of such people by empty talk and lies is worse than a crime.</p>
   <p>For the good of just this kind of Russian readers, for the good of the members of the cooperative Free Russia who sacrifice so unselfishly their hard-earned dollars for the sake of spreading light and truth among the Russian immigrants, I am making to Mr. Kozhevnikov, the critic of the People's University, the following proposal: I, the undersigned, shall pay $10 for the right of Mr. Kozhevnikov to attend during one semester lectures at the People's University. Let him choose the subjects he wants to study; let him attend in the evenings the lectures for at least three months; let him seek the company of other students; let him observe and gather facts; and after having done this, let him write the truth about the Russian People's University.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>If Mr. Kozhevnikov, the critic, will find that the People's University is not an educational institution, that under the mask of education it only propounds the political views of some Russian party or other, then I shall be the first to help him bring to light the falsity of the assertions of the Russian People's University that it is non-political in its activities and busies itself only with the dissemination of useful and necessary knowledge among the Russian immigrants desiring to return to their native country, and with helping the constructive work done by those who want to build up a new life.</p>
   <p>But if the contentions of the University would prove to be true, citizen Kozhevnikov will have to show his civic courage by telling the truth by means of the press.</p>

   <p>The Editor of the Newspaper Free Russia.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: It is very disagreeable to start some polemics concerning some filthy libel like the one that has appeared recently in The Russian World (Russkoye Slovo), (a most appropriate organ of the press for the publication of such effusions); and it is the importance of the question under discussion that prompts me to write this answer to Mr. "Chicagovets" (a resident of Chicago) who, like a cowardly boy, hides behind a pseudonym with no meaning to it.</p>
   <p>I cannot agree at all with the author of this epistle when he says that the Russian People's University in Chicago is really a "People's" University. "Mr. Chicagovets" may have no doubts about that, but he would probably be bold enough to use the term "People's University" even if that university would be controlled by the tsar's government. As to myself, I have very grave doubts as to the fitness of such a term. Who is at the head of this university? Is it not that same Mr. Wolf - or should I say Mr. Volkov - the ex-consul of His Majesty?</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Is it not Mr. Lutnitsky, the loyal servant of the former tsar? Are these gentlemen working for the people? This is ridiculous. Whom do you want to gull, Mr. Chicagovets? When it was necessary these gentlemen acted contrary to the interests of the people, and now they have suddenly become "the people's agents." What a transformation!</p>
   <p>"There have not been and there will not be any politics nor any kindling of political passions," declares Mr. Chicagovets. Is that so? Has not the People's University organized a solemn reception and a banquet in honor of Mrs. Breshkovsky, that staunch protagonist of Kolchak and enemy of the People's Soviet government? Has not the People's University invited "Prof." Galatsky to give at the quarters of the University a lecture when he spent two hours blaming the Soviet government instead of speaking about Lincoln as was announced? And at the same time, the University has never accepted as lecturers persons who were known as supporters of the Soviets. Rumors have reached <span class="page-break">9</span>me (I do not vouch for the correctness of these rumors, but they are significant even if it is just possible to admit that such rumors might have been spread) that the University had refused to give to Prof. Lomonosov and to A. Stoklitsky permission to lecture in the university. Is this your idea of a non-political organization, Mr. Chicagovets? This non-political character of the University hides a serpent which is ready to attack at the first opportunity with its poisonous fangs that very people the name and the means of which it is using. Under this mask of a non-political organization hides a nest of Kolchak's henchmen, even if one has to judge about it only by the persons who stand at the head of this institution. This elimination of politics is just used for the purpose of knitting that net into which the Russian people must be caught in order that Kolchak and his supporters could triumph.</p>
   <p>"It has been created for the people," continues to praise the university Mr. Chicagovets, "and the children of the people are studying in it." But does this university prepare these children to become <span class="page-break">10</span>worthy sons of their people? Does it teach them to be conscious citizens of their country and to fulfill honestly their duties as such? What does the university do in this respect? Only a university with such a program should dare to call itself "The People's University." This is the kind of institution that we should have here, not a school of officials and lackeys of the tsar. The leaders of the university forget that we have already outlived that century when teaching was limited by a narrow framework of thousands of circulars and explanations of the Ministry of Public Education. A modern school should create citizens, not subjects; but for such teaching, Mr. Chicagovets, lackeys and slaves are not fit.</p>
   <p>You call this university the "People's University"; but what is the attitude of the people towards this institution? Sixty students out of a Russian colony numbering 40,000 persons! It is not your business, Mr. Chicagovets, to blacken the reputation of the Russian people and to reproach it for frequenting saloons, putting your words <span class="page-break">11</span>into the mouth of some mysticious (sic) workman.</p>
   <p>What is the use of blaming the mirror when it is the mug that is crooked. The Russian colony is qualitatively the same everywhere; and yet in Argo, Ill., where there are less than a thousand Russians, when the school was in existence it was attended regularly by a hundred pupils. They would come in the morning, in day time and in the evening - whenever they had some time at their disposal. Yet they are working there harder than the Russian workmen in Chicago. And, mark that, Mr. Chicagovets, there they do not spend thousands of dollars of the people's money in a few months. But the Russian people will not attend your classes. The Russians understand perfectly well with whom they have to do. They understand perfectly well who is trying to "bamboozle" them. The Russian workmen in Chicago, like everywhere, are yearning for knowledge. Look at the meetings where class-conscious orators are speaking. Thousands of Russians crowd the halls; often some of them come from other towns <span class="page-break">12</span>in the hope of hearing some live words. But they will not go to your Russian People's University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Create here a school free from unclean elements, from parasites who are feasting on money that has been earned by the blood of the Russian people, free from propagandists working for Kolchak, and you will see what crowds of people wishing to get education will come to you.</p>
   <p>Boris Hopstein.</p>
