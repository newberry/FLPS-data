   <p>(Note: The regional conference of the groups Dielo Trouda and Probuzhdeniye (Awakening), which took place on April 25, 1937, in New York, is meant. D. S.)</p>
   <p>The magazine Dielo Trouda was transferred from Paris to America in 1930. In the beginning the magazine had to struggle with many difficulties because no experienced editor was available.</p>
   <p>The magazine was being published in Chicago (May 1930, No. 56-57), but the editor's work was done in New York. Later, after the first or second issue, the editing was transferred to the Chicago Progressive Club, which entrusted this work to Comrades Volkov and Novik. During the year 1930 three issues were published: Nos. 56-57, 58-59, 60-61, with a total number of 88 pages. In the year 1931 there were only three issues: Nos. 62-63,64-65, and 66. This last issue contained material accumulated during <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>eight months, from May to December. After this issue, the editing was entrusted to Comrade Maximov who before that time had been given only a little assistance. The total number of pages for the year 1931 is 80.</p>
   <p>In 1932 there were five issues with a total of 120 pages: Nos. 67, 68-69, 70-71, 72-73 (sic).</p>
   <p>In 1933 there were four issues with a total of 104 pages: Nos. 74, 75, 76 and 77.</p>
   <p>In 1934 there were six issues with a total of 160 pages: Nos. 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, and 83. The last two issues had been published after the Chicago conference of our federation. Nos. 78 and 82 contain 32 pages each. The last number was devoted to reports and to the resolutions of the conference.</p>
   <p>In 1935 there were six issues with a total of 172 pages: Nos. 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 (anniversary number), and 89.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>In 1936, because of difficulties which had arisen in connection with the printing, we could get out only five issues with a total of 120 pages: Nos. 90, 91, 92, 93 and 94.</p>
   <p>The total number of issues was 32 with a total of 844 pages.</p>
   <p>The first issue published after the Chicago conference was No. 82, and we intend to start our report to the conference with this number of our magazine.</p>
   <p>First of all, we have to answer the following questions: Has the magazine been able to give to the readers the right orientation concerning the most important and vital problems which life puts before them? Were these problems elucidated from the standpoint of the fundamental principles of anarchism, and were these principles elaborated with sufficient completeness when they had to be applied to the elucidations of actual problems?</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>In order to answer these questions we shall take only the leading articles and analyze them.</p>
   <p>The articles "We and Russia, "(No. 83) and "Revolution or Counter-revolution in Russia?" (No. 87) define our program in Russia, our views concerning modern bolshevism. They give an analysis of the dictatorship and prove the necessity for the formation of a bureaucratic class out of this dictatorship and because of it. They make evident the necessity of abolishing, not only private property, but also the state. They show the process of the degeneration of the Russian Communist party into a factor of counter revolution. The reactionary elements in the concept of state-socialism are disclosed and the actuality of anarchist communism is established.</p>
   <p>In the articles "Fruits of the Dictatorship," (K. Phillippovich, No. 84) and "The Causes of Kirov's Murder, Its Consequences and Meaning," (No. 85) are stated our views concerning the terrorism in Russia and the causes of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>terrorism are explained. The reactionary cynicism of Leninism, the caesarism of bolshevism and the moral disintegration of the Communist Party are revealed. The process of a swift development of terrorism inside the party is foretold, and the illusions of a peaceful democratization of bolshevism are demolished: "Despotism can be democratized only by a revolution." In "May Manifesto of the International Workmen's Association," our views concerning fascism and the methods of fighting it are elucidated; the nature of political parties and state socialism is explained. A correct definition of "common interests" is given and an uncompromising class struggle and social revolution are advocated in opposition to the theory of "common interests." In the jubilee number is explained the meaning of the Washington protest. In the article "For the Independent Sanctions of the Working Class," No. 89 the shameful attitude of the League of Nations and of the Soviet Union towards the Abyssinian problem is exposed. The true meaning of the slogan, "If you want peace prepare for war." That war is essentially nothing but robbery is explained. The diplomatic morality is exposed, also the ineffectiveness <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the policy of the Socialist Internationale.</p>
   <p>No. 90 contains a popular elucidation of Kropotkin's views about anarcho-communism. The Staphanov System is explained and is shown to be just a new name for an old form of exploitation.</p>
   <p>In the articles "Spain Washed in Blood," (No. 92) and "And Yet the Fascists will be Defeated," (No. 94) the readers are informed about the complicated conditions under which the events in Spain take place, and the international relations which have arisen out of these events. The readers become acquainted with the driving forces and the inner meaning of the events in Spain and with the role of the anarchists in these events. In the article, "16," (No. 93) are elucidated the meaning, the causes and the purport of the execution of Zinoviev, Kamenev and others.</p>
   <p>Using only these leading articles we can give positive answers to all the questions mentioned above. The leading articles teach also how to apply the principles of anarchism to the elucidation of vital questions of today.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The same articles convey an answer to those who feel sorry because of the absence of articles of a theoretical character. They contain more theory than the "theoretical" articles, i. e., those considering things in a purely abstract way, unconnected with the vital, stirring issues of the day. If one will look through all the articles published in The Cause of Labor, he will find that there is too much theory in this magazine.</p>
   <p>As to polemics with The Awakening, our magazine did not deem it necessary to undertake anything of the kind despite the fact that it was directly challenged by The Awakening. In the future our magazine will also abstain from all polemics with The Awakening, because these polemics cannot be kept in due boundaries, discussing things only from the standpoint of principles, but degenerate into a discussion of personalities which is very harmful to the movement.</p>
   <p>During the period with which this report is concerned, the following <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>persons were collaborating in our magazine:</p>
   <p>K. Philippovich</p>
   <p>A. Suchi</p>
   <p>Ch. Cornelissen</p>
   <p>P. Benar</p>
   <p>M. Pierrot</p>
   <p>Orobon Fernandez</p>
   <p>Santillan</p>
   <p>B-ky</p>
   <p>Mueller-Lening</p>
   <p>Shapiro</p>
   <p>Volin</p>
   <p>Rocker</p>
   <p>M. Mrachny</p>
   <p>Emma Goldman</p>
   <p>Armando Borghi</p>
   <p>Romash</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>The following persons have been correspondents of our magazine, reporting current local events:</p>
   <p>Kovalenko</p>
   <p>I. Daniluk</p>
   <p>Cavriluk</p>
   <p>Volodkin</p>
   <p>Doobatovka</p>
   <p>Motsegood</p>
   <p>Novik</p>
   <p>Crinuk</p>
   <p>Resanovich and others.</p>
   <p>Because of the events in Spain the collaboration of our foreign comrades became a difficult matter, though previously also it had not been easy because of the long intervals between the issues of the magazine and of the difficulties of getting translations of the articles sent by foreign collaborators.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>The editing of the magazine is also connected with certain difficulties owing to the lack of Russian and English newspapers and magazines and the fact that there is no regular exchange with foreign anarchist publications.</p>
   <p>During the period taken into consideration in this report there has been only one complaint about our magazine, voiced by the St. Louis group and caused by the articles written by Cornelissen; but this misunderstanding was quickly settled in a friendly way, as befits comrades.</p>
   <p>Not only during the period covered by this report, but also during the whole time when this magazine was published in Chicago, there were no misunderstandings between the members of the editorial staff. The work is being done in a most healthy and friendly atmosphere. All questions of importance or arousing controversies are referred to the Progressive Club for discussion.</p>
   <p>The Editorial Staff.</p>
