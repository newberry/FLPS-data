   <p>According to the report of the treasurer of the society, Mr. Shilay, the society has spent on a farm $80,423, and has sold lots for the sum of $11,328. Mr. Shilay finds that instead of electing a secretary the society should hire a competent person. He also announces that the society is organizing a grand concert for the benefit of a home for the aged.</p>
   <p>The report of the executive board is severely criticized by the revising commission. The report is declared to be formally correct, but the commission points out that considerable sums of money were spent in a very careless way, causing heavy losses to the society.</p>
   <p>The executive board is being criticized for its lack of energy in attracting young people to membership in the society.</p>

   <p>ROOV is a New York society having branches in several cities. A branch existed in Chicago some twenty years ago, but as far as I remember, it joined the Russian Independent Society of Mutual Aid of Chicago, formally connected with the so-called Russian Independent Church. I do not think a branch of the ROOV exists at present in Chicago.</p>
