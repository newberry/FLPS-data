   <p>The second session of the 25th supreme assembly of RIMAS was resumed Sunday, <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>September 6, 1936, at 12:00 Noon.</p>
   <p>Roll Call:</p>
   <p>There was a quorum of delegates present. personal felicitations were extended to the assembly by Maria Sabinskaia of Kryloff school, Evghenia Bernova of Bunin school and E. Z. Moravsky of Rassviet. A. pasiuk, supr. pres, of the Society, reported that new schools were organized; there was success financially, due to introduction of new forms of insurance policies much better than the former ones.</p>
   <p>N. Kozak, supr. sec'y of the Society, reported that the funds in the treasury are increasing, although the enrollment of new members has recently dropped, the cause of which is difficult to determine. New policies were introduced which bring good benefits to the members. At present the membership is 1,470 adults and 250 juveniles, a total of 1,720 members.</p>
   <p>Jos. Sleznik, supr. treasurer of the Society, reported that there is nothing more to report, that the secretary has told everything.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The audit committee expressed its thanks to N. Kozak and Jos. Sleznik for their honest and accurate work. Supr. sec'y N. Kozak reported that the attitude of the members of the board toward the work of the Society was excellent and they have loyally defended the interests of the Society.</p>
   <p>G. Wallace on behalf of the organization committee reported that life is sad for the Russian people in other cities. It is difficult at the present time to attract new members because they do not understand the principles of mutual aid, whereas others (i. e. those over 50 years of age) cannot be admitted into the Society because of their age. The conclusion drawn from this was that youth must at all cost be attracted into our ranks. During the last 12 months Branch 28 was very successfully organized.</p>
   <p>A. Bernov of the school council announced that the parents in Chicago do not show any interest in school matters. Last year only two schools existed during the school term, and there were 64 pupils enrolled. But this year the school council will try to create a junior high school, where pupils who have completed their elementary training can continue their education in Russian and not forget what they have already learned.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>S. Volodkin, member of the editing committee, reported that the page of "RIMAS news" had very little material assistance from the branches. Very often an empty page would have been issued were it not for branch 18. Mme. Swatikova, editor of the page, is not to be blamed for this. In the future all branches should help the editing committee in order that the page may be more interesting, and the contents more substantial.</p>
   <p>Dr. P. Chadovich announced that the real estate management committee managed the properties very diligently, although very often personal business had to be ignored. The speaker reported that in the future the real estate management committee should receive monthly or yearly remuneration for its work. The suggestion was approved and referred to the decision of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The committee entrusted with finding a suitable farm for the Society reported that farms average too high in price in Illinois, and the discussion on this subject was placed in the agenda.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Reports from Branches:</p>

The branch requests the board of directors to subscribe to European Russian magazines and create an extensive library.</p>
   <p>Branch 25.-K. Boran reported that there are 30 members in the branch and $379 in the treasury. The school at the branch is not strong, but it is being maintained.</p>
   <p>Branch 28.-V. Shavaiko reported that the branch has 50 adult members and 10 juveniles; there is $167.08 in the treasury. The branch is in existence only 8 months.

   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Attorney of the Society, K. Gugis, greeted the Assembly and wished it success in the future.</p>
   <p>Formal petitions, Resolutions and Complaints.</p>
   <p>Intermission.</p>
   <p>After the intermission it was announced that all written petitions, resolutions and complaints addressed to the supreme assembly be referred to the grievance committee.</p>
   <p>Some delegates appealed to the assembly in regard to those members in branches who, having reached old age and lost their jobs, have no means to support them-selves, that they be given aid from the Society's treasury.</p>
   <p>The assembly advised the creation of a special fund for this purpose, as the Society cannot make any payment of the death benefit to the member while he is alive.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>St. George's Parish Request for Loan.</p>
   <p>There was a written request received from the St. George's parish that the Society grant to the parish a new loan of $5,000 to complete the construction. At present the parish owes the Society $7,000 on which amount interest has not been paid in full. The assembly decided to refer this matter to the new board of directors, since among the delegates there were supporters and opponents.</p>
   <p>Telegrams of felicitations were received from the 10th convention of R O O V A and the Russian-American Citizens' Organization of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The Assembly of RIMAS decided to reply with felicitations to the 10th convention of R O O V A. Vice-president of RIMAS, Dr. Chadovich, read to the assembly the demands of the Illinois Insurance Department, regarding proportioning the dues of those members who did not pay enough, and the resolution of the board of directors which the Insurance Department approved on June 1, 1936, in which the following is stated:</p>
   <p>Whereas an examination made for our society by the Examiners of the Department <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>of Insurance has developed that we are now insolvent, and as the Department is demanding that prompt steps should be taken to increase our actuarial condition and again become solvent, and:</p>
   <p>Whereas, our actuary has determined that, by again collecting the rates at ages of entry in the years of 1930 and 1931 rather than the rates which were erroneously reduced by action of this board to the rates of entry into the former Orthodox Society, and we would again be more than 100% solvent, Now, Therefore:</p>
   <p>Be it resolved, that this board of directors now rescind its former action and require all members of entry years 1930 and 1931 to again pay the NFC rates and their respective attained ages in said years, beginning with June, 1936; or to proportionately reduce their protection to the amount which the present rate, if continued, will purchase; or to be permitted to transfer to the new Ordinary Life rates, based on the American Experience Table of mortality, at their respective attained ages in 1930 and 1931, with the Automatic Premium Loan Option and Paid Up and Extended Insurance privileges effective at once, but Cash Withdrawal and Loan Options to be deferred for three (3) years from the date of said transfers, and then to thereafter be required to <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>pay the established Ordinary Life rate based on the Amn. Exp. table of mortality at their respective attained ages in the said years of 1930 and 1931.</p>
   <p>Resolved further, that members heretofore permitted to reduce their rates by action of this board, as previously recited, shall not hereafter be required to make up any of said shortages caused by the reduction in the rates for the period of lower rates were actually paid by such members; and that when either of the options of readjustment presented in these resolutions has been accepted by such members the shortages aforementioned shall then be cancelled.</p>
   <p>Resolved further, that all members of the years 1930 and 1931, whose rates were reduced by this board shall automatically and without any action on their part be required to pay their rates at their respective entry ages in the years 1930 and 1931 for the amount of protection provided in his or her certificate; Provided, however that they may also be permitted, upon written application, to proportionately reduce their protection to the amount the rate now paid will purchase; or take out a new certificate on the Ordinary Life rates now being written for a like or less amount of protection at their entry ages in 1930 and 1931; but in each such case the member must make written request for either one of the last two options, the first one, only, being automatic.</p>
   <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>
   <p>Resolved further, that because an emergency exists, in that the Dept. has demanded immediate action to attain solvency at the earliest possible moment, that these resolutions shall become effective when adopted, subject to being ratified by the supreme Assembly at its next session, and that the officers are hereby empowered to promptly put the readjustments set forth in these resolutions into effect.</p>
   <p>This resolution with the approval of the Insurance Department and the board of directors of RIMAS went into effect June 3, 1936 and obligates those members whose dues do not conform with their ages shown in the policies.</p>
   <p>The delegates to the assembly accepted the demands of the Insurance Department and unanimously ratified the resolution of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>The delegates also established a time limit for those who wished to change their old policies for new as of November 1, 1936. Dues shall be payable on the age attained as shown in the old policy. After November 1, 1936, if a member has not taken care to make the transfer by November 1, 1936, thereafter <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>the dues shall be paid according to his age at the date indicated.</p>
   <p>The members who shall not wish to pay the increased rate of dues, shall have to return their policies to the office of the Society for rewriting.</p>
   <p>Reading of Correspondence of RIMAS an R O O V A</p>
   <p>N. Kozak read the correspondence of the board and R O O V A in regard to consolidation. Both organizations await the occasion when consolidation will take place. Since there are no opponents to consolidation with other mutual aid societies, and the delegates were in favor of consolidation with all relative organizations, the assembly entrusted the board of directors with the active work for consolidation. Upon motion duly made and seconded, the meeting of the second session was adjourned at 6:30 p.m. Sunday, September 6, 1936.</p>

Dr. Nedzelnitzky <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>announced that youth will only join the ranks when it knows the Russian language and will appreciate Russian culture. This youth will continue the work begun by the older generation and, as everyone knows, the future existence of the Society depends on the youth.</p>
   <p>Re: Schools.</p>
   <p>Since schools of Russian language are necessary for the attraction of youth into the Society, it was decided that all members should enrol youth into the Society, and that the Society extend its support to the Russian schools.

A motion was made to loan money <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>on first mortgage loans, first to members of the Society and then, if no members desire loans, grant such to non-members, but first suggesting to the latter that they join the Society.</p>
   <p>The delegates decided to refer the matter of loans to non-members of the Society to the board of directors.</p>
   <p>Date of Next Supreme Assembly:</p>
   <p>It was decided to convene the next Assembly in the beginning of September of 1937.</p>
   <p>Report of the Grievance Committee:</p>
   <p>The committee announced that Maria Kulich appeals to the assembly with the request that the assembly permit the board of directors to pay to her the death benefit of her deceased husband, B. Kulich, who passed away, May 31, 1934.</p>
   <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>
   <p>However, since the deceased committed suicide, and in accordance with the by-laws payment of the benefit cannot be made for suicides, the assembly</p>
   <p>Resolved that in the case of Maris Kulich the assembly adhers to the provisions of the by-laws.</p>
   <p>Accounting Committee's Report:</p>
   <p>The committee reported that there were no resolutions filed. A motion was made to issue a Jubilee bulletin in honor of the 25th anniversary of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. The motion was approved by the delegates and referred to the board for decision.</p>
   <p>Re: Society Farm:</p>
   <p>The Assembly entrusted the Board of Directors to continue the work of seeking a farm for the Society.</p>
   <p>Re: Examination Fees to Branch Physician:</p>
   <p>M. Rusetzky made a motion in regard to the payment of fees to the physician <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>for examination of new members; the board of directors pays the physician of branch 14 twice a year. After some discussion an explanation was made to the effect that the physician's fees are paid by check sent by the office of the Society upon receipt of a bill from the branch physician.</p>
   <p>Discussion of Pushkin Commemoration:</p>
   <p>The Assembly discussed the commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of the death of Pushkin. There are many organizations in Chicago, among them a Pushkin Committee.

   <p>Upon motion duly made and carried, the 25th supreme assembly of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society was closed, Monday, September 7, 1936 at 7:30 p.m.</p>
