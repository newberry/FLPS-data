   <p>Last Friday the well-known Russian writer, Mr. Grebenshchikov, delivered a lecture on "Siberia--The Country of a Great Future". The lecture attracted a large audience. As a native of Siberia Mr. Grebenshchikov very ably and intimately introduced the hearers to the fear-inspiring and yet most wonderful immensity of Siberia, with all its fabulous riches, and variety of climate, and of people. The lecturer predicted a great future for the vast land, in a small corner of which he was born.</p>
   <p>He told of the neglected past of his native land, spoke of the untouched, untold riches lying underground, and wondered not that the Japanese cast covetous eyes upon it and attempt to snatch at least a bit of the immense territory called by the name of Siberia.</p>
   <p>The lecture was illustrated with interesting slides. In the intervals a chorus of Kuban Cossacks sang numerous songs from their seemingly inexhaustible repertoire.</p>
   <p>The lecture closed with the singing of "Long Live the Poet," dedicated to Mr. Grebenshchikov, who was rewarded with thunderous applause.</p>
