   <p>The other day I received a letter with the return address of RNzOV [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society] on the envelope. I thought the Central Committee was being called into session and that there was an invitation for me to attend the business meetings. I opened the envelope and to my surprise, I found, instead, an invitation from Mr. Deviatkin and his agents to attend their meeting. Deviatkin and Company have decided to call a meeting at which they want either to ascertain or to explain the reason why RNzOV has introduced new forms of insurance for its members, why the organization "forces" its members to take out the new policies, even though some of the members, as Deviatkin states, want to retain their old policies. Deviatkin, in his letter, says that all the members who are not willing to change their form of insurance, are being expelled from the Society. Further on, they want to know why the Central Administration does not reveal its reasons for introducing the new policies, and, finally, Deviatkin's agents are interested <span class="page-break">\2</span>in finding out what has become of the money which was paid in during the past twenty years, and why in the first branch, the officials are "forcing" members to donate for the upkeep of Mr. Zheltonoga [Translator's note: Mr. Zheltonoga is a well-known priest in charge of the church at 917 North Wood Street].</p>
   <p>Any sensible man would find the whole letter somewhat mystifying because if the members of the Society regularly attend their branch business meetings--and most of them do--the reasons for the change in the policies are clear to them and no unsolicited explanation from Deviatkin and his coterie is necessary. Perhaps our "comrades" have lost their power of reasoning or turned into Chinamen and have ceased to understand the Russian language. Or, perhaps, Deviatkin's agents want members of the Central Committee of RNzOV to visit them at their homes and give the explanations seemingly required.</p>
   <p>No, "comrades," members of the Central Committee are not going to visit you because you would not accept explanations anyway. The purposes for which you call your meetings are concealed in the thickness of your brain, and revolve around the evil plan of injuring the Society. You were born to be <span class="page-break">\3</span>disrupters and you will remain such!</p>
   <p>Deviatkin's agents are also very much perturbed by the fact that RNzOV prints all of its news and publicity matters in Rassviet, scrupulously avoiding the release of any news to Novyi Mir [Translator's note: A Communist paper in New York]. Rassviet is a thorn in the side of Deviatkin and his accomplices. If it were not for this newspaper, it would be much easier for them to deceive the Russian colony and to"milk" it under one pretense or another.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee should keep under close scrutiny all such disrupters and authors of such letters. They should be sent to the place where they are trying to drag our organization. There is no other way of dealing with them. If some of our members would rather be on Mr. Deviatkin's leash, let them go to his camp. We will clear the way because we prefer liberty to any kind of dictatorship.</p>
   <p>Our RNzOV grows physically and spiritually. Most of the members are changing <span class="page-break">\4</span>to the new policies and they are doing so voluntarily. There were no cases of expulsion because of this change and there will be none. The Central Committee will never resort to any method of compulsion in its administrative work for the benefit of its members.</p>
   <p>For this very reason, both the Society as a whole and its Central Administration are held in high esteem by the Russian colony, and particularly, by the most advanced and culturally developed members of the organization.</p>
   <p>Members of the Russian colony have known Independents for many years; they know the educational and social work performed by this organization for the benefit of the entire Russian colony.</p>
   <p>If you, "comrades," want to know something about our activity, come to our meetings, follow the proceedings, and you will be well-posted on the affairs of our organization. At our meetings the floor is open to everybody. We do not gag even our opponents. Everyone is free to express his opinions. At these meetings you will also receive the necessary explanations from competent people. It's possible that there are still many members who are not <span class="page-break">\5</span>entirely acquainted with the forms of insurance only recently introduced by our Society. Such members should not fail to attend the next business meeting at which they will receive the necessary instructions and information as to the reasons for the reforms adopted by our Society.</p>
