   <p>In recent years lectures in Chicago have been poorly attended, regardless of the lecturer and the subject.</p>
   <p>Out of 70,000 members in the Russian colony, only one or two per cent attend. The reason for this everyone explains in his own way. We either know everything or are too lazy.</p>
   <p>But the last two lectures of Maksimov were quite successful in comparison with the past lectures.</p>
   <p>Maksimov during his two hour lecture, gave facts on the recent conditions in Spain and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. All seemed to be satisfied. The only bad point about it is that the lectures are too long and the public becomes too tired.</p>
