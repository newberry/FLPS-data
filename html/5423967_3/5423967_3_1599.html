   <p>(22) President of RNOV, D. Kazushchik, in his welcome address announced that the deficiency of RIMAS lies in the fact that it wishes to consolidate with Russian colonists only. Kazushchik recommends to the assembly the question of consolidation not only with Russian colonists but also with all workers, not discriminating in creed or race be considered. To this announcement there were heard contradictory remarks from the floor to the effect that it is not our aim to create an Internationale.</p>

Nikon Sidorovich stated that there are 32 adult and 12 children members of the branch. $170 was paid out during the year in sick benefits. $9 was set aside for the school.

   <p>Supreme president of the society, E. Horoschenia, suggested that the salary of the financial secretary be raised to $300 a year and that of the other officials remain the same. Many delegates opposed the increase of salaries.</p>
   
   <p>James Mikhalchik raised the question of extraordinary expenses paid by the treasury of the society. He recommended to the assembly that the delegates decide once and for always that the Board of Directors should not have the right to pay for extraordinary work other than the fixed salaries, but should cases arise, they must be left to the next assembly for approval. After some debating, the question was put to a vote and a majority of the delegates were in favor of not increasing salaries to any officer. Should any extraordinary work arise, the administration may meet the additional expense.</p>
   <p>(38) Election of Board of Directors for the Coming Year.</p>
   <p>A motion was made to adjourn for today and tomorrow with fresh vitality the elections will begin.

   <p>(40) Nomination and Election of Supreme Vice-President of the Society.</p>
   <p>The nomination for vice-president was met with some difficulty, as it was made clear that no one wanted to accept the vice-presidency because a bond is necessary while the position carries no responsibilities and no salary. A proposal was made to remove the bond from all assistants having no responsibilities. This was approved unanimously. After this Nikon Sidorovich was unanimously elected vice-president.</p>
   <p>(40a) Nomination and Election of Treasurer of the Society.</p>
   <p>Joseph Sleznik was unanimously re-elected treasurer of the society at a salary of $80 a year and under a $2,000 cash bond or $4,000 in real estate. A. Bernoff, alternate for delegate of Branch 6, I. Erin, was elected assistant treasurer, but the next day I. Erin appeared desirous of being elected to the Board of Directors, and consequently it was made clear that there could not be two persons elected to the Board of Directors from a branch sending one delegate to the assembly. In view of this Bernoff requested that he be absolved of the responsibilities of assistant treasurer and in his stead Semen Jakimovich was elected.</p>
   
   <p>(41) Nicholas Kozak was unanimously re-elected Supreme Secretary of the society. Secretary serves at a salary of $250 a year and is under a $4,000 real estate bond and all his expenses pertaining to society business, such as telephone and transportation are to be paid, as well as those of the other directors of the society.</p>

   <p>(44) The Second Session of the Assembly Opened Sunday, May 29, at 10:45 A. M.</p>
   <p>The roll was called; all delegates were present with the exception of V. Konashewsky; J. Erin replaced by alternate from Branch 6, Bernoff, was also present at this session, as was A. Pasiuk who represented the RIMAS Society at ROOVA's 6th convention in New York.</p>
   <p>A. Tichanovich, chairman of the assembly, read the greeting received from the Gogol school. Next, a representative of the city authorities greeted the assembly. In his speech he appealed to the Russian people to consolidate and have solidarity and advised to highly prize the great Russian culture and the beautiful Russian language.</p>
   <p>J. Erin on behalf of the Russian-American Citizens' Club in Chicago addressed the assembly. He briefly reminded the delegates of the activity of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society and expressed the hope that at the assembly the foundation will be laid for consolidation of the Russian colony into one family. Each of the delegate speakers were greeted with hearty applause.</p>
   <p>Especially wild was the applause accorded to V. F. Panka, representative of the city authorities who gave an ardent speech in the Polish language.</p>
   
   <p>(45) Nomination and Election of Fourteen Directors of the Society.</p>
   <p>There were twenty-four delegates nominated, but the following declined to accept the nomination: G. Kichkailo, S. Gutz, S. Zavada, J. Dziako, J. Mikhalchik, A. Grigorchuk, S. Jakimovich, A. Haponovich, and Dr. P. Chadovich. The following were nominees for candidacy: Z. Stolarana, I. Pyatnitza, J. Erin, F. Davidchik, I. Marchuk, P. Sorogovetz, P. Vasilkov, V. Sabinsky, P. Nagorny, K. Jarmolik and Katherine Parada. In view of the fact that fourteen delegates accepted nominations, therefore they were simultaneously unanimously elected and there were no objections raised.</p>
   <p>(46) Question Raised at the Assembly in Order.</p>
   <p>First, that of extending privileges to new members, voiced by Kichkailo. After some disputing, a conclusion was reached unanimously that initiation dues were not to be exacted during four months of the year, i. e., June, July, December and January. The new members must pay the first month's dues in accordance with his age and amount of insurance.</p>
   <p>(47) Second, that raised by (a) delegate from Branch 5, Argo, Ill., regarding the removal from their branch of the debt for newspaper Svobodnaya Rossiya, made at the time when the society published a daily newspaper. Delegates, having heard the complaint of delegate of Branch 5, decided by a majority vote to absolve the branch of this debt; there were only two delegates opposed. (The branch had been paying $1 monthly, but there was still $71 owing.)</p>
   <p>(48) Third, that raised by V. Dedovich during the reading of the treasurer's report, about loans. The financial secretary had reported that money of the society was not invested in "perishable places," as enemies of the society claim. Interest on the mortgages is being paid punctually. Delegate from Branch 5 reports that money under first mortgages is loaned only to members of Branch 1, but to members of other branches they are not given any loans. Horoschenia denied this statement and requested the financial secretary to disclose the names of any who received money under mortgages. The secretary read the list of mortgages and stated that loans are made to members of all branches. If, however, some members were refused loans, it was because there was no cash on hand. At present there is $46,000 loaned out for first mortgages. Delegate of Branch 14 moved that no loans be made for an indefinite period. After some discussion it was resolved by a majority vote of the assembly, 23 to 7, that if there shall be more than $15,000 in the treasury of the society, it shall loan money only on first mortgages in the future, but no greater amount than one-fourth of the value of the property.</p>
   <p>(49) Consolidation with ROOVA and other friendly organizations of mutual aid.</p>
   <p>Chairman of the assembly, Tichanovich, announced that now the speeches of the delegates present at the 6th Convention of ROOVA in New York, omitted yesterday due to A. Pasiuk's absence, will be made. To explain this complicated question, Supreme President of the society, E. Horoschenia, took the floor and on behalf of the committee stated that correspondence with ROOVA has been conducted since November of last year with the knowledge of the Board of Directors. The committee has worked out the following plan:</p>
   <p>The consolidated society must be divided into two districts: New York and Chicago. Branches must send dues to the center closest to them. The main office may be in New York, but in this case the society must be called the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. Besides, two representatives of RIMAS, A. Pasiuk and J. Dziako, were sent to the 6th Convention of ROOVA to clear everything on the spot. In conclusion, Horoschenia asked the delegates whether or not the correspondence with ROOVA regarding consolidation should be read. Several delegates stated that it is not necessary to read the correspondence as they have full faith in the members of the committee. President of ROOVA, Vasilieff, proposed that all the correspondence be read on the grounds that adherents of Novi Mir do not cease to shout about various secret agreements existing between the administrations of RIMAS and ROOVA. His proposal was accepted and the secretary with the chairman began reading the lengthy correspondence concerning the matter in which there proved to be no secret agreements.</p>
   <p>Whereupon A. Pasiuk asked for the floor and announced that the Bolsheviki were scaring the independents with "white guards." However, when we came to the 6th Convention of ROOVA, he continued, we saw workers there like ourselves. In ROOVA, as in our society, members are our countrymen, from provinces of Grodno, Minsk and Volhyn. There are no white guards there. The society is governed by the same workers like ourselves. Some branches are older than our society. The society does not occupy itself with politics. There are people there of all convictions, but they all live peacefully and friendly and are devoted to the work of mutual aid. We acquainted ourselves with all the work and examined the financial books. We should not heed what the Bolsheviks say about ROOVA, inasmuch as they call us white guards. There is no need to fear ROOVA. We should consolidate with this society for the welfare and progress of the Russian colony. After Pasiuk, J. Dziako asked for the floor and was surprised that A. Pasiuk said so little, and in consequence asked the chairman of the assembly "what kind of speech should be made."</p>
   
   <p>The chairman replied that the question up for consideration now is that of consolidation and that he should relate exclusively what he saw and heard while in New York. Then J. Dziako, in addition to Pasiuk's speech, stated that at the 6th Convention of ROOVA for consolidation, 39 delegates voted in favor of consolidation diregarding what the name of the society (may) be, or the place of headquarters; 15 members voted that the society exists under the name of ROOVA, but the center must be in New York. Eight delegates were opposed.</p>
   <p>The delegates from the provinces chiefly voted for consolidation. Subsequently, the following decision was made: if the center be in New York then the society must bear the name of Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society; but, if the center be in Chicago, then the Society must bear the name Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society. Therefore the chairman asked the delegates whether anyone else will say anything in regard to this matter. The following delegates requested the floor:</p>
   
   <p>E. Horoschenia, Z. Stolarana, J. Erin, F. Fedoroff, Z. Dreichan, N. Sidorovich, V. Zamkovetz, M. Horozanko, P. Chopko, J. Mikhalchik, A. Petruchik, S. Jakimovich, W. Sabinsky, I. Marchuk, and P. Nagorny.</p>
   <p>Thereupon a motion was made to limit the time of each speaker to five minutes. The motion was seconded and carried. All speakers were in favor of the principle of consolidation. For instance:Nagorny expressed himself in favor of consolidation of ROOVA and RIMAS. He said that regular members of the society should not pay any attention to the slander of Bolsheviks, as they slander alike ROOVA and RIMAS. Marchuk spoke for consolidation not only with ROOVA but also with RNOV.</p>
   <p>Chopko thanked ROOVA because it first set the question of consolidation and suggested to the assembly to decide this question with seriousness. Dreichman said that it is not necessary to hurry with consolidation, but it is better to wait until the next assembly.</p>
   <p>(Petruchik spoke for consolidation not only of the two organizations mentioned, but of all Russian Mutual Aid Societies.)</p>
   
   <p>Fedoroff (Baltimore) announced that in ROOVA workers are members, but they are governed not by workers. "We," he said, "cannot oppose consolidation, but we must see to it that enemies do not govern us." In conclusion he advised that the question be left open and (that) at the same time correspondence with other organizations begin.</p>
   <p>Horozanko proposed to leave the question open. Sidorovich said that before the Independents there stand two important problems at the present time: consolidation and schools. These questions must be solved by the assembly. Some of the delegates are presumably afraid of something. Formerly the tsar's consul scared them, and now, Devyatkin frightens them with non-admittance into Russia. "The Bolsheviki," he said "blame us for wanting to create some kind of an army. But this is only Bolshevik provocation. We are uniting people on the basis of mutual aid and education, not for war. If we unite, then we shall also unite the whole Russian colony in (America) United States and Canada. Then we shall have our own people's homes and schools. We must expel from our branches such persons as spread enmity and disorganization among our ranks. We have no need in such people, we must deal with them as bees with drones."</p>
   <p>Erin announced that the assembly acted well in hearing the correspondence concerning consolidation. "Now," he said, "the whole Russian colony will know the value of those 'comrades' who do not cease saying that the leaders of RIMAS sealed certain secret agreements with ROOVA without the knowledge of the ranking members of the society. Certain members of Branch 1 perhaps did not express themselves in favor of consolidation only because they did not know the contents of this correspondence, but trusted the 'comrades' who ardently provide them with their provocative proclamations. These 'comrades' become our friends only when our treasury is sound, but when there is no treasury, they are not interested in us. There is no need to fear consolidation, just as there should be no postponement of this question. When we shall consolidate then we will be strong, not only financially but also culturally." Stolarana said that there will be no advantage derived from hurrying consolidation. He said, "in my opinion, first it is necessary to unite the Russian colony in Chicago, then negotiate for consolidation with other organizations."</p>
   <p>Jakimovich announced that some of the delegates obviously are afraid of something , and therefore, we should wait a while.</p>
   <p>Mikhalchik said that earlier the Board of Directors of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society communicated with the Pittsburg Internationale" and suggested that it politics (sic). But the Pittsburghers rejected such a suggestion and began slandering the Independents. The slandering has continued both in conversation and in the press for two years. ROOVA is a fraternal organization, therefore, it need not be feared. The Board of Directors of RIMAS has not conducted any underhand work but has always worked in the interests of the society. The Bolsheviks go from house to house and say that there are one hundred persons who have left our society. This is a bold lie. One hundred members did not leave our society, only eleven, and we regret their leaving us. In conclusion, Mikhalchik announced that the new administration will not confer with the Pittsburgh society as they are not interested in the Russian colony and are uniting with various strange organizations. Therefore, the Independents must stop thinking about uniting with the Pittsburgh Society while it is ruled by enemies of the Russian colony and make a decision for consolidation with ROOVA.</p>
   <p>V. Sabinsky: The Bolsheviks call me a white guard, but you all know that I am a worker and have never had anything in common with the whiteguards. I have worked and will work in the interest of the Russian working colony. There is no need to fear consolidation. We were frightened at first, but we exist and are strengthening our organization. We are in favor of uniting with RNOV, too, but this society must abandon politics and its "Internationalism." Leaders of RNOV have betrayed the Russian colony as they unite with various strange organizations not for mutual aid but for political activity. As far as we are concerned, we are striving for consolidation with all slavic organizations. Consolidation with ROOVA we must not postpone, but we must make it an actuality now.</p>
   <p>Elarion Horoschenia said that the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has only 1,500 members. ROOVA in existence only six years has done much more. If we will not fear consolidation, then our ranks will be increased. In conclusion he moved that the question of consolidation be decided in principle and entrust the new administration to work out the terms of agreement and present it at the next assembly for ratification. Besides, he advised that negotiations with other Russian organizations be conducted for consolidation.</p>
   <p>Zamkowetz did not oppose the principle of consolidation but suggested to leave the matter open for the time being.</p>
   <p>Tichanovich announced that Branch 14 is in favor of consolidation with all relative organizations not engaged in political or religious work, and first of all with ROOVA.</p>
   <p>Wasiliev (president of ROOVA): "Bolsheviks call me a white guard, yet I came to America as a 16-year-old boy and never carried weapons in my hands. I represent "white" heads, but soon you shall behold a "red" head. Then you will realize who is the real worker." Whereupon Vasiliev related how ROOVA was organized and how the Bolsheviki tried to seize or disintegrate it. "At present," he said "our society has 3,730 members (more than 70 branches). In our treasury there is $164,000. The election of our administration is conducted the same as yours, and therefore, you should not heed the provocative remarks of the Bolsheviks that ROOVA, our society, is ruled by whiteguards. At the present time two questions face our administration: the expansion of schools, and aid to those members who because of the depression cannot pay their dues. If we unite, then we will have schools and farms. Then we shall also solve the problem of the unemployed members. We have corresponded with RNOVA in regard to consolidation, but it does not wish to give up politics. Leaders of RNOV are concerned not with mutual aid, but with dragging people under policemen's clubs. Our consolidation will bring disaster to all our enemies."</p>
   
   <p>Kazushchik next asked for the floor. Before granting him the floor, the chairman of the assembly showed the delegates a handbill printed by RNOV against the foremost members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. The chairman said that in the handbill, printed as the result of the initiative of Kazushchik, dirt was thrown upon the very persons whom the Independents elect at their assemblies for responsible positions. "By insulting those persons," said the chairman, "they insult all of us present in this assembly."</p>
   <p>Kazushchik announced that RNOV is non-partisan and not an international organization. (Laughter rang throughout the auditorium.) Thereupon he accused the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society ROOVA of creating a political organization, RUSTO. Representatives of ROOVA deny this accusation and announce that ROOVA had no connection in any way with RUSTO. There were some members of ROOVA in that organization, but no society of mutual aid can prohibit its members from belonging to political organizations and engaging in political work outside the society.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Kazushchik stated that RNOV united not the Russian colony, but workers of all nationalities. He also accused the administration of RIMAS of concealing from the delegates some letters and resolutions.</p>
   <p>Palchewsky (treasurer of ROOVA) stated how the first Russian organizations were organized in New York, how they united into one family and called themselves the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society, and how the Bolsheviks tried to destroy this society. Palchewsky also stated that ROOVA in a year had $26,000 profit, and in all there is over $160,000 in the treasury. In RNOV, according to rumors, there are more members, but scarcely more than half the money in the treasury, because the leaders of this society do not spare the people's money and travel all over the country, although no one invites them. In conclusion, Palchewsky said that RIMAS and ROOVA must unite over all barriers on an equal basis.</p>
   <p>M. Kutzko (guest from Gary) greeted the delegates and announced that members of Branch 18 of ROOVA have always defended the Independents against the Bolshevik hoodlums and hooligans. We always have supported the Independents, but with Branch 35 of RNOV we have never been able to come to terms. These people cannot prove their right, and therefore, have often let fists fly instead. "These 'comrades' are your worst enemies," he said. In Chicago they call us white guards, but in New York, anarchists-rassvetovtzy. This they do for the purpose of disrupting the Russian colony and want to seize it into their nets.</p>
   
   <p>If we unite, then our enemies soon will meet their end.</p>
   <p>Thereupon another representative of RNOV, a Chicagoan, Klimko asked for the floor. The chairman of the assembly put the matter to a vote of the assembly. The overwhelming majority of delegates voted against permitting Klimko to speak and considered the matter settled.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the assembly announced that the discussion of the matter is closed and proposed that motions be made in regard to consolidation.</p>
   <p>Then the chairman of the assembly demanded motions be made in regard to consolidation. J. Erin moved that the matter of consolidation be approved in principle and (this motion was seconded by A. Pasiuk) that the Board of Directors work out the terms on which consolidation would take place.</p>
   
   <p>The second motion made by Horozanko and seconded by Stolarana that the question remain open: The chairman requested that a vote be taken on these two motions. The following resulted: 36 votes in favor of motion one, that is, that the matter of consolidation be approved in principle and that the Board of Directors work out the terms on which consolidation would take place.</p>
   <p>There were six votes in favor of the second motion, that is, that the question remain open.</p>
   <p>Moisei Syman appeared on the floor and asked why the presidium of the assembly does not read the resolutions of the Board of Directors in connection with consolidation. Horoschenia replied that this resolution was not read because copies were sent to all branches and the contents are known to all members of the society. Some delegates proposed that the resolution be read, motivating their proposal on the fact that if the resolution were not read at this time, the "Novomirtzy" (adherents of Novi Mir) would make an issue of this and write in their pages that the Board of Directors concealed from the delegates certain "secret" pacts with ROOVA. The proposal of this delegates was approved and the chairman read the following resolution of the Board of Directors of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society:</p>
   <p>"We, the Board of Directors of RIMAS, at our meeting held April 23, 1932, at 2411 W. Chicago Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, having heard the report and recommendations of the members J. Dziako and Alexander Pasiuk, whom we delegated to the 6th Delegate Convention of the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society for the purpose of familiarizing and settling the possibilities and admissibilities of consolidation with the aforementioned society, have found that:</p>
   <p>(1) The interests of the membership ranks of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society demand a common Russian colonial consolidation;</p>
   <p>(2) Every branch of RIMAS is free to accept independently the resolution for consolidation of RIMAS with ROOVA and instruct its delegates to vote for such a consolidation at the 21st Supreme Assembly.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors of RIMAS recommends that the consolidation of RIMAS, ROOVA and other organizations desiring to unite into one Russian fraternal non-political family for mutual aid proceed in the following manner:</p>
   <p>1. The united society must bear the name Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   
   <p>2. After consolidation two districts must be appointed: the New York and the Chicago districts.</p>
   <p>3. All branches of RIMAS, ROOVA and other societies entering this consolidation will pertain to the Chicago district, if they are closely situated to Chicago, and branches closely situated to New York will pertain to the New York district. Besides, every branch will send its dues to the headquarters of its district and receive benefits from there, also loans for first mortgages, etc.;</p>
   <p>4. Each district will be governed by the district committee elected at the regular district assembly.</p>
   <p>5. Each district will elect several representatives to the Supreme Assembly where the executive officers for the administration will be elected for the entire consolidated society.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors of RIMAS considers that the expenses of the consolidated societies will be far less than the present expenses of the administrations of the separate societies, at the same time the consolidation will improve the stability of the societies and will arouse the desire of small organizations to join the consolidation. Only on a large scale can various forms of insurance, existing in American organizations, be arranged.</p>
   <p>At the same time, with a large number of members the basis of aid to needy members can be worked out not in the form of kindness but in the form of work whereby they can earn a livelihood. The consolidation of ROOVA and RIMAS into one fraternal family will broaden the sphere of activity of the societies: the care of orphans will become the care also of all our members in general. The resolution was placed to a vote and was accepted unanimously with the exception of seven who withheld their votes.</p>
   <p>Whereupon the chairman of the assembly announced an intermission for dinner promptly at 4:20 P. M.</p>
   <p>(50) Report of the School Business.</p>
   <p>After the dinner intermission Chairman of the Assembly, A. Tichanovich, began with the school report. He moved that the assembly give more attention to the school business. The assembly listened to the instructions pertaining to the organization of schools drawn up by the school committee. The assembly approved the instructions of the school committee, unanimously without remarks. Only four withheld their votes and these expressed their opinion that the society take the school work upon itself.</p>
   <p>Legal Counsellor's Speech.</p>
   <p>A. Pikiel, legal counsellor of RIMAS, asked for permission to speak. Addressing the assembly, he announced that when RIMAS will unite with ROOVA, then other Russian societies will join the consolidation. He also proposed that the members of RIMAS work to expand and strengthen their organization, create athletic circles for youth, pay no attention to the agitation of the enemies of RIMAS, the Bolsheviks.</p>
   
   <p>He also announced that the Bolsheviks are canvassing the Independents from house to house and suggest that they transfer to RNOV, promising them various privileges. In reality they are striving to deceive naive and trustful people.</p>
   <p>(51) Central Sick Benefit.</p>
   <p>In discussing the question of a central sick benefit fund of the society, the opinions of delegates divided: some were in favor of a central sick benefit fund, others opposed and expressed (the opinion) that the fund be safe kept as before, that is, in the branches. M. Horozanko moved that this question be passed to the Board of Directors and the Board should inquire of each branch of the society and then settle the matter definitely, before the next assembly. This proposal was approved by</p>
   
   <p>a majority of the delegates without objection.</p>
   <p>(52) The Payments for Injury and Insurance for Death by Accident.</p>
   <p>The matter of payments for injury and insurance for death caused by accident was little discussed by the delegates, and it was left open and entrusted to the Board of Directors that it may work out the questions in detail in accordance with the state laws.</p>
   <p>(53) Twenty-Year Life Endowment Insurance Policies.</p>
   <p>The question of 20-year Life Endowment Insurance interested many, especially the women delegates. Many opined that the younger generation does not wish to join the society because the society does not offer them more desirable insurance and they do not want to pay all their lifetime. It is more acceptable to them to pay only twenty years and remain insured thereafter and not paying any more premiums. Thereupon W. Sabinsky moved that this question be referred to the Board of Directors. The motion was seconded by Xenia Zhogalsky and approved by the sign of raised hands of all delegates.</p>
   <p>(54) Expansion of the News of the Society.</p>
   <p>The next matter in the order of the business of the assembly was that of expanding the column of the News of the society published in the newspaper Rassviet. The editing committee proposed that a full page in Rassviet be rented. Some members disapproved of the rental of a full page, claiming that the committee will not be able to fill it with material weekly. The matter was voted upon with the result that by a majority vote of 30 to 2 it was decided: the matter of expanding the column in Rassviet is referred to the discretion of the Board of Directors of the society. It is advised that a full page be rented only in the event that there will be sufficient material to occupy the space, but when material runs short only half page be rented.</p>
   <p>(55) Administrative Board.</p>
   <p>The Supreme Secretary of the society, N. Kozak, recommended that instead of $1 each year, 10 cents monthly be paid by each members for the administrative fund. Others favored to let the matter stand as of old. After some discussion it was unanimously resolved that: those who wish can pay $1 at once during the first month; those who are unable may pay 10 cents each month for the first 10 months.</p>
   <p>(56) Permanent Office and Library.</p>
   <p>The matter of a permanent office and library in the office was removed from the order of the business of the assembly until conditions in the country generally improve.</p>
   <p>(57) Collection of Children's Monthly Dues.</p>
   <p>Secretary of the society Kozak explained to the delegates that it is not obligatory to have agents at the children's branches, that dues may be collected by the secretary of each branch, thereby it will be easier to develop the children's branches and collect monthly dues regularly together with the collection for adults.</p>
   <p>Secretary of Branch 1, A. Haponovich, objected and demanded that the agents be left in power as before, as the work will be too heavy for the secretaries of the branches.</p>
   <p>After these discussions, the assembly resolved unanimously to leave the matter to the discretion of the branches.</p>
   <p>(58) Appeal of the Parish for Exemption on Interest Payment.</p>
   <p>Delegate from St. George's Brotherhood, J. Zholnerchik appealed to the delegates on behalf of the parish that the assembly grant the Board of Directors of the society permission to not collect from the parish interest due on a $3,500 first mortgage on the parish property, and the parish will not collect rent for the office of the society and the use of the home for administration meetings. The delegates, having heard this appeal, by a majority vote resolved that the Board of Directors handle the matter with its discretion and also the whole administration.</p>
   <p>(59) Chairman of the assembly, A. Tichanovich, inquired of the delegates whether or not there was any other business, inasmuch as the business in the order of the assembly was all transacted. V. Zamkovetz moved that the report of the treasury of the society be printed and distributed to all participants to the assembly before the next assembly. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
   <p>There being no further business to transact, chairman Tichanovich thanked the delegates for their fine attention and proposed to the delegates to rise and in silence honor the memory of the nine deceased members of the society, the names of whom were read by the chairman. After a minute's pause the chairman requested that the delegates designate the time and place of the next, the 22nd Supreme Assembly.</p>
   <p>Dr. P. Chadovich made a motion that the question be referred to the Board of Directors of the society. The motion was seconded and unanimously carried.</p>
   <p>At the last moment, J. Dziako addressed the chairman of the assembly, A. Tichanovich, and requested whether or not the assembly would object if he publishes his complete report of the 6th Convention of ROOVA in the newspaper, inasmuch as he was unable to do this before the delegates. Such an announcement was a complete surprise to not only the chairman but all the delegates. All the delegates were confused and perplexed. Chairman Tichanovich appealed to the delegates as to what any might wish to say on the matter. However, the delegates almost unanimously announced that the matter was Dziako's personal affair and the assembly holds nothing against such a move, on the contrary, it believes that it will be desirable if he publishes his report in the newspaper.</p>
   <p>Whereupon the assembly declared the meeting adjourned at 10 P. M., Sunday, May 29, 1932.</p>
   <p>A. Tichanovich, Chairman of the Assembly</p>
   <p>James Sleznik, Secretary of the Assembly.</p>
