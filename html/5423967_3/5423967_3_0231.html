   <p>Since the October Revolution in Russia schooling has developed to a great extent in the culturally poor Russian workers colony in America. All these years the vanguard among other cities in the number of schools as well as the carefully planned organization of these schools was and is the city of Chicago, where Russian workers' schools have begun opening since 1918, and where the uniting central organization, the Federation of Russian Children's Schools of Chicago and suburbs, from August of last year has begun the fourteenth year of its existence.</p>
   <p>For a period of years there was a fierce struggle in the Federation of Russian Children's Schools. Before 1917 in the various cities where Russian workers have settled, there sprang up church brotherhoods, churches. At times at the churches schools were opened, of course, not for the sake of enlightening the working masses. In Chicago a church school of this type was opened in 1915 or 1916. This was the school of the Russian Independent Society, a school for children of the workers and with tendencies of a worker's school but which, to our greatest regret, never could free itself from the tutelage of the priests.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1918 a group of Independents organized a South Side school in which the main subject was the study of the Bible, and although this school was opened by a priest, Zheltonoga, it was destined to become the first workers' "priestless" school in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Immediately after this, similar workers' schools were organized in other parts of the city, - in the Douglas Park district in 1919, in the Brighton Park district in 1920. Within this same year another workers' school opened at the section of the Technical Aid Society for Soviet Russia, in Gary, Ind., and in 1921 children's classes (opened) at a section of the Technical Aid Society for Soviet Russia, in Chicago, and a school in Rockdale.</p>
   <p>All these schools were organized by the workers, who united in school societies of the various school districts.</p>
   <p>But the organizers of these schools in most cases have lacked personal experience in schooling. As a result of this the schools were conducted as it could be expected of people lacking an elementary education; there were no means, no experienced teachers; there was no definite educational program and mainly there was no center which could coordinate their common work and direct it into the proper channels.</p>
   
   <p>For the school year of 1920-21 through the initiative of the South Side School, there was formed for the first time a "united committee" composed of representatives of three Chicago schools to take up the most important current questions.</p>
   <p>This committee, which later met periodically, was the first step towards the unity of all workers' children's schools, but the actual unity was still to be created.</p>
   <p>Three of the Chicago schools took up this question in the beginning of 1922.</p>
   <p>It was decided to call a special school conference.</p>
   <p>On July 24th the writer of this article, in the name of an organized "Teachers' Commission," published in the press a call to the forthcoming conference, together with a platform and order of the day worked out by the commission.</p>
