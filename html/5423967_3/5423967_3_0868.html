   <p>The writer of this article discusses the question whether the Mutual Aid societies, which are professedly non-political, should include into their educational programs lectures and discussions on the social sciences. There are those who believe that the introduction of such subjects would inevitably lead to the discussion of political questions, and this, instead of uniting people of various political views on the basis of purely economic and cultural pursuits, would tend to produce dissensions and thus weaken the society. And it is obvious that such a society can efficiently organize relief for those who are in need of it only if it has a large membership. The writer of the article does not quite agree with such a standpoint. He says that a <span class="page-break">\2</span>clear distinction should be made between an unfair, partisan presentation of social questions and a really scientific study of these problems which demands that they should be considered from various standpoints, as almost every particular standpoint has in it some truth, and among the members of every party there are men who sincerely want to do that which is conducive to the welfare of the people.</p>
   <p>We are told that when classes and lectures are arranged on such subjects as mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc., this cannot lead to any dissensions, as the facts and laws of such sciences are well established, and nobody would try to dispute them. But when it comes to history we meet difficulties because historical facts can be interpreted in a totally different way by persons holding antagonistic political views. This applies in a still greater degree to the teaching of social and political sciences.</p>
   <p>There is some truth in this. It cannot be denied that the discussion <span class="page-break">\3</span>of such questions often arouses the passions and creates enmity between those who participate in such discussions. But, says Mr. Oberuchev, this need not be so. It happens only because those who undertake to explain or discuss such questions are intolerant, fanatical, and do not understand thoroughly either the teachings which they defend, or those that they oppose. Therefore lectures on social questions should be given only by such persons who are real students, who are broad-minded and are actuated only by the desire to elucidate the truth, and not to defend at all costs some sectarian standpoint. In other words, such lectures should be really scientific, and not given for purposes of partisan propaganda or agitation. Under such conditions these lectures would help those who attend them to consider the social questions in a more impartial way and thus help to draw nearer to each other those who previously thought that they could be only irreconcilable enemies. Instead of producing dissensions and quarrels, such lectures would on the contrary, create greater unity and inculcate a tolerant attitude without which no successful social activity is possible.</p>
