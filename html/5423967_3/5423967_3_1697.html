   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>(8) In the order of the business of the Supreme Assembly was the report of the School Committee.</p>
   <p>A. Haponovich, member of this committee, reported that the best school is the Kryloff School, because the school is active, and he also recommended that the society not discontinue the work of opening new schools which will bring great benefits to the growing generation as well as to the society.</p>
   <p>(9) Next in the order of the business was the reports from the branches. It was disclosed from the speeches that due to unemployment, many members are unable to pay their membership dues on time which must be covered by funds of the branches.

   <p>(15) Next, the question of appointing an organization committee in each branch.
