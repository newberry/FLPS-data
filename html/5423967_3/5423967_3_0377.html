   <p>Notice about an extraordinary meeting of the Executive Board of the Russian Center of the city of Chicago, at the Y. M. C. A., 1621 W. Division St., to be held on September 12, 1926.</p>
   <p>(Note: Could not find out anything very certain about the character and activities of this organization. As far as I know it is extinct. It seems to have been an attempt to organize non-partisan Russians in order to improve their educational and cultural standard and to interest them in American politics. D. S. )</p>
