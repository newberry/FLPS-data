   <p>Will our readers excuse us for taking up once more the old subject of insurance? On our [R.I.M.A.S] page we have repeatedly presented proofs of the advantages enjoyed by holders of the new policies introduced by R.I.M.A.S for the benefit of its members. We think that all members of the Society deep in their hearts are aware of the special benefits accruing to them from this innovation, and yet, unfortunately, not all so far have taken out new policies and discarded their old ones. The Russian people are by nature a slow-thinking people; by very small steps and very slowly they approach any decision, and still more slowly and without any hurry they carry their decisions into effect. We think that therein lies the cause of so piecemeal and slow a change to the new policies among our members. Most of them think that "there is no hurry; there is still plenty of time to do it".</p>
   
   <p>There is a great error in such thinking. There lies the principal cause of the lack of success in the lives of many Russians. Life throughout the entire world is moving in an accelerated tempo. In America particularly every one runs and is in a hurry, and yet the Russian colony is a sluggish one; it hates to give up its habits, and therefore it evitably lags behind.</p>
   <p>In speaking of the new policies it is impossible, of course, to lose sight of the fact that on the basis of the provisions in the old policies the man unable to meet his payments for two or three months is automatically dropped from the Society and is denied any benefits, even though he may have been a member of the organization for twenty years or more. On the basis of clauses contained in the new policies the interests of every individual member are protected incomparably better. By the rules of the new policies if a member discontinues payments altogether, he is entitled to receive part of the benefits provided he has been a member of the organization for three years or longer.</p>
   <p>Every old member of the Independent Society must give serious thought to this matter, for unforeseen need may arise, or sudden sickness may occur, and on the basis of the new policies any member in case of extreme necessity may borrow from the sum that he has paid in without paying any interest and without begging for the favor.</p>
   <p>Therefore, having in view only the protection of the interests of the old members of the Society to the fullest possible extent, we once more remind our old brothers that for the sake of their own interests they should be in a hurry to change their old form of insurance policy to the new one. Chairmen and secretaries of the individual branches should advise their members of the advantages offered by the new policies and strive to persuade them to make the exchange for the new form of insurance as soon as possible.</p>
