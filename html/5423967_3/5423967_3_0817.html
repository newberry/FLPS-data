   <p>The first forum of this season, arranged by Moskva, a monthly review, was held on Saturday, January 11. The subject discussed was: Shall We Return to Our Native Country? The audience listened with rapt attention. Besides the persons announced on the program several workmen among the audience also participated in the discussion.</p>
   <p>Dr. Pertsov, who as usual was late, tried to explain in his introductory speech the reason for the choice of subject.</p>
   <p>"America," said the doctor, "is a wonderful country; nevertheless we feel attracted to our native land, the land where our fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers made their abode. There are many reasons for this. One of the chief reasons is that it is impossible for us to become firmly rooted in America. The whole tenor of life in this country, its tempo, all the surroundings, do not allow us to feel at home here. We cannot breathe freely in this atmosphere. When we sleep, we dream of our fatherland. And it seems to me that the Russian intellectualls feel the burden of life in a foreign country more intensely than those less well educated. You have to consider that you, the old immigrants, came to the United States from the small villages of the western provinces of Russia. You had not seen the largest centers of Russian culture. Through no fault of your own, of course, you were unable to partake of the intoxicating, enchanting, powerful, sweet content of the cup of Russian culture. In spite of that you yearn to see your old homes again. How could we help feeling the same yearning, we who have partaken of the sweet, intoxicating wine of the spiritual riches of our native land and are unable to renounce it? Many of us have achieved here a degree of material welfare by no means insignificant. Yet even such Russians do not feel at home in this country. For them also their home is across the ocean....</p>
   <p>"We want to go home because only there, in our native land, can we do any creative work. We should be able to continue there the great work of enriching Russian culture, contributing thereby to the welfare of our fatherland.</p>
   <p>"But this is not the chief reason why we decided to raise right now the question of the return to Russia. We believe that the foundation on which Russia is built, the very groundwork of that country's prosperity and strength, is the Russian peasantry. And when this peasantry is forced to adopt a collectivist regime--when in the thirteenth year after the revolution a series of most embarassing obstacles has been created, interfering with the normal development of peasant farming--we mean such measures as the forcing of peasants to join various collective farms and agricultural communes--when all this is being done, it is obvious to us what the results of such a policy will be. Soon it will be possible for us to return to our native land.</p>
   <p>"Up to the present time not one of the projected Utopias has been realized.</p>
   
   <p>And the experiments with Russian peasants made by the Communists will also prove to be a failure. The more intelligent elements of the Communist party have understood this for a long time. But just as it was in old times, so it is now; nobody in Russia, not even a high official, is allowed to have any opinions of his own.</p>
   <p>"And the experiment of socializing peasant farming is conducted in Russia by men who are perfectly well aware of the fact that this experiment is doomed to failure. What do the experimenters, for whom Russia is only a laboratory, care for the fact that this laboratory is the habitation not of guinea pigs, but of live peasants? Their business is not with Russia. Russia is just a detail. What they are aiming at is a world revolution for which the Russian revolution is merely to serve as an example to all nations. And the severely stricken country squirms under the lash of pain. The Russian peasantry groans, a peasantry anarchistic by its nature and not inclined to tolerate any domination, be it that of the Czar or that of the Soviets. The peasants are deprived of the most potent stimulus which incited them to creative activity and progress. The Communists endeavor to destroy the instinct of acquisitiveness, deeply rooted in the nature of every peasant. But is it possible to uproot in five years, and that not from the nature of an animal but from that of a rational being, a man, an instinct which was developed thousands of years ago? It can never be done.</p>
   <p>"And this is why we shall be able to return to our native land very soon. Eighty-five per cent of the present Russian population is incapable of being forced to join the collective farms. Hence the hateful forms will vanish, and a healthy farming industry will be reborn and effect the rebirth of the whole country, and at the same time sound principles of statesmanship will take the place of violence, despite oppression. And then we shall return to our native land."</p>
   <p>The next speaker, N. S. Gribov, then brought to the memory of the audience the year 1917, when Kerensky's government held sway.</p>
   <p>"After the October revolution," said Mr. Cribov, "the more radical elements thought that every Russian immigrant would return to Russia. They were even expecting that Lenin would send a special steamer to bring them all home. But they were disappointed in their expectations, though many persons sailed for Russia independently. When they arrived there, they were robbed of all their belongings. Many have gone even lately who still believe that when they reach Russia, they will find it to be a land flowing with milk and honey. But during the last few years the stream of Russian immigrants returning to the fatherland has dried up. A multitude of letters and communications sent from Russia by those who had returned there have refuted the fairy tale about the Soviet Paradise, and those among us who wish to be stood up against a wall are getting scarcer and scarcer. However, the so-called Communists among us still seem to believe in all these nursery tales about the Soviet Paradise; I happen to know personally ten Communists who left for the Bolshevik Paradise, but they have almost all fled from it (if necessary, I can reveal their names). One of them lives in Poland now, under the Pilsudski regime; eight have returned to capitalistic America, and one vanished without leaving any trace in Soviet Russia (probably having been shot by the Cheka). Not less than ninety per cent of the Communists who have left America for the U.S.S.R. have fled thence and have returned to this country. But they do not tell us what they have seen there. They still want the minds of Russian immigrants to be amazed by the Bolshevist bluff. For example, there is here a certain Communist by the name of Zhuk who has returned from Russia, but when he sees me, he crosses to the other side of the street, since he does not want to meet me. If you happen, nevertheless, to get hold of some such Communist, giving him no chance to escape from you, he replies to your questions:</p>
   <p>'We have returned to bourgeois America in order to work for revolution.'</p>
   <p>"And this in the face of the apathy which reigns at present in the ranks of the Communists! If you inquire further about this revolutionary work which they are doing, wishing to know what kind of work it is, you will find out that one of the Communists is working in a restaurant as a cook, another as a waiter, a third has opened a grocery store, and so on. This is effective revolutionary work! And for the sake of such achievements they have shed rivers of blood.</p>
   <p>"In the labor unions you do not meet workers of this type. They do not go there. As you all know, the American Federation of Labor is not a revolutionary organization, but anyhow, it defends the interests of workmen."</p>
   <p>Here the speaker brought in many facts illustrating the inner life of the labor unions.</p>
   <p>"You do not find any Communists in them. It is quite true that sometimes Communists come to some union meeting, get noisy, and raise a hell of a row. This is the kind of revolutionist that they are! They did not want to stay in a beggared country, and they quickly returned to America.</p>
   <p>"And such people want to misrepresent the truth about Russia! They want to throw dust in our eyes by spreading false reports, telling us that in Russia the peasants are better off than any other class of the population; that Russia is the peasant's paradise. But we know that this is far from the truth, and this gives us the right to believe that soon we shall return to our native country, where the peasantry, that backbone of Russia, will come into its own."</p>
   <p>After Mr. Gribov the third speaker, Mr. E. Z. Moravsky, took the floor. We shall quote only excerpts from his speech, since he spoke for almost an hour, provoking some fierce attacks on the part of Mr. Gominuk, a representative of the Communist party who happened to be present.</p>
   <p>"Dr. Pertsov made a splendid report on Russia, reviewing all the facts pertaining to the subject of our debate in an impartial way as befits a true defender of the Soviets. But he said very little about the possibility of returning to Russia. He was in the clouds, if I may say so. It is easy to say: 'I am leaving for Russia.' But can it be done? Dr. Pertsov is a dreamer. Many of you would also like to forget all about the cruel realities of life, thus deluding yourselves.</p>
   <p>"Before the war it was easy to travel from one country to another. But at present it is very difficult to set out on the way; you have to get passports and visas and to pay taxes. I tried to leave Russia in 1921 but found that it was impossible. Ultimately I succeeded in getting a visa from the Italian consul. At that time there was no direct communication with Italy via the Black Sea, and I had to apply for a transit visa to the Germans; but they refused to help me out, and I was forced to remain in Russia. Yet now as before Americans get visas quite easily. They are considered desirable guests everywhere, for even those who do not like the Americans themselves like the American dollars. But for one who belongs to the so-called "Constantinopoltsy" [White Russians, as those who fled from the revolution to Constantinople are often called] it is impossible to return to Russia. I am quite ready to believe Dr. Pertsov when he says that he desires to return. But they won't let him in. As to trying to get in by some illegal means, it is very risky, and I do not believe that Dr. Pertsov will take that risk. I left Russia of my own accord. I am not a refugee nor a White Guard. I am a voluntary emigrant. It should seem, therefore, that I ought to have the right to return to Russia whenever I wish to do so. But two years ago I made private inquiry and learned that I had forfeited my Soviet citizenship, and that Soviet authorities would in no wise allow me to be repatriated.</p>
   <p>Every one of us yearns to return to Russia, and I want to go there no less than you do. If I could return, I would even agree to suffer there, to go hungry, to eat all kinds of rubbish, such as even pigs would not eat here in America. I would even submit to things worse than that because I would not trade Russia for any other country, since I cannot endure spiritual hunger.</p>
   
   <p>"Dr. Pertsov is perfectly right when he says that it is much more difficult for intellectuals to get used to life in a foreign country than for one of the older Russian immigrants. But the uneducated Russian also yearns to return to his native land; for he also intensely loves Russia. This love of one's country is very similar to the love of one's mother.</p>
   <p>"We love even a bad mother, just because she is our mother. Ask a child about it, and it will not be able to tell you why it loves its mother so dearly. There is no mother like his. It is a mysterious, unfathomable love. Or take the case of a man who has fallen in love with a girl. He worships her, she is his ideal. It is this same kind of mysterious, unfathomable love that we harbor in our hearts for our native land. Maybe this native country has proved to be a stepmother rather than a real mother; nevertheless our love remains undiminished.</p>
   <p>"If conditions were different, many of us would already have returned to Russia.</p>
   
   <p>Under different political conditions I would not have remained here one day longer. All other immigrants are better off than we Russians; whenever they want to do so, they can declare that they are tired of living in this country, and that they want to be repatriated, whereas we Russians have lost our citizenship and our fatherland. Even I, who left my native country voluntarily, cannot return there. It is difficult to understand how this came about. There is no precedent for it in history...(Let French Revolution serve as an example; at that time the emigrants were treated much more humanely.) They do not want us in our native land; they consider us as foreigners. Many did not return to Russia because they were afraid of the Red terror; even some of those who were already registered in the Soviet consulates did not go. This is a most complicated and tragic problem. If it were as easy to return to Russia as Dr. Pertsov believes, thousands of us would rush there immediately. The fathers, mothers, wives, and children of many of us are there, but we cannot leave the United States. The doors of our native land have been closed upon us by the Soviet government.</p>
   
   <p>The question which we are discussing may be answered as follows: We will not return to Russia while it is ruled by its present government, which will not grant us admittance. But sooner or later that government will be overthrown. Many Bolsheviks maintain that the present regime has become stronger, that the country is progressing, and that all difficulties will be settled in the future; but this is just a boast. The present government of the U.S.S.R. is based on the G.P.U., (secret police), just as the Czar's government was founded on his corps of gendarmes. Yet the Czar's government did not treat its victims so badly as the government of the worker and the peasant does.</p>
   <p>The former government did not suppress freedom of thought so relentlessly as this is done by the Soviet authorities. The conclusion which we draw from all this is that the more crushing the oppression, the stronger the discontent. And only when the oppression ceases shall we return to Russia. At present none of us desire to go there because we know only too well what sort of life they really live in Russia. Gzilov, who spoke here a while ago, was right when he said that while the Bolsheviks praise their "Paradise", they do not want to stay in it...The U.S.S.R. can be compared to some arbitrarily ruled medieval principality or to an oriental despotic state. The present regime in Russia is not very much different from the regime which flourished there when serfdom was still in existence. And even if the Bolsheviks did allow us to enter Russia, it would be dangerous to go there."</p>
   <p>Moravsky recounted his wanderings and tribulations in Soviet Russia. He spoke of the absence of spiritual food.</p>
   <p>"There was no material bread to be had in Soviet Russia, but this did not trouble me so much as the fact that no spiritual food at all could be found there."</p>
   <p>Moravsky also spoke about the position of the press here and in the U.S.S.R.</p>
   
   <p>The sane lack of freedom which crushes the daily press is conspicuous also in the case of so-called "harmful books" and of publishing activities in general. In conclusion Mr. Moravsky spoke of the absolute spiritual famine reigning in the U.S.S.R.</p>
   <p>"You cannot speak, because if you do, you will be accused of being a counterrevolutionist; if your ideas happen to be at all dangerous, you are quite likely to be shot. In 1917 it was very easy to leave Russia (by crossing the Finnish frontier). I was ready to do so. I had already received the necessary documents. But I was reluctant to leave my native country and decided to stay there. And I remained there from the year 1917 to the year 1923, so that I am perfectly well acquainted with all the beauties of life under the rule of the Soviet authorities. I began to feel there like one who is strangling. The civil war, which was always referred to in order to find some apology for the horrors of the Soviet regime, had already come to an end a long time ago; nevertheless the executions were just as frequent as before. The Cheka (secret police) reigns supreme, nor has freedom of speech or freedom of the press been restored.</p>
   <p>"In spite of that the corrupt press extols the unshakable firmness of modern Russian absolutism. All this only bears witness to the weakness of the Soviet government. If it were really unshakable, it would not need the executions and the Cheka.</p>
   <p>"Thus the question of returning to Russia must be shelved. It is a matter of the distant future. We ourselves would not return to Russia even if we were permitted to do so. Going there would be just like stepping into a mousetrap. Even if you are an American citizen, it is no guarantee that the G.P.U. will not have you stood against a wall and shot. In my opinion it is still premature to raise the question of returning to Russia."</p>
   
   <p>After Mr. Moravsky, Mr. Tarasenko, one of the audience, obtained the floor. He voiced some objections to what had been said by Mr. Moravsky. He believed that if one acted as recommended by Mr. Moravsky, the Soviet government would remain in power forever.</p>
   <p>"No," said Mr. Tarasenko,"we should go to Russia and fight the Bolshevict regime, as is done now, for example, by the students in the northern part of the Caucasus." He also found that Dr. Pertsov's opinion that Russian peasants are anarchists by nature is rather a strange one.</p>
   <p>After this speaker Mr. V. D. Maslov took the floor. He declared that he was not going to defend any one; that a change of regime in Russia is approaching, which is necessary. We all use here the expression "the Russian people," but every one of us has his own idea about this people. Mr. Maslov understands also why an intellectual yearns more than any one else to return to his native land.</p>
   
   <p>"It is," said Maslov, "because apart from all the talk about culture the intellectual has also lost there his material possessions."</p>
   <p>He also disagreed with the assertion that the plain, uneducated man loves his native country less than the intellectual. As an example be pointed to the Russian war prisoners in Germany, who were portrayed in the well-known book written by E. Remarque.</p>
   <p>The next speaker from the audience was Mr. Selivonchik. This speaker divided the Russian colony into two camps: the camp of the workers and the camp of the intellectuals. These of course have no common language, so that they do not understand each other. In Russia, under the old regime, none of the workers could receive any college education; hence members of these two camps have quite different ideas about things. The speaker asserted that the Russian worker who emigrates to America soon forgets not only Russia but even his own relatives who suffer there.</p>
   
   <p>"We workmen," said he "remain here the same ignoramuses which we were; we do not yearn to return to Russia; we have forgotten our native land because we did not possess any adequate knowledge of it when we came to America some twenty years ago. The intellectuals, on the other hand, yearn to return and to recover their property. Well, let them go; we ourselves feel comfortable enough in America."</p>
   <p>After Senkevich and Zatsa had made a few remarks, the Communist Gominuk made a fiery speech, addressing both the debaters and the audience. This speaker protested first of all against the very word "fatherland".</p>
   <p>"This is an old superstition, said Gominuk; "where the worker dwells, there is his fatherland. Why are you all shedding tears here because of your native land? Why are you complaining that the Soviet authorities do not allow you to return to Russia? Why do you not fight capitalism here, in America?</p>
   
   <p>Moravsky said that he was dissatisfied with the government of the U.S.S.R. But what kind of government does he want to take the place of the Soviet government if the latter falls? What system could be substituted for the Soviet system now prevailing in Russia? All the capitalistic countries take part in this campaign against the Soviet regime, and you walk hand in hand with them. But all your attacks mean nothing."</p>
   <p>The speaker would have continued in this vein, but his time was up and it was getting late. After Moravsky had answered all his opponents, the chairman, Dr. Pertsov, made a concluding speech, explaining the usefulness of forums and emphasizing the necessity of arranging for them more frequently.</p>
