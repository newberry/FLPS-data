   <p>Why do Independents oust Bolsheviks from their conventions? Just because Bolsheviks have already done a great deal of harm to the Independent Society; and this has been done only because members of our society have been too tolerant toward Stalin's followers, permitting them to be present at the Society's conventions, and listening to their lying speeches.</p>
   <p>We do not have to go very far to prove this. For instance, at the 1930 convention new forms of insurance were not adopted because Mr. Kazuschik, a Bolshevik fraternal delegate, cautioned our delegates against any kind of innovation. At that time he recommended to us payment of dues in conformity with the N.F.C. table. This table, however, is advantageous only to well-to-do members. The poor people, on the basis of this table, are deprived of fraternal aid as soon as they are unable to pay their dues.</p>
   
   <p>Now the Independent Society has decided to replace the N.F.C. table with the A.E. table, which affords certain advantages to the poorer members of the Society.</p>
   <p>Of course, as a result of this change, the introduction of new forms of insurance cost the Independent Society a good deal of money and still more of effort on the part of the Board of Directors. The duplicity of Mr. Kazuschik consisted in the fact that in May, at the convention of the Independent Society, he advised our delegates not to adopt the new forms of insurance and attacked the A.E. table; and yet, in September of the same year, at his insistence, his own convention adopted the new table. It means that he deliberately misled our organization concerning the N.F.C. table, and thereby caused harm to our Society.</p>
   <p>The following reveals a second example of his treachery. Recently a member of the Independent Society died. The deceased had assigned payment of his death benefit to a friend, whom he named as a relative. R.I.M.A.S. paid the benefits;</p>
   
   <p>and then, quite unexpectedly, the Society's attorney received a summons to appear in court. A Chicago attorney by the name of Zimmerman had found a brother of the dead member in the U.S.S.R., and in his name demanded second payment of the death benefit. Some time after this, the same attorney presented a second claim demanding that the money should be paid, not to the brother of the deceased man, but to his sister residing, also, in Russia. R.I.M.A.S. has had on its books for about fifteen years death-benefit money which the Society cannot pay out because it is unable to locate the beneficiaries; and now all people in the old country, as soon as they hear that one of their old neighbors has died in America, begin to sue the Society.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the employment of such attorneys is clear to every man. The Bolshevik central figures in Chicago closely follow every move that R.I.M.A.S. makes. They hire attorneys at their own expense and drag the Society into court. The Bolsehviks know how expensive litigation in American courts is; and they hope that the more often they drag R.I.M.A.S. into court the sooner the funds (which are not as large as theirs) appropriated for the administrative expenses of the Society will run out. And thus, being left without such funds, the Society, as they hope, will be forced to discontinue all its organizational and cultural activity, and leave the field clear for the Bolshevik subversive activity.</p>
   <p>One could write whole pages citing instances in which the local Bolsheviks have taken advantage of every misunderstanding and every disagreement, no matter how insignificant, to sow discord among the members of the Independent Society in order to disrupt our ranks and stop the growth of our fraternal organization.</p>
   <p>Let us, then, form a united front of all Russians in a foreign land to carry on the fight against our common enemy. Let us rally around the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, around an organization formed of hard-working Russian people who strive to go forward to progress and enlightenment.</p>
   
   <p>Let every member of the Society and every honest Russian worker help the cause of building up his organization, and not wait in the hope that some one else will do the work for him. Let every one of us put his shoulder to the wheel and drag the load ever higher up the mountain of obstacles.</p>
   <p>Russian people of Chicago and vicinity, and their compatriots of Detroit, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities, should take up the task of upbuilding, of organizing new locals of the R.I.M.A.S., and of carrying on cultural work among its members.</p>
   <p>Every Russian man or woman can be a useful member of our organization. One may enlist a new member and persuade his friend to do the same. Another may send his or her son to one of the R.I.M.A.S. schools, or may pay dues for some poor orphan or destitute member. A third may join the fight against Bolshevik treachery. In a word, every man--either old or young, rich or poor, educated or illiterate, may help in building up our Society, help the cause of the Russian people finding themselves in a strange land, if he but has the will to help.</p>
   <p>And thus, dear brothers, Independents, let us all get busy and prove to our enemies that we still possess power and determination to work for the common good; that our Russian hearts are still beating in our breasts; and that we have not lost our Russian soul.</p>
   <p>A Member of the Independent Society.</p>
