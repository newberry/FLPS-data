   <p>The first issue of our magazine met with a very hearty reception: our readers from the most dull "Russian villages" in the United States, encourage us by their cordial letters in which they express their individual opinions of our beginning in the field of our cultural constructive work. We emphasize: these letters came to us first from our villages in the United States and Canada, precisely from there, where they expect good, peaceful, and plain words spoken for mutual understanding, for solving many puzzling problems and enigmas.</p>
   <p>We precisely expected this, that we would be first recognized by the provincial communities; which up to the present have been neglected by our colonial capitals.</p>
   <p>And really, all the more noticeable cultural work in the colony is carried on in America in our "Capitals": St. Petersburg (New York), Moscow (Chicago), Kiev (Philadelphia), Minsk (Detroit), Vilno (Pittsburgh), Vladivostok (San Francisco). In the provincial towns everthing sleeps <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>quietly, evenly, and peacefully.</p>
   <p>But our friends from the capitals also write to us, welcoming us with no less feeling. But differently, not as they talk about us in the provinces.</p>
   <p>To them everything is excellent. They are pleased with the fact that we answer very many questions; they are thankful to us for mentioning the enemy of slavery; for not forgetting the families, schoolboys; for giving interesting statistics; for introducing the readers to the masterpieces of literature, old and new; for loving poetry, not neglecting satire, talking of art and popularizing science.</p>
   <p>As a result of this acknowledgement, we must admit that we have not given our reader everything that we desire. We know what we are lacking; we know that our reader should have a monthly magazine-almanac of some sort, so that our publication would be both a friend and an adviser in every family and to every individual.</p>
   <p>Our readers from the capitals advise us in a friendly manner not to be <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>tempted with being too "elementary" i. e. to endeavor to make our magazine strictly scientific on scientific questions.</p>
   <p>Enlarging upon the thought expressed in the previous paragraph, we believe that, in addition to the strict scientific articles, we are obliged, especially, at the present time, to bring to light many scientific questions, also in popular "elementary" form.</p>
   <p>The same thing must be said about the other sections of our magazine as well, for example, about the section of fiction and poetry. With us, young V. Viacheslavsky compares with Valeriy Briusov, Ivan Savin with Fedor Sologub, Panteleymon Romanov with N. V. Gogol, Alexander Peregudov with Evgeniy Chirikov; but in this issue, we remind those who have forgotten (many have forgotten) of A. S. Pushkin, and V. A. Zhukovsky.</p>
   <p>In order that the broad mass read us, we must feed it spirtually with such "living bread" that everything growing spirtually, everything alive and living in the capitals or province, will find something in common with us.</p>
   <p>Unpleasant perplexity was aroused in us by some remarks concerning the new <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>orthography which we follow. Perplexity is the correct word. Because we think that the new orthography, improved by the Russian Academy of Sciences (already in 1912), should be used by every cultured person. In this very issue, in the section, "Vse" (all), we offer information relating to this question, which, to our belief, will explain our different points of view with some of our readers concerning the "legality" of the new orthography. Besides, we wish to point out, that we did not have any other desire in selecting this orthography.</p>
   <p>The letters that we received recently speak eloquently for themselves - that we really have the support of our readers.</p>
   <p>Beginning with this issue, our second year of publication, we are prepared to increase our endeavors to give to our readers the maximum of satisfaction. And for this it is worth while working.</p>
