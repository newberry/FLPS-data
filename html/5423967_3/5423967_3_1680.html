   <p>[Note: In view of the fact that the initials of the Chicago R. I. M. A. S. (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) are identical with those of the Pittsburgh organization, the author of the following article recommends a slight alteration of the former initials of the Society, in order to avoid any confusion.</p>
   <p>The Editors of Novosti (News), a page devoted to the affairs of R. I. M. A. S. in the newspaper Rassviet, are in full agreement with the author in this respect.</p>
   <p>"The future of R. I. M. A. S. depends on the young generation;" this slogan has for many years stirred this society and the idea expressed in this short phrase is discussed in all its details in the leading circles of this organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>No matter how strongly the older members of the colony are attached to the organization, one cannot build plans for the future on the support of the old generation. The standard Industrial Mortality Table, shows that the death rate of the elderly members of the Society exceeds that of other ages and threatens to reduce the funds of the insurance organization. These funds no matter how large in comparison to the number of its members, are always subject to the risk of a downward plunge by unforeseen circumstances.</p>
   <p>According to the new by-laws of R. I. M. A. S. the insurance of the young people who are expected to become members of the R. I. M. A. S. Juvenile Department, is put on a sound basis. In comparison with the by-laws of other organizations the so called R. I. M. A. S. "Juvenile Department" (See chapter XII of the by-laws) assigns to the juvenile members, the most favorable terms, when they transfer them to the adult class. Certainly, the merely perfunctory recruiting of members to the Juvenile Department cannot give any favorable results. The juvenile members should be drawn to that kind of activity which is more or less <span class="page-break">\3</span>to their liking. This problem should be discussed by the leader of R. I. M. A. S. It is necessary to organize for the juveniles literary and dramatic circles, sporting clubs and teams, circles of lovers of nature, circles of amateurs of music and ballet dances, schools for children, courses for adults, circles for chess-players, circles for domestic craft industry, singing circles and choirs, etc.</p>
   <p>A network of such organizations, established around the main centre of R. I. M. A. S. as well as their branches, and also independently, will certainly attract the young generation to the ranks of R. I. M. A. S., and at the same time will enable them to be prepared for social activities, and will teach the youth to handle the rudder of which they sooner or later will assume the management. The future of R. I. M. A. S. depends only on the young generation. The parents, workers of R. I. M. A. S., must take all possible measures to have all the independent youths organized by R. I. M. A. S. From the success of the aforesaid work depends entirely the existence of this benevolent social organization, which the elderly-colonists for the last twenty years guard and set going.</p>
   <p>Enlist the youth; prepare for yourself worthy heirs. Anton Bernov.</p>
