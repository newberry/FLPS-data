   <p>(Compiled from a telegram that appeared on the first page of the November 15, 1927, number of Rassviet, and from an article by Mr. Rubezhanin in the next number of the same paper.)</p>
   <p>In the middle of November, 1927, the Princess Alexandra Petrona Kropotkin, daughter of the celebrated anarchist leader, Petr Alexeyevich Kropotkin, visited Chicago. Her father had given up his title and a military career and became a champion of the oppressed, a scientist, and one of the greatest theorists of anarchism. The daughter does not scorn the princely title. When speaking to reporters of the Chicago papers, who were interviewing her, she expressed astonishment at the existence in Chicago of numerous slums, which she had observed while driving through the city. These slums, she said, reminded her of some of the worst quarters of Moscow, where the Soviet government tries <span class="page-break">2</span>to get rid of such ugly conditions. Miss Kropotkin remarked that she was not an admirer of the Bolsheviki. "I do not uphold the Soviets," she said, "just as I did not favor the tsaristic regime; but I am a friend of the Russian people that will outlive the Soviets, just as it has outlived the tsaristic autocracy."</p>
   <p>On November 15th the Princess Kropotkin gave a lecture on Russia, which was attended by a large audience. The Hirsch Hall on Grand Avenue, which can hold over 3,000 people, was filled to overflowing.</p>
   <p>The lecturer was greeted by the audience with much applause. She has a weak voice that could not reach those who were seated and standing in the rear part of the hall. In the beginning she spoke about the contrast existing between the theory and the practice of revolution, the ideal and its realization. Then the lecturer expatiated about the immediate causes of the revolution - the weak-willed personality of <span class="page-break">3</span>Tsar Nicholas II; the sickly mysticism of the tsarina, which caused her to fall under the influence of the notorious Rasputin; the precarious state of the army at the front, caused by the lack of ammunition; the demoralization of the rear of the army, the result of graft and profiteering; the resulting general discontent among all classes of the population. All these facts and conditions, well known to every Russian, culminated in the murder of the nefarious Rasputin by Prince Yusupov.</p>
   <p>The views of Alexandra Petrovna Kropotkin on Bolshevism proved to be somewhat vacillating. She does not agree with the theories of the Bolsheviki. She thinks that the Marxian theories may be true under the conditions existing in industrial countries, but are not adapted to agricultural countries such as Russia. Yet, the lecturer finds that the Bolsheviki have achieved some good things. She said that their regime had aroused among the peasants interest for the activities of the government, - interest that did not exist before. The Russian <span class="page-break">4</span>peasant previously practically ignored the activities of the government, except in such cases when these activities made him feel very uncomfortable. All this has been changed now as though by magic, and the peasants at present show interest in the doings of the government, and they desire to use to the utmost the rights acquired by them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rubezhanin finds this estimate of the influence of the Soviet regime on the Russian peasants to be an error. His opinion is that the result of the Bolshevist activities in the rural districts of Russia was only to instill into the hearts of the peasants a hatred for all organized government, i. e., a purely negative interest in the governmental activities.</p>
   <p>The lecturer does not share her father's anarchistic views. She esteems <span class="page-break">5</span>democracy highly, and finds that the Soviet system of government would not be bad either, if the voting would be by secret ballot. She also thinks that the Bolsheviki have done some good in educating the people. Mr. Rubezhanin does not agree with this opinion of the lecturer, and says that she apparently does not know that even from the Moscow and Leningrad colleges, persons are being graduated who know very little about spelling. What can one expect under such circumstances from the teaching given in the Soviet elementary schools, especially in those of the rural districts? Mr. Rubezhanin also points out the contradiction existing between the "critical" attitude of the lecturer towards Bolshevism, and her pleading for the recognition of the Soviet government by the United States. He says that such a recognition of the Bolshevist regime, which is doing such a terrible harm to the population of Russia, would strengthen this regime and enable the Soviet government to get a loan from the United States. For this is the ultimate aim of the Soviet authorities in seeking recognition.</p>
