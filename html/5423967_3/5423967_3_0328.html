   <p>As was already mentioned in the previous issue of Rassviet, the school activity has been revived among the independents. Wherever the independents reside in small groups the talk of the day is concerned with only the schools.</p>
   <p>It is known that in certain districts, not only in Chicago and its suburbs, but also in the neighboring states, that the school question is seriously discussed among the local independents and every endeavor has been made to revive this activity by reopening those schools which were closed by organizing new ones in their places.</p>
   <p>As we have pointed out in the beginning of this article the school movement among the independents is revived. We want to emphasize by this, that it is not the first time that these people were interested in school affairs.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At other times, for various reasons, the independents were prevented from achieving their goal successfully.</p>
   <p>Many were the handicaps; one of them being the former name of the society, (Russian People's Orthodox Society), and various other misunderstandings bearing a private character. Surely, all these obstacles may be attributed to the constant ill wishes of the independents - the Bolsheviks with their "Federation of Schools."</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact that in some circles of the independents, that are not distinguished with great perseverance, the Bolsheviks have carried on successful agitation against the projected school union. It is no secret, of course, that the "Federation," which is inimical to the Independent Society, has been saved several times only because of the lack of understanding among the independents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>To date there exist independents who sit on two chairs, that is, with one hand they pay dues to the treasury of the R. I. M. A. S., and with the other, support the Bolshevik Federation. There were other hostile acts against the independents and their union of schools, attacks which had nothing in common with the welfare of the people and that of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   <p>But it seems that time heals all wounds: it has cured those ignorant independents who were falling off the branch on which they were sitting. Time has also removed many other obstacles which were laid on the path of the union of independent schools.</p>
   <p>The present revived school movement among the independents promises to be successful. And, undoubtedly, it will bear good results to the R. I. M. A. S., itself, and to the rest of the Russian immigrants if the independents, after the revival of the work in creating a set of schools connected with R. I. M. A. S., should have as motto: "to come to mutual compromises."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>On compromising one should not take into consideration some groundless complaints of individual members, (who often being childless, are not particularly interested in schools). One should rather be intent on guarding the interests of the R. I. M. A. S., in all that concerns school matters, and in endeavoring to organize at all costs in the present school year, a union of schools connected with the Independent Society.</p>
   <p>There exists a slight misunderstanding in regard to text-books, which concerns the additional expenses, connected with changing those newly annexed schools or families.</p>
   <p>This difficulty according to our opinion, could be easily solved. The organization, through the mediation of its school committee should pay all the expenses for the new text-books.</p>
   <p>There are different opinions concerning the educational qualifications of the teachers and their obvious Bolshevik tendencies. They must be careful in handling this question as changing teachers during the school year will, undoubtedly, hamper the progress of the schools. We even dare to state that it will kill them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>There exists a naive opinion that a good teacher should be a teacher of the Russian language as well as of singing, music and even dancing; in other words a teacher can be a "jack-of-all-trades."</p>
   <p>Such teachers do not exist in this world. Certainly each teacher in accordance with his individual abilities may to a certain extent be able to help the school by teaching something else beside his special subject, but to look for one able to do everything is useless.</p>
   <p>But all these questions will be solved in a natural way if the main object will be attained, and that main problem is already on its way to a final solution.</p>
   <p>All over, where the independents live more or less in groups, they have their own schools for children, or for adults, depending on circumstances.</p>
   <p>All schools, in which the majority of their members are independents, must sever their connection with the Federation of Schools and be incorporated with the School Union of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
