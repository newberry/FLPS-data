   <p>The Russian Society of Religious Dissenters has decided to accept new members without the payment of any initiation fee in the months of April and May. The Society has been in existence for the last sixteen years. It gives help to all its needy members. In case of sickness it pays six dollars a week for twelve weeks. In case of death it pays to the relatives $175. The monthly dues are only fifty cents.</p>
   <p>All those who desire to join the organization may do so at any of our meetings, which are held every last Sunday of the month in Chesny Hall, 4501 South Paulina Street.</p>
