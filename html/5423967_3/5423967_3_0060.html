   <p>"There have been in Chicago numerous but unsuccessful attempts to create a Russian press. In 1911 Mr. De Sheimo founded the paper Russkiye v Amerikye (Russians in America). For a short time there has been published the paper Molodaya Rus (Young Russia). The editor was Mr. A. Bakharev. This paper lasted about one year. The paper Narodny Golos (The voice of the people) lasted only a month and a half. It was edited by Mikhail Altshuler. Mr. Pokotilov and Mr. N. Nikolenko have also been active as publishers. The daily paper Svobodnaya Rossiya (Free Russia), edited by Mr. Nikolenko, is still in existence."</p>
