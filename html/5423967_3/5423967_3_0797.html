   <p>At the meeting of the Chicago Commerce Association, Prof. P. Haensel, well known Russian economist, gave a lecture on the Soviet five year plan. In his lecture Prof. Haensel said, that the Soviet government had created the five year plan with the purpose of establishing its industrial domination over the whole world, but the results were as follows: tremendous waste of money; poor quality production and terrible living conditions of the Russian workers.</p>
   <p>Prof. Haensel stated, that the idea of the five year plan was praiseworthy in general, but that the absence of efficient management and leadership, brought to naught all the advantages that could have been derived from this plan. As an example, a steel factory, recently built by the Soviet Government is situated 800 miles from the coal region. A Soviet automobile factory is expected to have a yearly production of 140,000 automobiles, to be completed by autumn; but the problem of supplying enough steel had not been solved. The Stalingrad tractor factory produced poor tractors.</p>
   <p>The quality of production is gradually becoming worse. This will appear quite natural, if we take into consideration the impossibility of finding the necessary number of skilled workers and efficient managers in such a short period of time.</p>
   <p>"If any progress was made it was chiefly due to the enthusiasm of workers, but nonetheless the exploitation of the workers in Russia is outrageous. All other classes are in a state of serfdom. "Piece-work is introduced wherever possible. The Soviet factories work 360 days a year, and employ three shifts a day. The wages are very low,--$1.60 a day on an average."</p>
   <p>Before arriving in the United States, Prof. P. Haensel occupied a chair in the Moscow University.</p>
