   <p>In The Novy Mir [Translator's note: Bolshevik newspaper published in Russian in New York] we read a notice written by Fedot Ageev, secretary of Branch No. 35 of R.P.M.A.S. He complains about the unwillingness of Russians in Chicago to join his organization. Despite strenuous efforts and a very modest quota assigned to Chicago Bolsheviks, the latter have not been able to achieve satisfactory results. What is the matter?</p>
   <p>The reason, perhaps, we shall seek in the fact that Deviatkin [Translator's note: One of the Bolshevik leaders] uses bad judgment and dips his hands too often in the pockets of Russians in Chicago. People are not willing to join a society which robs them too often.</p>
