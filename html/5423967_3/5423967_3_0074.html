   <p>Rassviet is the only Russian daily in America outside of New York, it is published by the Russian Publishing Company, Inc. at 1724 West Chicago Avenue. The present owners of Rassviet acquired the property in 1926 from the owner of Russki Vestnik. In 1917 the Mutual Aid Society a Russian organization began to publish in Chicago the Svobodnaia Rossya. This publication was bought by Mr. Casimir Gugis, a Russian attorney, several years later and edited under the name of Russkii Vestnik up till the middle of May 1926. Mr. Moravsky, who is the editor-in-chief of Rassviet, stated that the paper is non-communistic and non-partisan in scope. Rassviet is a liberal paper, marching with the trend of times and politically has remained the same since its foundation. Rassviet can be found on all newspaper stands in Chicago where Russian colony is concentrated, as well as in Detroit, Michigan. It is a cooperative organization with its six employees sharing in the profits. The building at 1724 West Chicago Avenue is rented but the machinery, the presses and other property is owned by the Russian Publishing Company. Rassviet does not make any distinction between the Orthodox Russian Church in Chicago or any <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>other Russian sect. The policy of Rassviet is non-partisan. It tries to serve to the best of its ability the community in general, particularly the Russian Americans living in Chicago. It is devoted to the interest of the Russian colony and its organizations. As a permanent institution it spreads culture and refinement among its nationals. In the years of 1931-1932-1933-1934 the Rassviet, as any other commercial undertaking, has suffered materially from the depression but according to Mr. Moravsky the years of 1935 and 1936 have brought remarkable improvement both in its circulation and advertising departments. According to a sworn statement, the average number of copies in the past six months, Rassviet sold and distributed through the mails and otherwise is close to the 20,000 mark.</p>
   <p>In conjunction with publishing and editing the Rassviet the Russian Publishing Company operates and maintains a book store and library, consisting of Russian classical literature as well as present day authors. A lover of Russian literature can always find to his heart's content a substantial volume of books in the Russian language and at prices which are in line with the ordinary pocket-book. It also maintains a translation department. Here Russian is being translated into English and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and English into Russian. The Rassviet also publishes books in the Russian language whenever the opportunity presents itself, although, the latter is very limited.</p>
