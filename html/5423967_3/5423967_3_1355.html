   <p>During Easter, during the great spring holiday, every member of the Russian colony recalls many things connected with his far-distant native land. He remembers vividly the wretched, yet very dear village lost somewhere in the wide spaces of the province of Grodno or Minsk, where he spent the best years of his life. These recollections bind us intimately not only with our kinfolk, but also with our neighbors and the friends of our childhood and adolescence. During these days our hearts grow tender; we become kinder and nobler men.</p>
   <p>Suddenly we recall that in the old country we lived on friendlier terms--we were more like brothers--although officially we were not united. That fraternal feeling revealed the better side of our natures and the nobler quality of the Slavic spirit. All of us: Russians, Poles, White Russians, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Ukrainians, sometimes quarrel among ourselves, but we cannot get along without one another, we always gravitate toward one another because we are children of the same Slavic family; we are all brothers and sooner or later we will unite.</p>
   <p>The best representatives of the Russian colony in Chicago, the more cultured members of our colony, have realized this for a long time. They have understood that our strength lies in our unity, in our love for one another, in mutual assistance. With this purpose in mind, twenty-four years ago, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, RNzOV, was founded. In our society every Slav can receive help and assistance in time of need; he may enroll and become a full-fledged member of the organization, and by communal effort, help to create the future history of the Slavic people.</p>
   <p>In our native land, in our own home, we were more secure, we had no care for the future, and, therefore, we were more kindly and friendlier toward one another. Here, in the country of the dollar, in an epoch of materialism, <span class="page-break">\3</span>we quite often forget that spiritual values, both of individuals and of people as a whole, are higher than material goods. The services rendered by the more active members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society to the Russian colony are great, and they consist mainly in that they remind the great mass of Russians of the truth of the above statement by their disinterested and self-sacrificing work for the sake of the Russian people in America. They serve as examples, to some people and are a reproach to others.</p>
   <p>RNzOV is fulfilling a sacred obligation, and we all should unite around this society. Here, in the country that is strange to us, we must especially remember that only by uniting along national lines will we gain strength, and only thus can we preserve our national identity and prevent our disappearance from the face of the earth. RNzOV is the only Russian organization which shuns politics and sets forth as its aim the unification of the Slavs on the basis of mutual aid, on the basis of developing cultural and national values. This society is an organization which strives to rear the Russian-American <span class="page-break">\4</span>youth in a spirit of respect for their elders and for the Russian people, and in the spirit of love of Russia.</p>
   <p>During these Easter days, with our thoughts turned toward our far-distant native land, we shall with brotherly love unite together under the banner of co-operation and mutual aid. "All for one and one for all." Remember the words of the song in the Easter service: "We shall embrace one another and unite, for Christ has arisen."</p>
