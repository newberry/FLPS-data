   <p>A very strange phenomenon has been observed resently in the life of the Russian colony. Chinamen, Negros, Mexican, Serbians, Bulgarians and other foreigners have begun to attend Russian lectures, especially those of an anti-Bolshevik character.</p>
   <p>What is the explanation of such a strange phenomenon? What force makes these people who do know Russian, attend Russian lectures?</p>
   <p>The explanation of such a phenomenon is very simple. These people come not through their own initiative but, are compelled, by other forces to do so. Some of them are professional "wreckers," others from the rank and file of the Communist party. Their main object in view in coming to these lectures, is not the study of the Russian language or of the problems of the Russian colony, but to cause disturbances and demonstrations.</p>
   
   <p>The American Communist party does not commission Russian communists to the Russian lectures for two reasons: first, there is only a very small number of Communist in the Russian American colony, it is therefore likely that they may not succeed to cause a disturbance; secondly it is dangerous to send Russian Communists to these lectures, because an anti-Bolshevik lecturer may be influential in charging their view points and cause them to join the ranks of the "counter-revolusionists." As the result, the American Communist party send foreigners who do not know the Russian language. Some of them, as we have said, are professional "wreckers" and hooligans, who are rewarded for their "work" and also others belonging to the rank and file of the Communist party.</p>
   <p>We do not have much pity, for the charlatans even if attending Russian lectures, results in broken noses and broken teeth for them, but we do pity the Communists, because they must come whether they wish it or not, if ordered by the leaders of the Communist party to participate in any demonstrations or any other methods of propoganda. Naturally these leaders themselves avoid their own appearance if they have reasons to believe that their participation would endanger them in any way.</p>
