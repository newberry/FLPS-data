   <p>To-morrow, Sunday, April 26, in the People's Auditorium, 917 North Wood Street, a concert and ball will be given by the children of the Krylov School. The entertainment has been arranged for the purpose of financially assisting this school of [Russian] dancing.</p>
   <p>We think that the readers of our "Page of News" are quite familiar with the role which the children of this school quite often are called upon to perform in our organization. It seems that there has never been an entertainment arranged by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society without the school-children's being invited to take an active part in the concert program. And the children have always gladly consented to do their bit on the stage or the dance floor. They sing, dance, and recite, always gratis, not only for our branches in Chicago but for those in the outlying towns as well. Whether the parents of the children have borne the expenses of travel and of costuming the young entertainers, or whether these expenses have been borne by the organizations, <span class="page-break">2</span>nothing has ever been said about it, and as a matter of fact all such expenses, quite often at the cost of sacrifice to families, have been borne by the parents of the children. We desire, therefore, that our members in the branches shall treat the children of the school for the benefit of which the concert has been arranged in the same way in which the children treat the branches of R.I.M.A.S. and other Russian organizations, and that these members may honor the children by their presence at the entertainment. We desire that our membership shall appraise at their true value the services and the self-sacrificing idealism of the members of the school board and the efforts of the children when they, in rain or shine, sometimes for many miles, go to do their social duty for the benefit of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>On the success of to-morrow's entertainment depend the future of the school and that of the dance classes, the future of our young dancers whose services are often used by the central administration of our Society and by the branches in Chicago and its vicinity. Many a time we have said, both in the press and at conventions, that if we do not prepare our young generation for the tasks <span class="page-break">3</span>which we now perform in the organization, our Society will be doomed to inevitable death. No matter how strong it is financially, it will not be able to continue, to grow, and to develop if the organization's ranks are not vitalized with young blood. Children are the joy and the hope of every class of society. Enlightened people well realize that the more a country spends on the education of the young, the more prosperous and the happier will be the entire population of that country. And this is indeed the truth. The United States serves as an excellent example. Here has been introduced a compulsory system of education up to the high-school grades. And precisely for this reason in technical and cultural development this country has gone far ahead of those countries of which the rulers have cared very little or not at all for their people's education. If we, fathers of our children and members of the Society also, neglect the education of our young, our Russian organizations will lag behind those of other nationalities, and they will become inert and debilitated.</p>
   <p>The school board of the Krylov School is willing to carry on the work of <span class="page-break">4</span>rearing Russian children in the Russian spirit. The members of this board carry on the school work in the interests of our organization as a whole, and, therefore it is the duty of every member of our Society to help them in every possible way. Tomorrow a large concert and ball will be given by the Krylov School, and we are convinced that all those members who love their organization will help the school workers and the school by attending the affair. This time the school presents an unusually varied and interesting concert program.</p>
   <p>Russian people of Chicago, Argo, Melrose Park, Maywood, Pullman, Kenosha, Gary, and other cities will have tomorrow an opportunity to hear very good singing and excellent [instrumental] music and to see beautiful young dancers in the performance of Russian, Ukrainian, and classical dances. There will be many other attractive features.</p>
