   <p>On Saturday, February 1, the Russian-American Citizens' Club arranged a lecture to be given by G. D. Grebenshchikov, a Russian writer. The subject was "The Russian Revolution and the Peasants".</p>
   <p>G. D. Grebenshchikov, being an artist in words and an eyewitness of all that happened during the course of the Russian revolution, ably presented the audience with a vivid and true picture of the social upheaval as it occurred in 1917. With bold, clear strokes he outlined events in Leningrad during that memorable year. He described the occurrences which led to the time when authority was weak, and things were in a state of confusion, when power was shifted from the hands of one political party to those of another.</p>
   <p>He told his listeners how peasants were inveigled into supporting the revolution by slogans that promised much, and how they were disappointed later on.</p>

   <p>The lecturer compared the attitude of the former government with that of the present regime toward political enemies, and he told the audience just what the workers and the peasants had gained through the revolution. He told what the elements are which make up the present ruling party and government in Russia, and what the result has been of the Bolshevik attempts to eradicate religion.</p>
   <p>In Mr. Grebenshchikov's opinion the October revolution was guided not by idealistic men but by low elements, by flotsam from the cities, by deserters from the military front, by criminals, and by Russians who had returned to their native land from abroad--people able to destroy but not to create or to build up. Of the same or of similar elements consists the present state machine of the United Soviet Republics.</p>
   <p>The lecturer pointed to the total absence of any kind of plan in the building of "the socialist state" in Russia, of the unprecedented exploitation of <span class="page-break">3</span>those who have to work for a living, of the new unheard-of form of slavery, and of the millions of victims who have lost their lives.</p>
   <p>Of course, after these facts had been revealed and these conditions had been described, there could be no question as to whether the Russian people are satisfied with the present form of government. The answer could be only a negative one, particularly with respect to the working people.</p>
   <p>Further on, the author and lecturer made a purely historical review of state, social, and individual life and compared pre-revolutionary conditions with those of to-day, the old times with the present, the old civilization with the new machine age, and he proved that the new civilization with its technical progress has not brought any happiness to this world but on the contrary has brought confusion into social life and has created chains for humanity, which having assumed the chains cannot now get rid of them.</p>
   <p>Turning to the Russian problem, the lecturer expressed the hope that Russia, <span class="page-break">4</span>after undergoing so serious an operation, will recuperate in the near future, and it is possible that even we shall live to witness a new dawn in our native land and happy days for our people.</p>
   <p>In conclusion Mr. Grebenshchikov displayed a few slides depicting peasant life in the villages, portraits of the revolutionary heroes, and landscapes of European Russia and Siberia. The audience rewarded the author with loud applause for his pictures and promised to attend his other lectures in Chicago.</p>
   <p>After the lecture the guests were offered a cup of tea. Many of those present remained to exchange a few words with the author or to shake hands with him and his wife, who always accompanies her husband in his travels over the country.</p>
   <p>The tea party and the conversation lasted far into the night, and only the lateness of the hour compelled the guests to go home.</p>

   <p>There are not many social workers so active or men so distinguished as Mr. Grebenshchikov among us Russians in the United States. He is perhaps the only man who possesses the talent to sow what is good and vital for us all. May he live many years and succeed in his altruistic endeavors, and may they bear rich fruit!</p>
   <p>Mr. Grebenshchikov, even here in a foreign land, has arranged his life as he lived it in Russia, as it existed in Siberia. He has founded a village and named it Churaevka, far away from any city, in the woodlands of the State of Connecticut, in the midst of nature unsoiled by our civilization.</p>
