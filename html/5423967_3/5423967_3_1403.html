   <p>Foreigners have a habit of thinking of the Russian peasant as a member of the family of the bear. For this reason, they think that he is clumsy, lazy, backward, and stupid. This reputation was built up for the peasant all over the world by his enemies, of course. This particular attitude toward the Russian peasant originated during the period of serfdom. This was the picture of the peasant during that period in Russian history. The world was not aware of the fact that the Russian peasant was very industrious, and was superior in physical endurance to other peoples. How was the world to know of the good qualities of the Russian peasant, since everything it knew was only hearsay, and false hearsay, at that. This was the situation until the Russian Revolution. The Revolution came, and it seemed that the toiler of the fields would become an entirely different man, and would receive his due recognition. But it only seemed [that way]. In reality, this transformation did not take place.</p>

   <p>The present rulers also think of the peasant as a very indolent man; they have deprived him of every [chance to use his] initiative and of every independent activity. He must do everything on orders from above. But notwithstanding the fact that the past and present rulers [of Russia] have tried to soil the good and honest name of the peasant, the world is beginning to recognize the true character of the Russian toiler of the fields. Other peoples have finally understood that we are not worse than they are, that we are also able to create things. It is true that we are just beginning to reveal our abilities and aspirations. We are still weak from the disease which has afflicted us ever since we came to America, but, we are growing stronger every day. We are beginning to understand ourselves. This is really the road to recovery. We are gradually beginning to organize our ranks and to come closer together. There seems to be an end to the controversies, disagreements, and quarrels, from which we have suffered for many years. We are entering into a new stage of life. Our partial, if not complete regeneration begins at this point.</p>
   <p>All that has been said is as true of local members of the Russian Independent <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mutual Aid Society RNzOV, as it is of members in other states where the Society has branches. If, at present, RNzOV seems unimportant, still one need not be a prophet to declare that in the near future this Society is destined to play a leading role among the Russian organizations in the middle western states. A visit to the Wood Street Center last Saturday, February 3, made this fact very clear. The housewarming was really a big event in the life of the Russian colony in Chicago. Despite the fact that the auditorium is a spacious one, it was packed, and many people were compelled to stand outside on the street. One saw men, women, and children from all over Chicago and outlying towns there. Everybody came to see the work done by the peasants from Wood Street. I am, however, deeply convinced that this is only the beginning, and that the most important part of the work still lies ahead. This auditorium will serve as the center for all the Russians in Chicago. Here all the sessions of the conventions of the Russian organizations will be held; here the meetings, conferences, lectures, and concerts will be given.</p>
   <p>During the evening, I had an opportunity to speak to members of the branches <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>outside of Chicago, and they all expressed their gratitude to the members of the central branch, which had conceived the idea of building a new auditorium and had executed the plan in the shortest possible time.</p>
   <p>I shall write again about RNzOV and the Russian youth.</p>
