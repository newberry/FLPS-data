   <p>The Russian Review originated in November, 1927, in the form of a monthly magazine somewhat on the lines of the Literary Digest. Dr. Alexandr Ivanovich Nedzelnitsky was the editor and Mr. J. J. Voronko the assistant editor. This review contained articles on literature, theater, music and history and was not concerned with politics. In such a form the review was published for about two years. After that it was converted into a weekly newspaper under the editorship of Mr. Solomon Sheiman, whose place was taken later by Mr. A. P. Shuisky. In 1932 Mr. Breitman became the editor. The review from the very start had been conducted on more or less nonpartisan lines.</p>
   <p>In 1933 Mr. I. N. Kaigorodov, a former Russian reserve officer, persuaded Mr. Savicki to make him the editor of the paper. Mr. Savicki, who was not quite satisfied with the work Mr. Breitman was doing, turned <span class="page-break">\2</span>the editorship over to Mr. Kaigorodov, who immediately gave to the paper a nationalistic and ultra anti-Semitic character. Owing to this the paper began to lose subscribers. Mr. Savicki, who, naturally, was displeased and did not sympathize with the extremely belligerent attitude of Mr. Kaigorodov toward the Jews, invited Mr. V. I. Nedzelnitsky (brother of Dr. Nedzelnitsky) to become the editor. The paper again became more or less non-partisan though showing at times a slight tendency towards radicalism. Mr. V. I. Nedzelnitsky remained editor of the paper for about one year, when he was compelled to resign his editorship as he had accepted the office of priest in one of the Russian churches.</p>
   <p>So Mr. Savicki had again to find an editor for the newspaper. At the suggestion of Dr. I. Nedzelnitsky he invited General Vassiliy Vladimirovich Cheslavsky, editor of the review at the present time.</p>
   <p>Under the new editor the number of subscribers began to increase, as <span class="page-break">\3</span>General Cheslavsky succeeded in making the paper much more interesting than before. Though distinctly conservative in his views, General Cheslavsky avoided violent attacks and captious criticism on his political opponents, thus raising the moral prestige of the paper and earning the respect of his political enemies.</p>
   <p>The review, which under Mr. Kaigorodov had lost many subscribers and was experiencing financial difficulties, has overcome these difficulties at present.</p>
