   <p>Lately there have been arranged in the Russian colony many interesting lectures on various subjects: political, scientific, religious and others.</p>
   <p>Quite recently we had to publish a notice about a lecture by Professor Bobrovnikov. His theme was "Science and Religion," an unusual subject for a lecture in our colony. On the same evening there was another lecture also on an unusual theme: "Singing and Russian Songs." The tenor Mr. George Morozov was the lecturer.</p>
   <p>The audience listened to this lecture very attentively.</p>
   <p>Lectures on such subjects are a rare thing in our colony. It is also something new that such lectures attract very attentive audiences.</p>
   <p>This is a proof of the fact that we are progressing.</p>
