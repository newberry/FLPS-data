   <p>Branch Number Twenty-six of R.I.M.A.S. on February 5 opened a school for children who wish to learn to read, write, and speak correctly the Russian language. The school is located in the comfortable modern building of the City Library, 1101 Indiana Avenue. The classes are held every Wednesday from four to seven o'clock in the evening under the tutorship of Mme. P. Svatikova.</p>
   <p>Those Russian parents in the city of Pullman who do not wish to let their children remain ignorant of their mother tongue should take care of that problem by sending their children to this newly opened school. The school committee expresses the hope that Russian parents will respond to this undertaking, and that the school, which now has only a few pupils, will grow into a large institution and become a nursery of Russian culture.</p>
   <p>For all information concerning the school apply to Mr. S. Levkovich, 742 East 105th Place.</p>
