   <p>When Russians have sent delegates to conventions or congresses dealing with important matters they have always referred to them as "the best people". In the republics of Pskov or Novgorod, these best people used to choose from among themselves the chief warrior and ruler. The best people helped John the Terrible to formulate the laws for the principality of Moscow and took part in the deliberations of his councils; they were also influential during the reigns of the first czars of the Romanov family--during the reigns of Mikhail and Alexis. They helped to restore order after the feudal wars. They were the best people not only because they were the most cultured and the most enlightened people of their time, and were well versed in political and social matters, but mainly because a great majority of them were idealists, devoted to the duties they were called upon to perform, devoted to the people, to the society which they were ready to serve, and for the sake of which they were <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>chosen as representatives to a congress or council. For this reason, many ancient documents of people's assemblies, records of proceedings, and resolutions are full of humanist philosophy,and are examples of high moral standards, spiritual aspirations, faith, and hope in the coming brotherhood of man.</p>
   <p>Today, and for the two days following, the twenty-fourth annual convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, RNzOV, will be held in Chicago at 917 North Wood Street. We cordially extend our greetings to the chosen delegates to this assembly. Even though our society is not the republic of Pskov or Novgorod, nor the principality of Moscow, nevertheless, the rays of the sun reflect even a single drop of water, and truth will always prevail. To this Russian assembly will come idealists, men devoted to the Society, and ready to serve the Russian people steadfastly, without personal benefit. On the decisions of the delegates will depend the future policies of our society, its growth, progress, and moral and spiritual health during the coming years. In our opinion, the fate of the whole Russian colony in Chicago will depend, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to a great extent, on the decisions taken by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. We are certain that the delegates to the twenty-fourth annual convention of RNzOV, like their ancestors in ancient Russia, will approach the problem with the same purity of heart, with the same faith in the ultimate value of their goal for all the Russians in America, and with that enlightened enthusiasm which makes possible impossible things, and makes difficult problems very simple.</p>
   <p>It is possible that among the delegates there will be found some misguided men--perhaps, even a few self-seeking persons (a large family cannot avoid having a cripple), bu the general purposes of the delegates, their aims, and aspirations will remain righteous and pure. This is well known by the men who stand close to the affairs of the Society. This clear purpose of the Society will soon be understood by misguided or misinformed individuals. They will begin to discard their fallacious ideas, and together with the old members of our society will take on the responsibility for the benefit of the Russian Colony in Chicago and for the glory of the Russian name in a foreign land. Mistakes <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>are always possible, and anyone can make them. Even though our steps may be infirm at times and our actions hesitant, our direction is always right and our purpose good.</p>
   <p>Isn't the aim of the Independent Society a good one? Isn't it a good thing to unite as many Russians as possible and to insure the future of our widows and orphans, to save them from poverty and worry, so that they won't be left hopeless and forsaken in a strange land?</p>
   <p>Isn't the task of founding a school fund for the most talented children of our members so that they may receive higher and specialized education a vital one?</p>
   <p>Isn't the acquistion of a piece of ground where a Russian village may be founded, where our old members may seek asylum and some work, and our children may find <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>recreation and rest during the summer and may accumulate strength for the winter months, a sacred obligation? Only madmen or traitors--enemies of the Russian people--would harm or attempt to destroy the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are seventy thousand unorganized Russians. Let those who call themselves "friends of the Russian workers" organize them in any way they choose but they must not be allowed to stretch their dirty hands, smeared with the blood of the Russian people, to touch the sacred temple that is being built by the members of our society.</p>
   <p>The editorial staff of this newspaper cordially greets the twenty-fourth annual convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society and believes that each and every delegate understands and realizes the importance and seriousness of the duties entrusted to him, and will approach his tasks as a free man should <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>--with quiet deliberation in accordance with his own conscience and honor.</p>
