   <p>Novyi Mir [the Russian Communist publication] writes boastfully about the achievements of the International Workers' Order [the mutual aid insurance society controlled by the Communists]. According to Novyi Mir, the International Workers' Order maintains four colleges, five high schools, and ninety-seven grammar schools. The teaching in all these schools is conducted in the Yiddish language. In addition, the Order supports a number of evening classes, where the social and political sciences are given precedence over all other subjects. Here, too, the language of instruction is Yiddish.</p>
   <p>We agree with Novyi Mir that these are important achievements for a single mutual aid organization. The Jewish children in the International Workers' Order should be congratulated on having all these opportunities to learn their native tongue and to receive a fair general education. The Order does not spare the money of its members in properly preparing the sons and daughters to take the places of their parents in the organization when the time comes.</p>
   <p>We should like to know, however, how many colleges, and how many high schools and grammar schools are available for the children of other national groups affiliated with this organization. These others do not know the Yiddish language, and probably have no desire to study it. Non-Jewish members of the International Workers' Order pay the same dues as the Jewish members, and they should enjoy the same rights and privileges. They should also have their schools.</p>
   <p>We are interested in the affairs of the International Workers' Order, because a Russian benefit society, the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society, became affiliated with that organization.</p>
   <p>At one of the meetings of the International Workers' Order, the secretary, in reply to the contention that the Order is a Jewish organization stated that not more than thirty per cent of the entire membership of the organization consists of Jews. Let us suppose that this is true and that the remaining seventy per cent belong to other nationalities. Then the question arises: How many colleges and schools are being maintained by the International Workers' Order for the seventy per cent of its membership that is non-Jewish, if the thirty per cent that is Jewish enjoys the advantage of four colleges, five high schools, and ninety-seven grammar schools in all of which Yiddish is the official language? We most assuredly know that the International Workers' Order does not have a single college or a single high school for the children of its many Russian members. This organization supports a few Russian grammar schools, which are badly neglected and poorly managed. This fact is admitted by Novyi Mir itself.</p>
   <p>Where is this "equality of all members irrespective of race," which is the proud boast of this communist insurance organization? Are the Russian children less deserving members than the Jewish children? Or is the Russian language inferior and less deserving of study than the Jewish language? Why should the Jewish children, a minority of thirty per cent, be permitted to develop under the influence of their own national culture at the expense of the seventy per cent that is non-Jewish?</p>
   <p>From the foregoing, it can be seen that there is no place for the Russian people like their own purely Russian organization. The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society throws its doors wide open to every Russian man, woman, and child, indeed to every person of Slavic origin.</p>
   <p>Russian people in America are disorganized. If we add to this the already proverbial ignorance and political inexperience of our people, we have the answer to why the Russian group in this country has always lagged far behind other national groups in so many respects: in its political, social, economic, educational, and cultural life.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why even in the International Workers' Order the Russian members do not receive the same treatment and consideration as, for instance, the Jewish members of the organization. At the present time, all affairs of the organization and its entire membership, including the Russian members, are being directed and led by the Communist Jews, who are the bosses of the entire organization, including all its branches. In the future, their children, educated and specially prepared for that purpose in the organization's Jewish colleges, will direct the Order and will lead its non-Jewish members, who now as children are refused proper schooling by the heads of the organization. And yet these Jewish Communist bosses of the International Workers' Order call their organization a model workers' organization.</p>
   <p>We repeat: Not in the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society and not in the International Workers' Order, but only in the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is there a guarantee of equal rights and privileges for every Russian man, woman, and child in America. "United we stand, divided we fall," goes the old adage. This is especially true of us Russians in America. Unorganized and disunited, we are defenseless and helpless in any emergency. Strongly united on a national basis, we shall be able to build a better future for ourselves and for our children. In unity there is strength. When we are united and strong, we shall build our own college for our children. It will be a Russian college, and its language will be Russian. It will be a college owned and operated by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   <p>In unity there is strength.</p>
