   <p>The first lecture of T. V. Chernavin, "The Wrecker's Wife," was delivered last Friday at the University of Chicago. The hall of the University was jammed with people, most of whom were students who had come to hear the talented Russian woman tell of her daring escape from the clutches of the Bolsheviks. The conditions under which intellectuals in Russia live, must have been of interest to American intellectuals because the attendance at the lecture was very good.</p>
   <p>In her lecture, which lasted nearly two hours, Madame Chernavin drew a picture of the ugly conditions under which the Russian intellectuals live, particularly the older generation of professional men and specialists who are forced to work under Bolshevik control.</p>
   <p>In the past, Russian intellectuals were a class of free, independent people who were not subjected to any kind of official control. Russian intellectuals, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>according to Madame Charnavin, had even had certain tendencies toward anarchism, and these led to frequent conflicts with the czarist government, and these conflicts, in turn, generated revolutionary sentiments.</p>
   <p>The great majority of Russian intellectuals approved of the revolution, and naturally so, since they had, to a great extent, participated in preparing the soil for its coming. The preponderant majority of the intellectuals were ready, conscientiously, and not through fear, to work hand in hand with the Soviet regime.</p>
   <p>But from the very first days of the revolution a cleavage appeared between the Bolshevik authority and the intellectuals, whom the Bolshevik leaders regarded with suspicion.</p>
   <p>Lenin understood that a small group of Bolsheviks would not be able to accomplish anything in Russia. Socialism, he said, must be built by somebody else's hands and the Bolsheviks should retain only the leadership. Those <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>"somebody else's hands" proved to be those of the intellectuals. The intellectuals understood that they were being outlawed and hamstrung in their work by a good many Bolshevik overseers.</p>
   <p>As a museum specialist, Madame Chernavin worked in many first-rate museums. Her superiors in most places were ignorant, almost illiterate Bolsheviks--roofers, tailors, and other such proletarians--who displayed their carelessness when they handled museum rarities.</p>
   <p>When Madame Chernavin protested against these proletarians taking Imperial drapes to be made into dresses for their wives, the Bolshevik supervisors told her that it was none of her business as the museums were a part of the proletarian property and they were free to do what they pleased.</p>
   <p>The higher Soviet officials also regarded the museum valuables carelessly. Rare paintings of the great masters were sold at ridiculously low prices.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>In their struggle for foreign currency the Bolsheviks stop at nothing. Chernavin's protestsled her to frequent conflicts with the authorities, which ended as a rule with arrests.</p>
   <p>In most cases specialists are arrested with no justification, for the purpose of intimidation and of breaking down their will to resist and protest.</p>
   <p>Specialists find themselves outlawed if they happen to have been born members of the privileged classes. Not only they themselves, but their children, who have been born since the revolution, are deprived of the elementary rights enjoyed by members of the proletarian class. The intellectuals are being subjected to a glaring injustice when their children are deprived of the right to receive higher technical or other special education.</p>
   <p>The harsh treatment of intellectuals is indicated in their frequent transfers from one place of work to another, and their changes of assignments. Frequently they are assigned to work for which they are not qualified. Protests <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>are of no avail in such cases; the specialists are told to learn what they do not know and thus qualify for the new job. In case of fefusal, they are regarded as "wreckers".</p>
   <p>Such conditions interfere with the work of the specialists and create chaos in the country and in the life of the people. The Bolshevik leadership, of course, denies its responsibility for all the economic failures and lays all the blame at the door of the specialists, those scapegoats for all of Stalin's sins. There is no deliberate wrecking on the part of specialists. The noisy court processes are staged with the aim of pulling the wool over the people's eyes and diverting the resentment of the masses from those Bolshevik leaders who should be charged with the full responsibility for the chaotic economic conditions existing in the country.</p>
   <p>Of course, no lecture can take place without the presence of a group of Bolsheviks. Some of the Bolshevik-minded students questioned the lecturer.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>In all of her answers they received a proper rebuff. One of the Bolshevik students pointed out that such intellectuals as Maxim Gorky, Ilya Erenburg, Demian Bedny, and others enjoy their life under Soviet rule and are popular among the people.</p>
   <p>In response to this, Madame Chernavin declared that Gorky was now the richest man in the U.S.S.R., but even though they [aforementioned individuals] "like bolshevism" they still prefer to live either in fascist Italy or bourgeois France. If Stalin extends his favors to these men, it does not mean that they are highly esteemed by the Russian people, who are oppressed by the Bolsheviks.</p>
   <p>But perhaps the conditions are better under which the young specialists work--that is, those who have grown up under Bolshevik rule, and have been educated by them. No, answers Chernavin. They are persecuted for Stalin's failures just as much as the older specialists. Concentration camps in the U.S.S.R. already hold a large number of such young inmates.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Intellectuals merely ask to be permitted to work for the good of the country without fear that at any time, one may be seized and thrown into jail without cause, or sent into exile. The hopelessness of the situation forced Chernavin, her husband, and their thirteen-year-old boy to flee from the concentration camp and escape, despite unbelievable and at times insurmountable obstacles, to Finland.</p>
   <p>A very attentive crowd of listeners received Madame Chernavin with thunderous applause upon the conclusion of her lecture.</p>
