   <p>The regular business meeting of Kriildv's School was held on May 31 at 5553 Drummond Place. There were many questions on the order of the day. The minutes of the preceding meeting and the financial statement for May were approved without discussion. A report submitted by the delegate of RNzOV's School Committee was read into the record.</p>
   <p>This will be, probably, the last meeting of the school before it closes its doors for the summer recess.</p>
   <p>During the school year that is to close soon the school has been attended by twenty-four pupils. The classes have been held twice a week.</p>
