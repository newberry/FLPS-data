   <p>In 1927 there were arranged by the Russian organizations in Chicago eighty-six entertainments, distributed as follow: Theatrical performances, concert-balls, school and family festivities, bazaars and picnics. Of theatrical performances and concert-balls there were twenty-six. Of school and family festivities there were forty-eight; six picnics and six bazaars. Theatrical performances and concert-balls were arranged in specially rented halls. Festivities and bazaars were held in the halls owned by the organizations. I shall mention the costs and profits of these entertainments. The gross average returns from concert-balls and picnics were $525. The average expenses were $385. The average return from festivities was $100; the average expenses were $35; bazaars, average return, $140, expenses, $55. Thus all these festivities and entertainments cost in one year $22,440. This figureincludes only the material cost, as the labor was done by the members free of charge. Of this sum there remains a net profit of only $8,110. But this is by far not an exact figure, because the above information concerns only those entertainments which have been reported in the Russian daily Rassviet.</p>
