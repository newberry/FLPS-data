   <p>Last Thursday, in New York, the eleventh annual convention of the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society, RNOV, ended, and during Saturday and Sunday of last week, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, RNzOV, held its twenty-fourth annual convention in Chicago. Both organizations, if we look at them superficially, seem to be alike in many respects, identical in fact, because they apparently pursue the same aims and their membership is entirely Russian. In spirit, however, these organizations have nothing in common.</p>
   <p>RNOV's recently concluded convention in New York, was, in all probability, its last. It is well known that RNOV was caught in the communist net several years ago, and was changed from a purely mutual aid society into a political organization. In the near future, this society will discontinue its independent existence because its recent convention adopted a final decision to affiliate and merge RNOV with the International Workers' Order [Translator's note: a communist-dominated mutual aid organization with headquarters in New York, made up of a number of national groups]. When this decision goes into effect, RNOV will become only the Russian section of the parent organization known as the International Workers' Order with many branches in Chicago, including Russian locals also. For this reason, we believe that the eleventh convention of this society will be its last. The next convention of this society will not be a RNOV convention, but a convention of the Russian section of the International Workers' Order. That is where the Bolsheviks have led the Russian people--those who lacked the courage and ability to resist the encroachment of these adventurers.</p>
   <p>RNzOV's convention was of a very different type. The convention showed that RNzOV has grown stronger in every respect and is embarking on a new course. If formerly it had shown a certain hesitancy and uncertainty in its attitude toward Bolshevism, at present this indecision no longer exists. Formerly, members of the Society were inclined to think that sooner or later, some time in the future, Bolsheviks would become decent human beings and would cease to interfere with the affairs of others. For that reason, on all previous occasions and whenever an opportunity arose, they treated the Bolshevik representatives with all due respect, patiently listening to their espousals of the communist cause, and even inviting them to the customary banquets after the close of the sessions.</p>
   <p>But after many years of experience, members of the Society became firmly convinced that Bolsheviks are incorrigible; that they recognize no honor, suffer no shame, and totally lack human dignity. Consequently, when the Bolshevik "fraternal" delegates came to the twenty-fourth annual convention of RNzOV, they were told to get out. If the Bolshevik delegates had known what a sense of shame or honor was, they would have left the premises immediately. But since these human faculties are replaced in Bolsheviks by impudence, they, as is customary with Bolsheviks, acted as if they were in their own home and refused to obey the command. The convention was compelled to resort to force in order to eject them from the hall. This simply indicates that the patience of the members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has been exhausted and they are no longer subject to sentimental thinking with regard to individuals who are trying to destroy their organization, or to capture control of it, as happened with RNOV.</p>
   <p>What is more, RNzOV has embarked upon a new course in its organizational work. Formerly, the Society conducted its activities in a somewhat amateurish fashion, if we may use that expression. From now on, it will have a permanent staff secretary and it will conduct its business in the style of a large insurance organization.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the Society has every prospect of growing stronger both in quality and quantity, and it will remain a Russian organization, while RNOV is absorbed into the International Workers' Order, which is headed by a clique of very clever political double-dealers.</p>
