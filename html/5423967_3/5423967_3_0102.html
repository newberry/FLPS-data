   <p>In Lisle, Illinois, the first issue of a new church publication printed in English and Russian has just come off the press. The name of the magazine is the Church Voice. It is edited by Mr. P. Neuzhil.</p>
   <p>The first issue presents a pleasing appearance, but the articles in Russian suffer with illiteracy.</p>
   <p>In Chicago also the latest issue of Our Way, a church magazine published by the Russian Orthodox Church on Leavitt Street, has appeared.</p>
