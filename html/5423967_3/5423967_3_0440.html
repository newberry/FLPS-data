   <p>On November 3, 1924, at the club "Enlightenment," A. P. Braghin gave one of the lectures of the series entitled, "The Origin of Life on our Earth."</p>
   <p>The lecture was a great success, both as regards the lucid exposition of the subject by the expert lecturer, and in respect of the large audience.</p>
   <p>It is gratifying to point out the interest shown by the Russian workmen in an intricate scientific problem; it is also worth mentioning that some of the workmen, belonging to the rank and file, who participated in the discussions that arose after the lectures, have shown a certain erudition and were not lacking intellectual development.</p>
