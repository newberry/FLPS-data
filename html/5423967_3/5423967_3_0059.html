   <p>"It is not easy to start an organ wherever one wishes. Especially, of course in Russia. The censor, prohibitions, arrests--all these face those who wish to publish anything. Therefore, in Russia there can be no complaint with the lack of sympathy. While here in the country of freedom of speech, people who have foresaken Russia in this struggle for freedom of speech, upon the first effort at this selfsame freedom, fall into ways which recall involuntarily the words of our poet: 'In place of the chains of serfdom, men have laid on other chains'.</p>
   <p>Is it not strange? In a 'free' country people hinder the printed word. Strange but true.</p>
   <p>Conservatism, skeptical smiles, ugly predictions are met at the very first attempt at publication. That is why in such a city as Chicago, with a large Russian population, with a considerable number of political emigrants and intelligentsia in general, there have been up to now neither Russian papers or Russian magazines, while every Russian organ, every printed word of Russian, is literally gobbled up."</p>
