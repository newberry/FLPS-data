   <p>We Russian-Americans, in our frequent endeavor to help other nationalities, forget the interests of our own group, while other national groups concentrate all their efforts upon their own welfare. A good index to the harmony, the mutual understanding, and the ability to achieve possessed by other national groups, is the work of their societies and fraternal organizations.</p>
   <p>Consider, for example, the Polish nationality, which belongs to our own Slavonic race. The Polish group of Chicago alone was able to provide one of its fraternal organizations with four thousand new adult members and with over eight thousand new children members in the month of April. All the Russian organizations in Chicago put together did not get more than eighty new members during the same period of time. It is true that there are more Poles in Chicago than Russians, but at the same time it can be safely said that our group is far behind other nationalities in this and in other respects. The insurance statistics show that ninety-five per cent of the Germans and the Jews in this country have insurance policies, while only five per cent <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the Russians have any form of life insurance.</p>
   <p>During the last twenty years, the Russian group in Chicago has made very insignificant progress, if any at all. Its cultural level has remained the same. Its general understanding of literature, art, and politics has not advanced. Its mental development has remained stationary, much as it was at the time when the majority of Russian immigrants arrived in America some twenty-five years ago.</p>
   <p>The great task facing the old Russian generation today is the proper education of our American-born children. The most important element in the education of our children is a knowledge of the Russian language--the ability to read and write Russian. To achieve this knowledge, all Russian children should be sent to Russian elementary schools. If there are not enough such schools, our organizations should establish new Russian elementary schools and classes.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has its own Russian elementary schools in every section of the city of Chicago where there are Russians. It <span class="page-break">\3</span>is up to the parents to see to it that their children receive the necessary fundamental knowledge and understanding of the Russian language, Russian culture, and Russian history.</p>
   <p>We have a debt to pay, an obligation to fulfill to our children. We came to America resolved to better our own lives and the lives of our children. Let us keep that resolution, let us fulfill our promise to our children. We should spare no effort or expense to give to our children a better education than we have received.</p>
   <p>In the Douglas Park district of Chicago, there is a Russian school maintained by the Jewish population of that district. Evidently, they appreciate the value of knowing how to speak and write the Russian language, because they pay ten dollars a month for their children's lessons. And [even at this fee] the school is completely filled. Our schools charge only one tenth of what the Jewish school charges, and yet some of our schools are almost empty. The Jewish people realize what a knowledge of the Russian language will mean to their children in the future, while we do not seem to have grasped the importance of our language in future world affairs. Besides, the Russian schools <span class="page-break">\4</span>in America are indispensable for the future of our group in general, and for the continued existence of our organizations in particular.</p>
   <p>Every other national group in America, no matter how much it may be divided on political and other questions, stands together as one man when it comes to the school question and to matters pertaining to their common native language. Even their clergy co-operates to the fullest extent in such matters. We are divided even on our school problem. Our clergy does not co-operate with our efforts to organize and maintain our schools, and in some instances our priests are hostile to our work.</p>
   <p>Despite all the difficulties, we shall continue to hope that some day complete understanding and harmony will be established among our people in America, and that the schools will always receive first consideration.</p>
