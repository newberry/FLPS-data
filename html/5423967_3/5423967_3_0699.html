   <p>A reporter of Rassviet had a talk with Mr. G. D. Grebenshchikov, the noted Russian writer and philosopher, just before the latter left Chicago for Detroit. Among other questions our reporter asked the writer, who has delivered several lectures before Russian audiences in his visit here, just what impressions he is carrying away of the Russian colony in our city. After a few moments of smiling hesitation Mr. Grebenshchikov replied:</p>
   <p>"To tell the truth, I have hardly seen the Russian colony in Chicago at all. By chance, and only in a casual way, I met some Russians at the entertainment given by your newspaper on the second day of my visit here. At my lectures at the Russian-American Club I always saw the same faces, although they tell me that there are fifty thousand Russians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>I had thought that by taking advantage of their years of idleness the Russians here, having so much time to spare for self-education, might have grown culturally <span class="page-break">2</span>and developed a liking for the finer things in life, for art, literature, science, and among other things, lectures. But I was evidently mistaken. Not only in Chicago but also in other cities I observed, on the contrary, a flagging interest in Russian culture among the Russian people, whereas at the same time I noticed an increase of interest in it among American-born people and among those of other nationalities. It's a regrettable phenomenon that the Russian youth is altogether absent from the Russian lectures and from those that concern Russia.</p>
   <p>"So it was much pleasanter to observe, at my lectures before American college students, only young faces, and to judge by the way in which the young people received me, constantly surrounding me and asking for autographs, they liked my lectures and my pictures of Russia."</p>
   <p>Asked where his Russian audiences were most numerous, Mr. Grebenshchikov replied:</p>
   <p>"They were most numerous in three cities: New York, Gary,Indiana,and Minneapolis.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In St. Paul there was also a larger audience than in Chicago. Even in Trenton New Jersey, in a comparatively small Russian colony, I found more listeners than here. Only at the lecture arranged by the Reverend Mr. Semkov at the parish auditorium, Western Avenue and 53rd Street, was there a comparatively large audience, consisting mainly of Carpathian Russians.</p>
   <p>However, even these were not very numerous, but their constant attendance at my lectures, despite below-zero weather, moved me, as did likewise their attentiveness and their cordiality. I was treated with particular warmth and hospitality by the Right Reverend Bishop Leonty of Chicago, who headed the committee selected to arrange the banquet at which I met the flower of the Russian intelligentsia, the professors, the medical men, the lawyers, etc. Of course, there are many individuals and Russian institutions to whom and to which I shall express particular thanks, but first of all I wish to express my gratitude to the Russian churchmen with Bishop Leonty at their head and my particular thanks to the Reverend Mr. Timon, whose hospitality my wife and I enjoyed throughout our sojourn in Chicago. I also express to Mme.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Svatikova my cordial thanks for her efforts in arranging a number of lectures.</p>
   <p>"My hearty thanks go also to many, many people whose names perhaps I cannot even remember, but whose hospitality and friendliness I highly appreciate."</p>
