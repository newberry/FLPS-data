   <p>While police stood guard to avert anticipated trouble, Alexander Kerensky, Premier of Russia in 1917, told 1,200 of his countrymen yesterday that communism has sold the people down the river.</p>
   <p>"Stalinism, fascism and nazism are identical," said Kerensky, speaking in Russian. "They are all built on terror. Each resorts to the firing squad or headsman's block to silence champions of the people's rights."</p>
   <p>Police Guard Doors</p>
   <p>Lieut. Make Mills and detectives of the police industrial squad were scattered through the crowd in Ashland Auditorium. Uniformed police guarded the doors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>These precautions were taken after a series of Communist meetings at which speakers urged loyal Stalinists to break up the Kerensky gathering, held under auspices of the Russian Democratic Club.</p>
   <p>Asserting that the democracies of the world must present a united front to avert a disastrous war which would destroy civilization Kerensky went on:</p>
   <p>"Stalin's regime is destroying Russia's national strength by murdering the nation's greatest leaders. The longer he remains in power the lower the morals of the Russian people must fall.</p>
   <p>Denies Treachery</p>
   <p>"Hundreds of great men executed in recent purges were not traitors, but conscientious fighters for the rights of their countrymen. Most of them were true Socialists who helped Lenin to establish the Soviet government."</p>
   <p>The speaker declared these martyrs opposed Stalin and went to their deaths <span class="page-break">\3</span>because the present government is not one of true socialism, but has degenerated to the old feudal system, making vassals of the people.</p>
