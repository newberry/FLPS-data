   <p>Mr. Borodin, according to Mr. M. Perlman, the present proprietor of the Progressive Preparatory School of English, and in the past on the staff of the Progressive Preparatory School (a sister school of the Berg Institution), had a very fine and cultural background. Soon after his arrival in Chicago (about 1908), Mr. Michael Berg became associated with Mr. (now doctor) Karp, professor of philosophy at the School of Social Service in New York.</p>
   <p>Together they opened a school at Roosevelt Road and Newberry Avenue. The school was opened for the purpose of teaching English to the foreign born. From here Mr. Berg moved to his later location at West Division Street and Hoyne Avenue, and conducted his school under the same name and on the same basis. From this school he turned out great numbers of students, both grammar and high school graduates. He conducted this <span class="page-break">2</span>school until about 1919 or 1920, when he sold it to Mr. Samuel Hoffman and went to the Soviet Union. Although Mr. Borodin did not reap a harvest financially, his school, located in the heart of the Russian colony, had a great influence on that community.</p>
   <p>Concurrently, Mr. H. Bolotin, also a Russian immigrant, conducted a school for the foreign-born at 1700 W. Roosevelt Road, with Mr. Jurow as manager. This school later moved to 3317 W. Roosevelt Road, under the name of Progressive Preparatory School. At that time Mr. M. Borodin became acquainted with Mr. Bolotin, and they decided to consolidate their schools. Mr. Borodin had continued his own education at the same time and was a university graduate. The field of literature was his hobby, and he became quite proficient in it. Mr. M. Borodin lectured before many groups and was always able to keep the attention of the public, as he possessed a very winning personality.</p>
