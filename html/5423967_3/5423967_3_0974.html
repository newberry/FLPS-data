   <p>A new useful idea has been born in the minds of some members of the Club "Znanie". It has been proposed to organize a series of educational excursions to some of the most noteworthy places of Chicago: to museums, universities, parks, stock and other exchanges, etc. The first excursion was to be to the Art Institute. It took place on a Sunday, and Mr. Slonimsky, who was conducting the excursionists, gave explanations about every statue to be admired at the museum.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to arrange such excursions twice every month.</p>
