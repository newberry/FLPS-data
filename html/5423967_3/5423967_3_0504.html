   <p>We succeeded in becoming acquainted with the project of the constitution, which will be discussed at the conference of the Federation of Children's Schools of the City of Chicago, which is fixed for July 3.</p>
   <p>We also know roughly all the resolutions which were long ago already worked out, and will be skillfully put through at this conference. According to the statement of one of the parents of a pupil and a prominent worker in education, all of them are of the Moscow type, slavishly copying the program of the Soviet colleges.</p>
   <p>It is quite clear that the Chicago workers' paper which is protesting against the mixing of politics with education, and which contends for the raising and education of our future generation in a pure national and non-political spirit, this paper is, by the interpretation of the henchmen of the Communists, anti-Soviet, anti-Semitic and so forth. But let us fix our attention on the constitution.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The latter is composed so cleverly that practically speaking at first glance it would seem that it calls out practically no objection. But looking it through more attentively, we have noticed some of its characteristic points, as for example, point 5, paragraph 3, says:</p>
   <p>"The rearing of children in the principles of the workers' conception of the world." It is understood that the word "communistic" is replaced in this point, for euphony, with the word "workers." (in the same manner, Communist Party of America is written "Workers Party" of America).</p>
   <p>This point denotes that the Russian children who are sent to the Federation schools will be subject to suggestion from childhood, that they are not Russians; this means that from the child's mind will be removed all ideas about its native country, people, and so forth, which are only from childhood imbibed by the youthful, keen childish mind, that these children at best will grow up cosmopolites, who will be lost forever for the future Russia.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We do not have to go far for examples of what the Soviet school has done (and does) with Russian children and youth, how cruelly mutilated is their future there. Enough about this was told by Krupsky, Bukharin, Trotsky, and a line of other supporters of the communistic kingdom. The constitution flaunts an article (point 5, paragraph "G") about the rights of the executive committee of the Federations "to communicate with the educational institutions of the U. S. S. R., that is, to receive from there instructions and to put them through in life here, copying exactly the patterns from there.</p>
   <p>It is not enough for them that cruel experiments have been already performed in this respect on hundreds of thousands of children in Russia. They intend to perform these experiments also here, on our children.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is not without good reason that two large Russian schools for children, the South Side School, having up to 200 pupils, and the Wood Street School, with 40 children, did not join the Federation; not without reason are the leaders of the Federation afraid to grant to <span class="page-break">4</span>these schools, and also to some other Russian educational institutions of the city of Chicago, the right of a decisive vote; for the order given to the Communists by their "higher-ups" is as follows: "Give to them the right to vote only if they join, bringing with them resolutions prepared beforehand by us." Of course, to admit them just so, unconditionally, would be dangerous; what if at the last minute these delegates would reconsider all that had been already resolved and prepared for them beforehand according to the Communist pattern, and would come forward with resolutions of their own?</p>
   <p>(Apropos: a certain Mr. M. A. Skromny (Note: "Skromny" means "modest." D. S.) in writing for one of the local American papers about the coming conference, modestly made the following remark concerning the South Side School:</p>
   <p>"Previously one of the parochial schools also belonged to the Federation; but later this school did not agree with the decisions and rules of the Federation and left it."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Is it possible that Mr. Skromny does not know that the South Side School had never been a parochial school, or did he apply in this case the usual method?)</p>
   <p>The South Side School, which had never been a parochial school, after having belonged for some time to the Federation left it, being prompted to do so by very weighty reasons.</p>
   <p>How do the Communist leaders act?</p>
   <p>A short time before the end of the school year, there are introduced into the Committee of the school a few noisy Communist trouble makers who previously had nothing to do with the school; and they begin, of course, the usual work of destruction.</p>
   <p>This is how the principle of cooperation of useful persons, which is embodied in the laws of the Federation, has been applied in this case.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Politics are introduced purposely into the business of the Russian schools of Chicago.</p>
   <p>They want to introduce into the education of our children the pernicious influence of the Marxian teaching in a perverted form, as interpreted by the Communists.</p>
   <p>The parents and the school delegates who will attend the conference must endeavor to eliminate by all possible means all politics and to be guided in the passing of resolutions only by the usefulness of these resolutions for the progress of the school work.</p>
   <p>The schools for children which do not belong to the Federation should join this Federation on equal terms with the other schools; but, of course, before joining they should insist on certain desirable <span class="page-break">7</span>changes to be made in the project of the laws of the Federation.</p>
   <p>The Communists must manifest their wisdom (Be ye wise like serpents), and prove, not by words only, but by deeds, that they really want to cooperate with all the workmen's organizations of the colony in the cause of unification.</p>
   <p>The efforts of the Communists to introduce politics into the schools will only prove once more to the Chicago toiling masses that wherever the Communists make their appearance they create dissensions and petty disputes.</p>
   <p>Chicago workers in the field of education, let us work more and give less room to passions! Let us prove that we are able not only to wish, but also to convert our wishes into living realities.</p>
   <p>It is time, high time, for us to unite.</p>
