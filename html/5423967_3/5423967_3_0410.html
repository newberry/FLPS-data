   <p>The same delegates who attended the second session were present; also the delegate Tureyko of the Cicero School. As to the pedagogic side of the schools, it was found that during the current school year almost all the teachers managed their work well and were really good instructors. This was ascertained during this session of the Convention.</p>
   <p>The tactics of some of the teachers were discussed. All introduction of politics into the schools was condemned.</p>
   <p>After that the school discipline and the report of the Enlightenment Committee were discussed.</p>
   <p>After some discussion the report was approved. It was mentioned that in this school year discipline was tolerably good in all schools, <span class="page-break">2</span>especially in the schools where the teachers Mornel and Voronko have been teaching. As to discipline the same recommendation was adopted which had been uttered at the previous Convention.</p>
   <p>Item 12: Concerning the courses for general education and for teachers planned by the Federation. It was unanimously resolved to commit the opening of these courses to the care of the next School Council. The Convention finds that these courses are very necessary in view of the fact that this year about 25 pupils have graduated from the schools.</p>
   <p>As to the founding of a Pan-American Federation of Russian Schools for children, the Convention resolved unanimously (two persons abstained from voting) to issue an appeal to all Russian schools for children in America, committing to the care of a special committee the putting into execution this resolution. The technical part of this work of unification should be entrusted to the next School Council.</p>
