   <p>In questionnaires filed by applicants for various positions, the question: whether the applicant has ever been under arrest is included. The Soviet citizens in this connection jokingly remark: "Have you ever been arrested, and, if not, why not; or, if you have not spent time in jail, you will do it yet."</p>
   <p>And so they go to jails en masse, by the thousands. The Soviet Government wages a continuous fight against first one group and then another, exterminating each one as "a class". First, czarist officials were the victims; next came the aristocrats, bourgeoisie, nobility, and officers of the former <span class="page-break">2</span>army. Of course, not all were victimized--only the most active ones suffered the penalty of the group or of the class and those who had influence in the group and played the role of leaders.</p>
   <p>After the leaders and active members are destroyed the sense of group solidarity is also destroyed and any such group is regarded as disarmed and harmless insofar as the Soviet authority is concerned. When the switch to collectivism was made the same method of fighting the opposition among the peasants was employed. In the village the peasant resistance was crushed by brute force under the pretense of destroying the kulaks as a class. This hunting down of human beings in Soviet Russia never ceases.</p>
   <p>Since 1927 the blows of the Soviet authority have been directed mainly against the intellectuals and peasants. Today they are persecuting the children's doctors. Why? Somewhere, somehow, epidemics of scarlet fever spread among <span class="page-break">3</span>the children; but in the U.S.S.R., according to the degrees promulgated by the Bolsheviks, no epidemics should occur. Such epidemics never occur in the capitalist countries and there must be, according to Bolshevik reasoning, much less cause for children's dying from epidemics in the U.S.S.R., for the proletarian state supposedly provides ideal medical help for those who need it. If, however, epidemics do occur, the children's doctors are regarded as deliberate harmdoers and are punished or persecuted as such.</p>
   <p>They arrest veterinarians. Why? What for? Somewhere, somehow, epidemic diseases spread among the cattle and the animals begin to die en masse. And as you know, all sorts of epidemics in the U.S.S.R. are strictly forbidden. Again, it means that deliberate evildoers are at work. Veterinarians are, sure enough, poisoning the cattle. And so they fall under the ax.</p>
   <p>On similar, or as flimsy and wild, pretexts as these they arrest agricultural <span class="page-break">4</span>experts, historians, chemists, engineers, etc. They arrest, of course, people entirely innocent of the alleged crimes. But once you are in the hands of the Gay-Pay-Oo there is no escape and you must be made into a criminal. Of course, there is no evidence whatsoever to prove that you are a deliberate evildoer; you have not committed the crime attributed to you; on the contrary, you have performed your duties according to the dictates of your conscience. But the Gay-Pay-Oo agent says you are a criminal and you must confess your "crime". "If you don't do it willingly, we will force your confession."</p>
   <p>In what manner do Bolshevik inquisitors force the confession from the arrested victim? First of all, he or she is placed in a cell jammed to overflowing with other victims. In a cell designed to hold only twenty-eight men they jam, for instance, one hundred and ten men. They sleep on the floor, on and under the bunks, packed like sardines, without a chance to turn over without disturbing a neighbor. The windows must be kept open even during severe frosts <span class="page-break">5</span>for fear of suffocation. The rain and snow fall on those that sleep near the windows. The pound of bread given to the victim is insufficient to maintain life. Soup is no better than dish water. Barley soup was nicknamed "buckshot" soup.</p>
   <p>Insufficient nourishment is designed to weaken the victim physically. As a result, an unavoidable and terrifying case of scurvy develops, making the victim a helpless invalid oblivious and indifferent to all. Such a condition is used to advantage by the Bolshevik persecutors and they force the victim to sign a "confession".</p>
   <p>Agents of the Gay-Pay-Oo are not averse to employing still other and more inhuman and cruel inquisitions in their attempts to force "confessions". They make no distinction between the really criminal element and political criminals of their prisons. Political prisoners are incarcerated with bandits, thieves, prostitutes, and in contagious wards.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Professor Cherniavin, for instance, Madame Cherniavin's husband, was incarcerated with two bandits who were later shot by the Bolshevik executioners. He became friendly with the bandits and found out that they were not altogether bad men, not worse than the Bolsheviks themselves. When he refused to sign the "confession" the Bolsheviks arrested his wife in order that she might influence her "obstinate" husband. She was placed in a cell together with a woman thief and a prostitute suffering with a social disease. All her protests to the prison administration were of no avail. The prison physician declared that she might avoid infection by being careful.</p>
   <p>Bolsheviks also resort to still another more terrifying and inhuman method of forcing "confessions". In their prisons they have hot and cold cells. Madame Cherniavin knows of a case where the victim, an intellectual in this case, was forced to sign a "confession" after his wife and daughter were placed in a hot casemate. He was given an opportunity to watch through a hole how his wife and daughter were being suffocated after they were stripped <span class="page-break">7</span>naked. They were crawling on the floor seeking a breath of fresh air. After they have been reduced to a state of semiconsciousness the victims are transferred to a cold cell. Such change from hot to cold cells is repeated several times. Only a few victims with exceptionally strong will power can overcome such tortures and suffering and still refuse to sign "confessions". A preponderant majority succumb, give in and sign on the dotted line. These "confessions" later are introduced as prima facie evidence against the accused. Most of the verdicts are handed down in the absence of the offender.</p>
   <p>The Soviet prison population has now reached an enormous figure. This is truly a Soviet "accomplishment". According to Madame Cherniavin, the Svirsk concentration camp holds 50,000 victims; the Belomorsk-Baltiyski camp (on the canal construction job), 250,000 prisoners, of whom 180,000 remained in confinement after completion of the work; the Solovki camp holds 200,000; the Dmitrovski, 80,000; the Amur-Baikal camp, engaged in building a new railway to the Pacific coast, employs 800,000 prisoners. Madame Cherniavin <span class="page-break">8</span>has no figures for the number of prisoners in other concentration camps, such as Votkins (for men and women), Samarsk, Uralsk, Cheliabinsk, Obdorsk, Eniseysk, Irkutsk, Far Eastern, and others.</p>
   <p>The conditions under which the camp prisoners live are horrifying. They are forced to work sixteen hours a day. The day of rest falls only on every tenth day. They live in frame barracks and in some camps in dugouts or shelters improvised from tree branches; and all this takes place in latitudes of the far north, in places far beyond the Arctic Circle. Snow falls into the barracks, each of which shelters one thousand prisoners. Each inmate is allowed only fifty square centimeters of space. One must sleep on the side. Prisoners are given two pounds of bread a day. In the morning breakfast consists of porridge so thin that "one grain chases after another with a stick"; for dinner, and then only at times, a piece of putrid camel meat is given, besides a muddy, malodorous soup.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>According to Madame Cherniavin the concentration camps in the U.S.S.R. contain at least two million outlawed Soviet slaves. The peasants are in the preponderant majority, but there are intellectuals also.</p>
   <p>Inmates in the camps die by the thousands, but this fact does not disturb the Bolsheviks at all. They say that 180,000,000 people are at their disposal; one million of prematurely dead people is of no importance to them.</p>
   <p>The men sent to the camps by the Bolsheviks are, according to Madame Cherniavin, indispensable to them as free labor on the numerous construction jobs undertaken by the Soviet authority, and this is the only reason for the camps' existence. The Bolsheviks are in need of architects, engineers, and other specialists, and why should they pay salaries when it is only necessary to declare a man a criminal, put him under arrest and make him work gratis?</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>After the lecture several questions were asked Madame Cherniavin, to which the lecturer gave proper answers.</p>
   <p>Summing all this up one may state that the young generation in the U.S.S.R. is being brought up outside of religion, even though one should not infer that religion was destroyed or forgotten. It has taken on new forms which the Bolsheviks cannot stamp out. There are many Jews in the concentration camps. Bolsheviks have created a strong state machine and it cannot be crushed unless war or some other calamity intervenes and helps to overthrow the hated regime.</p>
   <p>Madame Cherniavin does not attempt to predict what will come to replace Bolshevism, but tells us that the Russian people are searching in earnest for new ways of life since the old ones have been discarded entirely. The lecture was attended by many intellectuals among whom one could not but notice His Grace, <span class="page-break">11</span>Bishop Leonty of the Russian church, and guests who came from Gary, Kenosha, and other near-by towns. The talented woman was very warmly received by the Chicago audience.</p>
