   <p>Personal. Mr. Nicolay Ivanovich Kozak was born in Russia, in the Province of Grodno. He received his elementary education in a Russian parochial school and improved it by reading and attending various lectures. He never had enough leisure to be able to attend any classes in a high school or college. He is a thoroughly "self-made" man. Mr. Kozak came to Chicago when he was 18 years old and has resided here since 1908, working as a linotype operator in the printing shop pf the daily Svobodnaya Rossiya (Free Russia), and in that of the Russkii Viestnik (Russian Herald), when it was still owned by Mr. Gugis. He is doing now the same kind of work in a Ukrainian printing shop, and devotes his spare time to his work as secretary of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. He has held the office of secretary of this society from 1912 to 1920 and again from 1928 until the present (1936).</p>
