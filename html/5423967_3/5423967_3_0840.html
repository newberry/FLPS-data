   <p>Mr. Chernov's second lecture took place on April 14, 1929, at the Douglas Park Auditorium. His theme was "Fascism and Bolshevism." This lecture was also a great success.</p>
   <p>By his masterly exposition of this subject and by the interesting facts with which he illustrated his statements, Mr. Chernov held the audience spellbound to such an extent that the Bolsheviki who had come to this lecture with the intention of protesting and causing a disturbance forgot all about it and just listened.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chernov's lecture lasted more than two hours. His criticism of Fascism and Bolshevism was crushing. He proved by numerous quotations from Bolshevist and Fascist publications, quite conclusively, that in spite of an apparent contrast between Bolshevism and Fascism, there is a certain spiritual affinity between these two systems. Both these <span class="page-break">2</span>movements are characterized by an absence of faith in the creative capacities of the people and by a denial of the right of the people to freely manifest their will. This leads to the crushing of all freedom and to the establishment of a party or personal dictatorship. "Obey as if you were a living corpse," such is the meaning of both the Fascist and the Bolshevist dictatorships. Under both regimes there is no freedom of opinion, even for the highest officials. The will of Stalin or of Mussolini is supreme. Zinoviev, who had incurred the displeasure of Stalin, used the following expressions in characterizing his own progeny, the dictatorship: "One can criticize the party's politics -- after one has made his will."</p>
   <p>On the evening of the same day there was a banquet at the Morrison Hotel in honor of Mr. Chernov. About 150 guests were present. Representatives of several social organizations made speeches.</p>

   <p>On April 20, 1929, Mr. V. Chernov gave his third lecture, this time at the Mirror Hall. The subject was "The National Question and Its Economic Foundation."</p>
   <p>In this lecture Mr. Chernov expounded the following theses: At the present time there is going on the formation of great amalgamations of of capitalistic enterprises which are being unified into trusts, syndicates and large concerns. Thus in Europe there exists a Franco-German steel trust which controls the European market. This trust competes in the world market with the American and English steel trusts.</p>
   <p>The various large financial and economic amalgamated capitalistic concerns, having an international character, are a threat to the separate countries. Not everyone of the latter acting separately can withstand the onslaught of these large amalgamated concerns. Hence, there arises <span class="page-break">4</span>a danger, especially for the small countries, - the danger of losing their independence. In order to counter-act this danger, it is necessary that there should arise between nations and states alliances based on common interests.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. Chernov holds that Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finnland, and even Poland, countries which have become separated from Russia economically, have lost very much because of that. The ports of the Baltic Sea, for instance, are dead now; the industry of the Baltic republics, having lost the large Russian market, is in a precarious position, etc. But all these economic losses are more than compensated by the advantages of an independent national existence which insures to these states the possibility of a cultural and political development.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Mr. Chernov believes that the old way of solving national questions, -by artificially keeping all the non-Russian nationalities as parts of the USSR and forcing them to submit to violence, -is an outlived, harmful and dangerous policy. The USSR should be organized as a federation, and the alliance of the nations forming this federation should be voluntary, based on a free mutual agreement. If some nationality would find it undesirable to remain in this federation, it should be allowed to secede from it.</p>
   <p>Separatist movements, according to Mr. Chernov's view, arise unavoidably when one large nationality oppresses a smaller and less powerful one. And when such oppression becomes weaker, the separatist movement among the smaller nationality is also weakened in the same degree. It is quite possible that if Bolshevism would not be the ruling power in Russia, if the people had enjoyed complete freedom, and if the non-Russian nationalities had been considered as having equal rights with the Russians, they <span class="page-break">6</span>might not have seceded from Russia. The oppression of smaller nationalities, according to Mr. Chernov's view, does not make a country stronger, but, on the contrary, weakens it and often is the cause of great catastrophes. The World War, as we know, arose because of the oppression of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austro-Hungary. Only the unconditional recognition of the right of every nationality to enjoy equal rights and equal consideration with all other nationalities can result in a peaceful neighborly life and cooperation of all nations.</p>
