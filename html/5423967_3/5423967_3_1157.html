   <p>The proverb, "In union there is strength," does not meet with any objections, and yet it is not being carried into effect. As it is easy to dissolve unity, so is it difficult to realize it.</p>
   <p>We remember how much effort was required in order to accomplish the unification of Roova [Translator's note: Russian United Mutual Aid Society in America] in 1926. At present the same problem confronts us in uniting all the Russian mutual aid societies into one single strong organization.</p>
   <p>When this depression severely hit the individual societies, they painfully felt the blow and began to realize the necessity for support from somewhere during "the capricious turn in their lives," and they began to speak of the need of close co-operation. Three years ago this idea was broached at the <span class="page-break">2</span>convention of the Orthodox Mutual Aid Society and met with response and sympathetic acceptance from the Society of Russian Brotherhoods and the United Orthodox Societies.</p>
   <p>The idea has not died. It has for a long time been recognized in Wilkes-Barre, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia. The central committees of the organizations located in those three centers quite frequently exchange opinions on this subject, but still no steps so far have been taken toward making the unity an accomplished fact. Why?</p>
   <p>As always in such cases, the determination is lacking to put the matter squarely and openly before the annual conventions. The necessary initiative is also lacking. The men at the head of the mutual aid societies lack the courage and are afraid of the various technical difficulties.</p>
   <p>Of course, there were and are certain obstacles in the way of unity, but since the idea has been recognized as useful, nobody should be afraid of <span class="page-break">3</span>the difficulties or deterred by fear from acting upon it. It is time to take concrete practical steps toward its realization. The sooner we approach the task in a practical way, the nearer the day will be when unity among Russian mutual aid societies will be an accomplished fact. This is the most important task which at present confronts all Russian mutual aid societies. Who, then, will be the first to approach the problem in a practical way and make a start toward the realization of the idea of unity?</p>
   <p>Should not the Russian Mutual Aid Society be the one to take upon its shoulders this important and difficult task? For several years Roova in a practical way has worked out and considered questions bound up with the idea of unification. The Society has carried on conversations with RMOV and R.I.M.A.S. These first steps were not crowned with success, but they gave practical preparation and revealed the difficulties standing in the way and the means to overcoming them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The experience thus gained makes it possible for Roova without further delay to approach the problem in a practical way, to take the initiative in driving at a common goal, and to issue a call to other mutual aid societies with an appeal to take part in the work.</p>
   <p>Let there be enemies. We should not fear them. Let there be difficulties. We should not hesitate before them.</p>
   <p>Once the idea is recognized as the correct one, it should be brought to a practical realization by common effort. A good beginning means that half the job is done. No one will find fault with Roova if the Society takes the initiative. No one will reproach it if the task undertaken is not solved so quickly as is desirable.</p>
   <p>Let us go ahead! In union there is strength!</p>
