   <p>On Dec. 15, 1935, an annual meeting of St. Ann's Sisterhood was held, at which a new executive committee was elected.</p>
   <p>At this meeting many important questions were decided, the decisions being obligatory on all members.</p>
   <p>An appeal is made to all members of the Sisterhood to take an active part in the campaign for attracting new members into the organization, and of signing up children of the mothers who already belong to the Sisterhood.</p>
   <p>At present R.I.M.A.S. [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society] offers very advantageous terms of insurance for new members, and new beneficial policies for the old members who desire to change their form of insurance.</p>
