   <p>Every young man beginning seriously to observe life and the activities of persons and groups of persons with whom he comes in frequent contact is, naturally enough, glad to see energy, activity, and prosperity emanating from those around him. A Russian benefit society or any Russian organization which is successful in its work and uses modern methods in conducting its affairs attracts the young Russian-American generation, and usually succeeds in winning the support and co-operation of the youth in furthering its work. On the other hand, when the young Russian-Americans see an organization of their fathers retrogress because of backwardness and lack of modern methods of conducting business, they lose their interest in the affairs of such an organization. We may even go further and say that for similar reasons they generally shun the affairs of the older generation, and try to forge their own weapons for success and a fuller life.</p>
   <p>There is little in the Russian organizations to attract the young Russian-American generation, whether from a spiritual or a material point of view. The things which interest the Russian immigrants in America cannot interest their American-born children. The American way of life sharply differs from that of the old Russian immigrants in this country. American public life and business life are based on modern ideas and are conducted according to modern methods, while Russian life in America still follows, with very few changes, the old Russian traditions and habits of thought. The sons and daughters of Russian immigrants, inspired with American standards of life and American ways of doing things--through their American schools, their American newspapers, and their American associations--look down upon, scorn, and criticize their fathers' organizations, together with all the quarrels, the gossip, and the political twaddle of their elders.</p>
   <p>The cause of the estrangement and isolation of the Russian-American youth from the activities and interests of the older generation lies not in the fact that the parents have failed to instil in their children the spirit of Russian culture, but in the fact that the parents stand still, rooted to one spot, and do not strive to make any progress here in America. The Russian-American young generation, on the other hand, does not stand still but strives to forge ahead. Our youth join the American organizations, where there is more life and more light.</p>
   <p>Mutual aid societies and the political and social organizations of other national groups in America long ago adopted modern methods with the most favorable results, the first and most important of which was the ability to hold their sons and daughters within the pale of the organizations of their fathers. The Russian organizations have failed to introduce modern business methods into their activities, with the result that some of them have ceased to exist.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is now engaged in introducing wide reforms into its entire work, thus fulfilling the decisions of the last convention of the delegates of all the branches of the organization. As a result of these reforms, our youth is rallying now to the banner raised by their fathers. New types of insurance have been introduced that are well adapted to the needs of our children. A Russian high school will be established soon. More grammar schools will be opened. One of the decisions of the convention was that the organization acquire suitable farm property which could be used as a shelter and a home of rest for the aged members of the organization. Our youth is also interested in the farm as a place suitable for outdoor recreation.</p>
   <p>When all the planned reforms and improvements have been put into practice, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society will become many times stronger than it is now, and its ranks will be swelled by a new army of our sons and daughters, who will find in the Society a broad field for many activities usually very attractive to all young women in America.</p>
