   <p>A person paying his entrance fee of fifty cents is considered a member.</p>
   <p>Note 1. Anyone desiring to become a member must leave his name with the secretary or financial secretary. His name is announced at the next general membership meeting. If there is no protest, the registered person is considered a member of the Economic Club.</p>
   <p>Note 2. In case of a protest the admission of the person applying is postponed until consideration by the committee of the propriety and seriousness of the protest. Members failing to pay dues for three months are notified by the financial secretary through the mail. A reply received within a week from the time of mailing is read at the next general membership meeting.</p>
   <p>Note 3. The treasurer reports to the general membership all notices mailed to members in arrears and the results of these notices.</p>
   <p>The treasury of the club. The funds of the club consist of the membership entrance fees of fifty cents and monthly dues of twenty-five cents, and returns from lectures, debates, parties, concerts, enterprises and voluntary contributions. Supplementary to Note 1: Dues start from the day of admittance.</p>
   <p>Rights and duties of members. A member who has paid dues for a period of three months has a right in case of need to ask the organization for assistance. The sum loaned the needy member must be repaid. Loans are given when two members of the club act as guarantors. The amount of the loan depends upon the size of the treasury, but must not exceed $10. Ten per cent of all incomes are earmarked for the special expense fund.</p>
   <p>Note: In case of a strike or serious illness, a member may receive a loan when having two guarantors, previous to the designated three-month period. In case the treasury is exhausted, money necessary for regular expenses may be drawn from the special fund.</p>
   <p>Loans of sums to members of the club, accompanied by two guarantor members of the club to avoid unnecessary delays, are considered extra expenses. Should the extra expense bring the amount on hand to an excess of five per cent of the monthly income, then the excess for a period of three months is put into the treasury of the club.</p>
   <p>All matters of importance are taken up and decided at regular membership meetings. There are regular and special meetings. Special meetings are called to amend or to complete one or several points of the constitution, in case of election of members, of a committee, treasurer, or secretary, and in cases when the general meeting deems it necessary. A regular meeting is considered legal when there are not less than fifteen members present.</p>
   
   <p>Note: In case of absence of the designated number of members, the secretary informs these persons of the date of the next regular meeting which is considered legal, if not less than fifteen members are present. Regular meetings are held twice a month on days appointed by the general membership meeting.</p>
   <p>By the general membership meeting a cashier is elected who keeps all monies of the club.</p>
   <p>The cashier gives out money only when ordered by the secretary and the financial secretary.</p>
   <p>A special meeting is considered legal when one third of the membership is present.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary may receive from the cashier a sum not exceeding $5.</p>
   
   <p>Note: Should one third of the membership fail to be present at a special meeting, then the secretary notifies the general membership of a meeting for the following week. All matters of the club are decided by a majority of those present and voting.</p>
   <p>Changes of committees and amendments are made by two thirds of the membership present.</p>
   <p>The membership committee may raise the question of a special meeting. In order to carry out the activities of the organization effectively, a committee of seven persons is selected every three months.</p>
   <p>From the seven the membership elects one financial secretary and a cashier.</p>
   
   <p>The duty of the financial secretary is to keep a correct account of all income and expenses of the club. In case of special expenses, the cashier pays out money only when signed by the entire committee.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary reports once a month on the state of the treasury.</p>
   <p>The committee reports to the general membership concerning its activities and plans. The committee meets not less than twice a month.</p>
