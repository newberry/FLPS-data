   <p>For many of our Russian colonists, the problem of having a collective farm does not seem very important. Many people think that since the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society of America, Roova, bought the farm at the Society's expense, it alone should make all the necessary improvements; it should erect the necessary buildings, assure a supply of good water, etc. And if the Society succeeds in putting the farm into good shape, these people are willing to visit the farm, to look it over, and to express their gratitude for the work done. But if they happen to find the farm not to their liking, they will be more than ready to blame the Society for any faults. In reality, the collective farm should be regarded in a different light. The farm was purchased and is being improved not for the members of the Society alone. It is meant to serve the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>needs of all the Russians who, for one reason or another, have to live on a farm.</p>
   <p>Even now the farm office receives many applications from people who want to live on the farm. Some of these people are in bad health; some are unemployed and destitute, and are willing to work on the farm and thus escape the economic hardships of city life; some, adjudged to be paupers, without any means of subsistence, are a burden on the relief organizations and are threatened with deportation.</p>
   <p>The farm is still far from ready to accomodate the applicants, although their number is growing with each passing day. The farm, for instance, cannot give shelter to the aged because the home for them has not yet been built. The land has not yet been prepared to receive the unemployed who are willing to work on the farm. The farm administration has had to reject the applicants--only because the farm is not ready to receive them. The work on the buildings and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>on preparing the land for cultivation is delayed only because there is not enough money being received to finance the work.</p>
   <p>Roova has appealed to the Russian colony to collect the necessary funds for this purpose. There were, however, two applicants whom the farm could not possibly reject. One case involved a woman who had been committed to an insane asylum, and was later to be deported. She is not a member of the Society, but her husband, who had brought her and the children to the United States five years ago, is a member of one of the branches. He appealed to the Society for help. The Society sent its own attorney to the asylum to release the woman on condition that she be given shelter on the farm. The woman was a perfectly normal human being. Her only trouble was that she was very nervous and could not make herself understood in English. Had it not been for the farm, the unfortunate woman would have been deported.</p>
   <p>The other case concerned a seventy-five year-old man, who found himself destitute <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>in the city. He had belonged to various Russian organizations for thirty years. He begged to be accepted on the farm for some kind--any kind--of work. This old man had to be helped. There are many such cases among the Russian colonists in Chicago, New York, and other large cities. Why then does the Russian colony regard them with indifference? Why don't the Russians send contributions to help this farm, to build it up, to improve it in every way? Why shouldn't the Russian colony offer an asylum to a woman who was considered insane only because she could not speak English? Why aren't those Russian colonists whose hearts have not turned to stone, eager to participate in the building of a collective farm? Why don't they become shareholders in the farm co-operative and raise the money necessary to improve the farm, to erect new buildings, and other facilities? The farm should be large enough for all of us. Would it be impossible to find one or two thousand men among the Russians--active sympathizers for this noble cause--who would be willing to buy at least one share? The shares cost only ten dollars a piece. This small sum will not ruin anybody financially and will benefit the whole Russian colony. Members of other <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>nationalities contribute to such causes. What right have we to lag behind other nationalities in such matters, to neglect our helpless compatriots, and permit them to endure privations? Who are we, and where are we--those of us who shout constantly about socialism and communism? What do we do in a practical way? Isn't it time that we realized that talk accomplishes nothing. We should all put our shoulders to the wheel, and should take active part in improving our farm. We can express our humanitarian spirit in this type of work. The progress of the Russian colony depends on it. "One thread from each and the naked man will receive a shirt."</p>
   <p>Purchase shares and help to improve the farm and to finish the job as soon as possible. By doing this, you will help yourself and your compatriots.</p>
