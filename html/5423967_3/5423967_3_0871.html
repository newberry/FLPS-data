   <p>The lecture on the theme "Evolution" which was arranged in the Russian Center in Chicago attracted a big audience. The announcer, Mr. D. L. Orlovsky, in his introductory speech mentioned that an account of the desire of many in the audience to participate in the discussion, he decided to make his opening address short. Mr. Orlovsky defended Darwin's theory very skilfully. One of the strongest of his opponents was Mr. A. G. Ilyin, who proved that it is possible to be attracted by Darwin's theory and in the same time to believe in God. Many others participated in the same discussion. </p>
