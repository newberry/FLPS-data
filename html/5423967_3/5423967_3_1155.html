   <p>Last Saturday, with I. Pianitsa as chairman, the regular meeting of the board of directors of R. I. M. A. S. was held.</p>
   <p>At the meeting several important matters were considered, and important decisions were taken. From the reports submitted it was clear that the Society continues to grow, to gain strength, and to develop its activity in various directions.</p>
   <p>In the month of January fifty new members joined the Society. Particularly successful in its work is Branch Number Fourteen in Detroit. Last Saturday we informed our readers that the branch in Kenosha is also growing very rapidly.</p>
   <p>In connection with the general situation it was decided to send travelling <span class="page-break">\2</span>organizers to near-by cities. In a few days G. Volos, N. Kozak, secretary of the Society, and S. Vakimovich will leave the city for this purpose.</p>
   <p>The directors confirmed their previous decision to the effect that mortgage loans may be made only on small dwelling houses.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to send official representatives of the Society to Kenosha for the opening of the new branch.</p>
