   <p>"The School Federation shall not fall into the hands of counter-Revolutionists, opportunists and massacre promoters. Chicagoans, as formerly, will raise high the banner of national culture and will serve as an noble example to other regions."</p>
   <p>We have regained our Federation. "The White Russian workers," Voronko and Zmagar transferred from the Russian Vietnik to the New York Rassviet where the Federation after the third convention was called "The Living Corpse," "Dead Work," etc. This barking no longer disturbs us. Our work was sailing on--peacefully, quietly, without any symptoms of White Guard Fascist opposition. On November 27, 1932 the Federation celebrated the 10-year Jubilee of its existence with a grand ball at the Ukrainian Workers' Home in Chicago. Motivated by this, we have then written in the Novy Mir giving the enemies of the Federation their due. "This selected rubbish, filth, which swam upon the surface of the waves of the October Revolution and has been carried away over the ocean; these little people, full of lies and envy and fear, carefully concealing under masks, shining with "education" and having at their disposal Viestniks and Rassviets printed patterns of perverted human conscience--they have been digging into our organization, with intent to dissolve and destroy it, in order to create for themselves groups of trusting obedient sheep and, for the glory of a "Holy Russia" to live on them. But they have not succeeded. The Jubilee on the 27th of November, was the celebration of our victory, and a "thorn in the side" of our enemies.</p>
   <p>"Children from the various parts of our city and suburbs, in the presence of the Russian Workers. Colony who filled the hall of the Ukrainian Workers' Home to overflowing, have beautifully carried out a three hour program and besides, not in an international language as our enemies might say it, but in good Russian language; but the program--and 100% Soviet."</p>
   
   <p>"Regardless of all attempts of the enemies of the Federation, the latter, as well as the schools composing the Federation, have gained the solid ground of sincere workers' cultural organizations."</p>
   <p>"This--the work of conscious workers' of the schools, the teachers' as well as the members' of the school organizations; this is the work of text books, composed not to create slaves of capital, but for the rearing of a generation of healthy and free defenders of Labor and Truth; this, at last, is the work of our enemies proper who by their injury gave us an opportunity, and by unmasking, showed their perverted faces to the Russian Workers' masses."</p>
   <p>The Federation of Russian Childrens' Schools of the City of Chicago and Suburbs, look back with pride upon the 13 1/2 years of productive activity and is preparing for its 14th consecutive convention. At present it is composed of the following workers' schools: 1) A Childrens' School in memory of L. N. Tolstoi (Previously Douglas Park); 2) A Childrens' School in Brighton Pk.; 3) A Childrens' School in memory of F. M. Dostoewsky (Previously North Side); 4) A Childrens' School in memory of Maksim Gorky (Previously Wicker Park); 5) A Childrens' School and School for Adults in Pullman (which emerged from the previous school in memory of Pushkin); 6) A Childrens' School in Argo; 7) A Childrens' School in memory of N. A. Nekrasov in Chicago; 8) A High School for Post Supporters of the Childrens' Schools in Douglas Park; and 9) The Russian Workers' National University on Division Street.</p>
   <p>In all these schools at present there are approximately 150 students. This, of course, is a very small number, in comparison with the number of students in our schools, 8, 10 and 12 years ago. But this may explained.</p>
   <p>The Russian immigrants, who arrived here 20, 25 or even 30 years ago, had few children of school age. The first supporters of our schools have long ago themselves become family people.</p>
