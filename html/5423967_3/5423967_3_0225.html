   <p>The main responsibility of the Executive Committee was the setting up of a school curriculum and equipment of the Federation's schools with textbooks befitting workers' schools.</p>
   <p>For such at that time a dire need was felt; the books on hand positively did not fill that need.</p>
   <p>Several successful parties during the winter of 1922-23 put the federation on its feet financially. This presented an opportunity for equipping the schools with more instructive textbooks, which were ordered from the New York bookstore of Novyi Mir. In 1924 textbooks were ordered from Moscow, and the crisis was thus ended.</p>

   <p>In general, after the first school conference our school work went uphill and was conducted as well as could be expected under the circumstances. In the summer of 1923 the Russian workers' colony of Chicago witnessed a great cultural celebration of the federation. The first Russian workers' school in America, the South Side School in Chicago, had its first graduation of those completing the course of study in accordance with the program of 1922.</p>
   <p>From this school graduated children who at present are adults, family people: Michael Krasarin, Boris Kutniuk, Andrei Kudelka, Olga Marchuk, Vira Solorey, Stepanida Voyteshuk and Anna Zeroniuk.</p>
   <p>They were the blossoms and pride of the South Side School. Three of the graduates, Marchuk, Solorey and Voyteshuk later became teachers <span class="page-break">3</span>in these schools and have proven to be a great asset.</p>
   <p>The examinations continued for five days, from June 25 up to and including June 29. The examiners were outsiders specially invited; the opera singer and coach Nikolai Karlash; a person well known in the Russian colony of America, the artist Anatoli Pokatilor; and a person then new in the Chicago colony, Anton Zmaran. It was conducted, of course, in the presence of representatives of the federation of teachers of the South Side School and members of the South Side School Organization.</p>
   <p>The exams were given for the following subjects: (1) Russian language (dictation, reading, recitation of what was read, grammar, etymology, syntax and poetry); (2) History of Russian literature <span class="page-break">4</span>and current events; (3) Arithmetic, written and oral; (4) Geography of Union of Socialist Soviet Republics; and (5) Russian history.</p>
   <p>The results of the examination were as follow: Out of 70 taking the exams the averages were 36 A's, 31 B's and 3 C's.</p>
   <p>These averages are a clear indication of what children could accomplish in Russian workers schools in America, despite such unfavorable conditions.</p>
   <p>At that time there were no misunderstandings within the school federation, no disagreements. School work was progressing on the entire front.</p>
   <p>Toward the fall of 1923 other schools were organized and joined the federation: one in Pullman, another in Fullerton Avenue, in Chicago, <span class="page-break">5</span>in the vicinity of the Deering farm implement factory, where at that time many Russians worked.</p>
   <p>A group of workers separated from the Fullerton School created a new school on Elston Avenue.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, at that time a small school in Rockdale and a school at the section of the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia in Gary had closed. Children's classes at the section of the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia in Chicago have formed a new school at Wicker Park.</p>
   <p>Thus in the federation there remained seven schools ideally and economically more powerful than the other seven schools created by the federation in 1922.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In 1923 the number of students grew from 400 to 500.</p>
   <p>But in the fall of 1923 there began a struggle within the federation which has strongly and for a long time hampered the further development of our school work.</p>
   <p>The story is quite extensive, but we are compelled to pause at the most important episodes.</p>
