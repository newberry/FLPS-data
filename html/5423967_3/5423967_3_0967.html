   <p>The society 'Prosvieshchenie' believes in the necessity of a radical change in modern social relations between men, in the necessity of the establishment of a social order founded on the principles of social justice, cooperation and democracy instead of the existing social chaos founded on violence, autocracy and exploitation. The society, nevertheless, believes that any radical change of the modern social relations among men depends on raising the common level and the development of the consciousness of the masses, and on social evolution, not on the parties and their theories. To help this uplift, this development of the consciousness of the masses , to achieve this result under the conditions of our complicated social evolution, within the limits of the problems set forth; and to be guided by the principles of perfect tolerance and freedom of thought while doing such work, - such is the platform on which the society Prosvieshchenie stands at present and from which it makes its appeal to the Russian colony in America.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the society Prosvieshchenie was Z. Lossieff. The auditor of the branch of the society is U. Wulbert. The society Prosvieshchenie was organized February 18, 1917. (See Russkaya Pochta, August 17, 1917.)</p>
