   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Will you be so kind as to give space in your paper to the letter which was sent by our branch to Branch 35 of the society RNOV?</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>T. Marchuk,</p>
   <p>Secretary, Branch 18,</p>
   <p>Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (RNzOV).</p>
   <p>Respected Fellow Citizens:</p>
   <p>Often your members and ours have expressed a desire that a debate be arranged between us, and that such a debate should be on the subject most vital to the Russians in Chicago. As you are well aware, there are two diametrically opposed views on the present realities of Russia.</p>
   <p>One faction--and the one that sways most members of your society--maintains that the U.S.S.R. is a country of farmers and workers, that a free society of the toiling people is being built there, that there is no longer any exploitation of man by man, and that all the natural resources of the country are controlled by the peasants and workers; consequently, all of us, both as Russians and as working people, should by all means help and defend the Communist party and the Soviet government and its regime in the R.S.S.R.</p>
   <p>Members of the society RNzOV in general, and our Branch 18 in particular, do not agree with these views held by your members. We maintain that workers and peasants in the U.S.S.R. enjoy no rights at all; that in the U.S.S.R. all rights, wealth, and privileges are enjoyed by only a small minority of the people, who call themselves members of the Communist party; that a most cruel dictatorship exists in the country; and that exploitation of man by man by the present rulers of Russia has developed to a degree and severity unknown even in the capitalist countries. In the U.S.S.R. every form of freedom was done away with, and, at the same time, every creative impulse among the working and peasant masses was extinguished.</p>
   <p>Consequently, as members of our branch say, we should regard the Soviet government of the U.S.S.R., not as a government of the workers and peasants, but as a government which is like every other despotic government, and the Communist party as not a party of workers, but as a clique of parasites. The aim of both is not to build up a free socialist society, but exploitation for the benefit of the party members and the government bureaucracy.</p>
   <p>Such, approximately, is the substance of the never-ending discussion which goes on between your members and ours. The disagreement always revolves around present-day Russian realities and what is being done there, what the economic and political status of the peasants and workers in the U.S.S.R. really is.</p>
   
   <p>Taking all this into consideration, Branch 18, at its regular business meeting, held on February 10, voted to challenge Branch 35 of the society RNOV to a debate. The subject of the dispute may be formulated as follows: "Have the Bolsheviks laid the foundation for a socialist society?" At the meeting it was proposed that a committee of five be appointed to make the necessary arrangements and to fix the rules of procedure. The committee has already arranged that the debate should take place on the premises of a neutral organization. The price of admission is to be fifteen cents. The two organizations should share equally in the costs and the money taken in. Two cashiers (one for each organization)should handle the money, and each club should appoint an equal number of men to keep order during the debate. There should be two chairmen, one from each side. The first speaker should also close the debate. Both sides should agree in advance to preserve order and quiet during the debate. If the challenge is accepted by Branch 35 we should be informed as to when and where your representatives will meet our committee in order to make the necessary arrangements.</p>
   <p>Waiting your favorable reply, we remain,</p>
   <p>Branch 18, RNzOV,</p>
   <p>T. Marchuk, secretary.</p>
