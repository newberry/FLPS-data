   <p>In Chicago many Russians live on the Northwest side between Fullerton and Belmont, and Cicero and Austin. They are people who bought their lots and homes in this new location and settled fairly and live comfortably.</p>
   <p>Not long ago a Russian woman, Mrs. Kachula, had an excellent idea of establishing a school for children in this district. "There are many of our children here," said Mrs. Kachula, "but there is no school for them." Without much pondering over the matter, she wrote an appeal and placed it in a newspaper, with the meaning: "Let's get together and open a school."</p>
   <p>And what happened? Up to the present time not one had answered her appeal. Is this not a great shame?</p>
