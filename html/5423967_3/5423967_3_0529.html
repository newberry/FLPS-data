   <p>The first consultation about the organization of a Russian People's University in Chicago took place on June 27, 1918, at the initiative of Professor S. I. Novakovsky. The following persons were present: Professor S. I. Novakovsky; the Russian consul general, Mr. A. M. Volkov; Archimandrite Mardariy Uskokovich; Mr. F. I. Bregovsky; Rev. Pieshkov, Rev. Zheltonoga; Mr. Prilla, engineer; Doctor Sahud, Doctor Spiegelglas; Mr. A. E. Lutnitsky, and General V. A. Yakhontov, who was at the time visiting Chicago.</p>
   <p>At this first meeting Professor Novakovsky, who was the first to raise the question as to the necessity of organizing a Russian People's University in Chicago, explained his views about this question and pointed out that it was necessary to start this undertaking immediately, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>because the Russian colony was in great need of education. Those who attended this consultation, after listening to Professor Novakovsky's report, exchanged their views about this subject.</p>
   <p>The meeting unanimously commended the idea of founding a Russian People's University in Chicago and resolved to form "an Initiative Group for the Foundation of a Russian People's University in Chicago." An executive committee was elected consisting of Professor Novakovsky, Mr. Prilla (engineer), Mr. M. N. Pollak, Rev. Pieshkov, Doctor Sahud, Mr. A. M. Volkov, Archimandrite Mardariy Uskokovich, Mr. I. M. Bregovsky (engineer), and Mr. A. E. Lutnitsky. This committee elected the following officers: Prof. S. I. Novakovsky, president; Mr. A. M. Volkov, treasurer; Mr. A. E. Lutnitsky, secretary. The entrance fee <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>collected formed the beginning of a fund for the foundation of a Russian People's University. The total sum collected was $64. The Initiative Group thus formed started on its labor of founding a university. During the period before July 10 the following persons joined this group: Mr. I. Erin, Mr. Sheinman, Professor Shcherbinin, and Mr. V. N. Fedorov.</p>
   <p>The meeting of the Initiative Group on July 10 was devoted to the discussion of the question of the relation of the Russian People's University to the commission which was being organized by the American government with the intention of sending it to Russia. It was decided to seek participation in this commission, and the following members were elected as candidates to be sent to Russia as representatives of the Russian People's University: Archimandrite Mardariy, Professor Novakovsky, Mr. M. N. Pollack, Mr. Prilla, engineer, and Mr. <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>I. M. Bregovsky, engineer. At the same time a report was written by Prof. S. I. Novakovsky and was sent to several official institutions in Washington. This report elucidated chiefly the educational needs of the Russian citizens, both in America and in Russia, who were bearing the heavy burden of the consequences of the war and the revolution. Among other things the report contained a project for organizing help for young Russian scientists. Briefly, this project can be summarized as follows: the "Fund for Help to Young Russian Scientists," having collected a certain sum of money, should send representatives to Russia for conducting negotiations with various colleges, proposing to them to select from among their students candidates which could be trained for professorship. The "Fund" undertakes to defray all the expenses of the students for transportation, lodging, board and tuition. Thus in two or three years Russia would have several hundred professors, lecturers and various specialists who could reinforce <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the decimated ranks of the Russian scientists and would also satisfy the needs of newly arising colleges. (Ed. Note: There is a note in the files on this report.)</p>
   <p>At the meetings that took place on the 10th and 16th of July, 1918, were discussed and accepted the by-laws of the Russian People's University, worked out by Professor Novakovsky. At the meeting of July 19th the name of the Initiative Group was changed to that of "Council of the Russian People's University," in accordance with the name mentioned in the by-laws which had been ratified. There was also elected at this meeting a provisional board of administration to take care of all matters until the time when the university would start its activities. The persons elected were Prof. S. I. Novakovsky, president; Dr. M. Sahud, vice-president; A. E. Lutnitsky, secretary; <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>A. M. Volkov, treasurer, and M. N. Pollak, chairman of the Section of Publications.</p>
   <p>The elected Provisional Board, in cooperation with the Council of the University, started on the preliminary work connected with the foundation of a university. From the time when the idea of the founding of a Russian People's University in Chicago was first discussed to the opening of the university there were held four meetings of the Initiative Group, nine meetings of the Council of the University and two meetings of the commissions.</p>
   <p>On October 5, 1918, took place the formal inauguration of the Russian People's University in Chicago. This inauguration was attended by about three hundred and fifty persons. Professor Novakovsky, as <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>president of the Provisional Board, made a speech of welcome, pointing out the necessity of having at that particular time a university as a center of general education for the people. He expressed the hope that this university would have a splendid future. After Professor Novakovsky, speeches were made by Mr. S. Piotrovski, representative of the Polish People's University; Professor Litman, of the University of Illinois; Archimandrite Mardariy Uskokovich, Doctor Sahud, Mr. I. Erin, president of the society "Znaniye"; Mr. Zhuchko, representative of the Social-Democratic Club; Mr. M. N. Pollack, representative of the Union of Russian Young People, and Mr. S. O.

   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>On October 10th, as the studies had to be started at the university and the term of the authority given to the Provisional Board had expired, the club "Znanie" kindly allowed the use of its headquarters for the purpose of giving explanations to the members of the club about the purposes of the newly founded Russian People's University. On October 20, 1918, took place the first meeting of students at the temporary headquarters of the Russian university, at the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, 2559 S. Michigan Avenue.</p>

   <p>When the question as to the best location for the permanent headquarters of the Russian People's University was discussed, it was found out that the great majority of the students desired that the headquarters should be located on the Northwest side of the city, in the vicinity of Division Street, Milwaukee Avenue and Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>As an epidemic of influenza was raging at that time, the local authorities had prohibited all evening classes. Because of that it was decided to have classes only on Saturdays and Sundays, from 3 to 7 P. M.</p>
   <p>On October 26, 1918, the studies began at the university, and classes of the three most necessary subjects mentioned above were started. The lecturers were Professor Novakovsky, - Russian language; Mr. Prilla, engineer, and Mr. V. N. Fedorov, - arithmetic; and Professor Shcherbinin, - English language. These afternoon classes functioned till Nov. 11, 1918.</p>

   <p>On December 1, 1918, the number of students who had registered grew to sixty-two, and out of these forty-five were attending the lectures regularly. All these forty-five students belonged to the same division, - the Preliminary, which was the only one existing at that time. In accordance with the by-laws, a representative of the students attended the meetings of the Council of the University. The first representative <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>of the students was Mr. Nesteruk.</p>
   <p>In November, 1918, took place the solemn celebration of the tenth anniversary of the inauguration of the Polish People's University. The Counil of the Russian People's University, wishing to express its solidarity with the splendidly organized Polish People's University, created by a kindred nationality, decided to delegate to the celebration the president, Professor Novakovsky. The latter was very pleased with this decision, participated in the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the existence of the Polish People's University and made a short speech in Polish, presenting to the Poles the greetings of the members of the Russian University.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the Council of the University of November 25, 1918, <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>the president, Prof. S. I. Novakovsky, was elected to go as a delegate to the Second General Civic Convention to be held in New York on December 13, 14 and 15, 1918. The delegate was given instructions to participate in the convention, speaking on behalf of the Russian People's University in Chicago, but only on questions having to do with educational and cultural work. These instructions were carried out by the delegate.</p>
   <p>On December 27, 28 and 29, 1918, there took place in Chicago a convention of Russian cultural and educational organizations in America.

   <p>On March 30, 1919, at the initiative of the president of the university, Prof. S. I.

Four meetings of the pedagogic council were held. At these meetings the programs of the Automobile Division and of the Pedagogic Division of the Russian People's University, which were to be started in the autumn of 1919, were worked out and accepted.</p>
