   <p>The evening of entertainment arranged by the Sisterhood of Christ's Resurrection (Branch Number Twenty-four of R. I. M. A. S.) last Sunday was quite successful, although the attendance was not large. The closely knit family of the members of this organization, mostly emigrant women from the province of Volyn, does know how to take care of its entertainments. In the concert part of the program a Ukrainian piece was presented which very much pleased the guests. In the cast were F. Zhuk, Mme. Kelp, Mary Nuson, and others.</p>
