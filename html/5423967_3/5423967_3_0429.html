   <p>The writer states that two tendencies have developed in the Federation in the last year. On the one hand there are those who despite differences in political outlook, are interested in furthering the education of Russian children and the progressive workers' schools. On the other side were the White Russian chauvinists, Voronko and Zmagar, and their adherents. They wished to destroy the Federation. This was shown at the last session of the Federation. It had not been possible for them to take action for a considerable time due to lack of strength.</p>
   <p>The South Side School, where Zmagar taught, withdrew its delegates to the Federation and elected new ones and at the next meeting (January 25) the opposition appeared in full force. They brought up the point that the president of the Federation was a Communist.</p>

   <p>Zmagar (his real name was I. A. Charapuk) stated that a man (Eberhardt) of a definite political belief should not head a non-political organization. He would influence them in a special direction.</p>
   <p>Zmagar quoted two incidents in proof of this fact. The author then discusses these from his point of view. The White Russian National Committee (composed, says Eberhardt, of Voronko and Zmagar) planned a contest with one of the schools where Voronko taught. The school soviet ordered the chorus not to take part, but Voronko went ahead with his plans. Eberhardt then forbade the chorus to take part and the meeting (December, probably 1924) supported his order.</p>
   <p>The second incident concerned a teacher. A satisfactory substitute for a history course was proposed, but M. I. Volkov refused to accept him and proposed instead a former general who had fought with Wrangel.</p>

   <p>Eberhardt refused to accept this "white guard." The executive committee upheld his decision.</p>
   <p>These cases were given as examples of Eberhardt's prejudice at the meeting on January 25, 1925, and the question was postponed until February 22, 1925.</p>
   <p>At the February meeting, after a two hour discussion, two candidates were put up, Eberhardt and Romanovich, the opposition candidate. The vote was tied, eleven to eleven, and the election was postponed until March 29, 1925.</p>
   <p>Eberhardt complained that Zmagar charged him with conducting the schools "in a non-Russian spirit." This charge was made by a man who hated the Russian spirit. Eberhardt says that the Russkii Viestnik published the other side without publishing his.</p>
