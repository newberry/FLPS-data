   <p>The Russian people of Chicago know very well that on Leavitt Street, at the Cathedral, there is a Mutual Aid Society, Russko-Amerikanskoe Pravoslavnoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi Sviatogo Kniazia Wladimira, Rapovs, (Russian-American Orthodox Catholic Mutual Aid Society of St. Vladimir). Up to 1918, the above-mentioned society was a branch of the Russian-American Greek Catholic Mutual Aid Society (Rpgkov), but later on, in spite of the large membership and other good qualities of this Society, the "Levitsi" decided not to obey the decree of the assembly of the Rpgkov, which had voted to increase the monthly dues, and they withdrew from the Rpgkov. ["Levitets," singular--"Levitsi," plural; these names are given to the members of the Russian Mutual Aid Society of the Holy Trinity Cathedral Parish at 1121 North Leavitt Street, Chicago, Illinois.]</p>
   <p>There was nothing remaining for the Levitsi to do but to organize their own <span class="page-break">\2</span>mutual aid society and this was done. Everything went along smoothly but then "Prosperity" arrived (unemployment and insolvency of banks). The Black Angel began to visit the members of Rapovs frequently, and the society was forced to do something. It was necessary to unite with someone. Inquiries and investigations were made of all similar societies and finally, after receiving all the required information, it was found that the most suitable organizations for the purpose of merging, were Rnzov (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) and Rpgkov (Russian Orthodox Catholic Mutual Aid Society). But here there appears an interesting situation.</p>
   <p>In every organization, there are people with different opinions and our neighbors, the Levitsi are no exception. Those members who were in favor of uniting with Rpgkov strove to convince the rest of the members that there would be more security in joining the above-mentioned society because the organization had seven thousand members (adults), but they purposely suppressed the fact that besides the seven thousand, there were only one thousand two hundred <span class="page-break">\3</span>young members. They forgot to mention that at the time when they left the said organization, it was because of its instability. They also concealed the fact that in 1926, Rpgkov of Wilkes-Barre established higher rates for the older members. They tried to prove that the aggregate membership must be considered an important factor.</p>
   <p>But to tell the truth, it is necessary to state that this was done chiefly for revenge (against whom? and for what?). Some persons, in order to discredit Rnzov and to press their own point of view, even made such insinuations as the following. They spread a rumor that they had in their hands official records of the instability of the Rnzov. We were told that the chairman of the administration of the Rnzov, upon hearing the rumor, visited the persons supposedly having this information. It appears that they failed to produce any of the official documents that they had bragged about. But these persons knew very well that some of the members were gullible; they openly said of such members: "Show them a piece of paper stating that herein is written so and so and they will believe it." But it appears that even the <span class="page-break">\4</span>Levitsi, in spite of their piety, are not to be cheated and slandered.</p>
   <p>Let's consider the real facts. The Rnzov as well as the Rpgkov increased the dues to conform with the rates adopted by the Fraternal Congress and, therefore, the financial soundness of each society became about equal. And if you recall that the Rnzov had, for its 1,500 adult members, over five hundred children, in comparison with Rpgkov where for seven thousand adult members there were only 1,200 children, or, in other words, in Rnzov the ratio is three adults to one child, and in Rpgkov it is seven to one, you have the answer, a simple test of the stability of the organization. Every Levitets knows that if there are more older members, more money is required for benefit payments, and, therefore, there will be less stability in the organization.</p>
   <p>And principally, one fact remains certain that those persons who worked so energetically in favor of transferring the membership of the St. Vladimir Society to Wilkes-Barre, are not at all interested in the stability of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Society, but are simply trying to cut off the branch on which they are sitting[Editor's note: idiom implying disruptive tactic].</p>
   <p>We Chicagoans, should take care of ourselves. This industrial age ruins a human being's life, and after forty-five years of age the Russian immigrant laborer is left without a bit of bread. Who will take care of him? Chicago or Wilkes-Barre? If we consolidated the Chicago group, we would be able to give bread to our aged. For instance; we could build farms for the aged. Let's say that the Rnzov spent part of their capital to buy land, dividing it into sections and offering the sections to any aged person who wished to work on a farm. The land belonging to the organization would be free from taxes. The organization would co-operate in helping to sell the products of the farm in the city. Many other forms of aid to our members could be organized, but first of all it is necessary that the societies trust one another.</p>
   <p>Our misfortune lies in the fact that within our colony there are people who play the role of pharisees. They pray to God, repeatedly bow in reverence, <span class="page-break">\6</span>go to confession, donate money and time for the support of the orthodox Catholic faith, but, in reality, they do not believe in the idea that they so loudly proclaim. Christ commands: "Love thy neighbor," but our Chicago Pharisees state: "How can we unite with our brothers? They left us; why should we give them a hand? No, no, never!"</p>
   <p>Therein lies our misfortune. For centuries the doctrine of Christ has been preached, and yet it has not helped to do away with our primitive arrogance. At present we are as far from brotherhood and Christian love as our pagan ancestors were. How can any unbeliever be converted to the Christian faith when he observes such deeds of people calling themselves "Orthodox Catholic"?</p>
   <p>The "red locust" [Translator's note: Bolsheviks], with the purpose of destroying us, attacks Rnzov as well as St. Vladimir, and our Russian "Orthodox Catholics" from Leavitt Street think that they will save themselves if they unite with Rpgkov. They refuse to understand that if Rnzov, St. George's <span class="page-break">\7</span>Brotherhood and St. George's Parish become victims of the red locust, then there is nothing left for the Levitsi; it would be useless to fight; the only thing to do would be to surrender without struggle.</p>
   <p>It seems that those persons who work so energetically against the consolidation of the Chicago societies, forget the historical precedent of Minin. Hey, you Levitsi! Do you really have the Russian soul and Russian blood in your veins? Are you willing to unite with your brothers Rnzov or will you, as traitors to the Russian cause, silently scamper to Wilkes-Barre?</p>
