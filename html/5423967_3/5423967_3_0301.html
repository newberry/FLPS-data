   <p>School work has already begun in the Russian schools for children maintained by the R. I. M. A. S. (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) in Chicago. We think that every Russian who has children of school age should send them to the Russian school, however difficult his economic situation may be.</p>
   <p>Our children should know how to read and speak Russian. It is our duty, the duty of the parents, to teach Russian to our children. We do not know what may befall them in the course of the next fifteen or twenty years. With our present technical development, our life is undergoing a constant change. Let us take, for example, the time when we came to this country, some twenty years ago. At that time it was much easier for one without a knowledge of the English language to adjust himself than it is now. Now even the old-time immigrants can scarcely adapt themselves to changing conditions. The advent of the machine has thrown many workers out in the street. But what will happen to our children? What awaits them?</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>It is possible that our children will be forced to leave America in search of their daily bread, as we were forced to leave Russia. It is quite possible that our children will have an opportunity to come in contact with Russian life on the other side of the ocean. Then the knowledge of the Russian language will come in handy. Then it will become important to them. They will not feel strange and foreign among the Russian people, as we felt when we came to America, for even now we possess but little knowledge of the English language. This is one reason why we appear strangers even to our own children, why we do not understand them and they do not understand us. But when our children are able to read and speak in Russian we can understand each other better, and then the children and the parents will become satisfied with each other.</p>
   <p>I remember the occasion last winter when we were arranging receptions for the benefit of our schools. How much joy, how much gladness the children experienced then--preparations for public appearance; learning recitations; singing, etc., in order to make proper impressions on those present. And during the examination period, every child, dressed in holiday array, nervously waited to be called to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the examination table, everyone trying hard to pass the examination with a better showing than the next fellow. When we consider all this, we are not sorry to give our last pennies or to devote all energy and effort for the benefit of our Russian schools and our children.</p>
   <p>Dear countrymen, every penny you spend for your schools will bring you much good--good which you will appreciate later, and which will make you greatly pleased that you sent your children to the Russian school, you pay very little for the privilege of having your children know their native language. If you really have a desire that your children go to a Russian school, the expense will prove trifling and the difficulties will disappear.</p>
   <p>Last year the R. I. M. A. S. spent quite a large amount of money to keep the schools going. This year, also, the Society promises similar aid. Our teachers have extensive teaching experience, the schools maintain good order, and the children attending the schools make good progress in their work.</p>
   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society maintains six schools. For the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>convenience of Russian people these schools are located in various districts, for example, the Wood Street, Humboldt Park, Hanson Park, Argo, Illinois, and Pullman, Illinois, districts. All Russians living in these districts should send their children to these Russian schools. Let us hope that the Russian people will be inspired with understanding, and will fill the schools with their children. We also advise the Russian people living in the district of Humboldt Park that our school in that district is located at 2548 West Cortez Street, near Rockwell Street. We have good lighting and heating systems there. The teacher is Mrs. Paulina Svatikova.</p>
