   <p>The editors say that one of the most important questions facing the Russian colony at the present time is the establishment of a people's university. The question is now only in the earliest stages and its fulfillment would take some time. (Ed. Note: The editors of the magazine referred to America in general, but their discussion applied to Chicago as well.) The situation of the Russian immigrants demanded the establishment of such an institution. In some cities of the United States (including Chicago) popular lecture courses have been given for the past six or eight years. The first Russian People's University was founded in Los Angeles six or eight years ago. (Ed. Note: About 1908.) It lasted only eight or nine months. There has been considerable development in the Russian colony since, and means are at hand to make another attempt. A people's university, immigrants' home, etc. should <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be founded to aid the moral and social-economic well-being of Russians in America.</p>
   <p>Domashnii Vrach will cooperate with any such effort.</p>
