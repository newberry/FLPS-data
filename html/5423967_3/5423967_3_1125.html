   <p>Nobody will deny that our Society Roova (Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society) is growing and acquiring additional strength through constant increase in membership. Our Society is also gaining in prestige in the Russian colony because of its financial stability and the cultural and educational work carried on by it. We have already repeatedly pointed out that the growth of our organization is promoted by very definite factors, namely, our determination to avoid political controversies and our no less strong determination to concentrate all our efforts on problems of mutual aid and on cultural and educational work.</p>
   <p>We shall promote such cultural projects as the public farm which is destined to be a place where aged Russians may pass their remaining years in familiar environment where in summer under the care of teachers Russian children may grow strong away from the baneful influences of city streets, where Russian colonists with their families will be able to rest and forget at least for a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>time their daily worries while enjoying all the gifts of nature in refined surroundings. Finally, the magazine Russian Herold, which has attracted attention among Russian colonists, induces many people to regard our organization with the respect which it deserves.</p>
   <p>Honest in fulfilling all obligations as regards insurance and avoidance of red tape and unnecessary formalities in services rendered to the members have made our Society known all over the United States and Canada. It is growing in membership; the branches are growing and are widening the scope of their social activity. All these developments should gladden the hearts of our members.</p>
   <p>Only a few days ago the central office of Roova received a letter from Hollywood signed by twenty-two Russian actors with Mr. Ledov at the head. What do they write about? They write us, that they want to organize a branch of Roova in that center of the cinema industry and join the ranks of our mighty Russian family. They request us to mail them all the necessary forms so that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>they may go through the formalities of establishing the branch as quickly as possible. They inform us in their letter that there are thousands of Russians in California, and that they, Russian artists, have no doubt of the rapid growth of their branch after it has been established. Further on the artists explain why they have decided to organize a branch of Roova and not to join any other society. They had previously made attempts to organize branches of other societies, but they were very quickly dissolved, for they were not based upon any sound idea. They, the Russian artists in California, like Roova just because this organization abstains from taking part in any political activity or religious squabbles--two factors which breed dissension among the members of any organization and incite passions among people who otherwise would get along very nicely.</p>
   <p>Our Roova grows and gains strength, and if all we members are able to avoid the petty disagreements which often arise among us, and if we develop to a higher degree the qualities necessary for social discipline and begin to understand that the will of the majority is the law, our Society will become still <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>stronger and more stable, and we may reasonably predict that our organization will then occupy the central position in the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Upon us, the rank-and-file members, depends to a large degree the success of all the activity that is being carried on by Roova. We should avoid the misunderstandings that interfere with our progress at present and patch up somehow our differences of opinion, presenting ourselves before the Russian colony in a way that will command respect.</p>
