   <p>Thoughtful, active men in the Russian colony many times warned the rank and file members of RNOV (The Russian People's Society of Mutual Aid) that they are faced with the danger of losing their Russian identity and their Russian name, but members of RNOV did not pay attention to these warnings, and did not take any steps to preserve their independence or to unite with other Russian Mutual aid societies similar in aims and membership. Whether because of their political illiteracy, or for some other reason, members of RNOV meekly followed in the footsteps of the Bolshevik adventurers and never resisted their scheming plans and intentions.</p>
   <p>As a consequence of this a curious action was taken the other day, which perhaps passed unnoticed by many, rank and file members of RNOV, for the event was not accompanied by any clamor or outcries which are a concomitant to any Bolshevik action.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The action taken essentially means that members of RNOV have been baptized in conformity with the Bolshevik ritual. Heretofore this Society was connected with the Bolshevik organizations, but unofficially and, therefore, was able to preserve at least a semblance of independence. But the other day it lost its identity entirely. Prior to that time the Novy Mir [Translator's note: A Bolshevik newspaper in New York] published a page headed as follows: "Mutual Aid Official Section of the Russian People's Society of Mutual Aid in America". Further on followed the address of the main office of RNOV.</p>
   <p>However, in its issue of January 3, the heading of the page was changed. The words "Mutual Aid" remain, but RNOV has disappeared. Instead of sending their newspaper articles to the headquarters of RNOV, the contributors are advised to address them, "International Workers' Order, Attention of the Russian section".</p>
   <p>The Bolshevik newspaper refrains entirely from explanation of the change, but from the change in heading alone one can infer that RNOV has ceased to exist as an independent organization, as a Russian mutual aid society, and has become <span class="page-break">3</span>merely an adjunct of the International Workers' Order, whose headquarters is located, not in a proletarian district, but on fashionable Fifth avenue in New York.</p>
   <p>Whether the baptismal rites were performed with the consent of the members of RNOV or by a decision of the leaders, the newspaper does not explain. Whatever it might be, the members of RNOV have the experience of an unpleasant occurrence against which they were repeatedly warned by public-spirited Russians. They were unable or unwilling to remove from their midst the Bolshevik adventurers, and unite with other Russian kindred organizations. Now they find themselves thrown into an order not known to them, where they will have no weight or voice, for, knowing that they could not preserve their independence, the Bolshevik leaders will regard all members of RNOV as so much human dust.</p>
