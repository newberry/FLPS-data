   <p>Esteemed hearers! From our past informative talks over the radio concerning conditions in the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (R.I.M.A.S.) and its activities, you have seen that our Society is a very useful organization and a solid one.</p>
   <p>Our Society, as you have seen from our reports, is the largest Russian organization of its kind in the Middle Western states; and, as such, represents practically the entire Russian organized elements in Chicago and its vicinity. Nevertheless, there are people to be found who attempt to smear our Society and present its activity in a light very unfavorable to our organization.</p>
   <p>Lately so-called "defenders of the working class" have tried to pick a quarrel with us in connection with the adoption by our Society of new forms of insurance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Last time I told you what value was represented by the new policies and what benefits would accrue from them to you, personally, and to the Society to which you belong. These new forms of insurance make the financial foundation of our organization much firmer and much more stable. The new policies which we have recently adopted, have already been in use for some time by the largest mutual aid societies in America.</p>
   <p>These new forms of insurance merely show the progress being made by the insurance business in the United States. But our slanderers try to present our reform as something of a crime. What is their aim in doing this? It is the old story!</p>
   <p>Ever since the R.I.M.A.S. appeared on the Russian scene in Chicago, and, as the Society became a powerful organization, an inimical campaign by the enemies of the Russian colony has been carried on against our organization. Just recall how these enemies a few years ago would not let our organization alone because in its title appeared the word "Orthodox." With this name, it <span class="page-break">3</span>seemed, all the evil in the world was supposed to be bound up. The Society was forced to change its name to the extent of eliminating the word "Orthodox" so that it might be able to serve the Russian colony better. Essentially, the Society remained the same, except that it became more patient and tolerant. It became an organization ready to serve any one who sought mutual aid and protection. And that was the sole aim of the organization. But has the inimical propaganda campaign been stopped? Not at all. Our enemies started a search for "criminals" among the members of our Managing Board, and among our Directors, knowing quite well that, as among its members, so among its administrative personnel, our Society has no "enemies of the working class."This hostile agitation has continued for several years. Has it been of any avail to our slanderers? No. What did they do after this failure? They picked a quarrel with us under the pretext of the new policies. Again, knowing quite well that the policies are really beneficial to our members, and that they have been approved by experts in the insurance field in the United States, and that the new forms of mutual insurance have been introduced by the specific advice of the State Insurance Control Board and will be only of benefit to <span class="page-break">4</span>our Society, our opponents broke into a rage, and once again are showing themselves as enemies of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Next time they will probably accuse us of not paying tribute to Shkliar (Translator's note: One of the Communist leaders in New York). Some people fear the growing solidarity in the ranks of our Society. They are afraid of the growing economic independence of our members, and of the Russian colony, in general.</p>
   <p>But the nut is hard, and it cannot be cracked. No agitation, no matter from what source, will ever be able to destroy the R.I.M.A.S. Our Society, as never before,is strong and united. It submits to all the laws of the country in which it exists, and the State Control Department regulates all our financial activity. Consequently, neither our new members nor the old ones should feel any anxiety for the safety of their savings deposited with our organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>In our Society one may find protection in the form of insurance in case of death or sickness. And not only that. He will meet with a brotherly attitude on the part of our members and directors. He will hear his own native tongue, will enjoy entertainments among his own crowd, will hear his own music, and scientific lectures. He may send his children to Russian schools. Some people know and others do not know, that such a freely functioning organization could not even exist in the country of our fathers. Such organizations, as a matter of fact, are possible only in the United States.</p>
   <p>Therefore, friends, let us take advantage of the opportunities that this country affords us. Let us make our Society strong and powerful. Let us issue an urgent call for new members and new workers in our ranks.</p>
   <p>And those of you who still do not belong to our Society, join us, unite with the ranks of an old reliable organization of mutual aid for your own benefit, for the benefit of the Russian colony, for the benefit of your own children, and for the sake of the Russian people in general.</p>
