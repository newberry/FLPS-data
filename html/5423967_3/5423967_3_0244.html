   <p>At the business meeting held by Branch Number Eighteen of R. I. M. A. S. last Sunday many important questions were brought up for decision. Aside from the questions directly concerned with the Branch itself several problems relative to the Russian-language school and the dancing school were considered. It was decided to continue to work, just as before, in close collaboration with the school committee and to help it morally and in case of need financially. It was also decided to help the school committee to organize the entertainment which has been planned for the benefit of the school, to be given on April 26 at the People's Auditorium, 917 North Wood Street.</p>
   <p>At the proposal of I. Raskatov it was resolved to organize a dramatic circle in connection with the Branch. The work of organizing it was entrusted to Mr. Raskatov himself. He expressed the hope that with the help of Russian artists known by him the dramatic club would be formed in the near future.</p>
