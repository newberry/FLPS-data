   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The Society of Russian Intellectuals of Chicago has decided at its last general meeting to change the name of the society, and in the future it will be known under the name of 'Russian Club of Chicago.' In order to create a forward-looking and interesting organization, the executive has resolved to attract greater numbers of people interested in this. The executive is, therefore, requesting you, dear Sir, to be present at a general meeting, which will be held Monday, March 22, at 7:30 P. M., at the YMCA headquarters, 19 S. La Salle Street, 16th floor.</p>
   <p>The basic aims of the Russian Club the executive considers are: (1) To unite all prominent Russians for cultural and educational purposes, and (2) To establish a permanent center where Russians could meet from time to time. No one can deny the necessity of a Russian club in Chicago, and the latter may be accomplished only by united effort.</p>
