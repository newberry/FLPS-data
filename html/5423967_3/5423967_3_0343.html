   <p>Since the existence of the "Federation of Russian Schools for Children of Chicago and its Suburbs," the Bolsheviks have done their utmost to have same under their control. Their efforts in achieving their goal remained fruitless, for they faced strong opposition among the members of the school council. Nevertheless, since the time the Russian colonists had lost interest in the affairs of their schools, the number of Bolshevik members of the school Council had increased yearly. Their indifference was conspicuous in regard to the school organization, for the past school year; the attendance at the meetings gradually dropped and the executive offices were filled under great pressure. The Bolsheviks took advantage of these circumstances. They willingly filled the vacant positions and eagerly went as delegates to the Federation of councils. As a result, all the positions in the school council were taken over by the Bolsheviks and their sympathizers. An abnormal situation, therefore, occured. The School-organizations were non-partisan; they could even be considered as anti-Bolshevik. This abnormity <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was explainable by the indifference of the members constituting the Federation, as during the time of its entire existence, especially in recent years they did not show any substantial results. The Bolsheviks occupying a predominating position in the council of the Federation proposed a general clean-up. The change was adapted during the convention of the Federation, which was under their full control. In the coming school year, it is their intention to make over the Federation, into a branch of the Bolshevik party.</p>
   <p>How did these changes come about? As was customary in former years, "friendly organizations" were invited to attend the convention. Said organizations, proved to be Bolshevik. They had mobilized all their strength and utilized it at the convention. The following organizations were represented: The Russian branch of the Bolshevik party, the Union of Chicago Atheists, Union of Pulman atheists and Union of Workers' Correspondents of the "New World," Cooperative Society, Women's Society, Worker's Choir, Mutual Aid Society, the oral communist paper , "Proletarian Tribune" and also, one or two other Bolshevik organizations. The non-Bolshevist organizations were represented by the following only: The "Znanie" society and the " Independent Society," <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the latter for information purposes only. All these organizations had received the right of a deciding vote, which was not in accordance with the rules and regulations of the by-laws. The following schools were represented: Douglas-Park, Braiton-Park, Argo, Melrose-Park, Gary, Dostoevsky, Gorky, South Side, in all eight schools, while the "friendly organizations" represented eleven at least. The fate of schools therefore, was decided upon, not by the school organizations, but by those who had nothing in common with the schools. Ninety-nine per cent of said organizations were the product of the Russian section of the American Bolshevik party: hence, at the convention the welfare of the schools, was at the hands of the Bolsheviks and their affiliate organizations.</p>
   <p>Accomplishing this change, the Bolsheviks freely guided its course in accordance with their desires. Against all elementary and ethical principles they elected as president, a person who even lacked the credentials of delegate, and to the office of secretary, they elected the Secretary of the Federation. Thus, according to the Bolshevik ideology it seems, a man, whose activities are subject to revision could, at the same time be the chairman of the Revising committee.</p>

   <p>The convention approved the activities of the Federation, not withstanding the fact that the executive committee of the Federation had not as yet presented an account of its activities. The executive committee, had come to the convention already revisioned. Why? Because neither the executive nor the revisionary committee were able to locate the accounting books. The entire report of the executive committee to the convention consisted in the statement, that there was nothing essential to report and that the said convention had passed a resolution to approve its actions. One hand washing the other so to speak. It was not surprising, therfore, that the convention accepted a resolution, by which the Federation ceased to be a non-political, independent organization. Schools, from now on, will lean toward Bolshevik tendencies, by which to achieve gradually, a closer union with the proletarian Komsomol Communist Youth Organization. Although the convention accepted the old rules and regulations and the program of the Federation, unchanged, the Bolsheviks, as we gathered from their newspaper Novi Mir (the New World), will offer their interpretation of the by-laws; have at the most 14 school delegates and eighteen delegates from the communist organizations. If this number of Bolshevik delegates will not suffice, then it would be easy for them to subdivide their party into groups of three and select two <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>delegates to the convention from each such group acting as an independent organization; and by this method retain their majority in the school council. Thus, have the Communist blockheads, taken possession of the School Federation, and dispense with the latter according to their whims. You may rest assured, that in the future they will assemble to bury it for good, and make this solemn occasion a momentous one; because such organizations are doomed in the hands of political fanatics. "Gentlemen" Bolsheviks you will fail to make a, Komsomol Communist Youth Organization, out of our schools and those which are still in your heads, sooner or later will face destruction. We certainly do not express pity for your sakes, but pity for the fate of our schools.</p>
