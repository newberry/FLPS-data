   <p>Doctor Krasnow's Paper. Dr. Krasnow reads a report on the necessity to include in the public grade school curriculum sanitary and hygienic information, and shows that owing to the absence of the most elementary survey on these subjects, the Russian masses are subjected to many privations. They live unhygienically and seek medical assistance only in extreme cases, and so on. The children of Russian immigrants suffer most from an unhygienic environment. The lecturer cites overwhelming statistical facts of mortality among Russian and Polish children in Chicago, which exceeds the mortality of children from groups of other nationalities.</p>
