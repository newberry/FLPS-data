   <p>In the winter of 1924-25 the fierce struggle was renewed. The White Guards mobilized all their forces in order to capture and destroy the federation.</p>
   <p>At this they decided at any cost to get the "German" Eberhardt, who, they maintained, was a stumbling block to "Russian activity" in "their" city.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1924 the evening educational courses for adults began in one of the public high schools. The principal of these classes was an agriculturist,who voluntarily came to the Russian colony, a man by the name of M. J. Volkov. However, when Volkov presented the name of a White Guard general as a candidate to teach Russian history in those classes, the president of the federation categorically protested and rejected the candidacy of the general. The Soviet of the Federation approved the move of the president. But the enemy's camp armed and brought up the question about the re-election of the federation's president. March 29th a special meeting of the federation soviet was held on the question of re-electing its president. The opposition was in full blast.</p>
   <p>It has even succeeded in obtaining new "candidates," which was totally unforeseen. They presented their candidate, J. Romanovich. The result of the voting was a tie. The chairman of that meeting, O. Vladimirov, did not vote, and the problem remained unsolved. The fate of the federation as the vanguard of education of workers' organizations was hanging by a thread.</p>
   
   <p>But the oppsotion lost ground. Zmagar and Voronko at that time were thrown out of the White Russian National Society and were holding on in only two schools. Kaluzin also was "moved" from the Russian Viestnik. On March 29 the fight of the federation was ended. At the new meeting of the Soviet Eberhardt was re-elected president by a majority of 13 to 9. The opposition with their right-hand man Romanovich were prepared to capture the Federation by "violence," but in face of their defeat wisely retreated. The open strife has been curtailed. Our "civil war" has ended, the Kaluzin "intervention" was extinguished, and our "socialistic construction" has begun anew.</p>
   <p>The enemies have for a long time continued to work underground against the federation. They made one more desperate attempt to tear down the third convention of the Federation in 1925, but all was in vain. They have been forever alienated from our cultural organizations.</p>
   
   <p>At the third convention of the federation,the one on July 17-19, 1925, delegates of all schools were present except one, the South Side.</p>
   <p>Zmagar and his clique again succeeded tearing away this school from the federation.</p>
   <p>For the federation this was a great loss . This was the oldest school and the cradle of the federation, our "red pew." In the South Side School, at that time there were 200 students, but there were also White Russian chauvnists. It has remained in their hands for several years.</p>
   <p>On the eve of the opening of the third convention Novy Mir, our newspaper since 1924, completed the leading article dedicated to the convention, expressing full confidence that victory will be ours.</p>
