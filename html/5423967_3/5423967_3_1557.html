   <p>Today no one doubts that the brotherhood mutual aid organization is not only useful, but absolutely indispensable in order to gratify the most essential need of humanity. It is evident to anyone who more or less considers social life, and not at all surprising, that new and small societies for mutual aid have been organized and established, and that the older ones are growing, broadening, and expanding constantly, embracing all aspects of human life, so wide and so deep is the extent of its activities. These societies are beginning to satisfy almost all the essential needs, all the necessities of the people. The mutual aid societies have been in existence for a long time, but not in the same form to which they have recently been converted.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Previously they were organizations which aided people only in the most tragic situation of life, namely in the moment of death. For the purpose of supporting the family, to help it financially, the organizations resolved to give the poor people every opportunity to save a penny for chorniy den (black day) and concerned themselves mainly with people of limited incomes. But the death benefit is only one principle of the brotherhood mutual aid organizations; true, it is very important and valuable to the hundreds of thousand of widows and orphans, which it aids.</p>
   <p>But there are other needs, other matters also of importance. We wish to talk about one of them today; it is the question concerning the social education of the youth. Any organization can be solid and stable if its management realizes their duties and responsibilities to the organization as a person remembers his duties to society.</p>
   <p>A new man, who becomes a member of the mutual aid society, receives not <span class="page-break">3</span>only his rights, but immediately begins to feel his responsibilities and obligations. Because the youth are kinder and more sensitive to the suffering and misery of others, they involuntarily are more quickly imbued with the feeling of duty, with brotherly sympathy, and mutual aid ideals which predominate in such organizations. The mind of youth is occupied with different thoughts and hopes--to take care of the others--that is the goal towards which the sensitive soul of youth is compelled to aspire.</p>
   <p>Besides, participation in social welfare develops the intellect of the young person, teaching him to express his thoughts clearly, correctly, and logically. Respect of the opinion of others is what is especially necessary for the Russians. If a young man belongs to a committee within an organization, then he must be aware of his obligations, and how to do this or that. He should not only be able to express himself before an audience, but should be able to express his thoughts, his plans, in writing--in literary Russian, and he should not feel embarrassed before the people who elected him.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Then if the Mutual Aid Society, imposes even small membership dues on the youth, it will only teach them to be thrifty; it will make them save for the rainy days. Their character involuntarily will be improved by the habit of abstinence. A young man remembers that he must pay say even twenty-five cents in dues tomorrow, therefore he cannot squander it today. He refrains from spending, which means that he is working to improve his habit of abstinence, to control his emotions, desires, and to improve his will power. And will power in life is practically the most important thing.</p>
   <p>The great service of the Independent Society consists in the fact that it was the first among the Russian organizations which realized the supreme importance of welfare education for our youth, and endeavored by every possible means, to attract the youth--these future founders of society--to social welfare work.</p>
   <p>Therefore, dear compatriots, resolve to get to work! If your children are <span class="page-break">5</span>not members of the branches of the RNzOV, The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, then do not delay, and enroll them. It will be of great benefit to your children, and will bring great happiness to you.</p>
