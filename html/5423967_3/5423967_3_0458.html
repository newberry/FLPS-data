   <p>The regular meeting of the South Side School Society took place on July 12, 1924, at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman Tedorov, Chopko being the secretary.</p>
   <p>The order of the business of the day was read and approved unanimously.</p>
   <p>The secretary reads the minutes of the last two meetings and their minutes are approved.</p>
   <p>After that the financial secretary Romanovich reads his report which is also approved unanimously.</p>
   <p>The school has a capital of $1,132.64 in cash.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The report of the Revising Committee is read and also approved unanimously.</p>
   <p>A short discussion is called forth by the reading of the report of the Controlling Committee which had to do with the entertainment arranged on March 30, 1924.</p>
   <p>But as it became immediately obvious that the financial side of this entertainment was in perfect order, and that all the proceeds from it ($232) had been given in good time to the financial secretary and entered in the books, a motion was carried to have the controlling committee present a report on the entertainment to the next meeting of the society.</p>
   <p>Report of the Examining Committee. This report should have been submitted to the meeting by Piven, a member of the Society, but as he was absent the report was read by the teacher, Zusser.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The conclusion of the reporter was that in all the forms the results of most of the examinations were satisfactory. Only in the case of very few children it has been found necessary that they remain in the same form and repeat its program.</p>
   <p>The member of the Examining Committee, Sclovey, expressed his opinion about this report. He criticized severely the results of the examinations, especially in the higher forms.</p>
   <p>The teacher Zmagar opposed Solovey's view. He tried to prove by quoting the marks received by some of the pupils that the achievements of the pupils who had completed the course of the school had not been so very poor.</p>
   <p>"The examinations," stated the teacher, "were stricter than these in the olden time of the tsar's regime. The program of our school was too bulky; this has been found to be so even by the present school conference. We, teachers, know our business and carry it on conscientiously."</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>About the teachers' personnel. The teachers, Romanovich and Lagunets, declare consecutively, in a very blunt way, that they do not want any move to be teachers at the South Side school.</p>
   <p>Both Lagunets and Romanovich who, have spent so much of their time and health working for the school, profess that they have decided to resign because the other teachers who are teaching in the higher forms are being paid at the rate of $1 per hour whereas they, Romanovich and Lagunets, get only 75 cents per hour; but all those present understand perfectly well that this matter of the rate of remuneration is not the real reason of the resignation of these two teachers. (Right there several of the parents protest against any such discrimination as to the salary and point out that there should be a uniform rate of remuneration for the work done by teachers).</p>
   <p>Stormy debates arise in connection with this question.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Several speakers declare that they are decidedly opposed to the resignation of the teachers Romanovich and Lagunets, and they state their reasons in a perfectly outspoken way:</p>
   <p>"Our teachers do not resign voluntarily; they are being forced to do so; it is all due to the intrigues of the Communists."</p>
   <p>"We must keep our old teachers."</p>
   <p>"We do not need any teachers who would do destructive work; we shall get along perfectly well with our teachers."</p>
   <p>"We shall not give them away."</p>
   <p>Only with great difficulty the chairman succeeds in quieting the excited parents who are fighting the resignation of the two teachers; still for a long time occasional shouts are heard such as this:</p>
   <p>"Shklar (a member of the Society) was not the one to install in their <span class="page-break">6</span>offices our teachers; so don't let him eject them."</p>
   <p>Schklar tried to get the rights of the floor in order to give some explanations, but the meeting unanimously refused to hear him.</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that the chairman had exhorted those present to be quiet and that the right of the floor had not been given to Shklar, because of the excitement prevailing among those who had gathered, Shklar goes towards the stage.</p>
   <p>The meeting demands tumultuously that Shklar return to his place, and declares that he will not be allowed to speak.</p>
   <p>Shklar tries in vain to begin his speech by addressing the meeting with the word "comrades."</p>
   <p>But the audience shouts back: "You are not our comrade!" "Begone!" "You have nothing to do with us." "Who are you?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The question as to the expulsion of Shklar from the Society. Quite unexpectedly there is raised the question of the expulsion of Shklar from the Society, a question which was not included in the order of the business of the day.</p>
   <p>Shklar who had resumed his seat does not get the right of the floor.</p>
   <p>A number of the members of the Society declare in unmistakable terms that they do not want to listen to Shklar, "but we shall give the right of the floor to Yatsuk, a member of the Society, who can speak in defense of Shklar."</p>
   <p>Yatsuk makes a speech, but does not say a word about Shklar and begins by telling that drunkenness is inadmissible in a school. As he is not speaking to the point he is not allowed to finish his speech.</p>
   <p>Shklar's explanations. At the suggestion of the chairman, Mr. Tedorov, the meeting agrees to give the right of the floor to the member of the <span class="page-break">8</span>Society, Shklar, in order that he could clear himself of the accusations raised against him.</p>
   <p>"Let him have his short say, and them he can get out."</p>
   <p>"Make it short, make it short," say someone who is sitting on the rear bench.</p>
   <p>The chairman impressively demands that order should be kept.</p>
   <p>The member of the Society, Shklar, looking very troubled and distressed, declares that he has not to clear himself of anything as he does not know of what he is accused.</p>
   <p>"No accusations whatever have been made against me. If I an a dishonest man, if I am guilty of some offense against you, elect a commission, as is done in all organizations; this commission will find out all about it and will report to you."</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>"There are heard here continually such remarks as 'who has sent him here?' Nobody sent me here. I joined the Society voluntarily in order to do useful work in its ranks. I have not done anything objectionable as yet. What harm did I do to the Society? I repeat, you can expel me, but you have to act in an honest way."</p>
   <p>Again voices are heard shouting to the speaker: "It is enough!" "We know you!"</p>
   <p>Shklar continues: "The Society has accepted me as a member..."</p>
   <p>Voices are heard again shouting: "Nobody has accepted you.."</p>
   <p>Having finished his speech in a rather colorless way, Shklar returns to his place.</p>
   <p>Accusations against Shklar. The right of the floor is given to the teacher Romanovich who, speaking so that everybody could hear him, declares that if the parents and members of the school are willing <span class="page-break">10</span>he will formulate clearly and distinctly all the accusations which he makes against Shklar.</p>
   <p>"Shklar has come to our school from an organization to which our school is an eyesore; and the members of this organization had to undermine the work done by this school. From the very first day I have honestly told Shklar: 'This is no place for you.' And he answered: 'I shall stay here.' And his henchmen who have recommended him as a candidate for membership told me in so many words: "You, Romanovich, have to get out because you interfere with our plans."</p>
   <p>"Here are my accusations: At the very first session of the Federation, Shklar with his henchmen, Stolar and others, managed things in such a way that we, teachers and founders of the school, were deprived of the right to cast a decisive vote.</p>
   <p>"When I asked one of the delegates who had come to the convention, as everybody else was asking, how many members have you go in your Society, what class of people are they, have you got much money in <span class="page-break">11</span>in your treasury, etc.? accusations against me were made from all sides, and allthis was done at Shklar's initiative. Shklar has declared here that he is our "well-wisher"; but his adjutant Yatsuk says that we are cannibals in our school. All this is dose at Shklar's instigation. This man Shklar was intentionally trying to create enmity between people of different nationalities."</p>
   <p>After the teacher Romanovich the right of the floor was given to the teacher Lagunets, who confirmed all the accusations made by the first speaker and substantiated them by a number of facts from the life of the school. Some persons siding with Shklar raise a noise, and their opponents answer in the same vein.</p>
   <p>The chairman succeeds only with difficulty in quieting the excited members. Several members tell those who are particularly noisy: "We know why you are shouting like that; you feel that we shall expel Shklar from the Society, and therefore you are trying to disrupt the meeting. But you will not succeed in doing so."</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>The right of the floor is given to Morozov. The latter, in a speech brilliant as to its argumentation, proves how harmful for the school has been the influence exercised by Shklar from the very first, when he had become a member of the Society. The speaker draws a vivid picture of the plans of those who had sent Shklar.</p>
   <p>Morozov relates circumstantially the case, well known to all the Russian colony, how Shklar had refused to publish in the "G. T.." (Note: the Golos Truzhenika -(The Voice of the Toiler), the newspaper of the Russian Branch of the I.W.W., is meant. D. S.) an advertisement sent by the school.</p>
   <p>Shklar is expelled by a majority vote of 12 against 4. The result of the voting was as follows: 12 votes cast for Shklar's expulsion, and 4 against it.</p>
   <p>The resolution was formulated as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>"Whereas Shklar, member of the Society, while he was working in the newspaper G. T. has expressed himself in an insulting way about the South Side school, having said that this school "should be killed in its embryonic state," and by his insistence has caused the request of the school to publish in the above mentioned newspaper a notice to be rejected; whereas the above mentioned Shklar has been sent to our school by undesirable persons and organizations; whereas it was he who has introduced into our school politics, which will be the first step towards the destruction of the school; and whereas he has also continually been working with the aim of expelling from our school those teachers who were undesirable for his party but valuable for the school, the General Assembly of the School Society of the South Side People's School expels him from its membership by a majority vote of 12 against 4."</p>
   <p>Not a teacher.</p>
   <p>(Note: According to the information about the South Side People's School received by me from the former teacher Romanovich, 180 children <span class="page-break">14</span>were taught in this school; there were four teachers and four forms were in existence.</p>
   <p>The bolsheviki joined the Society connected with this school with partisan motives: they wanted to get control of this school or, if they would not be able to do so, to disorganize it from within as this school has been continually strongly opposing the attempts of the bolsheviki to take hold of it.
