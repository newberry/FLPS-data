   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>You are undoubtedly aware that in the Soviet Union, as well as in all countries of the world, where Russian artistic thought has penetrated at the present time, active preparations are being made toward the great celebration in honor of the 100th anniversary of the death of the great poet, A. S. Pushkin. America, and particularly our city, Chicago, will not take a back seat in the preliminary work for the Pushkin celebration.</p>
   <p>We want to have in Chicago, if not the best, then one of the best of Pushkin celebrations.</p>
   <p>The Pushkin Committee organized by us, the only cultural front of <span class="page-break">\2</span>various progressive organizations, decided at its last meeting to call a special Pushkin conference in order to accomplish a successful Pushkin celebration, and to invite to this conference, in addition to the representatives of the organizations, a number of persons whose experience, talent, knowledge and adaptability to Russian culture would be of assistance to the success of this cultural celebration.</p>
   <p>The conference is scheduled for 3 P. M., Sunday, September 27, 1936, at the quarters of the YMCA, 1621 W. Division St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>Through your friends, your name was included in the specially prepared list of persons whom we will be very happy to see at this conference, and we, therefore, ask of you to give us a few hours of your time and to come to this conference.</p>
   <p>This letter is sent to you personally, but if you belong to some <span class="page-break">\3</span>cultural organization, and you might be accompanied by an officer of your organization, then this completely serves our purpose.</p>
   <p>Awaiting to see you at this conference, I beg to remain</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>PUSHKIN COMMITTEE</p>
   <p>J. Eberhardt</p>
