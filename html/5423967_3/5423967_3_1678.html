   <p>The following questions, among others, were discussed at the regular meeting of the board of directors of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (R. I. M. A.), on August 6th, 1931:</p>
   <p>(1) The invitation of all the members of the editing committee to participate in the work of the organizing committee.</p>
   <p>Resolved that all the members of the organizing committee - to wit: Vladimir Sabinsky, Jacob Dziaka, and Vasiliy Konashevsky - participate in the work of the editing committee and by all means contribute to the "Novosti" (Note: The page of Rassviet devoted to the R. I. M. A. S. and entitled "News of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society" is meant. D. S.) appropriate material for publishing.</p>
   <p>(2) The creation of a network of people's schools connected with the R. I. M. A. S.</p>
   <p>An elaborate report was read by P. Chopko, chairman of the school committee. This report shows that the activity of the school committee was very successful. For example, in the district of the Douglas Park School, the school committee has already registered twenty-five pupils for the new school that is being organized in that district, and twenty pupils for the school of music, singing and dancing.</p>
   <p>A movement in favor of the organization of a local "independent school" can be observed in the district of Fullerton Avenue and Clybourn Avenue.</p>
   <p>One of the schools of the so-called Federation also intends to join the Union of Russian People's Schools connected with the R. I. M. A. S. It is reported that in Pullman also the agents of the "Federation" are losing ground.</p>
   <p>The board of directors, having heard P. Chopko's report, resolved to contribute $50 to the committee entrusted with the task of organizing a school in the Douglas Park district.</p>
   <p>Financial support will be given to other schools immediately after their school committees will have informed the school committee of the R. I. M. A. S. of their decision to join the Union of R. I. M. A. S. schools.</p>
