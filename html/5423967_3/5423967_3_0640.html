   <p>Mr. Myron Mikeoff, a White Russian by birth, was reared in the Ukraine. He came to America in 1907. At present he lives with his family at 4559 N. Albany Avenue. Like the average immigrant he had to go through the hardships which is the lot of every immigrant. Being a quiet sort of a chap and very intelligent, he helped his very charming daughter to acquire a complete knowledge of the Russian language, although Miss Mikeoff was born and reared in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the words of Mr. Mikeoff, there was great need of an elementary education among the Russian children as well as adults, and Mr. Mikeoff devoted himself to that cause. In 1917 the first school was organized on the South Side. At present there are eight schools of which six are for children and two for adults. One of the latter is more in the form of a high school, for it is a continuance for the youths who have gone <span class="page-break">2</span>through grammar school. In the six grammar schools the following subjects are taught: reading, writing, grammar, literature, arithmetic, history, and geography. There is more conversation in the Russian language, as well as translation from Russian into English in the higher school.</p>
   <p>The locations of the schools are as follow: 39th and Kedzie (Brighton Park); 3748 W. 18th Street (Tolstoi School), which is a grammar and adult school; 2417 Central Avenue (Nekrasov School); Damen and Elston (Dostoyevsky School); 1628 W. Division (Maxim Gorky School), a grammar and adult school; Argo, Illinois (Argo School).</p>
   <p>There are approximately about one hundred on the enrollment list, and the charge is $1.50 per month for one, and $2.50 for two, three, or more. The teachers are paid $1 per hour. The schools are open about nine months in the year.</p>

   <p>Mr. Mikeoff states that in addition to the schools, the Federation of Russian Children's Schools has organized a chorus of children, as well as outsiders, who are taught Russian folk and modern songs.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mikeoff not only devotes his time and energy to the above mentioned school, but is also interested and active in the Workers' Circle of Dramatics. He is also a member of the Russian branch of the I. W. O.</p>
