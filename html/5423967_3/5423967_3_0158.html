   <p>On Saturday, February 15, I. Y. Voronko, director of the Russian Radio Hour, gave a radio-evening entertainment. Instead of a Russian radio evening the entertainment was an international one, for there were present many people of other nationalities, and the Russian guests were in the minority. The reason for this, perhaps, was the high price of admission tickets.</p>
