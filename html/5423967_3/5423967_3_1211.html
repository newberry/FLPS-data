   <p>The Editorial staff of the page published by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (R.I.M.A.S) appointed a year ago today is finishing its work, and the issue of next Saturday will be edited by new men. Full or vigor and fresh energy, they will take up our task and will continue the interesting and vital work involved in publishing the page of Rassviet devoted exclusively to the activity of R. I. M. A. S.</p>
   <p>We are certain that the new editors will work as conscientiously on the task as we did during the past year.</p>
   <p>In each issue of the paper on the page assigned to us we endeavored, besides the informative and propaganda material of the Independent Society, to give space to other articles which dealt with vital and timely problems. We tried to enliven the page, to revive the interest of our members in the affairs of the Society, and to give impetus to the active participation of <span class="page-break">2</span>everyone concerned in promoting the welfare of the organization. We attempted to set Russian men and women thinking of their own future, of their children's welfare, and of the future of all Russians in America.</p>
   <p>We are constrained to believe and hope that our labor has not been in vain and that our mite, even though it be a modest one, has contributed to the promotion of the Russian cause.</p>
   <p>The tasks undertaken by the Editorial Committee have been performed by us diligently and scrupulously. If there were some omissions or errors, let such faults of ours serve as a lesson for better understanding of the problems and for better work by the new men who are about to take our places.</p>
   <p>Fifty-two issues of the newspaper Rassviet in which our page devoted to the interests of the R. I. M.A. S has appeared--over one hundred articles in one year--do not seem a big lot and to outsiders, it may even seem to be just a trifle, but for the Editorial Committee the making up of the page, <span class="page-break">3</span>for every issue, meant a great deal of work and anxiety.</p>
   <p>Will the article strike the right chord and meet with response from the reader? Will the men on whom our attacks were made and whom we wanted deservedly to punish and even smite feel our blows? Such were the uncertainties of our work that produced anxieties and worries in our minds.</p>
   <p>With a sense of deep satisfaction we observe that the enemies of the Independent Society have felt our blows and quite frequently felt their painful effects. In the Novy Mir [Translator's note: Bolshevik newspaper in New York published in Russian] whole pages were devoted to verbal vehement attacks on us. We quite frequently occupied the front page of this Communist propaganda sheet, and editorials were penned by the high lights of the Communist coterie denouncing us and our work. We were given the most ingenious sobriquets of which one might compile a whole lexicon of the cabdrivers' linguistic profanity and lewdness. V. Burtzev, world-famous Russian revolutionary, who relentlessly fought for freedom even during the Czarist regime <span class="page-break">4</span>in Russia, and who later on joined the fight against the Bolsheviks, was always afraid when Lenin or Trotsky wrote articles of praise for his actions.</p>
   <p>"I must have erred," said Burtzev, "for they begin to praise me. I sleep comfortably and relax perfectly when these men denounce me because it means that I pursue the right course."</p>
   <p>We, of course, do not pretend to be as great as Burtzev was, and yet with pride we notice that throughout the entire year Novy Mir has not uttered even one single word of praise about us. Denunciation was heaped upon us aplenty, however, by the disrupters of the Russian colony, and this only means that the Editorial Committee of R. I. M. A. S. pursued the right course during the tenure of its office, and fought its enemies successfully.</p>
   <p>But our main task was to lift the Russian national self-consciousness to a higher level, to knit the Russian colony as closely as possible and generate among our members as much friendly feeling as we were able. We made particular <span class="page-break">5</span>efforts to enlist the help of as many contributors to our page as was possible under the circumstances, and with the limited financial resources on hand. We tried to induce every member able to write to contribute to the page his own opinion. Therefore, we gave space to every communication sent in by our local branches or by individual members, and we regret very much that some of the branches often failed to supply us with important information in time.</p>
   <p>In the future, it would seem, it will be necessary for the members of the Editorial Committee to pay visits to the local branches and ascertain personally just what is going on among the Russians in various localities, to attend local business meetings, and generally to keep in touch with the pulse of life in the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>The newspaper is the most potent weapon for uniting the Russian people in Chicago and elsewhere.</p>
