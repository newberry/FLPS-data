   <p>The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has guarded for the past twenty years the interests of the Russian immigrants in the Central States of the United States of America. The relief given to the widows and orphans, and the work carried on in order to unite all the immigrants abroad is the main object of our organization, the good name of which is well known far beyond the limits of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is not a secret to anybody that the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is the most powerful Russian organization among the Russian immigrants in the Central States - an organization, which, though it does not stand for the whole colony, yet reflects its true character.</p>
   <p>At the present time the capital of our organization has reached the sum of $501,500. The branches of R. I. M. A. S. are scattered over three states of: Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. The following figures can serve as a graphic illustration of the productive activity of our organization: During its existence <span class="page-break">2</span>the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society paid to the widows, widowers and orphans death benefits to the amount of $151,800; in addition the branches of our organization have paid at various times to its sick members over $200,000.</p>
   <p>Is it necessary to go into details of the usefulness to our immigrants of such an organization as the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. This is well known among hundreds of orphans who in the year of their misfortune have intimately felt the kind care of this organization.</p>
   <p>Thousands of immigrants bear witness to the relief given on many occasions by the branches of our organization to those who were afflicted by sickness.</p>
   <p>What is the worth of the utterances of irresponsible demagogues, who without considering the very essence of the problems and activities of our organization, slander us and sling mud at our civic work? What local Russian organization among those which exist at present or has been in existence before now was more useful to our people residing in the central states than our society? Can anybody accuse us of doing unprofitable work, or of betraying the confidence of our members? In what cases did we act contrary to the interests <span class="page-break">3</span>of our colony?</p>
   <p>The R. I. M. A. S. can proudly declare that the only guiding star in all its activities was the unification of the Russian colony in the field of mutual aid. Yet, notwithstanding twenty years of activity, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society has not yet succeeded to unite all the Russian immigrants, who reside in the city of Chicago and its vicinity. There are thousands of our immigrants,who not only do not belong to our organization, but in general are unorganized.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile time marches on, people become old. Many have reached the age at which it is not easy to be accepted by any mutual aid organization. Moreover, the majority of our young men have no connection at all with parents' organizations, and naturally each year they lose contact not only with their own set, but with the land of their fathers.</p>
   <p>Lastly, there exist in Chicago and its vicinity small organizations of immigrants, which are not connected with such large centers of the Russian colony, as the R. I. M. A. S. (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) and as a result lead a miserable existence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Taking all this into consideration, the board of directors of the R. I. M. A. S. calls all the unorganized immigrants, all community organizations of Chicago and its vicinity to unite with the R. I. M. A. S. in order to protect themselves against sickness and to make provision for their families and relatives in case of death. Let every immigrant find in our community organization a real aid and a consolation. Let us put an end to the appeal to charity for burying our dead - those who were closely connected with; and let our orphans be comforted and taken care of in the future.</p>
   <p>The R. I. M. A. S. for a small monthly payment insures its members $200 to $2,000, which sum is given to the beneficiary in case of death of a Chicago member of R. I. M. A. S. The branches of our organization pay weekly in case of sickness, $5.00 to $7.00. During June, July and August, 1931, those registering for membership in the Chicago R. I. M. A. S. are freed from initiation fees, and have to pay only $1.00 to the administration fund, which privilege is offered to the new members only for the aforesaid short period.</p>
   <p>Full particulars can be obtained from Nickolas Kozak, secretary, 4129 North Mobile Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. Let all Russian immigrants join the ranks of their social organization, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
