   <p>Last Thursday the annual meeting of the Russian-American Club of the Twenty-sixth Ward was held in the clubrooms. Several matters were brought up before the members for their decision. Among them was the necessity of widening the scope of the Club's activity and attracting new members to it. Some of the speakers pointed out that at the present time no Russian colonist can afford not to belong to an organization of some kind which will protect his interests and help him in case of need. This is particularly true in the case of such of our compatriots as for some reason or other have not taken any steps toward becoming American citizens. By joining the Club such people will be in a position to receive help in this important matter from those who have become citizens of the country and can aid them in taking our first and second papers. One of the speakers warned those who are not citizens that on reaching old age they may find themselves in extreme necessity, for foreigners are excluded from the benefit of the old age pension and from other privileges <span class="page-break">\2</span>accorded to citizens.</p>
   <p>For the coming year the following officers were elected: I. F. Erin, reelected president, N. Korecky, recording secretary, and P. Vushko, financial secretary and treasurer. Mr. Vushko was also elected ward club organizer.</p>
