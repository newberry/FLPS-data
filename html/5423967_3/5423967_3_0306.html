   <p>Autumn has begun, bringing with it parental cares and worries over schools and school children. This is a hard year for the parents--probably harder than last year. Many evening schools have been closed. Crane College and Normal College, the only two free institutions of higher learning in Chicago, have also closed their doors for lack of funds. Those from the Russian colony who have been sending their children to these free colleges and to other institutions of learning will now have to save every penny to be able to send then to the University of Illinois. It is true that admission to this institution is free to everybody, but since it is some 135 miles from Chicago, students from that city can no longer live with their parents. This means an enormous increase in family expenses and in the cost of higher education.</p>
   <p>But we advise our Chicago youth not to become discouraged on that account: they should not discontinue their education. In the beginning some help will come from parents and friends. Later, you will be able to find some employment that will enable you to continue your studies. Even in Russia the great majority of college students worked for their living while studying at colleges and universities. The youth in America is much healthier and stronger than was the youth in Russia, but, above all, the American youth is more practical, and with a knowledge of the English language, he can always find a satisfactory solution of his financial problems.</p>
   <p>We hope that the number of students in the Russian colony will increase rather than decrease this year, and that our youth and their parents will not become discouraged, but instead will pursue their intended purpose with self-reliance and determination. You can wear the same old clothes for one year, and you can save on your meals; and for all these sacrifices you will be amply compensated at the proper time. But it is not easy to compensate for the time lost from your studies.</p>
   <p>To work and to study at the same time is very difficult, but it is possible and can be done, if one has the desire, the will to succeed, and the necessary persistence. If the parents will only give their children moral support, helping them to increase their faith in themselves and inspiring them with success, then the youth will conquer. They have enough energy for the struggle. Before them lie life and their future.</p>
   <p>But, to our sorrow, there are not yet many students in our colony, only a scattered few. On the other hand, the colony has many pupils in the grammar and high schools, and it is of them that I want to speak--and not so much of them, as of the primary schools intended for them. On this particular front, our efforts don't look any too good. The parents work rather halfheartedly and usually delay the opening of the schools. There are many reasons for this. In the first place, I will be told by many that there is no money. But I say this is not exactly true. The school societies have never had any money, and yet our schools have always opened on time, and some of them have remained open even during the summer. The chief reason is not financial, but moral. If people have the enthusiasm, if they have a strong desire to do some useful work for the benefit of their children and their community, then the money will be found, and the schools will continue to exist and to prosper.</p>
   <p>Very often, the most useful people to the cause of our schools have not been the rich men, but the unemployed. The men who themselves were as poor as a church mouse went to work. They began to convince others; they looked for free quarters for our schools; they collected money; and thus they were instrumental in opening and maintaining many of our schools.</p>
   <p>No, it is not a question of money. It is rather a question of the energy of the Russian people; it is a question of faith in our work as work for our national cause--this work that confers benefits upon our children and honor upon the parents. But if there is no faith and confidence in the work, if there is no desire to act, then everything will turn into dust.</p>
   <p>The children will draw further and further apart from their parents; they will forget their native tongue; and finally they will be ashamed to be Russians, and--most terrible of all--they will look upon their parents with scorn and contempt. And a man who renounces his country and is ashamed of his parents is capable of any evil, and deep in his heart he is very unhappy. Only pride in their parents and love for their people can save our children from the evil influences and other ills of our age.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the parents will look upon the Russian schools not only as a place where their children may learn the art of reading and writing in their mother tongue, but as a place where their education goes much further and much deeper than the average observer might suppose. The Russian school in America is a link which binds the child to its parents; it is a foundation upon which is built his entire character and his outlook upon life. The Russian school is that flame, that living spark, which will be extinguished in the eyes of your children if they forget their mother language, the language their mothers used when talking to them in their cradle.</p>
   <p>And so, my dear countrymen, join the School Committee of our R.I.M.A.S. [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society]. Send your children to our schools, the only place where they can learn the necessary things, the things for which they will always be grateful to you.</p>
