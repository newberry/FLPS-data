   <p>Report of two lectures by the well known Russian writer, G. D. Grebeushchikov, on January 9, and January 10, 1933. The themes were: "The Truth. Sacrifice and Hope of the Russian People" and "Holy and Rejected Russia".</p>
   <p>From an article by Mr. I. Raskatov, containing an account and criticism of the first lecture, we learn that Mr. Grebeushchikov dwelled in it exclusively on the bright side of the Tsaristic regime in Russia, ignoring entirely its dark side, showing thus, an entire lack of understanding of the causes of the Russian revolution.</p>
