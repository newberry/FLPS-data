   <p>In 1929 Mr. Voronko, conceived the idea of expanding his field of activities among the White-Russians--that is to reach a greater part of the Russian colony. For that purpose the radio was brought into service. At the beginning programs were given in White-Russian and on Sundays only. From the start, Mr. Voronko, met with powerful opposition from ultra-Russian patriots of the Russian colony. Both wings, the right as well as the left, opposed him and for this reason the White-Russian radio hour was short-lived.</p>
   <p>The Russian Radio Hour was born in November 1933 after recognition of the Russian government by the United States. To start with, the management of the Russian Radio Program gave only a half hour a week and that only on Sunday mornings. But gradually under the guidance of Mr. Voronko, it developed sufficiently to allow a broadcast of one hour on Sunday mornings from nine to ten and fifteen minutes on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This is exclusive of special programs, Russian music, speech, songs, were given on the following stations, WEDC, WSBC, WGES, WJJD, and WHFC. In the opinion of Mr. Voronko the Russian radio has a two-fold influence upon the Russian colony. Due to the illiteracy of the majority of the Russians and especially among the elderly inhabitants who are unable to read not only English but Russian as well, for them the radio performs a tremendous service and is not only a business institution but an educational and a cultural one as well. In other words it is a public service. Some of the leaders of the Russian Colony, as well as a number of authors and artists, are quite often heard through the facilities of the Russian radio. Russian children born in the United States have talked over the radio in the Russian language for the first time. Mr. Voronko claims that the Russian radio is performing a service not only for the Russian colony but for all those able to understand the Russian language. Broadcasting is done on Sundays from 3860 Ogden Avenue and week days from 2400 West Madison Street.</p>
