   <p>Since the year 1912 there exists in Melrose Park a so-called Russian Benefit Society.</p>
   <p>On various occasions we have written much about this society. It has done much good for the Russian immigrants by doing cultural and educational work and by giving relief to sick members. In those respects it has always responded to the various needs of the colony.</p>
   <p>One of the purposes of this society is the "spreading of education among the members of the colony."</p>
   <p>Until lately the society has not been able to realize this purpose.</p>
   <p>But last year it has opened a Russian school at the quarters of the public school.</p>

   <p>The committee of the society gave us the following information concerning this event:</p>
   <p>"Pupils whose parents are members of the society pay for the tuition a fee of $1; children of persons who do not belong to the society have to pay a fee of $1.35.</p>
   <p>"There are twenty-six pupils in the school. Their behavior is very decent; they obey the teacher.</p>
   <p>"The teacher, Miss Olga Bar, performs her duties admirably. Lessons take place twice a week; on Tuesdays and Fridays from 5:30 to 8 P. M."</p>
