   <p>The writer calls attention to the fact that neither the name of Mr. I. Erin, one of the assistant secretaries, nor that of Maksimov or Khaimovich, the latter having delivered a speech as delegate for some organization, are on this list. He wonders whether more names were not dropped from the published list of persons. He notes that as guests were marked G. Polonsky, from the Russian Division of the National Committee of Information in New York, and Shpoliansky of Chicago.</p>
