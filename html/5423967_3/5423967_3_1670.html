   <p>Mr. Alexeyev and Mr. Komiakov, (a former secretary of R. I. M. A. S. A.), representatives of the New York branch of the R. C. M. A. S. A. arrived in Chicago last week. The Independents of Chicago R. I. M. A. S. (Russians Independent Mutual Aid Society) held several conferences with their participation, and Mr. Alexeyev, submitted a report at the Peoples School 917 N. Wood St., on the subject: R. I. M. A. S., R. C. M. A. S. A. and R. P. M. A. S. (Russian People's Mutual Aid Society). This report was read on Saturday, Oct. 24, 1931, to a large gathering. Several Bolsheviks, taking advantage of the kind attitude of the Independents came to hear the report, and in their customary outlandish manner created a disturbance, warning the members, of the danger caused by the "white-guards," counter-revolutionists: etc., who stand as obstacles, in preventing the Bolsheviks in joining the ranks of the Chicago as well as of the New York Mutual Aid Societies.</p>

   <p>[Note: It may seem strange to the American readers why so many articles published in the newspaper Rassviet, are not signed by the author's real names. This is done exclusively for the simple reason that the authors of these articles, in criticizing the Bolshevik regime and the activities of the Communists in general, are afraid of reprisals against their relatives in Soviet Russia.
