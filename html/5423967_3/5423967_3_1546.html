   <p>Today in the Morrison Hotel will be opened the annual convention of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. The convention will sum up the results of the activities for the last fiscal year of the largest and most influential Russian mutual aid organization in Chicago and the Middle West.</p>
   <p>This convention therefore is an exceedingly important event, not only for the Russians living in Chicago but for all American Russians. The independents in Chicago constitute the backbone and the focal point of the entire Russian colony in America.</p>
   <p>The distinguishing characteristics of the Independent Society are nationalism and independence. The composition of the membership of the Society is overwhelmingly of peasant stock, the sons of the soil, now factory workers, who have passed through a severe American school of hardship and toil. And no one has the moral right to reproach the Independents or to lay at their door <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the charge of demagogy or playing politics or of trying to exploit or to oppress others.</p>
   <p>The Independents are really populist, believing with deep conviction that nobody but the people themselves should govern and supervise their affairs. No matter how good or how bad their self-government may be, the people themselves should be the masters in their own houses, in their society in their schools, and in their churches.</p>
   <p>The basic foundation of our Society is co-operation in the broadest sense of the word; death benefits, hospitalization, loan service, school aid, in short, aid of a financial, material, or spiritual nature. The Independents take care not only of the needs of the body but also of the needs of the soul. This aid is being offered by the Society to all members and it is also extended, as far as means permit to nonmembers.</p>
   <p>The recreational programs, picnics, and parties which are being organized by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Society enjoy great popularity among the Russians in Chicago. And the Russian independent schools for children are the pride and the adornment of our colony; they successfully fill their cultural duty of preparing the younger generation for taking over the posts left vacant by their elders.</p>
   <p>The depression that has prevailed in America necessarily affects the activities of the Society and it has hindered the realization of many, excellent plans, such as the construction of the Russian National Home, the opening of the Russian High School, and the extension and the renovation of educational and cultural activities and other functions.</p>
   <p>Sectarianism is foreign to the Independents, who are always patient and accessible to everybody; they are the true gatherers of the Russian immigrants not only in Chicago but in the whole United States. The best proof of it is the fact that branches of the Society can be found not only in the Chicago area but also in such faraway cities as Detroit and Baltimore.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The Independents of Chicago are probably the only ones who ardently desire above all the brotherly union of all Russian mutual aid societies in Chicago and nearby towns.</p>
   <p>The Independents have done much work and applied many efforts to bringing closer the realization of such union, and if the initial conferences have not brought satisfactory results, it was not the fault of the Independents. Against the union are those little people who are always afraid and have been accustomed to toil in their own little back yards.</p>
   <p>The Independents recognize the importance and the benefits of the union of all Russian colonies in America, and they sincerely desire it.</p>
   <p>Every man of sound reason understands that in this age of great organizations, companies, and industrial mergers,small, widely spread workingmen's organizations are doomed to a vegetative existence and slow death.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The unification of all native organizations in Chicago, to be followed by the unification on a national scale of all Russian colonies in America, presents itself as a real and urgent need of the Russian people in this country. The union should be organized on a nonpolitical basis, on the principle of co-operation and of the promotion of cultural and educational activity among the Russian people.</p>
   <p>The eyes of all the Russians in America at present are directed toward Chicago. The Russian people in America are waiting expectantly to hear of the Independents, the all-important name which will change their long-cherished dreams of union into actual reality.</p>
   <p>To we wish all success to the convention of the Independents. May their decisions bring further good to all Russians in Chicago and to all Russian colonies in America!</p>
