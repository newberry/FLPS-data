   <p>Last Tuesday a meeting of the school committee of R.I.M.A.S. was held. The members of the committee first heard reports from the branch secretaries on the condition of the schools maintained by the Society. The two schools of largest attendance are the Bunin School and the Krylov School; with respect to cash resources the Krylov School holds first place.</p>
   <p>A. Mizevich, former president of the Pushkin School, reported that Branch Number Twenty-six [of R.I.M.A.S.], has opened a new school and has named it after Lomonosov. He also gave a report on the causes which had led to closing the old school. Fortunately for the Russian cause and for the children of the members of R.I.M.A.S. in Pullman, Branch Number Twenty-six energetically took up the task of opening a new school, and about a month after the closing of the old school they found better and more comfortable quarters for a new one.</p>

   <p>The classes will be conducted by Mme. P.V. Svatikova. Thus the Russian children will not remain without a Russian school and will be able to continue their education.</p>
   <p>We should express our gratitude to the energetic Russian people of Pullman who have worked and are still working for the good of the Russian colony.</p>
