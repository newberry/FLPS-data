   <p>In the September 24 issue of the Lietuva (Lithuania) a list of the Chicago Lithuanians who, at present, are attending higher institutions of learning was printed. It has been found that the list was not complete. It is not an easy matter to gather all of the names of our students. The following is an additional list, also incomplete, of Chicago Lithuanian college students:</p>
   <p>John Mucinskas is attending the Kent College of Law.</p>
   <p>Casimir Kasputis is attending the Kent College of Law.</p>
   <p>A. Aleksandravicius is attending the Chicago Art Institute. He is studying sculpture.</p>
   <p>Brindzukas came here from Nanticoke, Pa., to complete the study of medicine. He has enrolled at the Chicago Medical College.</p>
   
   <p>John Sileika has returned to the Chicago Art Institute to continue a course in art, painting, and sculpture. The Institute is not charging him anything for tuition.</p>
