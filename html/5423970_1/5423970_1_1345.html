   <p>Which is more important, to know: How to raise pigs, or how to raise children? According to Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, the well-known food authority, it seems that in the United States raising hogs is the more important of the two. For fifty-years the science of raising hogs has been taught in this country. There are about five thousand people trained in this science, but there are not even fifty people who know how to bring up children correctly.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wiley believes that the educational system in America is to blame for this state of affairs. The schools do not concern themselves with teaching the people how to feed and care for their children in a healthful manner. They must gain this knowledge by practical experience, but this, however, is very costly. One hundred and thirty-seven infants out of every thousand die before completing their first year of life.</p>
