   <p>Studying the Lithuanian newspapers while living on a farm, I often wondered why Lithuanian farmers never wrote to the newspapers to tell them how they were getting along.</p>
   <p>I came to Chicago, and read Naujienos every evening. Once, while looking through No. 14 of that newspaper, I came across an article which was signed "Not an Agent". The writer complained that the Lithuanian intelligentsia does not inform the public of the opportunities on American farms.</p>
   <p>Of course, it would be well if the intelligentsia did give such information. But if they fail to do so, people who are interested in farming should themselves learn more about the subject from books, of which in the English language there is no shortage. However, there are other people who can give <span class="page-break">2</span>us information about farms--the Lithuanian farmers themselves. They can be found everywhere, in Michigan, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and so on. The only trouble is that they do not bother to write. And it is necessary, very necessary, somehow to force them to write.</p>
   <p>For my own part, I will say that I am acquainted with several states. I have known Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin for twenty-seven years. For ten years I lived on a farm in Missouri. The states of Washington, Oregon, Montana, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Wyoming, New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana are not strangers to me. There are Lithuanian farmers in all of them.</p>
   <p>But I lived for ten years among Americans who do not do as the Lithuanians do. The latter usually buy a farm somewhere in Michigan or Wisconsin. If they are not successful there, they throw away their money and return to Chicago. However, if the Americans fail in one state, they try again in another. From the Americans, therefore, we can learn what kind of farms <span class="page-break">3</span>are best in each part of the country.</p>
   <p>Let us first discuss places for farming. In Oklahoma, in some localities, the water is bad. Cattle die after drinking the bad water. The climate is also unhealthy. It is true that, in some vicinities, it is possible to live well. New Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana are low countries, and are therefore also unhealthy. In Missouri the water is pure and the climate is suitable for living. Here one may be assured that he will not be sick.</p>
   <p>In No. 8 of Naujienos a certain Jos. Beliackas criticizes the advice on where to live which was given earlier by A. Leonardas and P. Butkus. I am acquainted with neither Jos. Beliackas, nor P. Butkus, nor Leonardas. They are, therefore, all equals to me. But, judging from the articles which were written by Butkus and Leonardas, and published in Naujienos, I see that these two men are somewhat acquainted with Colorado. And it also seems to me that they have made some good suggestions. They urge Lithuanians to obtain land in the same manner as do the Americans, who do not pay money for their land.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Americans obtain their land from the Government. Lithuanians ought to do the same thing. Instead of paying thousands of dollars for farms, by following the example set by the Americans they could keep their money in a bank and draw interest on it. It seems to me that Lithuanians would profit by taking land in Colorado.</p>
   <p>The climate of Colorado is healthy. The ground is plowed by machines, and one man with a machine does the work of twelve men. From the Government anyone can get 320 acres of land in Colorado, where there are large stretches of level land called prairies.</p>
   <p>Regarding Mr. Beliackas' claim that the region is mountainous, it is true that there are mountains. But no more Government land is available near these mountains. Those districts are already thickly settled. Now the available land is far from the mountains. On the other hand, we can find in many states mountains as large as those in Colorado, and yet people live near them--and we ought to envy their manner of living!</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>As I have stated before, I know none of the three men mentioned here. But from Mr. Beliackas' article I can see that he knows nothing about either American farms or American mountains. He only dreams about them like the priest does about Hell: he says there is a Hell, but cannot tell where it is. It seems to Mr. Beliackas that people are urged to move to farms only in order that others may take their money from them.</p>
