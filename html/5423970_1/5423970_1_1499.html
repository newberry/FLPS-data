   <p>This week another four Lithuanian families applied for the establishment of a Lithuanian colony. Now we have eighteen Lithuanian families. This week there will be advertised in American newspapers requests for a tract of land. When we receive replies with plans, locations, and prices of lands, we will announce it in Lietuva.</p>
   <p>We are asking for more Lithuanian families to support this important cause to establish a Lithuanian colony. When you have your own land you need not worry about unemployment and food. There will be no starvation. You will do good not only for yourself, but for your brother Lithuanians, who will get help at your colony in times of industrial crisis and unemployment.</p>
