   <p>By far the most important and the most effective weapon of the workers on the economic battlefield is the strike. It is especially effective in those countries where industry has reached a high state of development, where one industry is closely allied to another, and where the stoppage of one industry would seriously affect the other. Under such conditions long strikes are detrimental even to the capitalists. That is the reason why it is possible for the workers to employ the strike to their advantage. The American capitalists are well aware of that fact. For that reason they are employing every means at their command to deprive the workers of that most important weapon. At this very moment, J. E. Edgerton and J. M. Emery, who are leaders of the National Association of Manufacturers, are in Washington giving orders to their servants in the government to prohibit strikes by law.</p>

   <p>A number of bills on that subject already have been introduced in Congress. For example, one of these, the Blanton bill, calls for the legal prohibition of strikes. Another bill, the Roylan bill, is an attempt to prohibit strikes in a indirect and roundabout manner. This bill would give the President the right to place the mines under Federal control during a strike, and, "in order to safeguard public welfare and health," permit the wining of a necessary amount of coal. The provisions of this bill, therefore, would make strikes ineffective and altogether meaningless, because the Federal Government would have the authority to force even the strikers themselves to mine coal. The coal companies would then be able to withstand such a "strike" for many years.</p>
   <p>The workers should form a strong united front of all factions and thwart these nefarious attempts of the capitalists and their servants <span class="page-break">3</span>to take away the most effective weapon of the working class in the struggle for higher wages and a higher standard of living.</p>
