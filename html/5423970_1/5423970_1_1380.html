   <p>The unspeakable conditions of the sweat shops in Chicago and the unspeakable exploitation of the workers is overlooked by the federal government and the city authorities. Men and women must bring clothes to their homes to be worked upon. Sanitary supervisor Hedrick wants to force the city officials to stop this inhuman and unsanitary exploitation of the poor.</p>
   <p>One day's investigation brought the following results:</p>
   <p>He came to the homes of the people who were taking clothes from the factory to finish in their living rooms. He found men and women working hard in their own homes in order to make more money for their miserable living. He found in one house a husband, wife, her brother, four small daughters and a child eight months old. This house is dirty; water leaks from the sink. He found a pile of clothes brought from the factory. The payment is ten cents for a dozen pairs of pants. If they worked hard enough they could make four dozen pairs of pants a week, that is, forty cents.</p>

   <p>At another place he saw a woman carrying on her head a bundle of clothes. He followed her into her house. She was Italian and could not speak English, so they conversed by using their fingers. The woman told him that she gets four cents for making a dozen pairs of pants.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hedrick went to many such places and found the most unsanitary conditions in such houses. Then he went to the clothing factory and found there unsanitary conditions also.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hedrick says that he will look into the horrors of sweat shop exploitation in order to get rid of it. We doubt very much whether he will succeed because to the federal and the city officials graft is more important than the lives of the people.</p>
