   <p>Among the American Lithuanians, the number of schools--parish and public--are increasing rapidly every year. Almost all of these schools are primary schools. We have no high schools or institutions of higher education. We have schools where instruction in bookkeeping, language and other subjects is given, but the number of such schools is so small that they have no significance among the Lithuanian public. Well my theme does not concern the institutions of higher education.</p>
   <p>I want to speak about the primary schools for adults, or the evening schools where the Lithuanian language is taught. Everyone will agree that the aim of such schools is of a double nature: first, cultural, and second, the retaining of Lithuanian nationalism. Both these goals are possible and the second one, is possible to obtain in our own language. In reality, what benefit could we receive if educational subjects were explained in a strange language which we did not understand. Therefore, the first step toward cultural development is to learn your own language. When you have learned that, then you can seek something higher.</p>
   <p>How does the Lithuanian language stand in such schools? When we look at such schools, we see a very amazing situation. These schools are attended by people who can barely read or write. Persons who hardly know the alphabet very often come to such schools. In such schools, besides the Lithuanian language, they teach English, arithmetic, and other subjects. Now then, which subject do the Lithuanians take when they come to such a school? According to the information of the instructors, most of them take English. This is very curious.</p>
   <p>The English language is used everywhere, and it is the national language of the country. For Lithuanians, as well as other national groups, it is absolutely necessary that English be learned. Now then, how can we learn English when we do not know our own language? Someone will ask, what is the relationship between the native and alien language? There is a definite relationship.</p>
   <p>Almost all of the European languages are derived from the same root. The foundation of these languages is practically the same. The principles of these languages are more or less common. It is much easier to learn the principles of a language in the native tongue than in the alien. Every language has a lot of distinctive qualities different from other languages, and many peculiarities of its own; also, there are many similarities among languages. Now then, which is the easiest way to learn these peculiarities, and to understand them? Undoubtedly, the easiest way is by comparing the peculiarities of one language with the other. Then you will see the distinction in these languages, the differences, relationships, similarities, etc. But the most important fact, as I have stated, is that it is much easier to learn and understand the principles of your own language; it will then be much easier to learn the principles of a strange language.</p>
   <p>However, the students in our evening schools are studying English, instead of Lithuanian, from the very beginning. There is nothing that can be said against them because they clearly do not understand that in order to learn a strange language perfectly, one must first know one's own language. It is the duty of the instructors to advise those who do not know this principle of learning languages. Some of those, who are thinking of attending the school, ask for information, what should he take first. In such a case, the beginner should be advised what he should study.</p>
   <p>Knowledge of the principles of your own language makes it much easier to learn a strange language. The knowledge of your own language will reveal to you its beauty; you will like it, and you will have a closer relationship with your own language. Thus we will maintain our nationalism, the loss of which looms as a specter constantly before our eyes.</p>
