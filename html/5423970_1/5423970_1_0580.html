   <p>There are many Lithuanians in Chicago and in other cities who are not satisfied with city life. Would it not be better to buy land and establish a farm--then we would not have to worry about unemployment and the strikes.</p>
   <p>I have devoted much time to the investigation of farms, and at present I have a great deal of information about farm land in various states. Those Lithuanians who are interested, [please] write or come to me then if we agree, several of us can look for a place to establish a Lithuanian farm colony. I am not an agent, nor am I inducing anyone to buy a farm. I have valuable information about [various types of] farm land, such as fruit farms, stock farms, and general farming. Come, let us talk it over; if we can make [satisfactory] arrangements, then we can decide about the establishment of a Lithuanian farm colony.</p>
