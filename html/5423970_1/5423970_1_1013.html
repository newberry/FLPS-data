   <p>In ward 6, there are 300 Lithuanian voters and such a number of votes has great weight on one side or the other.</p>
   <p>The question arises, what can we do, when those devils at the registration booths do not want to register Lithuanians as Lithuanians, but wrongfully register Lithuanians as Russians, Poles, Germans, etc. For this reason, even if there were a thousand Lithuanian voters, their votes would give the credit and honor to the Poles, Russians and Germans, but not to Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>When you go to register, insist that the registration judges register you as Lithuanina. If they refuse to mark you as Lithuanian, then tell them that you will not register.</p>
   <p>This is the first year that the Lithuanians have gone into politics, therefore, at present it is very hard to understand the political machinery.</p>
