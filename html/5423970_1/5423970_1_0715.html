   <p>P. 4. The Chicago Stockyards are famous not only in the United States but also in other countries. It is also a well-known fact that the stock-yard workers work very hard, and very long hours - 54 hours per week, and are highly exploited.</p>
   <p>However, even that does not satisfy the meat kings. Armour and Co. has decided to lengthen the working hours from 54 to 60. Although the stockyards workers are not organized, the company has learned from past experiences that a drastic slash in wages and an increase in working hours may not succeed - the workers might declare a strike. For that reason the company <span class="page-break">2</span>devised a scheme to attain the desired goal in a roundabout manner. The company has announced the formation of a "mutual council," made up of company and employee representatives. However, the workers do not know when and by whom their representatives were elected. It is therefore very obvious that those "employee representatives" were selected by the company. With the aid of such a body the company aims to achieve its purpose - to make working conditions worse in order to realize greater profits.</p>
   <p>It is too early to predict whether or not Armour and Co. will succeed with their plan to extract greater profits at the expense of employees. The Daily Worker, organ of the American working class, is exposing the plans of the company to stockyards workers. Special articles are written on the <span class="page-break">3</span>subject and the paper is distributed among the stockyards workers. The company forbids employees to buy and read the Daily Worker. However, they are reading it. During the first few days 3,000 copies have been sold.</p>
   <p>Many workers now understand that the "mutual council" is a tool of the company.</p>
   <p>The company is attempting to justify the increase in working hours by saying that it will benefit the employees. They are told that by working longer hours they will earn more money. However, the company purposely forgets to mention the fact that it is also possible to earn more money by working shorter hours. Wherever the workers are organized they are working shorter <span class="page-break">4</span>hours and are earning more money.</p>
   <p>The workers of Chicago should support the Daily Worker.</p>
