   <p>January 21, at Wentworth Hall, on Wentworth Avenue, the Lithuanian Youth Circle gave a program of songs, declamations and dances. This concert was arranged by the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, branch 114.</p>
   <p>Only thirty people attended the concert. The people did not come because there was a small admission fee. Another cause for their absence was the fact that the saloons have their "concerts" every Saturday--free, with no admission charge.</p>
   <p>The young men and women are going to the saloon dances, to drink, dance, and then fight. What does the Lithuanian youth learn there? Demoralization and nothing else. It is time that the Lithuanian youth found themselves, who they are. Why don't you young people attend concerts--you will learn a great deal. You gain nothing by going to the saloon dances. You are demoralizing yourselves; you are not elevating yourselves, either culturally or intellectually.</p>
