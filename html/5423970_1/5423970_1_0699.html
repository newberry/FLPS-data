   <p>p. 2...... The street car companies of Chicago are giving very poor service to the public. It is said that their service is the most inefficient of all street car companies in America. They keep an insufficient number of cars in service, an for that reason the public is forced to either wait for hours on corners or fight their way into frightfully overcrowded cars. Many accidents and much damage result from these over-crowded conditions. Riders lose their belongings, pick-pockets rob the passengers, and often, those who are riding on the car step, are pushed off into the street and are seriously injured or even killed.</p>
   <p>The people of Chicago have become disgusted with such service. They are beginning to demand that the city government force the street car companies to put more cars into service and stop transporting people like herring in a barrel. But that is not enough. Experience proves that greedy business men will never properly satisfy the needs of the people. The street car companies should be taken over by the city government. Why should such huge profits from streetcars be allowed to go to private companies when the city government can utilize them for the welfare of the people?</p>
