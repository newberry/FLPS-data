   <p>Not long ago, one Scenic Lover No. 2, wrote in Lietuva about the Lithuanians of the vicinity of Kensington. He drew a very dark picture of the Lithuanians in this locality. True, there is some card playing and drinking among some of them, but you cannot say that all the Lithuanians behave thus. Let us look at the facts.</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Motherland Society, branch 113, have lectures every Saturday night at F. Shedvilas Hall, 341 Kensington Avenue. Up to the present time, the following lectures have been delivered: on February 15, K. Valys read a lecture entitled, "White Slavery"; February 22, Dr. Aldona Rutkauskaite, "The Maintenance of the Home"; March 1, K. Valys, "G. Baltakys (Mr. G. B. Raitelis), his life and writings"; March 8, K. Jurgelionis, "Present Day Art"; March 15, Dr. A. Rutkauskaite delivered a lecture entitled "Health". The last four lectures were illustrated. After the lectures, we had discussions.</p>

   <p>At Palmer Park, every Sunday afternoon, concerts are given. February 23, the well-known Lithuanian singer, Miss A. Klimaviciute sang at the concert "Elsa's Dream" from "Lohengrin" and Gounod's "Tell Me Beautiful Maiden." She was accompanied by Mr. A. Pocius.</p>
   <p>March 6, eleven members organized an Aurora branch to establish a library and school. Before the school and library will be established, the meetings will be held in private homes. The project of having an Aurora branch in this vicinity has been under discussion for some time. At last it was realized and the school and library will be opened after the Easter holiday.</p>
   <p>March 6, the Discovery of the Holy Cross Society in West Pullman, held its meeting for the purpose of organizing a parish. Most of the promoters are from the All Saints Parish of Roseland; they are not satisfied with their priest Father Serafinas. If they establish a parish in West Pullman, the parishioners there will have the same trouble with their priest, as they have with Reverend Serafinas in Roseland. At that meeting, one elderly man <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>said that we Lithuanians have enough churches in Chicago. He said: "I helped to organize many parishes in Chicago. We need Lithuanian schools, not churches, where we and our children can go to obtain enlightenment and culture."</p>
   <p>March 9, Reverend B. Serafinas in his sermon spoke very unfavorably about the new parish.</p>
   <p>March 7, at Stancikas Hall, lectures were given. They were arranged by the Lithuanian Alliance of America, Chicago district. The speaker was Mr. J. A. Chmieliauskas, a representative of the newspaper Birute, from Prussian Lithuania. He spoke about the Lithuanian conditions in Prussia. Then, Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas, spoke about the Prussian Lithuanians, and about the affairs of the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
