   <p>The officers of the Chicago Playground Society have made public their plans to conduct a series of recreational activities during the coming summer months in the various parks and playgrounds of Chicago. They have invited the pupils and students of all public and private schools, the athletic circles of both men and women, and the nationalistic societies of all the different nationalities in Chicago to participate in these activities. In this manner, all groups are provided with an opportunity to display their talent, skill, and ability to each other.</p>
   <p>The following points illustrate the general aims of the Chicago Playground Society: (a) To promote a recreational spirit with various sports, popular games, and nationalistic dances; (b) to determine whether or not it is possible and feasible for the city to take over the playgrounds; (c) to create more playgrounds, parks, and recreational opportunities for the people of Chicago; (d) to study and promote a variety of activities in the playgrounds; (e) to encourage activities in the fresh air and promote a greater appreciation of the many beauties of nature in the vicinity of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>We will not discuss the question of whether or not such international activities are beneficial to the non-Anglo-Saxon nationalities, which are oppressed here by the Irish and English. There can be no doubt that the main purpose of the sponsors of these activities is to hasten the assimilation of other nationalities by the Anglo-Saxons, and thereby strengthen the latter group in America. They are fully aware of the fact that when a number of different nationalities intermingle with each other, the weaker and less numerous nationalities are forced to surrender and become the servants of the stronger and more numerous one. The Anglo-Saxons are not only more numerous, but they also have the upper hand here in almost everything. They feel perfectly at home in Chicago and other parts of the United States. For that reason the other nationalities, by intermingling with the Anglo-Saxons, expose themselves to the danger of extinction and servility. However, the situation is more hopeful than it seems. Even if our nationality is weak in numbers and power, it is possible for us to mingle with a more numerous and powerful nationality and still preserve our identity and independence. If we fully understand and always keep in mind the real motives of the friendly gestures of the Anglo-Saxons, then it will not he necessary for us to lose our heads. We should mingle with them freely, but accept from them only that which is beneficial to our own group. It is always better to possess our own ideals and live with the aid of our own brains than to be dependent upon and be subservient to others.</p>
   <p>However, looking at the matter from another angle, the recreational activities in our parks and playgrounds are very praiseworthy and beneficial to everybody. They encourage and provide opportunities for wholesome recreation in the fresh air, bring people closer to the beauties of nature, and stimulate a better appreciation of ethical culture. They are as beneficial to us as they are to the Anglo-Saxons. It is very advisable for our people to participate in such activities if, in doing so, we will remember who we are and not permit anyone to confuse our heads.</p>
   <p>One of these activities, as described above, took place last Saturday, June 20, in Ogden Park, which is located in the southern part of the city. Among those who participated in the program were the teachers, pupils, and students of various schools, a number of athletic circles, and nationalistic societies of the Czechs, Jews, Norwegians, Dutch, Lithuanians, Irish, and Swedes. The Lithuanian part of the program was rendered by the Birute Singing and Dramatic Society under the direction of Mikas Petrauskas. The program was unusually long; it started at ten o'clock in the morning and lasted until eleven o'clock in the night. During the evening, when the program was at its height, more than ten thousand people surrounded the temporary platform, which was more than one hundred feet long. The spectators were seated on three sides of the platform, while those who participated in the program were seated on the fourth side behind the platform. The latter group presented a very picturesque sight. Women athletes wore gymnastic trunks; the male athletes were also dressed in very light attire; the various groups of the nationalistic societies were adorned in the garb of their native countries. Each group was photographed before and after the program.</p>
   <p>The entire program was very interesting and entertaining. A group of Dutch maidens, dressed in both male and female attire of their native Holland, pleased the audience with a dance that closely resembled the Lithuanian "Klumpakojis" (wooden shoe dance). Other national groups also executed a few numbers of their native dances. The Lithuanian group sang two popular Lithuanian songs, including the "Jieva" (Eve), and danced the "Suktinis" (a twirling dance), the "Klumpakojis" (wooden shoe dance), and the "Aguonele" (poppy dance). Our dances proved to be a great novelty to the spectators; they viewed our program with open mouths, holding their breaths. Our group executed the dance numbers gracefully with required precision. They lacked only one thing - the men were not dressed in native Lithuanian garb.</p>
   <p>The above event represents the first appearance of our nationality in an international scene, and we have made a splendid showing. The songs and dances of our group drew tremendous applause. That indicates that although our nationality is very little known, nevertheless, we are not inferior to other nationalities. The realization of this fact fills our hearts with great joy; the very same joy which is experienced by a child who has just started to walk. Yes, we also have started to walk, thanks to Mr. Mikas Petrauskas, the director of the Birute Singing and Dramatic Society.</p>
