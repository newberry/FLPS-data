   <p>This Tavern Alliance was organized by George Chevesiduskas in 1932.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Alliance is to protect the individual tavern owners, to see that bad laws should not be passed against the taverns in Cook County and in Springfield, Ill. Also, if possible, to establish a brewery of our own, and to buy whiskey in carloads for the organization's members.</p>
