   <p>This war must be won in order to free the world and Lithuania from German slavery. Thousands are sacrificing their lives in the American and Allied armies to attain victory and the freedom of humanity. But not all of the efforts and sacrifices are made on the fields of battle. There is another front, which is composed of those who stand behind the army and support it.</p>
   <p>You, also, are in that front, brother and sister Lithuanians. In order to win the war, both fronts must stand firm, both must be permeated by a spirit of self-sacrifice and perseverance. The soldiers are doing their part, but what about us who remain here?</p>
   <p>From September 28 to October 19 the United States will appeal to its citizens and inhabitants, asking them to help, with their moral support and their money, to attain the great aim: to make the world free. From September 28 to October 19 the Fourth Liberty Loan bonds will be offered to the public. This appeal, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Lithuanians of America, is directed to you and all the other immigrants who have found a haven and freedom here.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians! Let us do our duty by buying Fourth Liberty Loan bonds. You are asked to do so by the United States, our best friend and intercessor in all causes. Let every Lithuanian buy at least one Liberty bond. Whoever refuses to buy these bonds should be regarded as a traitor and is no better than the man who refuses to fight on the field of battle. The Lithuanians have never been and never will be traitors. Now, as always, they will cause their names to be raised high. Therefore, we confidently await the approaching time when the bonds will be placed on sale. We know well that the Lithuanians will fulfill their duty, when the signal is given, to free humanity from the curse of militarism which is represented by the rulers of Germany, and to remove the chains of slavery from the enslaved nations, including Lithuania.</p>
   <p>There is only one method to fulfill our duty successfully and to show our loyalty to America's ideals: we must buy Liberty bonds. We must organize <span class="page-break">\3</span>ourselves well for the work of selling them. May there be not one Lithuanian individual, organization, or society unwilling to put all surplus funds into Liberty bonds. We can make a one hundred per cent record if we have good organization and good committees. We know from the last Liberty Loan drive how important organization is. If the Lithuanians had not been organized, they would not have bought four million dollars' worth of bonds or, at least, they would not have received full credit for the purchases. That sum is not large enough for us Lithuanians: We can do much better. We only need organization. Therefore, let every Lithuanian colony select a committee to sell Fourth Liberty Loan bonds. All Lithuanians are urged to buy bonds through Lithuanian committees, so that the Government will know how many bonds the Lithuanians buy and how loyal they are.</p>
   <p>Societies! Look into your treasuries! Is there not at least a small sum which you could lend to Uncle Sam? Look to your members to make sure they all buy bonds. See to it that there will be no skunks--slackers who bring shame upon your society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In many colonies Loyalty Day celebrations were arranged for July 4 by organized committees. Organizations and individuals created these committees, and the latter performed their duties well. These committees can now become the kernel about which the Fourth Liberty Loan work can be organized. In those vicinities where committees were not created, the people must now organize such groups. All of these committees must register in their cities' central loan headquarters as Lithuanian committees. Now is the time to do this and not after the work has been started. The societies should make decisions as to how many Liberty bonds. Let not one Lithuanian and not one society shirk its duty. Then, when the work is finished, we shall be able to congratulate ourselves on our success, which will bring honor to the Lithuanians and liberty and victory to all.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians! Having recalled ancient times and our forefathers' wars with the Germans, let us get to work! Let us set our will for victory; awaken within ourselves the thirst for freedom; and fan the flame of loyalty in our hearts. Then our devotion will be sweet and our work will be easy. We shall willingly <span class="page-break">\5</span>do whatever is required of us in this time of great efforts.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all of the Lithuanian newspapers and leaders and to all of the people of good will to begin this work and to help the people organize. Then, when the time comes, they will be able to show, by their purchase of Fourth Liberty Loan bonds, how well we understand those ideals for which we and the world are now at war.</p>
