   <p>p.2... This year, as in previous years, the Chicago Lithuanian Women's Educational Society has started evening classes of instruction in the science of cooking, home industry, and in the study of the English language. It will be to your advantage to get more closely acquainted with the various educational opportunities that are offered by this school.</p>
   <p>A good knowledge in the science of cooking is of great value to all women and girls, if not at present, then at least sometimes in the not distant future. The proper selection and preparation of goods for the family is not only essential to all housewives and prospective housewives but study and practice is necessary in order to become a master of the art. The Woman's Educational Society will assist you in gaining the required knowledge and practice in order to make it possible for you to prepare healthy and economical meals.</p>

   <p>The same is true with the course in home industries. Is there a woman or girl to whom it would not be valuable to know how to make such miscellaneous items as sweaters, knit caps, clothes; or how to crochet flowers and other ornamental designs on table cloths and bed-spreads? The latest methods in sewing, and knitting are taught.</p>
   <p>Women and girls! Do not let this splendid opportunity go by. Spend at least one evening per week for self improvement. Visit the classes of the society at Mark White Square Hall, 29th and Halsted Sts.</p>
   <p>The class in sewing and knitting is held every Tuesday evening. The course in the study of the English language is conducted every Thursday evening.</p>
   <p>All classes are free. There is an entrance fee of five cents for the class in cooking, to help defray expenses.</p>
