   <p>Lithuanian workers should take special notice of the fact that those Lithuanians who are enemies of the Communists are at the same time enemies of the entire working class movement. Although the Lithuanian enemies of Communism do not come out openly at present against labor unions, nevertheless, they do not dare to do so only because of their weak position in the Lithuanian colonies, and also because of the fact that the greater majority of Lithuanian. Americans are members of the working class - only a very small number are members of the bourgeoisie class. The Lithuanian bourgeoisie class is made up entirely of small business men, without any factories or large business establishments. They depend almost entirely upon the Lithuanian working class <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for their livelihood. For that reason, they cannot come out openly against labor unions.</p>
   <p>There is no shortage of facts to prove that the Lithuanian bourgeoisie are enemies of organized labor. Although they may even show some sympathy for unions with hypocritical words, nevertheless, their actions prove the direct opposite. Suffice it to mention the attitude of the Lithuanian bourgeois newspaper Vienybe (Unity) against organized labor. That publication is continuously agitating against unions, especially against the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, under the pretext that they are "Jewish Unions." Not daring to come out openly against unions, our bourgeoisie are attempting to wreck the unions in an indirect manner by saying that they are opposed only to "Jewish domination" in unions.</p>

   <p>Therefore, when the Lithuanian bourgeoisie shout against Communism they do so with the very same motives as Mr. Edgerton, the anti - union lobbyist in Washington, and other capitalists.</p>
