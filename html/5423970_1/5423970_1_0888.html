   <p>Saturday, April 23rd, the Chicago Lithuanian Socialists held their meeting at Radaviczius Hall. A lot of people were at the meeting. With great attention they listened to the explanation of the Socialist aims and principles. After the speech, they succeeded in organizing a Lithuanian Socialist branch of eight members. J. L. Zukareckas was elected secretary, J. Girijotas, treasurer. If one half of the people present had joined, there would have been a large Socialist branch. This shows that not many people have understood the Socialist principles. The people must come to the Socialist meetings more often to hear the explanation of Socialism, even though they would not join. When they understand the aim of Socialism, the people will become sympathizers and join the ranks.</p>
   <p>The next Socialist meeting will be held on June 20. We hope that at this meeting there will be more people. Lithuanians, you should always come to the Socialist meetings. Socialism is the salvation of humanity.</p>
