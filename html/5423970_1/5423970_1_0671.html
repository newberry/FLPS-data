   <p>Mr. Swift, of the famous packing firm in the Chicago Stock Yards, is boasting that his firm enjoyed a huge profit during the past year. According to the financial statement of the firm, a net profit of $15,379,152, was realized during 1925. Mr. Swift stated that the success of his firm is due largely to the submissive attitude of his employees.</p>
   <p>These fabulous profits of the firm will be enjoyed by the large shareholders, who have contributed very little work, if any at all, in the production of these profits. Did the employees of the firm benefit in any way from those huge profits which they piled up with hard labor, and physical and mental suffering and the sacrifice of their health and lives? Did it improve the standard of living of the employees in any way? No! On the contrary, the standard of living of the employees is steadily going from bad to worse. Their working hours are being lengthened and their working conditions are becoming increasingly intolerable. The big bosses are continuing their favorite capitalistic cry: Profits, more profits, and still more profits! The question of dividing at least some of these profits with the employees who produce them is not given even the slightest consideration. The workers are looked upon as mere tools of the company, unworthy of anything but a bare existence.</p>
   <p>Employees of the firm are not permitted to talk or even to think about better conditions. They are not permitted to join any labor union, except the "company union", which is nothing else but a tool of the employers for the purpose of misleading and exploiting the employers. The workers cannot even hope to better their conditions with the aid of such a "union". This fact is admitted even by the company. While boasting of the huge profits, members of the firm also stated that during the "adjustment of employee grievances" all delegates of the company "union" were very sympathetic and submissive. That is the reason why the company succeeded in increasing, so sharply, its earnings during the past New years.</p>
   <p>Like all capitalistic enterprise, the Swift company is hoping for still greater profits during the current year. Accordingly, the company is making preparations to lengthen the working hours of the employees and introduce a vicious speed-up system.</p>
