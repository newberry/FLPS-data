   <p>Thanks to the laziness of our Lithuanians in Chicago the four Lithuanian evening schools were closed. Only two are open - one on 31st street, the other on Town of Lake. Therefore, brothers, attend those schools, keep them open. It would be a disgrace to the Chicago Lithuanians if those two last schools were closed.</p>
   <p>A new Lithuanian club under the name the Young Lithuanian Pleasure Club was organized in Chicago, near Canal street. The officers are: J. Zamickis, president; Petras Gulbis, secretary; and Jurgis Petkus, treasurer.</p>
   <p>This new club will have its first ball, January 4, 1896, at 505 Union avenue. Admission 25 cents. All Lithuanians are cordially invited.</p>
