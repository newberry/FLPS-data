   <p>The Chicago public schools distributed books valued at $70,000 free to all the pupils. The Catholic societies not only protested against the free text books, but even went to court to get an injunction. They got the injunction too late because all the books have been distributed. We do not know why the Catholics are against free books in the schools. We think they ought to support this plan.</p>
