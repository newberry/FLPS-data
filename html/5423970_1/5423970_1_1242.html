This country calls itself neutral, and boasts that it is not participating in the bloody slaughter. However, nobody is contributing more to the continuation of the slaughter than our "neutral" capitalists who are crowding ammunition into Europe. They are making millions of dollars out of the blood and lives of the people.</p>
