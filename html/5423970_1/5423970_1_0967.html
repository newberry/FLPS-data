   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians are going forward. The Lithuanian political clubs are increasing, and they are working for their own benefit. Up to the present time in the 29th Ward there were one Lithuanian Republican Club, but now they organized another club. Of this ward, the prominent Lithuanians decided that in such a large ward one club is not enough, it is hard for officials to take good care of the club, because it is very hard for the members and the officials of such a large ward to get together frequently, especially for some quick purpose.</p>
   <p>The name of this new club will be the Lithuanian Republican Keistutis Club of Ward 29. (Keistutis was the Lithuanian duke in the latter part of the 14th century)</p>
   <p>The officers are: John Ziauberis, president; Stan. Martinkus, vice-president; F. Morkus, secretary; K. Niuzemis, treasurer. The meetings will be held every last Saturday of the month.</p>
