   <p>As it was stated in the last issue of Lietuva many Lithuanians lost their money in the so-called bank of the Hungarian-Jew Koperl. Then one of the Chicago English newspapers referring to the Lithuanians who lost their money in the said bank,printed a slanderous article about Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>On February 22 a meeting was called and a committee elected to protest against the slander on Lithuanians. The newspaper (The Evening Journal) refused to print our protest, and the next day printed a more slanderous article about Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>For this reason we decided to call a mass meeting to make a protest and form a resolution against that newspaper. The mass meeting was called on March 8 at St. George's church hall. Over two thousand Lithuanians were present.</p>
   <p>There were reporters of all English newspapers in Chicago, even the reporter of the Evening Journal, which printed the slanderous article against Lithuanians. There were also reporters from German, Polish and Swedish newspapers.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Such prominent speakers were on this mass meeting: Theodore Brentano, a judge of the Superior Court and Eugene Seeger, city statistician.</p>
   <p>Mr. E. Seeger said that no one can tell me better about Lithuanians than myself. The newspaper that blackened your name knows nothing about Lithuanians. You have a great language, its history goes back to the ancient Sanscrit; you have a great history; you were oppressed by the Russian Czar; you love freedom, and America gives you that freedom. Why did that newspaper slander you? Because you are a working people. Do not be ashamed that you are workers; this country is being built by the working people, and you came to help build this great country of America. You people, as children of Abraham Lincoln, do not be ashamed to call yourselves workers.</p>
   <p>Pay no attention to the slanderous newspaper .... a real American would not slander you people. You came to this country because your seeking freedom, and you are making progress in spite of slanderous libel of certain newspapers.</p>
   <p>Judge Brentano said: "I don't think that the newspaper which printed that slanderous article about you Lithuanians, have done it with bad intention. They have done it because they didn't know any better. If the newspaper people were <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>here on this mass meeting they would be ashamed of themselves if they could see your intelligent faces.</p>
   <p>"At present there are in Chicago over ten thousand Lithuanians. I am a judge for the last six years, and during these years I never had a Lithuanian in may court on any offense. This proves to you that the Lithuanian are law-abiding citizens. Therefore, no prudent American would slander such people.</p>
   <p>"In your old country the Russian government held you under the oppression; you had no freedom there to work out your own destiny. In this country you have freedom, hold meetings, protest against the injustices done to you, print books and newspapers in your own language, and go forward with civilization in this land of the free.</p>
   <p>"By holding this mass meeting today against the slanderous newspaper, you are doing the same as any prudent and respectable people would have done against such injustice."</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian speakers were Mr. Szernas (his real name is Adomaitis), editor of Lietuva; Mr. P. Donaitis, president of the Lithuanian Political Alliance; A. <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Olszewskis, publisher of Lietuva, and Mr. A. Bijanskis.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian speakers said the newspaper stated in its slanderous article against Lithuanians that only one Lithuanian in two hundred can read; that the Lithuanians in Chicago are working for only fifty or seventy cents a day, because they are still living like slaves in Europe,where they are working for food only. That there are about 15,000 Lithuanians in the world; that the Lithuanians are semi-civilized, etc.</p>
   <p>Against such a slander we are protesting in this meeting. That there are not 15,000 Lithuanians, but over 4,000,000 Lithuanians who are speaking the Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>We are asking the slanderous newspaper to take into consideration the following facts: - In Chicago there are over 10,000 Lithuanians; 2,000 of them are tailors by trade and their wages run from $1.50 to $4.00 a day; there are 500 moulders; 400 barbers. The Chicago Lithuanians have twelve mutual benefit societies; eight political clubs, and one strong organization - the Illinois Lithuanian Republican Club. Is it possible for a semi-civilized people to have such a tradesmen and such organizations? And yet that newspaper states that we <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>are a barbarous people and know nothing of how to take advantage of this free country of America.</p>
   <p>Therefore we are making this protest against the newspaper - the Evening Journal - for the slanderous article against us.</p>
   <p>On the next day all the Chicago newspapers wrote about this mass meeting. English, German, Polish, Swedish - newspapers of every language - wrote about this protest meeting. Especially the Inter-Ocean newspaper printed word by word the speech of Judge Brentano.</p>
   <p>Now everybody knows that the Lithuanians are not such ignorant people as the said paper described. Even the Evening Journal which printed the slanderous article against us, now after this mass meeting, wrote that the Lithuanians who were present at this protest meeting were clean, well dressed and intelligent people.</p>
   <p>Some of the newspapers even mentioned the past historical events in the history of Lithuania, and about the Lithuanians in America.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Now, Lithuanians, do not be ashamed to call yourselves Lithuanians. Beware of drinking, gambling and laziness, as some of us are. Read newspapers and books, educate yourselves, show that you are enlightened, but not such ignoramuses, as the paper stated that only one Lithuanian in two hundred can read.</p>
