   <p>The Republican party in the United States showed its inhuman conduct to all the civilized world by declaring war on the Philippine Islands. All the cruelty of the Americans in the Philippines was kept secret for a long time. But, as the time went on, the truth appeared very clearly in the eyes of the people. The war in the Philippines brought a great disgrace to the United States citizens. All this happened on account of the Republican party and its administration, who were so eager to satisfy their millionaire friends, notwithstanding the loss of the United States honor as the most democratic country in the world. They did not care much for the honor of the United States and its citizens as long as they have satisfied their greedy desires and accomplished their purpose at any cost. Wishing to satisfy American millionaires, they worked furiously like fierce savages to promote the war in the Philippine Islands. Not enough that they were tormenting, attacking and destroying the property of innocent Tagalog People; they also permitted American soldiers in front of their own officers to commit immoral acts. The American soldiers, like enraged satans, attacked furiously catholic 
<span class="page-break">\2</span>churches and monasteries and robbed them and spread holy sacrement on the floor and tramped it under their feet. The catholics and the citizens of this free land, as American adversaries, who saw the war in Philippine Islands, told a very sad story about the cruelty of the American soldiers in the Islands. The people who came back from the Islands told us that catholics made strong protests against American soldiers and their devilish acts in the Philippine Islands. Finally bishops and archbishops of all catholic churches in America accused the United States for the cruelty of the American soldiers. A famous Irish Bishop from St. Paul Minn. condemned the United States and its soldiers for attacking and mistreating the people of the Philippine Islands.</p>
   <p>The results of this war and the bad conducts of the American soldiers in the Philippines brought nothing but disgrace upon the United States and its citizens. The capitalistic aim for material gains was too great, they lost more than they had during the Philippine war. The honor which they lost cannot be regained at any price. Archbishop Katzer from Milwaukee, Wis., condemned the method of waging war in the Philippine Islands. He did not acknowledge the Philippine Islands as profitable thing, even if the United States did conquer the Islands. The Philippine Islands would bring only a <span class="page-break">\3</span>greater burden upon the citizens of the United States. It is a doubtful thing that these Islands will be of any benefit to United States. This is also the opinion our educators and the citizens who understand and know the Philippine situation. The Americans lost a lot in this war, but they have not gained anything worth-while.</p>
