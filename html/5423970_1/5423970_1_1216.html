   <p>The Chicago Daily Tribune, in a recent article, has stated that "the editors of foreign language newspapers declare that they are all prepared to support their adopted country until the end." The article presents the viewpoints of the various foreign language newspapers published in Chicago on the present crisis between the United States and Germany.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily Tribune published the following in regard to the viewpoint of the Chicago Lithuanian newspaper Naujienos (News):</p>
   <p>"In the Saturday issue of the Naujienos, there is a long editorial about the purpose of the German note to the United States. The newspaper remarks that it is still too early to know the effect of the note upon this country, but, in any event, all the different nationalities in the United States should stand behind President Wilson united in their Americanism.</p>

   <p>This is what the non-Lithuanian public is being told. But in the same issue and in the same editorial, the Naujienos informs the Lithuanian public that America has not observed neutrality, that America is more interested in profits than in the preservation of her neutrality. The Naujienos concludes the editorial with the following words:</p>
   <p>"All this trouble between the United States and Germany is a bloody capitalistic humbug, and American workers would be crazy to allow themselves to be drawn into such a war. Down with war and all war mongers!"</p>
   <p>It is regrettable that this newspaper did not also shout "Down with business and hypocrisy, which force some people to pretend to the American public that they are lambs, but who crow like roosters to the Lithuanian public!" Without a doubt, such a political policy can do much harm to the Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
