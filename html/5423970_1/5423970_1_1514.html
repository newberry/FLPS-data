   <p>p.4... A committee of twenty prominent Lithuanian doctors, dentists, priests, and social leaders was appointed by the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute to assist in conducting a campaign against tuberculosis at Park White Square Hall, from Jan.15 to 29.</p>
   <p>The committee is headed by Dr. A. Zimontas. Two days of the campaign will be devoted exclusively to Lithuanian people.</p>
   <p>The great importance of the campaign is emphasized by the fact that 3,895 people died in Chicago from tuberculosis in 1914. The plague is especially prevalent in the slum districts where sub-standard housing and living conditions exist.</p>
   <p>On the afternoon of the first Lithuanian day, Jan.21, a group of Lithuanian public school children, led by Mrs. M. Jurgelonis, will visit the tuberculosis exhibit. They will see moving pictures on the subject and hear lectures by Dr. A. Zimontas and Dr. J. Jonikis. The program in the evening will consist of moving pictures and lectures by Dr. A. Juska, Adolph Petraitis and Dr. Kazys Drangelis. The audience will also be entertained with Lithuanian music.</p>
   <p>On the afternoon of the second Lithuanian day, Jan. 22, a group of Lithuanian parochial school children will visit the exhibit under the leadership of Mrs. Slikas. The program will consist of moving pictures on health and lectures by Dr. Susana Rutkus and Dr. Kazys Drangelis. The evening program will include lectures by Dr. J. Kulis, Dr. A. Zimontas, Dr. A.J. Tananevicia, and Lithuanian musical entertainment.</p>
