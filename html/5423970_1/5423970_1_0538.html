   <p>A big Polish parade took place last Sunday in the Town of Lake district of Chicago both to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the death of Thaddeus Kosciusko and to send off five hundred Polish volunteers to the Polish Army in France. The most unusual thing about the parade is that several Lithuanians took part in it. For example, A. Zemaitis, owner of a printing shop, who is a real Lithuanian, participated in the parade as one of the leaders.</p>
   <p>We do not envy the Poles; let them work for the interests of their nationality as much as they please. But it is not only a shame but really a sin for Lithuanians to place themselves voluntarily under the yoke of the Poles. Lithuanians, is it not enough that our people have been tortured and oppressed by the Poles for five hundred years? Why should we continue to be their slaves?</p>

   <p>I am particularly annoyed by Mr. Zemaitis' participation in the parade because he is now the printer of the publications of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. Do the central officers of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society know about the political sympathies of Mr. Zemaitis? Undoubtedly, when the officers gave printing jobs to Mr. Zemaitis they believed that they were dealing with and supporting a Lithuanian. But if Mr. Zemaitis is a supporter of the Union of Lublin [the ill-fated union between Poland and Lithuania effected in the sixteenth century], then we should know about it.</p>
