   <p>In Springfield there was incorporated a club under the name, "The Lithuanian Pleasure Club of Chicago."</p>
   <p>The incorporators are Samuel Goldstein, Eli Goldstein, and Arthur Goldstein. The names of the incorporators are Jewish. Is it possible that Chicago Jews are organizing a pleasure club for Lithuanians?</p>
