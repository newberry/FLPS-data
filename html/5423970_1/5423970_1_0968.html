   <p>The last Sunday at 4 P. M. at Azukas Hall, a meeting was held by the political Lithuanian Alliance. The delegates from other political clubs were at this meeting. They decided that on account of coming elections this spring they should hold meetings more frequently. They decided to appeal to all Lithuanians in all parts of Chicago to organize a Republican political club, and then join to the largest organization, the Illinois Lithuanian Republican Alliance.</p>
   <p>The first meeting for this purpose will be called in ward 7th to prepare those Lithuanians for a political activity.</p>
   <p>The meeting will be on March 14, 8 P. M., Mondeikis Hall, Jefferson and 15th place. Therefore Lithuanians of this ward come on this meeting and hear what benefit we can get through politics.</p>
   <p>After a few days another meeting will be held in ward 29th. South Chicago, to organize a Lithuanian political club.</p>
