   <p>The effort made by the Lithuanian-Americans to gain independence for Lithuania has been a difficult, uphill task. The question of Lithuania's independence seemed to be such a small speck in the monstrous whirlpool of the European war that it has been difficult for us to attract the attention of other people. Our brothers across the sea, as well as ourselves over here, looking about, wondered who would offer assistance to the land of our fathers, crushed by the millstones of the war.</p>
   <p>Our waiting was not in vain. That land which hospitably sheltered us when we were forced to flee our fatherland, that land which accepted us as her sons and granted us the opportunity to be equals to her native sons--that land, the United States, did not refuse us then and is not deserting us and our brothers now in their hour of misfortune.</p>

   <p>When starvation threatened to kill the majority of our brothers left behind in the fatherland or exiled to Russia--a country strange to them--who was the first to stretch out a hand of mercy? President Wilson was the first, in the name of this country, to declare a "Lithuanian Day" throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>And now, when the armed hand of the German is reaching out, threatening to subjugate Lithuania, when the Lithuanians not only lack the power to brace themselves against this robber, but are also unable to complain freely to the world and express their real desires, who comes again to their defense? Again, none but this big, free country; none but her great President, Woodrow Wilson. On the third day of this month he declared publicly to a Lithuanian delegation that America would not desert Lithuania, that America is in favor of independence for Lithuania, that Lithuania must be a free country--free from the clutches of the Germans and of her other neighbors.</p>
   <p>We who always regarded America as the champion of liberty have not been deceived. <span class="page-break">3</span>The Lithuanians again have a mighty friend who is determined to guarantee, with the blood of her sons, freedom and peace not only to her own children, but also to our brothers on the other side of the sea.</p>
   <p>"You can recognize a true friend only during misfortune," an old proverb says. The Lithuanians, in their greatest hour of misfortune, recognize that friend. It is America! America first, America always!</p>
   <p>May God bless her! We, her new sons, can entrust everything to her and lay down our lives for her, just as her native sons are now laying down their lives for justice and the freedom of all, including our brothers.</p>
