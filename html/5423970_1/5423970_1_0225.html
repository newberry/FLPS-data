   <p>The Bridgeport branch of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Total Abstinence Society held a health and temperance exhibit on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of last week at St. George's (Lithuanian) parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn (now Lituanica) Avenue.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that altogether about five thousand people visited the exhibit. The exhibit was open to the public only during the evenings of the three days.</p>
   <p>A program was presented each evening. It consisted of lectures, orations, motion pictures and slides on the subjects of health and temperance, songs, recitations, and the explanation of various charts, photographs, and other objects on exhibit in the hall. Dr. A. L. Graicunas made explanatory comments on the motion pictures and slides as they were being shown on the screen.</p>

   <p>Health lectures were delivered at the exhibit by the following Lithuanian doctors: Dr. Jonikaitis, Dr. K. Drangelis, and Dr. Juska. Orations on the subject of temperance were delivered by Reverend Kudirka, Reverend S. B. Serafinas, and Reverend Anthony Briska.</p>
   <p>The large attendance proves that people are interested in such exhibits. The unexpectedly large crowds caused such confusion in the hall that it was impossible properly to explain all the various photographs, charts, and other objects that were on exhibit in the hall.</p>
   <p>The same exhibit will be shown on May 16, 17, and 18 in the Providence of God (Lithuanian) parish hall at Union Avenue and 18th Street. It will be sponsored by the local branch of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Total Abstinence Society. Miss Freitikis is the most active member of the committee which is making preparations for the exhibit.</p>

   <p>It would be helpful if the doors of this exhibit were opened earlier so that visitors would have more time to study the various objects on exhibition.</p>
