   <p>As it is known, in Chicago (the various wood trades) were organized into one carpenters' union, to which we Lithuanians belong in various locals in all parts of the city. Now, the carpenters' union does not want to take in foreign workers. If this will become a reality many foreign-born workers, including Lithuanians, will get no job as carpenters. Therefore, we are urging the organizing of a separate union branch, to which only the Lithuanian workers would belong. For this purpose a meeting will be held on August 22, 7 P. M., at the J. Radavicius Hall, 168 W. 18th St. All the Lithuanian carpenters are invited.</p>
