   <p>The newspaper Tevyne and Rev. Milukas praised very highly the Lithuanian parish school in Chicago. They have told us that the school, conducted by the nuns, is the best in the world. A few days ago we saw a leaflet issued by the school teachers in Lithuanian language. The Lithuanian language in those leaflets is the worst jargon that we have ever seen or heard. Yes, such jargon has no equal in the world.</p>
