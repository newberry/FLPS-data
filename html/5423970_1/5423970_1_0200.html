   <p>The American government is anxious that its every inhabitant could read and write, for this reason in every city, town and village it builds schools and gives education free, in order to make the people cultured.</p>
   <p>It not only wants to educate the children, but adults too, especially those that cannot speak the English language.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are scores of evening schools for the purpose of educating the foreigners. English is taught, and the natives languages, in order to uplift those people, who had no opportunity to attend schools in their own countries, to enlighten them, to give them culture, and all this is free.</p>
   <p>There are twelve evening schools in Chicago for Lithuanians alone, to teach them free the English and Lithuanian languages. Put how many of our Lithuanians are attending those schools? Three of the evening schools were closed already, because our Lithuanians did not attend the schools. It is a disgrace to Lithuanians. The government gives school room heat, light and education free, and yet our Lithuanians disregard all this educational opportunity.</p>

   <p>Many of our strong and young Lithuanians are out of work for not knowing the American language. And yet those jobless Lithuanians do not care to attend the schools, do not care to learn the American language, to read and to write. They are jabbering that they have no time. But they have plenty of time to play cards for days and nights.</p>
   <p>If you Lithuanians will not go to school the government will close them. Therefore, before the schools are closed, attend the schools, educate yourselves because only through education you will improve your living conditions.</p>
