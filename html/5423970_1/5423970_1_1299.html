   <p>We see a desire shown in the newspapers by other nations in this country to organize an army to help the United States in the present Spanish-American War.</p>
   <p>Can we Lithuanians organize a separate army? Where are the leaders of our army? We think that in America, among Lithuanians,there are no higher army officers than a sergeant. A sergeant has no education nor the qualifications for an efficient officer. Some times, officers, by their own foresight, need to make an attack on the enemy but a sergeant cannot do that as he is not prepared for it. A sergeant only knows how to instruct in drilling, but not how to attack or repulse the enemy.</p>
   <p>The army leaders require that the officer must know something about strategy. To lead a separate army on the war front requires tactics not to be found among Lithuanians in America.</p>
