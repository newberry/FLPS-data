   <p>The English Language: Beginning Jan. 6th, every Wednesday evening. It is absolutely essential for everyone to know how to speak English. Without a knowledge of the language one experiences many inconvenient and embarrassing moments. When you apply for work you are at a great disadvantage because you are unable to speak to the employer,on certain important occasions one is compelled to waste as much as a half day looking for an interpreter. It will pay anyone to devote at least one evening every week for the study of the English language.</p>
   <p>Cooking: Beginning Jan.7th, every Thursday evening. This is a very important and essential course, because ones health, life, and happiness depend upon properly prepared food.</p>
   <p>The courses in English and sewing are free to members and outsiders. The course in cooking is free only to members of the Lithuanian Ladies' Educational Society. A charge of fifteen cents is made to non-members to help defray expenses.</p>
