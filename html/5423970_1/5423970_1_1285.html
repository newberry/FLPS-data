   <p>The matter of calling an annual conference of the Lithuanian Press Society, which should have been held in July, was raised in the most recent issue of the Katalikas. However, the last week has brought us so much that is new, and the cycle of life has made such a complete turn, upsetting everything, that it seems to us that the question raised by the Katalikas must be replaced by another question, at this time more important. A general, nonpartisan conference-convention of all Lithuanian-Americans of all tendencies, should be called.</p>
   <p>The war, which has arisen in Europe, concerns a large number of nations. Among the other nations affected by the war, one of the most important places has been taken by our fellow-nationals whom we have left behind in Lithuania. The reports published show that Lithuania is one of the centers where battles <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>between the Russian and German armies might take place. In the event of a battle, Lithuania will become a martyr, regardless of which side wins. The Lithuanian fields and the people's wealth will be torn up and destroyed. Thousands of our brothers in Lithuania will be left without shelter. Thousands of orphans will lose their homes and, you will find, even their last morsel of bread. In the tumult, more than one completely innocent Lithuanian will be destroyed.</p>
   <p>At this moment we cannot be concerned with the question of who will be the victors. We know only that our native land will be destroyed and that our parents, brothers, and sisters will be forced into the abyss of hardship, misfortune, and misery. At this moment we cannot be concerned with whether our neighbor is a Nationalist, Socialist, Clericalist, Anarchist, or something else. No matter of what religions or political tendencies we are; no matter what opinions we adhere to; today we are all only people who are equally concerned with the welfare of our dear ones.</p>

   <p>We were free to fight among ourselves, to use all our power in the effort to defeat an opposite viewpoint. A wave of hatred and vengeance was free to rise in that fight. Now the hour has come when all that must be forgotten. It is a moment when the sole enemy of all Lithuanians is the misfortune which threatens our native land and the native town of every Lithuanian. At this moment we cannot say whether the sea of misery will flood our loved ones, or whether Lithuania will be drowned in its waves. No one can foresee what will happen during the next hour. You will suddenly find that the awful calamity is already at the threshold.</p>
   <p>We cannot delay this matter, no more than we can desert our brothers in Lithuania. We must prepare in advance to meet the calamity which threatens our whole nation. The only conclusion is to have a meeting of the representatives of all Lithuanian-Americans: to arrange the same sort of convention as we had during the time of the Russian Revolution. There, in common, we can discuss the situation, decide what we must do at this time, and draw up a plan of action.</p>
   <p>We hardly have [ever] had a moment which could compare to this in importance.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>And it is the duty of every person to concern himself with this matter without delay.</p>
   <p>These words are directed to all the people, without exception and without regard to their viewpoints. All are invited to raise their voices and to co-operate in this work. It would be the handiest to have this matter started by the largest and most important organizations, such as: the Lithuanian Alliance of America, the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of America, the Socialist Alliance, and the Lovers of the Motherland Society.</p>
   <p>May the conference of all Lithuanian-Americans take place as soon as possible!</p>
   <p>May it begin a Lithuanian relief fund, without delay. Aid to our relatives, widows, and children could be given from such a fund after the war!</p>
