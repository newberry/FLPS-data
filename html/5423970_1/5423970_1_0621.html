   <p>Last Saturday the Chicago Poles held a massmeeting protesting the building of a monument of Frederick the Great, which was delivered to America as a present from Germany. The Poles ought to have more important matters on hand than to watch where President Roosevelt will place Frederick's monument. Why should the Poles worry when President Roosevelt and his friends are standing in the shoes of Frederick. If the Poles did not want the monument of Frederick, why did they vote for Roosevelt? The protest will help none. It is known to all that Germany offered the monument of Frederick to Roosevelt and he accepted it.</p>
