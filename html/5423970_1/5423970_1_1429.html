   <p>Lithuanian women of Chicago, the time has arrived when we should wake up and become active together with the women of other nationalities! We all live under the same conditions, and we can also enjoy better food, and warmer and more sanitary homes in which to rest after a hard day's work. We must stop and realize that mankind is marching forward towards greater perfection. Those who fail to keep up with the progress of others are trampled upon; if we wish to avoid being trampled upon we must march forward together with the rest of mankind. We must strive to learn and develop ourselves intellectually. It is not enough merely to learn quickly from the girls on the streets how to arrange our hair in accordance with the latest American styles. A girl who understands and knows her place in society can be attractive without being a slave to styles.</p>

   <p>We must learn and strive to understand life, and build up a brighter, independent future for ourselves. It is necessary for us to depend more on ourselves than on the alluring but deceptive promises of others. In order to understand all these matters we must learn to read books and newspapers, and attend lectures and other educational meetings. For that purpose the Chicago Lithuanian Women's Educational Society has arranged a lecture, together with a program of recitations, monologues, and music, on Sunday evening, February 14, at Davis Square, 45th and Paulina Streets, in the Town of Lake colony. The speakers will be Miss T. Andrius, art student, J. Varkala, student of philology at the University of Chicago, and others. All Lithuanians of both sexes are invited to attend. Admission is free.</p>
