   <p>In this district of Chicago there are many Lithuanians. It is impossible to say how many but I think no mistake will be made when I say that there are approximately one hundred and fifty families and twice that many single persons. Yes, there is a large number of Lithuanians here, but no cultural activity among them. Maybe this is a fault of this district, because the Lithuanians here do not live in one place but, instead, widely scattered among Americans and Irish people.</p>
   <p>The other cause for this lack of activity here is the lack of enlightenment--to tell the truth, the darkness--which exists among Lithuanians. Very seldom can one find among them a newspaper, an educational book, or even a prayer book. Therefore, it was nothing to be amazed at to find here only one society, the Lithuanian Alliance of America, Branch 251, <span class="page-break">\2</span>even this with only twenty members and not much life in it. Many people were unwilling to join this society; they said that this was an organization of infidels! But this charge of heresy was not the real reason. The whole secret here is that at the corner of 61st and State Streets, a Jew operates a "Lithuanian Hostelry" where the people can very easily spend their hard-earned money. As a natural result, therefore, whenever the opportunity comes, they have a chance to scratch someone's ears, or to investigate the strength of someone's head bone [Editor's note: i.e., to fight]. In such circumstances, it is impossible for a man to have even the few cents necessary to buy a newspaper or to have the time to join a society. Four months ago, however, there was organized the "Light Singing and Theatrical Society." Already, about sixty members have joined this society. The initiation foe is twenty cents, and the same amount is charged for monthly dues. Also, during sickness (as this is a mutual benefit society), the member receives five dollars a week. This society is young, and what it will accomplish in the future is <span class="page-break">\3</span>very difficult to predict. On October 5, [sic] it will give its dance in the rear hall of a saloon in Town of Lake. They got the hall free. Later, they decided to hold their dance in Englewood but two members, as I have heard it, still wanted to have the dance in Town of Lake, and have already ordered printed leaflets announcing that the dance will be held there. Evidently there are people who do not yet understand the value of majority rule and of unity within a society. Another reprehensible fact is that they have selected several young girls to serve beer at the tables, their point being that drunkards will buy more beer from a beautiful girl and the society will thereby make more money.</p>
