   <p>(Zinycia, temple, tabernacle - is a word impossible to translate. It would be like a place in which to obtain knowledge.)</p>
   <p>There are many roads which lead to the improvement of living conditions. One such road was selected by the group of Lithuanians who organized the Lithuanian committee of Zinycia. Its purpose is colonization.</p>
   <p>To command Lithuanians to new action the committee of Zinycia has published its plan:</p>
   <p>1. We see plainly that in all parts of the world the workers are wronged while the employers are rich and fortunate. Therefore, we must organize and establish our own industry and commerce and thus become employers and workers. By doing this we will have fortune, power, and honor.</p>
   <p>But (how can we) bring industry and commerce? Well, let us look at the labor of the ants and we will understand everything and be able to bring forth. Like the ants we must take the job we know best. Therefore, this committee is willing to organize a huge Lithuanian industrial and commercial organization, and appeals to all Lithuanians who are willing to take active part, to send their names and addresses to the secretary of the Lithuanian Committee Zinycia.</p>
   <p>2. On the second point, where and how to start such a job? The answer is in the Lithuanian colony. To establish a Lithuanian colony in America is much easier than for all the Lithuanians to find good jobs in the cities. There are lots of good land not inhabited by the people, yet it is possible to get such land almost for nothing. Ten thousand Lithuanians could very easily establish such a Lithuanian colony of industry and commerce. The committee desires that every member of this organization should have equal rights in the affairs of such a colony. Each member may not buy more than $100 worth of stock, and if there were any money left, a bank should be established with it.</p>
   
   <p>3. The capital will be used to buy land, to establish factories, to buy all necessary machinery and all the implements for erecting the buildings, making roads, for raising domestic animals, and the payment of wages to the workers.</p>
   <p>The larger the membership the stronger the organization will be and will become more and more powerful and famous. The $100 given by each member for such an industrial colony will build our industry and commerce, so that we ourselves will be employers and employees. There will be no longer the necessity of standing like dupes at the gates of a factory waiting for a job. On our own land and in our own factories there will be enough work to do.</p>
   <p>4. In America there are over 100,000 Lithuanians. By depositing $100 each in the corporation's capital stock, we would have $10,000,000. It would leave enough money to establish a Lithuanian colonization bank.</p>
   
   <p>Such a corporation would be the richest in the world because we would have not only the capital but our own workers, too. We poor people are powerful, only we need the brains of ants and bees to make us realize it.</p>
   <p>5. With such a group of people and with such an amount of capital, we could go into the most vacant corner and make a living there. In this wise have the kingdoms of Europe been established. All those nations came from Asia, and settled in the vacant spaces, built cities, domains and villages. In the same way we could establish our colony in free, enlightened and rich America. The government is giving millions of acres free in the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, and in other states you can buy for $1.25 and $2.50 an acre. Who then is obstructing our way in getting these lands?</p>
   <p>6. The land bought for $2.50 per acre, cultivated and inhabited will go up to $100 and more per acre, while in the cities the price would rise to $1,000 for a lot. In the same way the American millionaires have come into existence. So, we the poor, obscure Lithuanians can become a rich people, too.</p>
   <p>7. To establish a city is not so hard as many people think. On this land should be built various factories and farms, lumber mills, brick kilns and grain mills. It would be necessary to build stores, houses, churches and schools. All these would be our possessions. It would be necessary to meet the needs of the people. Clothing and building materials would be supplied through our own industries. Around the Lithuanian city would arise Lithuanian villages. The territory would become a small Lithuania. This colony would become the greatest weapon to free our fatherland in Europe. We must mention that for such new colonies the American government is giving help, by granting them free land for schools, known as the school land.</p>
   
   <p>$1.25 per acre we could buy two million acres for the Lithuanian colony in America; land with forests, mines, lakes, rivers and natural resources.</p>
   <p>Such a Lithuanian colony and its industry would attract the attention of the railroad companies, the commercial industrialists, etc., by seeing the Lithuanian industry and diligence.</p>
   <p>In the Lithuanian schools after ten years our children would take courses in universities, engineering schools and other educational institutions.</p>
   <p>10. How to establish this organization with such broad aims and purposes? The first foundation of this society for the establishment of Lithuanian industry and commerce is the committee of Zinycia, which will be the first branch of this organization. The purpose and the foundation of this organization is explained above. Every member will pay ten cents per month to cover the expenses of the committee of Zinycia. It will be necessary for every member to buy a $100 share to form the organization's standing capital. But the shares will be sold when the organization is ready to take the proposed action.</p>
   <p>For the time being we will have no laws of our own, the organization will be conducted by the majority vote of the members.</p>
   <p>The committee will be composed of the president, vice-president, financial secretary, secretary and treasurer. The treasurer will be under bond.</p>
   <p>A member of this organization must be a Lithuanian of moral standing and willing to take active part in this organization.</p>
   <p>P. S. The sponsor of this organization was J. J. Hertmanovicz.</p>
