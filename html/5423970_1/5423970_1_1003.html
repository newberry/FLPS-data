   <p>The elections of city aldermen and of Congressman of the Fourth District were held last Tuesday. The aldermanic elections were interesting because of the fact that all of the Socialist candidates were defeated. Even the incumbent Socialist alderman, who represents the Fifteenth Ward, Rodriguez, was defeated and will have to leave his post. The Ninth and Twenty-seventh Wards were supposedly Socialist "strongholds," in which Socialists expected their candidates to win. It is now apparent that their expectations were unfounded.</p>
   <p>Two Lithuanians figured in these elections: Petraitis ran for Alderman of the Fourth Ward, while K. P. Gugis ran for Congressman of the Fourth District. Both were on the Socialist ticket and both were defeated.</p>
   <p>The results in the Fourth Ward were as follows: Richert (Democrat) received 4,834 votes; Petraitis (Socialist), 634 votes.</p>
