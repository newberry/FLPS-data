   <p>Tomorrow is the day when Lenin died a year ago. This is an unhappy anniversary for the working people. With Lenin's death the world's working class has lost its greatest leader.</p>
   <p>On this occasion the American Workers' Party has issued a manifesto which reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"On January 21st one year has elapsed since the death of our great leader, Vladimir Illich Lenin.</p>
   <p>"Do you remember, when one year ago all of the working class' enemies congratulated each other on the death of Lenin?</p>
   <p>"Do you remember that deep sorrow of millions of enslaved people throughout the world after the loss of Lenin?"</p>
   <p>The manifesto encourages further in remembrance of the death of Lenin to:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Unite in struggle against capitalism. Unite against reduction of wages, against breaking of unions, against "open shop." Unite to defend the arrested workers in the State of Michigan."</p>
   <p>At the end, the manifesto encourages invitation of workers to join the American Workers' Party.</p>
   <p>January 21st is a historical day, on which conscious workers of the world will remember their great leader, Lenin.</p>
