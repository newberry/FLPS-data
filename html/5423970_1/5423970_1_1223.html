   <p>The fervor and excitement of the people of the United States have now reached a high pitch. However, if the United States becomes involved in the present European war, there may be some people who will become so enraged thereby that they will commit rash and foolish acts. In this connection, we wish to give our readers a few words of warning and some good advice.</p>
   <p>If the United States should declare war on Germany, it is very unlikely that she will send an army to Europe. Instead, this country will most probably raise a big army by means of voluntary enlistment or some other means, because it is apparent that if Germany should win the war, then, like God in heaven, she would most likely seek revenge against the United States. If the United States should become involved in the war, she would most likely assist the Allies with loans, heavy guns and ammunition, and by sending her <span class="page-break">\2</span>navy to Europe. Therefore, there is no great danger to the lives of the people of the United States.</p>
   <p>The editors of the Lietuva wish to warn Lithuanian-American citizens, and all Lithuanians in general, to be very cautious in what they do and what they say. We who are American citizens became citizens of this country through our own free will, and we swore complete loyalty to this country, which gave us asylum from persecution in our own fatherland. No one wants war, and this includes us. But if this country finds itself unable to choose any other alternative, then let us remember that we are and must remain loyal American citizens, and that we must be fully prepared to fulfill the duties and obligations of American citizenship.</p>
   <p>For their own good, let us try to restrain those of our fellow countrymen who attempt to talk too freely; war is no joking matter, and persons who let their tongues indulge too freely in unnecessary criticism will probably meet with many unpleasantries. Whenever people become enraged they are <span class="page-break">\3</span>likely to utter rash words that can get them into trouble. We are citizens of the United States, which has given us asylum, and during a time when this country is in trouble, it is our sacred duty to be loyal citizens and good friends of America.</p>
   <p>We still have hopes, however, that the war danger will pass, but if it does not pass and if war really comes--which none of us want--then let us keep in mind the foregoing words of advice.</p>
