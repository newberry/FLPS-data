   <p>Andrews Graicziunas has graduated in Chicago in a course in medicine. The Lithuanians ought to be glad to have a Lithuanians doctor. In any sickness they can call the doctor and speak in their own language. When you cannot speak the language even the best doctor cannot explain to you how to take care of yourself in time of sickness.</p>
