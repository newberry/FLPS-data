   <p>In No. 44 of Lietuva Mr. Pazistamas replies to the article of Dr. Rev. Juodiszius in regard to our schools. He brought up the important question of having reliable Lithuanian teachers for the Lithuanian schools. If the rich Lithuanians or priests or business people could agree among themselves to send a few good Lithuanian students to schools, where they could get proper education in normal schools, then they would be much better teachers than the Polish nuns.</p>
   <p>This is a very important question, if the well-to-do Lithuanians would give a small part of their money for the benefit of Lithuanians. If they would start, then others, the workers, no doubt would donate as much as they could for this great cause of Lithuanian schools.</p>
   <p>At one time we heard from Mr. A. L. Graiczunas that the Lithuanian rector of Chicago had told him that the priests had their convention in Pennsylvania, that the clergy at this convention decided not to help the Lithuanian students in secular education. We hardly can believe that the Lithuanian clergy would decide against secular education because without the intellectuals educated in secular institutions it will be impossible to uplift Lithuanianism. Besides religious education among Lithuanians there must be public education too, because at present one can hardly get a place for a spiritual leader among Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>We do not understand why the clergy are against the secular education. There is a broad field for parochial and public education. There is a lot of work for both. Why obstruct enlightenment of the people. The Lithuanians are suffering from lack of intellectuality.</p>
   <p>The spiritual leaders further say that the church is upholding the morale of the people. We agree with that. Yet, from the practical point of view we see that the church does not uplift nor enforce the morale of the people. We know that the Lithuanian Catholic churches never have been filled with the people. That the morality of the churchgoers is not improving, that the drunkenness is not on decrease but on the increase. We see among other nations that their churches are crowded with the people to capacity, and their morale is higher than among the Lithuanians. Why? Because they have a better public education than we Lithuanians. This proves that the parochial education alone without the public education does not uphold the morale of the people.</p>
