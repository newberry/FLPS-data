   <p>The majority of us Lithuanian-Americans have come from our motherland, Lithuania, only a short time ago. In most cases we were village-dwellers occupied in farming. An inadequate social order and a cruel government did not permit us to live there happily. By unbearable taxation and through its refusal to concern itself with the improvement of farming methods, the government forced many good farmers to leave their farms and migrate to the cities and even to other countries to seek a livelihood.</p>
   <p>The majority came to this much-praised country of America, expecting to be able to earn a morsel of bread more easily. Some of those who came here were successful in earning a few cents and are returning to Lithuania where, with their earnings, they intend to improve their farms.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Saloon Businesses Are Not God</p>
   <p>However, the majority of those who came here have not been successful in accumulating a fortune. Others, though they have saved up fortunes, are not even thinking of returning to Lithuania. Some do not want to; others cannot. Those who have something saved frequently enter business in order to earn an easier livelihood. Most frequently they engage in the saloon business. The saloon business is well-known. If the saloon is in a good location a person can get rich. But this wealth, eventually, benefits neither the saloonkeeper nor his friends. Continually standing behind the bar, in an atmosphere of stale air, he gets rheumatism or some other illness in a few years and his savings are spent on attempts to cure what often are incurable diseases.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians also enter other kinds of businesses. If they understand the business and have a good location, under favorable circumstances they can eke out an existence. But the majority of the new businessmen do not <span class="page-break">3</span>meet with success. On the contrary, expecting to get rich quick, they lose everything. Then they damn business and go into the factories or mines to earn their bread.</p>
   <p>An Easy Job Is Not a Blessing</p>
   <p>What happens to a Lithuanian who has quit business and has again become a laborer? Working in a factory at various machines and in foul-smelling surroundings, exerting himself from morning to night (and doing the same thing every day), the workman's health soon reacts to such conditions. When a young man arrives here from Lithuania he is husky, strong, and straight. His cheeks are rosy--in other words, he is a man fit to push over a building.</p>
   <p>He goes to work in a factory. At first it seems to him that his work is of the easiest kind. Most of the time he merely sits down and guides a machine. Why, even a little child can do that!</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>But let us look at him three or four years later. His brightness and his rosy cheeks have disappeared. His eyes are sunken and have blue rings under them. His whole appearance, compared to the way he looked three or four years ago, makes an awful impression on us. And, if he continues to sit there, his constitution finally becomes so weak that it easily succumbs to some disease--most often tuberculosis--and that young man who was so well a few years ago goes back to Lithuania seeking health. One must weep when he thinks of the fate of such a man.</p>
   <p>Let us say that John found a good job in a clean factory. He does not always sit in one place but, once in a while, does some physical work. Nothing, therefore, harms his health.</p>
   <p>As time passes, John's earnings become greater and greater. John is certain that he is a most fortunate man. His family is satisfied, everybody is in good health and only good fortune beckons in the future. But <span class="page-break">5</span>one day John is brought home, very pale. His family is alarmed. His wife frantically asks what has happened. It is explained to her that John must have come to work without having had enough sleep. He stuck his hand in a machine and lost it there. The family cries and weeps. And why shouldn't they weep? The family breadwinner has suddenly lost his health and his job and the family is threatened by hunger and cold.</p>
   <p>Another Lithuanian settles near a coal mine. There is little hardship in learning mining and, having the strength, one can soon begin earning good money. But misfortune also can easily befall one here. A piece of coal falls, crushes a foot or a hand, and a person is made a cripple for life. Or, still worse, through carelessness the mine catches on fire and an entire group is buried in flames and smoke.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Here They See Things Never Witnessed in Lithuania</p>
   <p>Another somehow learns some kind of a trade, thus hoping to become independent and free without a boss over his head. But even he cannot hide from misfortune. Unexpectedly, had times, something we never heard of in Lithuania, come upon us and the laborer loses his factory job.</p>
   <p>Together with the common laborer the tradesman becomes aware of hardship when hard times arrive. The businessman and the professional group are also affected, for, earning nothing, the people strive to get along without professional assistance. Hardship overtakes everybody. The tailor, the storekeeper, the doctor, and, most of all, the common worker suffer.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to earn anything. Yet, ironically, the cost of living rises daily. The fruits of this suffering, especially in larger cities, <span class="page-break">7</span>are robberies and murders. They happen so frequently that it seems the newspapers do not busy themselves with anything but reports of robberies and homicides. In the cities, especially, this is well-known.</p>
   <p>However, not all of us understand and recognize our unfortunate situation. The majority of us have become so accustomed to these conditions that we feel they cannot be otherwise, that this is our fate. We have come to believe that this is all we can expect. And, until somebody calls these conditions to our attention, we do nothing about correcting them. We imagine that we have to live in rotten, foul air; that we have to work in dangerous places where injury and death are daily threats; that we have to eat food without knowing from what it is made. (We often receive fabricated milk and butter which have never seen a cow.) We seem to recognize these conditions as our fate and we nurture no hope of ever escaping it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>What Statistics Show</p>
   <p>If we look around we find many places where the living conditions differ greatly from those of city dwellers. Statistics show that a smaller percentage of the people live in cities. Of 91,972,266 people in the United States (census of 1910) only 42,623,383 live in cities; 49,348,883 live on farms or in villages having a population of less than 2,500. That larger part of the population living on farms and in villages is not subject to those dangers to health and life, those worries, hardships, and bad times which plague the people in the crowded cities. They eat healthful foods which they themselves prepare. They breathe pure air and not the foul smells and dust inhaled by the city dwellers. By drinking the pure water of the springs or wells they avoid many of the diseases which, every summer, send thousands of city dwellers to their graves. Farmers average nearly ninety years of life, while city dwellers find it difficult to reach their fiftieth or sixtieth year. Thousands of children die in the cities from diseases brought on by impure milk, <span class="page-break">9</span>while cases of this sort are practically unknown on the farms. Statistics show these things clearly; so, it seems, there can be no doubt about them. A city dweller sits down at the table, complaining that he does not want to eat, that he has no appetite; the farmer, without any complaints, finishes one plate after another.He works and sleeps in fresh air. You who have lived in the villages of Lithuania remember this and will bear me out. In the summertime the city dwellers must go up to the roofs to get a bit of fresh air and to escape the dust; the farmer, having no thought for the discomforts of city dwellers, romps in his orchard, under the green trees, on the soft, green lawn where nature buoys a man's spirit, commanding him to forget his weariness.</p>
   <p>On a Sunday the farmer, having a free day, walks about his farm, rejoicing and comforting himself with his cattle and the growth of his grain and fruit; the city dweller, having nothing to do, goes to a saloon where he mingles with people of wicked character and learns to drink and to <span class="page-break">10</span>gamble. He loses his job and becomes a drudge of the streets, often compelled to fight against hunger and cold. He becomes a robber and a murderer--in other words, the worst kind of creature on earth. After coming home from school the farmer's children play on the grass or on a sandpile, removed from all danger. Where do the city children play? Why, in the street! In the street where danger threatens every minute from every passing wagon and automobile. The city people know how often accidents befall children playing in the streets. Unfortunately, it has been my lot already to have witnessed four such unfortunate accidents involving children; a wagon ran over one child's arm, another's leg was broken and, on the other two occasions automobiles killed the children instantly. Those were horrible occasions in my life. I never want to witness such happenings again.</p>
   <p>Having compared life on the farms and in the cities, I believe that everybody, and especially the people of a big city, will admit that our blessing lies on the farms. Only the wealthy can live under sanitary <span class="page-break">11</span>conditions in a big city. In their free time they get into their automobiles and go out to the open country for a breath of fresh air. In the summer they go to their summer homes. But the poor workingman must eat the dust of the city always. There are no pleasures for him.</p>
   <p>You Must Be Careful</p>
   <p>But not every farmer everywhere is successful and contented.</p>
   <p>It sometimes happens that, when purchasing a farm, a person does not make a careful investigation and is therefore cheated by the agent. Only after making a down payment does the buyer realize that the soil is worthless and that he will not be able to make a living from it. Land placed for sale in such localities is fertilized only for that occasion. Having brought a prospect to view the land, they show him how wonderfully the clover and grain are growing. But when a person buys that land and <span class="page-break">12</span>plants it in the usual way he realizes that what he had seen was only a "feigned" fertility and he knows he was cheated.</p>
   <p>I noticed a letter in a recent issue of the Lietuva, in which A. Zemaitis, a farmer of Dodson, Louisiana, wrote of the farming opportunities in Louisiana. I was very much interested. Not being entirely convinced by him, I turned to the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, inquiring about the climate, fertility, and the possibilities of cattle raising in Louisiana. The Department's reply agrees with Mr. Zemaitis' claims. A study of grain statistics revealed that much more can be gained from the soil in the South than in the North. In the South the price of land is not at all high, compared to prices in Northern and Central states. If you have five or six hundred dollars cash you can, by buying on the installment plan, obtain a medium-sized farm. The Polish and Slovak colonies, started there about five years ago, are so much improved that, in many instances, farms which were purchased for a thousand dollars are today valued at ten and fifteen thousand dollars.</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>Those people have found happiness there and have no thoughts of returning to the cities or mines. The climate is especially suitable for farming. There is practically no winter. In January, when Northern farmers are compelled to remain indoors, the farmers of Louisiana are planting potatoes, which are dug up in May and sent north, where they sell for a good price. Having harvested the potatoes, they plant corn or other grain. The cattle need never be fed. They stay in the pastures the year around. In the summer the heat is no greater than in Northern states. The hottest day came in 1911, when the temperature reached 110 degrees. Such heat often visits the colder places in the North.</p>
   <p>Since we Lithuanians are, by birth, farmers and, since we have experience in farming, it is not advisable for us to crowd into factories, suffering hardships to master a job we may lose any day. There are so many opportunities on the farms for us not only to make a living, but even, by living intelligently, easily to get rich.</p>
   <span class="page-break">14</span>
   <p>I believe that, because of the unemployment in the cities and because the farm question is now being discussed among Lithuanian-Americans, these words of mine will not have been written in vain.</p>
