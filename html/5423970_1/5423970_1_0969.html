   <p>Messrs. M. Waranka, Fr. Masionis, J. Grinius and W. Wabalas organized a new political league under the name The Lithuanian-American Republican League.</p>
   <p>We cannot understand why they organized another league. In Chicago there are two Lithuanian political leagues, why do they organized the third one, we cannot understand.</p>
   <p>It is much better to have a fewer and better organizations instead of many and worthless ones.</p>
