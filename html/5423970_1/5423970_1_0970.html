   <p>After long agitation and many discussions, the Alliance of the Lithuanian Political Clubs was at last organized the 9th day of December. There were nine Lithuanian political clubs in Chicago. These clubs worked separately and many times worked against each other. Now we are organized into one strong Lithuanian political organization. This organization will be known as the Lithuanian Republican Alliance of the State of Illinois. The following officers were elected: President. A. Olszewski; vice-president, Franciszkus Palionis; first secretary, Motiejus Waranka; second secretary, Petras Jonaitis; treasurer, Wincentis Wasilianskas.</p>
   <p>The following wards joined this alliance: Wards 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 18 and 23. While the 7th and 29th wards have not joined our organization as yet, we are asking those two wards to join our alliance without delay. Let us show to other nationalities that we Lithuanians are just as good as the other people.</p>
