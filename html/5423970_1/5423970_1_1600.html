   <p>One of the most important decisions made at the meeting was that every member be asked to recruit at least one new member. In that way we will have the benefit of a larger membership, and at the same time we will be able to invest more money, thus earning a greater profit. The association will benefit ten-fold if we increase the membership. Every member should be interested and help to build up the association, which is very important to our people, especially, to those who want to make a sound investment.</p>
   <p>It is pleasant to know we have elected three well-known business men in Chicago, as new members of the board of directors. These three men are chairman of three different chapters of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. They are experienced, and will help the association to grow stronger and bigger. Mr. F. Siratavicius, secretary, is a well-known business man of Marquette Park; Mr. George Stungis, is president, and Mr. J. Pocins, chairman. The above mentioned, are newly elected executives of the Building and Loan Association. We are confident that the business of the association will increase during the coming year,and hope to obtain better results than last.</p>
