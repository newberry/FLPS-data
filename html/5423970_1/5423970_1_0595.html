   <p>In the April 2 issue of the Lietuva, J. J. Hertmanavicius states that the Poles of America, under the leadership of the Polish National Alliance, plan to erect a statue in Washington, D. C., of Thaddeus Kosciusko, famous Lithuanian hero of the American Revolution. He wrote about the "close ties" and the "brotherly relations" which existed between the Poles and the Lithuanians in the past, and raised the following question: "Would the Lithuanians accept an invitation to assist the Poles in this matter"?</p>
   <p>Mr. Hertmanavicius should go to the Poles with his question: "Will the Poles invite the Lithuanians to help them erect a statue of Kosciusko"?</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>As to whether or not the Lithuanians would accept such an invitation is another question. The latter may be answered as follows: If there are still some Lithuanians left who are willing to co-operate with, and be enslaved by, the Poles then we repudiate them and are not responsible for their acts.</p>
   <p>The Poles are not doing us any harm by honoring our fellow-countryman, Kosciusko; we can be proud of the fact that a son of Lithuania is recognized as a hero and a pillar of liberty. However, any co-operation of the Lithuanians with the Poles is unthinkable. We have had bitter experiences with the Poles not only in the Fatherland but also here in America. Dr. J. Sliupas performed a very patriotic deed when he completely divorced the Lithuanians from the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Poles in this country. The behavior of the Poles with Lithuanian divinity students in the St. Stanislaus School in Chicago and in the Polish Seminary at Orchard Lake, Michigan, should be enough to convince even the most skeptical Lithuanian that it would not only be useless but also a disgrace to continue any association with the Poles. The Poles are continuously advocating that a Lithuanian is a Pole, but a Pole is only a Pole. This Polish attitude reminds me of an American proverb: "What is yours is also mine, but what is mine is not yours."</p>
   <p>The statement of Mr. Hertmanavicius that the Lithuanians and the Poles are still "united" politically, is not only untrue but also a big joke. We all know that the Lithuanians are fighting for a free Lithuania, independent of Poland, with Vilna as the capital; whereas the Poles are fighting to include Lithuania in a free Polish state, with a common capital at Warsaw. If <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Mr. Hertmanavicius still does not know that the "ties that bind the Lithuanians with the Poles" are decayed and broken, then he alone should join and co-operate with the Poles. Let him confine all his activities with the Poles; we Lithuanians are very anxious to forget those "ties" of which he speaks.</p>
   <p>In the April 16 issue of the Lietuva (Lithuania) Mr. Hertmanavicius states that the Poles have already invited all Lithuanian organizations that have a membership of 500 or more and a number of distinguished Lithuanian patriots to take part in a Polish congress to discuss ways and means for erecting a statue of Kosciusko in Washington, D. C. I hope with all my heart that not even one faint-hearted Lithuanian will be found to represent our people at that congress.</p>
   <p>Let the Poles hold congresses and split their heads in the efforts to devise means of enticing the Lithuanians, but we who have learned from bitter experience, will not put our necks in a beautifully decorated noose.</p>
