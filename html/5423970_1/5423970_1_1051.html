   <p>In the vicinity of 33rd and Halsted Streets, robbery and attack on Lithuanians by Irish gangsters is a daily occurrence. Many Lithuanians have been robbed and beaten. On March 5, one Lithuanian, Justinas Petrulevicius, was killed. He had a wife and two children of four and five years of age in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The local police do not try to stop the daily attacks on Lithuanians because the robbers are Irish. And the Lithuanians do not know where to make complaint against the police for not stopping these robberies.</p>
   <p>All the Lithuanians who have been attacked or robbed should come to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>office of Lietuva to sign a petition which will be taken to the Police Captain. We will ask him why the local police does not stop the robbers and does not protect the public.</p>
   <p>The majority of the people in this vicinity are Lithuanians. We must demand that our rights and property be protected from the Irish robbers.</p>
