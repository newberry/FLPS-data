   <p>The Lithuanian colony committee came back from the state of Arkansas and reported that they were in Prairie County, Hazen township.</p>
   <p>The committee said that the land there was very good, where everything could be raised, except winter crops of wheat and rye. The price of the land there is from four to eight dollars an acre, on easy payments.</p>
   <p>The committee said that they have no objection to the land, but they thought that the climate was too hot for Lithuanians. The committee said: "As to the land, it would be the best place for the Lithuanians."</p>
   <p>If you people do not believe the report of this committee, you can elect another committee to investigate the land in Arkansas.</p>
