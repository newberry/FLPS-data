   <p>This year in Chicago there was elected a new city administration. The democrats have governed the city for almost ten years, now the voters have elected a republican administration. The rulers of the city will be different in name only, graft and wasting of money will go as usual. The American voters are so stupid that they will not vote for intelligent and honest candidates. The ignorant citizens believe what the yellow press says about the candidate. It is known to every prudent person, that the yellow press of Chicago or of America never has agitated for honest candidates. In America the yellow press thinks for the ignorant citizens of this country - the ignorant voters believe and obey.</p>
