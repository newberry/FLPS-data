   <p>Two weeks ago a new column was established in Lietuva (Lithuania); it is called "Kaip Buti Sveikam" (How to be Healthy), and is conducted by Dr. S. Biezis.</p>
   <p>Probably readers of the Lietuva have already realized that this column promises to be very useful. In the first column, Dr. Biezis discussed various diseases in general; in the second column, he explained diphtheria.</p>
   <p>His articles, which are in reality short and concise lectures, are written in a language that every Lithuanian can easily understand. We feel that they might very well be read at meetings of our societies; it would be a very good thing if this were done at all meetings, especially at the end of each meeting.Questions on health will be answered by Dr. Biezis in his column. All those who have questions, should address them to Dr. S. Biezis, care of Lietuva, 814 West 33rd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   
   <p>This column promises to be highly educational and useful. For that reason, we urge our readers for their own benefit, to read each issue of it carefully.</p>
