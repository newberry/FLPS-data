   <p>No matter to what side we look, we find that the Lithuanians are fearful; they are ashamed of their Lithuanian names, they are timid to show themselves real Lithuanians. It was discussed before in the Lithuanian newspapers about the Lithuanian names, that all Lithuanians should write plainly and shorten their names.</p>
   <p>For example, such a name as Buragas, and yet the Lithuanians are writing the same name as Buragiawiczius. Why are we using suffixes such as "ski," or "wicz?" Such a suffix is Polanization of the Lithuanian name.</p>
   <p>A short Lithuanian name is much easier for Americans to pronounce. Do not think that the Polish suffix to your name gives you higher honor or more respect. It does not. Lithuanians must use their own names, without any suffix, because our names are short and beautiful. Do not Polanize your name.</p>
