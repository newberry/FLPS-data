   <p>Two days ago, the Court of Appeals in Chicago handed down a decision that condemns peaceful picketing as harmful to the business of the firm where such picketing is conducted. The decision was made in connection with the case of Philip Henrici, restaurant proprietor, and his employees who conducted a long strike in 1914. This decision of the Illinois Appellate Court is a serious threat to the working people. Court decisions in America are more powerful than legislative enactments, and if the above decision stands, the working people will lose their most important weapon in strikes. They will not have the right to warn their comrades away from a shop where a strike is in progress. If the capitalists have been able with the aid of the police to get "scabs" to work in a shop or store where a strike is in progress, then with the aid of the foregoing court decision, they will succeed to a greater extent.</p>

   <p>This means that as time goes on things are steadily growing worse in this "free" country, the government of which is in the hands of the capitalists.</p>
