   <p>February 26, several men and women who are boarding at Lithuanian homes held a meeting; they agreed that a Lithuanian Boarders' Union is necessary. Some of the housewives are dealing dishonestly with their boarders as well as being unclean; they cook the sausages in the pot at the same time with the laundry, they do not make the meals on time, fix the beds only once a week, wash clothes once a month, etc.--this is unhuman. There is no way that we can force them to be more considerate except by organizing a union among ourselves.</p>
   <p>Therefore, after a long discussion, we came to the conclusion that we should appeal to our brother boarders. We are asking you to call meetings where you can discuss this very important problem: how to organize a strong union.</p>
   <p>Do not delay, organize, because the housewives are organizing among themselves, with the purpose of exploiting us even more.</p>
