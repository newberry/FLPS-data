   <p>The capitalists are demanding military preparedness, but they seek to place the burden of the cost upon the shoulders of the common people. "Preparedness" is a good business proposition for manufacturers and bankers. Within the period of only one year the capital of the munitions companies has been increased by $866,000,000. Those who profit from "preparedness" should also pay for it.</p>
   <p>The working people are in no need of military preparedness. Their living standards are now so low that new taxes would be unbearable. The Industrial Relations Commission reported that approximately one third of all the adult male workers earn less than ten dollars a week, and that about two thirds earn less than fifteen dollars a week. Are they not already exploited enough?</p>
