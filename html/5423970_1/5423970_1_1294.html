   <p>The annual Memorial Day parade took place last week in Chicago. As usual, the parade was devoted to a display of American militarism. Many people who witnessed the parade and noticed the gold decorations on army officers, undoubtedly felt for a moment that they were not in America, the land of the free, but in Russia, which is oppressed by the czars, or in Germany, where the army is held in first place and employed to suppress liberty. It appears that America, after going through a few minor wars, has become overwhelmed with the spirit of militarism and is now imitating Europe.</p>
