   <p>May 24, the so-called Lithuanian-Polish society Unya Lubelska (The Lublin Union), presented the drama, "Kosciusko pod Roclawicarni," at the Pulaski Hall, 800 S. Ashland Avenue. At this play only the Polish language was heard. The officials of this society are Poles. Only the Polish language is used at the meetings of this society. Why did they named it the Lithuanian-Polish society when the Lithuanian language is not in use? What benefit do the Lithuanians get by joining the Polish society where they have no voice nor rights? The Lithuanians should join the Lithuanian National Alliance, their own organization and build their society, not the Polish.</p>
