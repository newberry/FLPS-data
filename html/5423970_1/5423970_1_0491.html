   <p>We are announcing to all the members of the Zinycia that, according to the statutes of the state of Wisconsin, where the Zinycia is incorporated, every member of the organization must pay as a first installment not less than 20% of the total value of the shares which he intends to acquire. He who will not pay right away that amount on the stock cannot be a member of the corporation. Therefore, we are reminding our members to make their first payment as specified above, because in a short time a meeting will be held by this organization. At this meeting we will elect a new administration. On March 1, 1907, the new administration will take the money from the present one and will make a contract with the land company to buy land for a Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>We are reminding everyone that the membership fees up to March 1, 1907, are $3. After that date they will be $5. Whoever wants to have a voice in electing the new administration must pay 20% of the total value of the shares he has agreed to buy.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanavice, Chairman.</p>
