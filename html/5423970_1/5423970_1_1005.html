   <p>Preparations are now being made in all sections of the United States for the coming presidential election, which is scheduled to take place in the fall of next year. Although the candidates of the various political parties have not yet been nominated, nevertheless it is apparent that extensive preparations for the election are being made all over the country.</p>
   <p>Lithuanian-American citizens, like all other citizens of the United States, will participate in this election. Every citizen will cast a vote for one of the candidates for president. Everyone will give his vote to that candidate who, in the opinion of the voter, promises to do the most good for the voter and the entire nation.</p>
   <p>All individuals who participate in the political activities of the nation <span class="page-break">2</span>know that an organized body of voters exerts great power and influence. Lithuanian voters can also enjoy political power and influence, to the same extent as citizens of other nationalities. However, in order to develop such power and influence it is first necessary for Lithuanian-American citizens to become organized. Now is the time to start thinking about such matters.</p>
   <p>Thus far, in spite of their comparatively large numbers, Lithuanians have enjoyed very little power and influence in American politics. The main reason for this is undoubtedly that the political activities of Lithuanian voters consist merely of extemporaneous mass meetings during election campaigns. These meetings are usually called by some non-Lithuanian politicians for the purpose of influencing Lithuanian voters to vote for them or for the candidates they represent.</p>
   <p>Whenever we cast a vote for any candidate we are at the same time endowing him with a certain amount of responsibility. An elected candidate is <span class="page-break">3</span>responsible to his constituents. However, that responsibility has a real value only when an organized body of voters can control the official whom they have elected and can demand an account of his activities during the term of his office. Such an organization would also be beneficial in that it would be in an excellent position to expose those politicians who are primarily interested in patronage. Then the vote of a Lithuanian-American citizen would not be wasted. This is true in regard to local as well as national politics.</p>
   <p>If we elect a Lithuanian-American to public office, then we would do so not merely because he is of Lithuanian extraction, but chiefly because he is qualified for public office, because he will be a good public servant and will be of service to the Lithuanian voters who had elected him.</p>
   <p>All this is possible if we would only have a suitable organization of Lithuanian-American citizens. Such an organization should be formed for the coming presidential election. Afterwards, it would be very useful in local elections.</p>

   <p>Now is the time to prepare for action in this field. Will we do so?</p>
