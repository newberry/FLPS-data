   <p>We are glad to hear that our brothers are working for the national cause, but we are very sad that our Lithuanian sisters do not take part in the activity for the national cause of Lithuanianism.</p>
   <p>The mothers are rearing the children; the mother's inspiration to the child never dies. Only the mother's inspiration to the child results in national heroes.</p>
   <p>We are sorry to say that most of our sisters instead of helping our men work for the national cause, are against it. The duty of our sisters should be to help their brothers enlighten our ignorant brothers and sisters. We can spread enlightenment through good newspapers and books. Only enlightened and cultured mothers can raise a good family, therefore, we must enlighten ourselves in order to bring forth mentally strong generations in the future.</p>
