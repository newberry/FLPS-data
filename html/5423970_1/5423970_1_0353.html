   <p>p.4..... The 269th Lithuanian local of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America held a meeting on Saturday, Jan. 16. New officers were elected. A. Cepaitis was elected president.</p>
   <p>It was decided at this meeting to affiliate with the League of Chicago Lithuanian Societies. A decision was also made to contribute $10.00 from the treasury to the Lithuanian Relief Fund to aid war refugees in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Our delegate, A. Baciunas, who attended the national convention of the Amalgamation in New York, was supposed to have made his report at this meeting. However, he failed to attend the meeting. Apparently he is not interested in the affairs of the union, because the union failed to find him a job.</p>
   <p>Bitter debates took place at the meeting because the delegate failed to <span class="page-break">\2</span>attend and deliver his report. Many demanded to know the reasons why he not only failed to attend the meeting but also did not inform the local of his reasons for doing so.</p>
   <p>According to reports made by the retiring officers, this local is in fairly good standing. Attendance to meetings is as good as can be expected.</p>
