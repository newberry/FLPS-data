   <p>General William C. Gorgas, chief surgeon of the United States Army, and who is famous for banishing yellow fever from the Panama Canal district, delivered a speech at the Congress of Missionaries, on April 29, at Washington, D. C. He stated in his talk that poverty is the main obstacle in the way of banishing unsanitary living conditions. He further stated that "poverty is also the greatest obstacle in the way of morality and religion."</p>
   <p>To us, Socialists, this is not a new thought. We have been repeating it for many years. We have been taught by Socialism to understand that principle which declares that economic conditions of the people are the foundation of the life of the people, morally, religiously, etc. For advocating such materialistic ideas we are being continuously denounced by priests and their followers. But it has been revealed that even a person, who never has had anything in common with the Socialists, recognizes that very same thought on the basis of his own experience in life; he made that admission at the above-mentioned congress of missionaries.</p>
