   <p>Five Lithuanian Socialists, members of the Socialist Party of America, were arrested by Chicago police on Aug. 7 at an open-air mass meeting on the corner of 33rd and Morgan Street. Apparently the police, who boast of American liberty, do not like these street meetings of Socialist agitators. The police desired to arrest Socialist orators on a number of occasions before, but due to an overwhelming number of listeners, they did not dare to do so.</p>
   <p>A fairly large number of people were listening to one of the Socialist speakers on the above mentioned corner when a squad of police suddenly appeared on the scene and dispersed the audience with clubs. Those who were arrested are: J. Semaskus, D. Matuzas, P. Treinauskas, A. Slazas, and Z. Saulauskas.</p>
