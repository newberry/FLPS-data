   <p>The sentenced workers are coal miners and members of the coal miners' union. Off hand we are unable to determine whether or not these workers were really so guilty that they should merit such a severe penalty.</p>
   <p>However, we will hardly make a mistake by saying that if capitalists instead of workers were brought before the court and tried on more serious charges, they would not be thrown into a jail cell.</p>
