   <p>I want to say a few words here about a food store. However, I wish to announce in advance that I will speak only about a co-operative food store.</p>
   <p>Local grocers and butchers are attempting to convince the people that the proposed Cicero Lithuanian co-operative food store desires only to hurt private business. That is not true; we have no such motive. We only want to know what kind of food we are eating and how much that food is worth. Naturally, private businessmen will not and cannot give us that information. We will know these things only when we ourselves become the owners of a co-operative, that is, when we have a store of our own.</p>
   <p>No human being and no other living creature wants to live at the "mercy" of another; everyone knows from experience how "pleasant" such dependence can be. Then why should food, upon which our very existence depends, be placed in the <span class="page-break">2</span>care of others? We often hear charges that food unfit to eat is being sold here and there by grocers and butchers. This is being done by private businessmen because they make a greater profit by so doing. And the present capitalist society is based on nothing else but profit. This is the reason why the Lithuanians of Cicero have awakened and are now organizing a co-operative food store.</p>
   <p>Many people say that a co-operative store cannot hold out, and that after a short existence such stores go bankrupt, etc. But the time is long past when such things were true; the "smart alecs" who used to control co-operative stores and who played hard and fast with the money of ignorant and unsuspecting people are unable to do so any longer. Today there is more enlightenment and understanding among the people. The people no longer place the management of their affairs into the hands of unreliable people. Cicero Lithuanians are taking full advantage of the experience of others. They will know how to handle their own affairs. For that reason they do not intend to become frightened by the babble of private businessmen.</p>
