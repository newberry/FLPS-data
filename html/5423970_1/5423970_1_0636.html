   <p>We, the American Lithuanians are making our living by hard labor, because we cannot get better jobs with higher wages due to our lack of education. We cannot improve our living conditions, as we have no unity among ourselves for the lack of education.</p>
   <p>For that reason we must suffer. We are making a bare living as long as we have a job, but as soon as the dull season comes, we are on the edge of starvation. A few of us save some money, deposit it in the bank, and then the others are doing business and profiting with our money. If the Lithuanians were an enlightened and educated people, they could open businesses with their own money. Look at the people of other nations, as soon as they make some money, they go into business. If the Lithuanians were enlightened, they could organize among themselves to open here and there small businesses, small factories, and later on we could develop into a large business <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>By having a big business we could not only make a better living for ourselves, but we could establish schools, where we could educate our unfortunate brothers, and the most important thing is to educate our children, make then good Lithuanians. Then let our young generation look back on our accomplishments, then the young Lithuanian generation by seeing our established business and factories, would get more inspiration, and would go further with new ideas, by enlarging the business and the Lithuanian industry. Now then brothers, let us have unity, let us put our money in business, let our money work for us, this is the only and proper way to improve our living conditions.</p>
