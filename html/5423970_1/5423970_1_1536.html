   <p>June 3, at the Chicago College of Dental Surgery, two Lithuanian students were graduated and received their diplomas to practice dentistry. They are Petras Petraitis and Kazys Drangelis.</p>
   <p>Antanas Tananevicia was graduated from the Chicago College of Medical Surgery; Antanas Sliakis an American Lithuanian, born in Chicago, graduated from North-western University's school of law; Stasys Petrulis graduated from the Loyola school of pharmacy, and Kazys Gugis graduated as a technical engineer from Armour Institute.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the number of Lithuanian professionals is increasing. We wish them all possible success in their profession. We hope that they will not be dull, independent professionals, but will participate in the cultural activities of the Lithuanians, and will spread the light of knowledge among their brothers.</p>
