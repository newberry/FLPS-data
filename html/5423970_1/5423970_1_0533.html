   <p>Various persons have pointed out to us that the reputation of Lithuanians has been soiled in this country, thanks to the propaganda of many insolent creatures. In various places, Lithuanians are treated with unmistakable unfriendliness, or at least coolness, by Americans.</p>
   <p>When they attempt to present their problems to the big American newspapers, Lithuanians find it almost impossible to have interviews with the editors. In some places, we have learned, Lithuanians have been accused of being "slackers" and on that account, it has been said, they cannot expect the sympathy and support of this country. Our newspapers have a most difficult time in obtaining release from the English-translation ruling, even though some of the German-language newspapers have been granted such releases.</p>
   <p>Many complaints are heard from Lithuanian workers who claim that they are refused work or laid off from their jobs for no apparent reason.</p>
   <p>All of this proves that the Lithuanians are not trusted and are on a sort of parole. This situation has been noticed by people who should know how the Americans regard the Lithuanians. According to these people, the Lithuanians are beginning to be looked upon as "undesirables" in America. They are accused of being syndicalists and members of the I. W. W. and therefore "undesirable". So we should not be surprised if our efforts do not win widespread support.</p>
   <p>Those who know the Lithuanians better know that this opinion is wrong. They know that the majority of Lithuanians are good, orderly citizens but that we have among us a bunch of cry-babies who do much harm to our reputation. Bad is always more noticeable than good.</p>
   <p>Upon reflection we must admit that the above-mentioned observations are true. The presence of various groups of Lithuanian Bolshevik, the frequent "brave", crazy speechmaking of our cry-babies, and the shameless slandering of our Lithuanian factions as "reactionaries" and "German hirelings" (as the Lithuanian-American Workers' Council has called other factions)--all of these things, added to the fact that the I. W. W. and the Bolsheviks support the People's Council, are only a part of the crazy conduct which has defiled the good reputation of the Lithuanians in America.</p>
   <p>What the consequences will be, we cannot predict. But it is clear that Lithuanian-Americans cannot stand idly by while a little group of insolent adventurers injure the reputation and interests of the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>We know very well that, with the exception of that small group of restless people, ninety-nine percent of the Lithuanians here are among the most peaceful and most faithful citizens of this country. They perform their duties to this country honestly and devotedly.</p>
   <p>At this time, when America is becoming more and more involved in the war, the Government and the people of this land cannot tolerate any illegal conduct, even if it is cloaked in innocence. There cannot be a middle or neutral position; you are either a loyal American or a traitor. It is no wonder, then, that the immigrants of various nationalities are now being watched so carefully.</p>
   <p>Will the Lithuanians allow themselves to be marked with the stamp of unfaithfulness? Now is the time to act. It is the time for the Lithuanians to become better organized. By common action, we should convince the people and the Government of this country that the Lithuanians are not the kind of people others are led to believe they are by the actions of a small group. Cry-babies, troublemakers, and adventurists are to be found among any national group and, unfortunately, we have them among us.</p>
   <p>The purchase of Liberty bonds through the Lithuanian Branches is one way the Lithuanians have at present of washing off the undeserved stain of unfaithfulness.</p>
   
   <p>Be loyal! Buy Liberty bonds! Do everything you can to help the country which gave you refuge!</p>
