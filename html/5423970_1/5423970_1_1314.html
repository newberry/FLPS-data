   <p>Another brazen attempt to narrow the rights of the working class is being made by Congressman Blanton of Texas. This reactionary, in a long tirade against strikes, denounced the anarchists, socialists, communists, liberals, trade-unionists, both progressive and conservative, and everybody else who dares to resist or even speak against exploitation.</p>
   <p>Congressman Blanton has introduced a bill in Congress which proposes to prohibit the following: Strikes by railroad and mine workers, political and industrial meetings of protest against the government, and the spreading of inciting literature.</p>
   <p>There is nothing new about Congressman Blanton's scheme. During the big railroad strike, the reactionaries, exploiters, and their servants in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>government advocated the above measures. The injunction issued at that time against the railroad strikers expressly forbade the very same things which Congressman Blanton's bill proposes. However, the scope of that injunction was too broad, and for that reason was crushed. That injunction was answered by the railway strikers with the threat of a general strike. At that time no one even talked about incorporating such measures into a law, as Congressman Blanton is now doing. That injunction did not succeed in preventing strikes. However, it appears that the fat profiteers and their servants never renounced their wicked plans and they still hope to put them into effect.</p>
   <p>Congressman Blanton's bill is merely a repetition of many brazen attempts to take away from the workers their most valuable class-war weapon. The strike is recognized everywhere as the most effective method of the working class in the struggle for a larger bite of bread and for better <span class="page-break">\3</span>working conditions.</p>
   <p>In America, the class struggle is constantly growing keener. Attempts are being made everywhere to lower wages, to lengthen working hours, and to make working conditions worse. An increasing number of bills are being introduced in Congress to abridge the rights of the workers in their struggle against exploitation.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all workers to unite their forces and fight for the preservation of their rights. It is possible to marshal the forces of all factions against the Blanton Bill, because it is a severe threat to the interests of all workers. The same thing can be done in regards to the Oswald Bill, which threatens to cripple the entire labor movement by narrowing the rights of aliens and foreign-born workers in this country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the formation of a labor party would be the only effective means for combating the threats against the working class.</p>
