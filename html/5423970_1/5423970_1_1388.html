   <p>Last Sunday in Chicago and all ever America we celebrated the anniversary of the death of President McKinley. The Republican politicians wanted to make this day a national holiday. Even if the Republicans would succeed, the next party would abolish such a holiday. President McKinley was of benefit to the Republican Party, so the politicians want to make political capital for themselves. President McKinley as a whole has done nothing good for the country.</p>
