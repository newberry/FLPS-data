   <p>The refusal of the United States Government to withdraw the American punitive expedition from Mexico upon the demand of President Carranza has sharply affected relations between the United States and Mexico. The American punitive expedition has been suddenly halted at the town of Parrel. Newspapers report that a unit of the regular Mexican Army had attacked the American expedition "without the least provocation" by the American soldiers. Therefore, the possibility is increasing that the United States Army will clash with the regular Mexican Army. The American press writes that "the capture of Villa" is now a secondary matter to Americans, and that the defense of the punitive expedition from General Carranza's troops is more important.</p>
   <p>The Yankee newspapers appear to be very strange when they write about the absence of any provocation by the United States. What, then, is the whole "punitive expedition" if it is not the greatest provocation against the Mexican people? Just imagine, for example, if several thousand soldiers of a foreign country would invade the United States and conduct a hunt such as General Pershing's army is now doing in Mexico--does anyone doubt that all the Yankees would rise immediately, in a wink of an eye, and make a determined effort to chase the invaders out of the United States? The American army in Mexico is antagonizing the Mexican people, and its presence there is daily increasing the danger of a bloody war between these two countries.</p>
