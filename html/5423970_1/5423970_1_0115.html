   <p>In Bridgeport, Mr. Golubickis and Dr. Graiciunas are going among the Lithuanians, and ask them to sign a petition demanding that Lithuanian be taught in the Armour School. The rule is that if fifty families sign such a petition to have their children taught Lithuanian, the request will be granted. If they succeed, the Armour School will probably be the first in America to teach the Lithuanian language.</p>
