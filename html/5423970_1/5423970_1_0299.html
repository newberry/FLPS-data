   <p>Nearly all Lithuanians were either born or reared on a farm. After emigrating to America, they became factory workers, coal miners, mill hands, store employees, stock-yards workers, etc. Therefore, a comparison between the lives of a workman and a farmer in America should be of immense interest to our people. In order to become thoroughly acquainted with the lives of a workman and a farmer, and learn which is more desirable, it is necessary to make a detailed review of the various social and economic aspects of these two classes of people, and then compare them with each other. The results of this comparison will speak for themselves.</p>
   <p>A Lithuanian workman in the United States, if he is not the master of a trade, or is unable to speak the English language, can find only that kind of employment which requires a great deal of bodily health and physical endurance at very low wages. The average laborer receives from one to two dollars per day. His job is very insecure. He is subject to frequent and sudden lay-offs. During the years of national prosperity, many labor strikes spring up and the <span class="page-break">\2</span>worker is compelled to go out on strike with his fellow workers. He receives no income during these periods. When a business and industrial depression occurs, the worker is laid off and again he has neither job nor income.</p>
   <p>Even during those periods of national prosperity, when no labor strikes take place, the industrial worker often loses his job because of illness. After he recovers from an illness, he is again forced to go out and look for another job, which usually takes a very long time. If he is fortunate enough to locate a good job, and works for a comparatively long time, then he is able to save some of his earnings. However, when a period of forced unemployment occurs, then his savings become exhausted. When he is re-employed, he must start saving all over again.</p>
   <p>We must bear in mind that the above is only the example of an industrial worker who is sincerely interested in his future welfare, and who does not squander his earnings in saloons or for other foolishness. This type represents a very small minority. The earnings of a greater majority of workers do not stretch from one pay day to another. When these workers lose their <span class="page-break">\3</span>jobs, they find themselves without even a bite to eat.</p>
   <p>The living expenses of a workman are very high all over the United States. His earnings are so meager that he is unable to meet the expenses of all the necessary requirements of life, especially if he is married. He cannot afford to live in suitable living quarters, wear decent clothing, attend theatres, send his children through the higher institutions of learning, enjoy a vacation in the country during the summer months in order to get a breath of fresh air and build up his failing health, and he cannot afford to eat any of the more expensive foods, because his meager earnings cannot stand it. He is forced to lead a miserable life of poverty. Even his children have little hope of ever reaching a better, brighter, and happier life.</p>
   <p>The only commodity which a worker has to sell is his health. As long as he enjoys good health, he is able to earn enough for a bare subsistence. However, when his health fails, he comes to the sad realization that with <span class="page-break">\4</span>the labor of his entire lifetime he was unable to earn enough even for bread in his old age, nor for shelter, clothing, or other vital necessities of life.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the life of a workman is full of grief and misery, and without hope for a better and brighter future. He is at all times dependent upon those who are more fortunate than himself. He must fear his superiors and be careful not to be late for work. Regardless of whether he is sick or healthy, he must perform a full day's work; otherwise he will be discharged and left without bread or shelter, and his friends will shy away from him. It is, therefore, not at all surprising that workmen complain so frightfully about their plight and engage in bitter struggles in order to ease the great burden of their lives.</p>
   <p>However, the various struggles between the workers and their employers do not produce any satisfactory results. Whenever the employers shut down their factories, or other forms of enterprise, the workers either starve to death <span class="page-break">\5</span>or move to other sections of the globe.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the life of a workman appears to be highly undesirable. It seems that we should seek other lines of endeavor for our livelihood.</p>
   <p>Now let us review the life of an American farmer.</p>
   <p>A farmer owns a strip of fertile land; he owns a home, a herd of cattle, and enjoys healthy air, water, and food. He does not find it necessary to go out into the garden of nature on week-ends, because he lives in a garden of nature all his life.</p>
   <p>A farmer does not need to pay rent or water tax; he does not need to buy coal if he has kindling wood; it is not necessary for him to buy milk, cheese, or butter; it is unnecessary for him to buy potatoes or other vegetables; it is unnecessary for him to purchase eggs or even meat, because he can always slaughter some of his cattle and have plenty of fresh and healthy meat. A farmer does not need to pay street car fare to get to work; he can ride to <span class="page-break">\6</span>work with his own horses. In other words, a farmer who owns a good farm, does not need to buy anything as far as food is concerned, and for that reason he is independent; he does not know the meaning of a financial crisis. He works on his own farm for himself; he does not fear anyone and is not obliged to obey anybody; he has nofear of losing his job or coming late to work. He is a king on his own land and does not have to fear any bosses.</p>
   <p>A farmer does not need to buy any necessities of life. On the contrary, he has many products to sell. He raises wheat and, after providing for his own needs, he can sell the surplus and receive money for it. When a farmer raises some cattle or poultry, he sells them and receives money. He keeps cows and receives money for their milk. The longer he lives on his farm, the more profits he derives from it. His wealth increases from day to day. It is very plain, therefore, that the life of a farmer is incomparably much more fortunate and happier than that of a workman. All this leads to the inevitable conclusion that there is but one salvation for us Lithuanian-Americans, and that is to take to the land in order to free ourselves from foreign bondage.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>A farmer can send his children first to a country school and later through the higher institutions of learning, because it is not necessary for him to depend upon his children for support. He derives enough bread from his farm for a decent livelihood without the aid of his children. An intelligent and industrious farmer not only provides for the education of his children, from whom he derives great joy and assistance in his old age, but in doing so he also fulfills his obligation to raise the intellectual level of society. Therefore, it would be a very good thing for all Lithuanian-Americans, who are now suffering hopelessly in the service of foreign masters, to give very serious consideration to the idea of settling down on mother earth; we should leave the cities and towns, and shy away from them as from a plague.</p>
   <p>Although the best farm lands are already occupied, nevertheless, there is plenty of good land for colonization purposes still available in the United States. Much of the land, however, is unsuitable for profitable farming, even if it can be procured at comparatively low prices. Therefore, such factors as fertility of the soil, transportation facilities, water supply, etc., must be thoroughly <span class="page-break">\8</span>investigated. Climatic conditions, in order to suit the Lithuanian racial characteristics, also must be taken into consideration. Furthermore, we will be able to preserve our national traditions better and lead a more happier life if we group together, and not scatter ourselves in various sections of the country among farmers of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>The question, then, is how can we realize all these wonderful ideals? The solution of this problem, has been assumed by the Lithuanian colonization society Zinycia (Fountain of Knowledge). During the past three years this society has been actively engaged in a thorough investigation of the various farming sections in the United States. When this society was first organized, and the colonization question was seriously discussed, the members advanced a great variety of suggestions. Some wished to colonize in a warm climate in the southern states; others preferred the western states; and a third group pulled for the eastern states. The latter was soon eliminated from consideration after we learned of the high land prices and dense population of the territory.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>In order to select the best location for the colonization of Lithuanian-Americans, the society decided to launch a very extensive and thorough investigation of all the available farm lands in the United States. The United States Public Land Office was contacted for information about available homesteads. A number of railroads representatives and other land agents were invited to attend meetings of the society to present information on the land situation in America. Contacts were made with individual farmers, both personally and through the mails. Justin F. Jakavicius toured the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and the Indian Territory; his brothers, George and Julius Jakavicius, made a tour of the southern states; Alex Bendris investigated the states of Tennessee and Missouri; Anton Mazeika went to Alabama and the neighboring states; Stanley Mikolaitis and Frank Domeika were sent into the states of Washington, Oregon, and Colorado; other members of the society conducted an investigation in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Information was also sought and received concerning prospective farm lands in the states of California, Utah, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Ohio, South and North Dakota, Minnesota, and in Alaska and Canada.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>After three years of extensive investigation and study, the members of the society finally came to the conclusion that the states of Wisconsin and Michigan offer the best opportunities and advantages for the establishment of a Lithuanian-American farm colony. The southern states were eliminated because it had been learned that Lithuanians would experience some difficulty in adopting themselves to the hot and dry climate. About fourteen years ago Anthony Olis, an active member of the society, had formed a Lithuanian colony in the state of Arkansas. Although the soil was very fertile, nevertheless, the climate proved to be very unhealthy and the colony was forced to disband.</p>
   <p>Minnesota and Dakota were eliminated because of the high cost of land. In the western states too much irrigation is required for successful farming. Heavy and prolonged rainfalls interfere with the prosperity of the farmers in the states of Washington and Oregon. The prevalence of tornadoes, earthquakes, and violent storms in the southern states was also taken into consideration.</p>
   <p>Therefore, after carefully considering the colonization problem from all <span class="page-break">\11</span>angles for three years, the Lithuanian colonization society Zinycia has decided to establish a Lithuanian agricultural colony in the state of Wisconsin. There the land is very fertile, the climate is very suitable and healthy for Lithuanians, and there is an abundant supply of healthy water. It has excellent railroad transportation, good roads, and many large cities and towns. Thousands of farmers in Wisconsin are already enjoying wonderful prosperity. It is, therefore, an established fact that any industrious farmer can make a very good living in Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>The society has selected the northern part of Clark county in the state of Wisconsin an the most ideal location for the establishment of a Lithuanian-American agricultural colony. The society already has purchased a large tract of land in that section of Wisconsin and has named it "Zinycia," after the name of the society. An extensive campaign is now under way to colonize the territory with Lithuanians. Most members of the Zinycia society are already established there and are making splendid progress.</p>
   <p>All land in the northern part of Clark county is very fertile, without stones, <span class="page-break">\12</span>mountains, sand, or large swamps. Transportation facilities are excellent. A beautiful river flows through the territory. There are many old towns near-by, offering a very good market for farm products.</p>
   <p>After the colonization work of the territory is well under way, it is planned to set up a Lithuanian town in the vicinity, with factories, a Lithuanian church, school, etc.</p>
   <p>Therefore, here is an excellent opportunity for all those Lithuanians who desire to free themselves from the misery of city life. It is advisable to purchase a piece of land as soon as possible, while the prices are still low. All Lithuanians are invited to visit the territory and make a personal investigation. The cost of a round trip railroad fare from Chicago is $13.00. For further information write or apply to Mr. A. Olis, General Manager, 3252 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Ill.</p>
