   <p>Appointment of the standing committee on education by the sixteenth annual convention of Sandara (Harmony), held last June, at the Chicago Lithuanian Auditorium, means, if anything, a recognition of the need of education by the American Lithuanians in general, and the members of Sandara in particular.</p>
   <p>This need was further emphasized by Mr. Vitaitis in his banquet speech, at the close of the convention, when he said, "It is not enough to be a good Lithuanian and a good citizen, but one should strive at being a cultural Lithuanian." The fervent applause this remark drew signified the consensus of opinion of those present; but the fact that the convention failed to adapt a definite program in this direction, leaves the problem open, and it is difficult to see what the committee on education can do without funds, or a designated place to hold regular meetings.</p>
