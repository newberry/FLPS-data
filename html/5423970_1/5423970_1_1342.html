   <p>The only Socialist in the United States Congress, Meyer London, has presented a resolution which demands insurance against unemployment, illness and old age for the workers. This is the first time during the existence of the United States Congress that such a plan has been put before it.</p>
   <p>Congressman London favors the principle that the Government should create such an insurance agency, and asks that a committee of five be created to prepare a detailed insurance plan.</p>
   <p>The workers of America can commend this step taken by Congressman London. Whether his demand is fulfilled or not, at least it already has been offered to Congress. The workers will not hesitate to acclaim his demands as the demands of their own class.</p>

   <p>The justice in his demands is too clear to the working people. The people who are creating the wealth of the country with their hands have the right to demand that their welfare be safeguarded when, through no fault of their own, they lose their jobs.</p>
   <p>The worker of the present day has been lowered to the point where he is regarded merely as a tool for creating profits for the capitalists. While he is healthy and strong, and while the merchandise is selling fast, the worker is forced to work long hours and even overtime. But when the worker's energy is gone, or when the market is overflowing with merchandise, the capitalists throw him out into the street as a worthless thing. This is natural according to the capitalists' point of view, but the workers cannot agree with them.</p>
   <p>A worker is not only a bearer of working power, but he is also a human being. He wants to live even when he is not needed by the capitalists. And if the capitalists exploit him in such a manner that he has nothing to live on during a period of unemployment or illness, or during old age, he has the right to <span class="page-break">\3</span>turn to the state and demand that it provide for him.</p>
   <p>Receiving insurance benefits is not like receiving alms. It is the return to the worker of a part of those benefits which are taken from him without compensation by the wealthy class with the aid of the state. The insurance plan, therefore, should be so organized that the benefits will be paid out of the pockets of the wealthy.</p>
   <p>Once raised in that law-enacting institution, this question will not be stilled until it is solved in a manner satisfactory to the workers. It is well that there was a Socialist in Congress to raise this question.</p>
