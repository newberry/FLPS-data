   <p>p.4... The Lithuanian Compositors Society held its monthly meeting Jan.10. A motion was made and carried to affiliate the society with the Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies.</p>
   <p>This society is newly organized and does not have many members, because many printing shop workers are afraid to join. Many printing shops workers have decided to discharge all employees who join this objectionable society.</p>
   <p>In spite of that handicap we shall go forward. We have about fifty members, and are prepared to work in harmony with all worth-while organizations.</p>
