   <p>When the present war in Europe started, many people asserted that it would be the last war. They reasoned that the grim horrors and great cost of this war will demonstrate, better than all verbal discussions, the futility of war; for that reason the people of the world will not permit another war. The war has already cost millions in money and precious lives.</p>
   <p>This assertion [that this will be the last war] was purely a prophecy. Truly, that prophecy is fully understandable. It expresses one of the deepest desires of all progressive and lofty people. The brain of man is unable to understand how anyone could even think of war after that ghastly slaughter which flooded the greater part of Europe with seas of blood, deprived millions of families of their loved ones, and cast millions of people into an abyss of grief and misery <span class="page-break">\2</span>Advocates of permanent world peace, who made a valiant effort to prevent and stop the present homicide, earnestly adhere to the belief that the ghastly horrors of this war will teach the people a great lesson and lead them to control their bloodthirsty instincts forever.</p>
   <p>That prophecy is an expression of the hope which nestled and still nestles in the hearts of all lofty people. But whether or not that prophecy will be realized is another question. To say anything definite regarding this matter would likewise be a naked prediction. Nevertheless, by charting the direction in which the present situation is heading and by observing the effect one year of the war has had upon the minds of the people, it is more or less possible to determine how much hope there is for the fulfillment of the prophecy.</p>
   <p>The war, which started a year ago, has hardly increased the sympathy of the people for the peace movement of the pacifists. On the contrary, there is reason to believe that brotherly love and other worthy sentiments, which are <span class="page-break">\3</span>indispensible for the realization of the plans of the pacifists, more likely have turned to hatred between nationalities.</p>
   <p>This conflict, instead of demonstrating the futility of war and preparing the way for the ultimate victory of pacifist ideals, has really pushed those ideals into the background.</p>
   <p>This war offers an opportunity for various countries not at war to learn which weapons and what methods of warfare are more effective, thereby assisting them in preparing for war. For example, people who follow the English-language press in the United States have had an opportunity to observe that the main lesson which the leaders of this country have learned from the war is that this nation is insufficiently armed and poorly prepared for war in the event an enemy should attack the United States. In this connection, propaganda has been unleashed from all sides urging the government to expand the army and navy and perfect its weapons of war. The government already has begun activities in this field. A similar attitude regarding war appears to exist in other neutral countries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Therefore, the most important lesson that has been learned from this war is not the realization that war is a dreadful thing (this was known to all and much talked about even before the war started), but that it is necessary to be prepared for war. In other words, matters are moving contrary to the direction advocated by pacifists.</p>
   <p>It may be unpleasant for us, but the facts show that the prophecy that this will be the last war is without foundation and that, one by one, the hopes of the pacifists are fading away.</p>
