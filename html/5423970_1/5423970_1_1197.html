   <p>Besides the enactment of a selective compulsory military service law, a suggestion has been made that the government take over the control of food and regulate prices. As in all other countries, there are wolves and vultures in America who take advantage of every opportunity--and there are many such opportunities during war time--to raise prices on food and other commodities, and then blame the war for their action. During the last few weeks, prices of food and other commodities have jumped very high. Although people are earning money now, nevertheless they are experiencing great difficulty in making ends meet.</p>
   <p>President Wilson, in his appeal to the nation, stated that the government would keep an eye on merchants and manufacturers to see that they fulfilled their duties properly. The president advised them that their motto should be "a fair profit and quick service".</p>
   <p>However, words are not enough. The government should immediately take the necessary steps to control food and other commodities, set maximum prices, and see that merchants adhere to them. The burden of war should be borne in equal measure by everybody, and the people should be protected against all kinds of greedy profiteers. The sooner the government regulates these things, the better it will be for the entire nation.</p>
