   <p>The Poles of America, under the leadership of the Polish National Alliance, are planning to erect a statue of Thaddeus Kosciusko, a Lithuanian soldier of fortune who became a hero of the Lithuanian-Polish state and the American Revolution. The statue will be erected alongside of the monument of Pulaski in Lafayette Square, Washington, D. C., at a cost of $40,000.</p>
   <p>"Since Lithuania was once united with Poland, and because Kosciusko was a Lithuanian and a hero of the Lithuano-Polish state, then the question arises will the Poles invite the Lithuanians to join them in this undertaking; and if the Lithuanians are invited will they accept.....? It would be interesting to learn how the Lithuanians feel about this matter; perhaps it would be a good idea if the Lithuanian intelligentsia would express their views on this matter in the Lietuva."</p>
