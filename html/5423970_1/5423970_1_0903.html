   <p>Apparently some of our people do not realize the importance of the reorganization of the Communist party from sections or chapters into smaller units or cells, irrespective of the nationalities of the members.</p>
   <p>Under the old plan, regardless of the size of a party chapter, only a small number of members were active. Many were not active and were content merely by attending meetings; some even failed to attend meetings regularly.</p>
   <p>Under the new plan, each chapter is divided into many small units or cells. Every cell will be engaged in the very same activities as the former chapter. In other words, a smaller group will carry on the same activities that were formerly carried on by a larger group. In this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>manner many more, in fact all members of the party, will become active. Thus the activity and effectiveness of the party will be increased tremendously.</p>
