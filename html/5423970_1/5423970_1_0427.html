   <p>The Naujienos Company had an unpleasant week: it happened that during the past few days a workers' strike was called and the union label was taken away from the publishing company. The strike took place under the following circumstances: several of the press workers complained that they do not receive their wages on time, and one of them testified that he had worked overtime a great deal and that the Company owed him $500 which it did not want to pay him. The manager and biggest stockholder of the Company, J. Ilgaudas, testified that the linotypist concerned, had left that money with him as a deposit. There was also other trouble with the Company. Therefore, the workers went out on strike one day and asked other printers not to go to work in the Naujienos Press as scabs. The Naujienos, however, did get nonunion scabs who did the necessary work. It is said that the Naujienos Press, which is a union shop, used nonunion help even before, for overtime work. One of the workers, who did not feel satisfied, complained to the officers of the printers union, who investigated the case. All of this did not last long, <span class="page-break">2</span>however. The manager of the shop was able to come to terms with the striking linotypist who, according to Mr. Ilgaudas, has returned to work under the old terms "until Wednesday, when it will be made clear whether we can come to terms or whether we hire another worker."</p>
   <p>Having removed irregularities in the printing shop and having conformed to union requirements, the publishing company has had its union label returned to it.</p>
