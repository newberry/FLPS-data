   <p>When the United States became an independent country full rights were granted every citizen in regard to all political and economic questions of the land. When the Constitution was written, all citizens, regardless of class distinctions, were granted an equal voice in determining the laws of the country. The rights of the workers were not restricted; they remained equal rulers of the land and equal supporting pillars of both the Constitution and independence, which they had won with their own blood. If our government officials would adhere to the principles of the Constitution, and not evade them, then it would really be possible to call the United States a land of liberty.</p>
   <p>However, experience proves that the Constitutional rights, which the people in America had won with the blood of their forefathers, are being increasingly trampled upon. The rights of the working class, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>especially, are being increasingly restricted. This is proven by many undeniable facts. The workers now have only a small percentage of the rights which they formerly enjoyed. That the principles of the Constitution are being shamefully violated is shown by the denial of the freedom of the press to the working class, and by the attacks of the police against striking workers.</p>
   <p>We immigrants cannot forget the brutal behavior of Cleveland, who while president of the United States in 1892, concluded a shameful treaty with the Czarist government of Russia. According to this treaty, workers who have succeeded in evading the bloody claws of the Russian despots can no longer find refuge here in America, because the very same Czarist scenes of despotism are now taking place here in the United States. We have a good example in the present economic crisis. The capitalists <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>have already admitted that they have purposely created this crisis to satisfy their own selfish interests. The eighty-six million people in the United States are helplessly in the power of a handful of capitalists. The militia is being employed to force striking workers to return to work at shamefully low wages; and when the workers produce an overabundance of goods, then they can be tossed into the street to starve, etc., etc. President Roosevelt, who was elected with our votes, stated that we immigrants and all those who are demanding liberty are "undesirable citizens". William Howard Taft, candidate for president, who is being very enthusiastically supported by the enemies of liberty, is hypocritically promising jobs to six million unemployed workers; in this manner he hopes to win the support of those who are not conscious of their enemies.</p>
   <p>However, the workers must learn to recognize their enemies! Let us not forget the records of those presidents for whom we had voted in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the past, especially the records of the famous Roosevelt and his associate Taft. During Roosevelt's administration a number of new economic crises were born. These crises forced thousands of workers to go hungry while the warehouses were filled with food produced by the workers. Therefore, as long as we continue to vote for such persons we will be increasing the burden on our backs and we will be assisting in the restriction of our own rights, which the workers of America had won with their blood.</p>
   <p>It is clear, therefore, that only one road remains open for us to follow; we must refrain from voting for the tools of the wealthy class, candidates of the Republican and Democratic parties, and vote for our friend Eugene V. Debs, defender of the working class. Although he is being denounced as a criminal who has spent twenty-five years in jail, nevertheless, we know that those who fight faithfully <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>for our rights are often placed in jail and tortured by persons who are more brutal than murderers. We know that in Russia all people who demand liberty are always thrown into prisons; some of these prisoners are people with rather conservative viewpoints, such as Kubilius, Lithuanian representative in the first Russian Duma. Why are these people imprisoned? Certainly not for robbery or murder! Even the United States is surrendering escaped revolutionists from Russia, people who are guilty only of political offenses. These people were imprisoned because they advocated liberty and desired to free the masses from cruel exploitation, slavery, and misery.</p>
   <p>We must learn to recognize our enemies and our friends. We did not receive any benefit from any of the presidents whom we had elected with our own votes. On the contrary, our elected presidents brought about conditions that can be compared with those in Russia, Turkey, and Persia where the masses have no rights whatsoever and cannot secure any rights without severe struggles and bloody sacrifices. Here in <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the United States we have the right to vote, and it is not necessary for us to employ arms or make bloody sacrifices; all we need here is the ability to recognize our enemies and their hypocritic 1 deeds. Our enemies are not making an effort to win our support for the election by momentarily appeasing our huger with a bite of food. However, after the election is over they will enslave us more than ever, like the workers are enslaved in Russia.</p>
   <p>We must exercise our rights. Although our rights are narrow, nevertheless, with their help we can resist our exploiters and reduce their power at least to our own level. We must bear in mind the fact that if we broaden our rights we will make a very important step forward; we will reduce the power of the capitalists and increase our own. Whenever we increase our rights we automatically increase our influence over the government.</p>
   <p>By voting for and electing Eugene V. Debs, friend of the masses, we can gain the upper hand and free ourselves from oppression. (Lietuva editors note: Even if Debs is elected president he would be unable to <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>bring about any important changes if the Congress is composed of enemies). Therefore, fellow Lithuanians of Chicago and the whole United States, let us not sleep and let us not sell ourselves for a few flowery words of capitalist servants, who desire that we vote for Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist candidate for president of the United States. If he is elected we will increase our rights and become liberators of the land as those who liberated American in 1776, from the yoke of England.</p>
