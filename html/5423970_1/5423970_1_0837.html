   <p>Not long ago the well-known I. W. W. organizer, Mr. L. Grikstas, came here from the East. (We have a report that L. Grikstas has no official authorization as organizer of I. W. W.--Editor.) On December 13, while delivering a speech on I. W. W. affairs, he attacked the socialists. Then one of the socialists demanded the right to answer the speaker, but Grikstas said that he should arrange a debate and to get one of the best socialist speakers to debate with him the question: Socialism or the I. W. W., which of these is better?</p>
   <p>The debate was arranged for December 18 and the local Lithuanian socialists had as their speaker Mr. A. Sideravicius. It lasted two hours, and both speakers criticized each other as much as they could and presented the best arguments they had. The attendance was about 300. It was clear that the audience was with Grikstas, because his arguments made a better appeal to their point of view. After the debate the decision had to be rendered. The socialists, foreseeing that they would lose, at first did not want the audience to vote, but they were forced to agree that the public should decide. The result was that Sideravicius' side was upheld only by the socialists, while the public voted that Grikstas had beaten the socialists in the debate.</p>
