   <p>It was announced in Lietuva about the Lithuanian evening school. Rev. Krauczunas also announced in the church about the necessity and the benefit to Lithuanians to have such a school, so the last Monday evening two hundred Lithuanians came to the school on 31st St. The school supervisor was surprised that so many Lithuanians came to school. The schoolroom was too small for such a big crowd of Lithuanians. The supervisor never thought that so many Lithuanians would come to the evening school. Because the schoolroom was too small, there was no school that evening. Now they will give a larger schoolroom for Lithuanians. It will take one week to get that room ready. Next week the evening school will start in a larger room. Therefore brother Lithuanians do not slumber educate yourselves, learn the English language, without education, without knowing the English language, a man is not worth even one cent.</p>
   <p>The teacher will be W.Zaharewiczia. He knows both English and Lithuanian languages fluently.</p>
