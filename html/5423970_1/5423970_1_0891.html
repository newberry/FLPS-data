   <p>A meeting was held by the International Society, Nov. 27, 1892, at MAJAUCKAS Hall, 777 Milwaukee Avenue. The program was our own to improve the workingman's condition. The speaker X. was from the province of Kaunas, a student of Berlin University. The speaker said "do not believe that the anarchists with their bombs will bring benefit to the workers. It will not. Such an action is against a democratic government policy." The speaker said that in this democratic country the best weapon of the working men is the ballot. We do not need to shed blood nor use fire. We workingmen can win our fight, improve our living conditions by ballot because we are 95% while only 5% own the wealth and control the government. We need education and we can obtain knowledge only through literature. When the workingmen are organized we do not need to shed blood. We will improve our living conditions by peaceful assembly and ballot.</p>
