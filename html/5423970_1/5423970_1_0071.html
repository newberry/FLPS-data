   <p>Much has been written in our newspapers about the great importance of assisting our students. The time has now arrived when we should change from mere words to actual deeds. Most Lithuanian-Americans are members of the poverty-stricken working class. However, there are quite a number of Lithuanians in every Lithuanian-American colony who are more or less wealthy. It is known that the individual fortunes of some Lithuanians total several tens of thousands of dollars. These Lithuanians would not experience any hardship if they joined the Ausra Society (Students' Aid Society), because the membership dues of the society are only twenty-five cents per month, or a total of three dollars per year. If all these wealthy Lithuanians would join the society it would be a very big step forward in the intellectual development of our people; it would benefit our nationality to an immense degree, because the present number of our students would then be increased many times.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We all know that our people have the scornful habit of looking upon educated people with indifference. We are paying a very high price for this bad habit; it would be much cheaper for us if we were all members of the Ausra Society. That bad habit of indifference is keeping our people in the depths of darkness, slavery, and exploitation.</p>
   <p>At present our greatest need is for educators, literary men and women, medical doctors, and all kinds of merchants. Without educators we are unable to learn about the miracles of science, the mysteries and beauties of nature, etc. Without literary men and philologists we cannot become acquainted with the beauty and richness of our language. A shortage of doctors causes many of our people to die prematurely. A shortage of merchants make it possible for our people to be exploited by, and for the benefit of, foreigners; it is common knowledge that business men of other nationalities find a very profitable field among the Lithuanians. We are short of educated Lithuanians in all walks of life. Therefore, is it not time for us to get busy and fill this shortage?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We are members of one of the smallest nationalities of the world. However, our nationality is not so small in numbers that it must necessarily be allowed to die out and become absorbed by other nationalities. A number of nations, some numerically smaller than ours, are getting along very nicely. For example, take Bulgaria with a population of 2,400,000; Denmark with 2,500,000; Sweden with 2,600,000; and Greece with 2,500,000. All these nations enjoy their own independent governments, schools, institutions of higher learning, and they all have many educated people. These nations fought for their existence in much the same manner as the Lithuanians are now doing, and they succeeded in throwing off foreign yokes; now they are their own masters. We Lithuanians, also, can succeed in gaining those lofty heights, but only with the aid of a large group of educated people. we can march forward and attain a happier and greater future only by means of intellectual development, which banishes all darkness and all powers of exploitation.</p>
   <p>We are fully aware of the fact that there are many inimical forces among other nationalities, who purposely impede our efforts to reach a higher level of civilization; these sinister forces are doing everything within their power <span class="page-break">4</span>to keep us in darkness as long as possible, because they depend upon our darkness for their welfare and prosperity. It is our duty not only to defend ourselves from these forces, but also to wage war against them with the weapon of intellectual development until we are victorious; we can do this by assisting our students and by taking full advantage of opportunities to educate ourselves.</p>
   <p>The Ausra Society, a students' aid society, was established in December, 1901, by a group of prominent Lithuanians of Chicago who understood the value of educated people and their necessity in Lithuanian life. The aims and by-laws of the Ausra Society are as follows:</p>
   <p>Purpose</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Ausra Society is to assist in a financial and advisory capacity worthy young Lithuanian college students, and in this manner create a Lithuanian intelligentsia in all branches of learning except religion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Ausra Society hopes to achieve this end not only by means of its own resources, but with the help of all Lithuanians who will support the Ausra students' fund by means of various gifts and contributions.</p>
   <p>Assistance</p>
   <p>1. Students of sculpture, music, science, philology, etc., who will be unable to earn a living immediately after graduation, shall be assisted in preference to students of other branches of learning. Women students shall have a priority over men students. Those who have been banished from the Fatherland and those who have suffered in any way on account of their nationality shall have a priority over students who are attending school in the Fatherland.</p>
   <p>2. Assistance shall not be given to students of religion.</p>
   <p>3. Boys and girls who possess talent in any trade can receive assistance from the Ausra Society to continue the development of their talents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>4. Those applicants for assistance who have shown their loyalty to Lithuanianism with deeds or in any other suitable manner, shall have a priority over all other applicants.</p>
   <p>5. All financial assistance received by students from the society shall be made in the form of a loan and not as a donation; students who receive money from the society are to refund the money to the society as soon as possible after the completion of their education; this refund may be made either in cash or with worthy deeds for Lithuanianism, such as important writings, etc.</p>
   <p>Supplement 1) The importance and value of the deeds or writings of graduates who had been assisted by the Ausra Society will be decided by a committee elected for that purpose by the members of the society.</p>
   <p>Supplement 2) If any student, while receiving aid from the society, fails to perform at least one worthy deed for the benefit of Lithuanianism in any of the fields of science, art, literature, or national activity, then the society may decide to discontinue all further assistance to such a student.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Supplement 3) It is desired that all students who complete their education with the aid of the Ausra Society, establish permanent homes in Lithuania and work there for the uplift of the Lithuanian nation. However, circumstances will not permit all graduates to do this. For that reason, the society does not make this a compulsory requirement.</p>
   <p>All students who desire assistance must make their applications at least six months in advance so that officials of the society may have ample time in which to investigate the character of every applicant.</p>
   <p>Resources</p>
   <p>1. Both men and women may become members of the Ausra Society.</p>
   <p>2. Members pay an initiation fee of one dollar, and monthly dues of twenty-five cents. The initiation fee may be paid at one time or in partial payments.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>3. Members who contribute a sum of one hundred seventy-five dollars or more at one time, are freed from the payment of all monthly dues.</p>
   <p>4. The rights of both men and women are equal.</p>
   <p>5. Lithuanians who are living in Europe may also join the Ausra Society; they shall pay their dues in accordance with the following money exchange values: One American dollar is to be equivalent to one Russian ruble, three German marks, five French francs, or four British shillings.</p>
   <p>Honorary Members</p>
   <p>Any person who performs an outstanding deed for the welfare of the Ausra Society may be declared an honorary member of the society.</p>
   <p>Branches</p>
   <p>The Ausra Society is not a local organization; it has branches all over the <span class="page-break">9</span>United States. Branches of the Ausra Society also may be established in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>All the branches of the Ausra Society enjoy full autonomy. All membership dues collected by the branches are sent to the supreme treasurer of the society; all membership lists, together with a financial statement of each member, are sent to the supreme financial secretary of the society.</p>
   <p>Eight hundred copies of various books have been donated by Lithuanian-Americans to the Ausra Society. A catalogue and price lists of these books has been published; a copy will be mailed to anyone upon request. Those who purchase books from the Ausra Society are performing very useful deeds; they are contributing financially to the students' aid fund.</p>
   <p>The present national officers of the Ausra Society are as follows: Mrs. J. T. Zelvis, M. D., president, 1 Church St., Plymouth, Pa.; J. Sernas (Joseph Adomaitis), secretary, 3252 S. Halsted St., Chicago, Ill.; P. Mikolainis, financial secretary, P. O. Box 62, New York, N. Y.; Dr. John Sliupas, treasurer, 1419 N. Maine Ave., Scranton, Pa.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>A branch of the Ausra Society should be organized in every Lithuanian colony in America. A copy of the by-laws of the society may be secured from the financial secretary.</p>
