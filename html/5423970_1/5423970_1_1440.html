   <p>One year has elapsed since the inception of the Lithuanian Women's Enlightenment Society. The start is always hard. Most of the time has been devoted to the preparation of by-laws. The foundation must be laid solidly in order to put up a substantial building.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the society is to impart culture to our women. At every meeting one of our members reads a lecture, or delivers a short talk on the affairs of women. Some woman displays her hand-work - knitting, or some other object that she has made in her spare time.</p>
   <p>One lecture deserving mention was given by Mrs. E. Sutkuviene. In part she said: "If woman wants to be equal With man, she must seek education in order to know herself."</p>
   <p>Only through education and enlightenment will one know himself. For this reason, the women must join organizations in order to unite all their strength and thus further education and enlightenment. Women must help each other by giving scientific advice, or advice of a practical nature.</p>

   <p>They must discuss their weaknesses openly without any fear. Woman must not have too much confidence in man.</p>
   <p>The meetings of the Women's Englightenment Society are held every second Sunday of each month at 869 - 33rd Place.</p>
   <p>Let us work together for our own benefit and let us have unity, for in unity there is strength.</p>
