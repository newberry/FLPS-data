   <p>There is no doubt that German propaganda in America emanates from organized sources. The aims of this kind of propaganda are clear and understandable. Its goals are to foster distrust of the government, to spread doubts of the sincerity of the Allies, to propagate discouragement, to instigate quarrels and, generally, to encourage discontent with the social order and the war program. The ultimate aim is to lessen America's perseverance in the war and to weaken the morale at home.</p>
   <p>This propaganda is strengthened by political and religious differences, nationalistic and social movements, prejudicial motivations, and various weaknessess of the people.</p>
   <p>Those engaged in spreading this propaganda include German sympathizers and paid agents of the Germans. Many citizens, because of their personal convictions and beliefs, are innocently aiding the German propagandists.</p>
   <p>It would be foolish to state that the poison of this propaganda is not active among the Lithuanians of America. It must not be thought that the agents of the Kaiser would overlook this not so small field for agitation which the Lithuanian group in America offers. It is an undeniable fact that the poison of German lies is being injected into the minds of Lithuanians. The same is true of every national group.</p>
   <p>Lithuanianized German Propaganda</p>
   <p>Each national group has individual qualities. To make an impression on each group, it is necessary to use different means. These means must be adapted to temperaments, traditions and alien characteristics of each particular group. Hence, German propaganda among American Lithuanians is Lithuanianized, that is, it is especially fitted to Lithuanians.</p>
   
   <p>Probably the most widespread example of Lithuanianized German propaganda is the contention that Lithuanians should take a neutral stand on the war. An article dealing with this contention was published in one of our newspapers recently. One often hears that the Lithuanian nation is neutral and, therefore, that Lithuanians should assume a neutral position. The aim of such propaganda is very clear. It is an attempt to convince Lithuanian-Americans on this point so that their enthusiasm and efforts in this war will subside. The aid of Lithuanian-Americans is required to conduct the war against Germany successfully.</p>
   <p>When this element of neutrality is expressed in conversation thus: "What difference will it make to us Lithuanians who wins the war? As long as Lithuania is unharmed....", it is evident that the propagation of this spirit aids the Kaiser's efforts.</p>
   <p>By encouraging this attitude the Germans hope to destroy the morale of Lithuanian soldiers and to make them unwilling to fight German militarism and German plans of aggression. Such statements tend to make the Lithuanian masses more sympathetic to German propaganda and also tend to breed disloyalty.</p>
   <p>That the talk of neutrality is not very successful among the Lithuanians is evidenced by the thousands of Lithuanian-American youths in the American army. The enthusiastic participation of Lithuanians in the Liberty Loan drives, the collections for the Red Cross, and the present efforts to create a battalion of Lithuanians in the army tend to prove the ineffectiveness of this propaganda. Other Lithuanian activities also prove the loyalty of the Lithuanians to America.</p>
   <p>Lithuania herself, though lacking in arms, is conducting a fight against Germany's plans by every means that can be devised. Lithuanians understand that the war is being waged for the freedom of all nations, including Lithuania.</p>
   <p>In America, Lithuanians are loyal to all the American ideals and acknowledge them as their own. Overseas, they cannot be neutral because the Germans hold Lithuania by the force of arms.</p>
   <p>Talk of neutrality among Lithuanians can only be attributed to stories made up by the Germans and their sympathizers, who hope to mislead the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Stories of the Insincerity of the Allies</p>
   <p>People who are otherwise commendable citizens are busy circulating rumors. It is sufficient to tell only one person about something, and, before you can look around, a third person knows about it and is telling a fourth. They become members of an ever-increasing army of storytellers who repeat the rumor to everyone they meet. When everyone is talking about the same thing, many people are inclined to believe what is being said, because "everybody says so".</p>
   <p>German propaganda reaches the people by this method. For example, Germany announced that the Allies were insincere, and that the latter's avowal that they were at war for the principle of liberty for small nations was a gigantic lie. Such statments were repeated by German sympathizers and were thus circulated from one friend to another.</p>
   <p>Stories about the insincerity of the Allies also reached the Lithuanians. How ever, when proof of such supposed insincerity was demanded, the German propagandists were at a loss for examples. Unable to support their accusations by concrete illustrations, the propagandists attempt to point out the insincerity of the Allies by claiming that the latter do not specifically name the countries which are striving to win their freedom. Many incidents prove the futility of this example of pro-German thinking.</p>
   <p>Whenever the statesmen of the Allied nations had occasion to mention any of the small nations, they always expressed sympathy for the cause of these nations.</p>
   <p>In May, President Woodrow Wilson told the delegation of the Lithuanian-American Council that he was in full sympathy with Lithuania's efforts for independence. Senator Lodge clearly stated that he was in favor of independence for Lithuania. His remarks can be found in the Congressional Record of August 29, 1918. Earlier, Senator Lodge had spoken concerning other small nations.</p>
   <p>The statesmen of the Allies have never expressed themselves in favor of the enslavement of any nation, but have always demanded freedom for all. They have supported the efforts of many nations to free themselves, as can be attested by the Belgians, Serbs, Russians, Czechoslovaks, Poles, Jugoslavs and other nationalities. There are no such documents among the Allies as those which the Germans produced when the Kaiser apportioned a part of Germany's indebtedness to Lithuania, and when Germany attempted to exploit Lithuania by voiding various agreements.</p>
   <p>When a pro-German finds it necessary to prove something by an example, he realizes that facts and deeds, not words, are against him.</p>
   
   <p>Rumors About the Exploitation of Foreigners in the Army</p>
   <p>Rumors are believed, and therefore they are troublesome. This is true no matter how absurd and contrary to fact they might be. When something is whispered secretly to a person, the latter is likely to believe what he has been told because he cannot ascertain the truth immediately. Even if such a person doubts the rumor, he may, in attempting to verify it, repeat it to someone who knows nothing about the matter, and thus aid in circulating the false news.</p>
   <p>For example, it was rumored that Lithuanians, and members of other nationalities, were being exploited in the army; that because they are unable to take advantage of various opportunities, they are given the dirtiest and most difficult jobs, etc.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to discover where this rumor started. However, it is sufficient that it has been started, and that it is one of those lies which the pro-Germans like so well. It is entirely unfounded and will be refuted by thousands of Lithuanian soldiers and by logic itself. Nevertheless, the rumor is circulating and being believed by many who have not investigated the matter but who have only heard it from somebody else.</p>
   <p>The purpose behind such a rumor is self-evident: It is designed to influence the men into not joining the army, to cool their spirit, and to worry the parents and relatives who have dear ones in the army. This rumor is so effective that it is believed in the face of the public denials and despite the assurances of the soldiers themselves.</p>
   <p>It is true that those who cannot speak English have some unpleasant experiences in the army. Because of their inability to converse, they have difficulty in making friends, feel restrained, and cannot enjoy the various affairs and entertainments arranged for the soldiers. However, to keep up the spirits of such men, they are now grouped together and are placed under officers who speak several languages.</p>
   
   <p>Now, you would have a difficult time finding a Lithuanian in the army who does not feel at home. The government regards everybody with equality and wants them all to feel equal, whether they are native-born Americans or of foreign descent.</p>
   <p>In other respects, the pro-Germans circulate rumors which attempt to arouse the ire of the Catholics, Protestants, or members of other religions, by making them believe that the Catholics, Protestants, or others are being treated unfairly in the army. All of these rumors are unfounded. They were started with an evil purpose in mind.</p>
   <p>Rumors of Dissoluteness in the Army</p>
   <p>The themes chosen for rumors are such as are difficult to verify. A good example of this is the chatter about the utter dissoluteness and lack of morals in the army. This rumor cannot be verified because morality and chastity are personal matters. Among the millions in the army, some examples of dissoluteness can be found. The propagandists multiply isolated cases and hold them up as examples of a general condition and thus convince an uncritical audience.</p>
   <p>The reports and statistics of the army doctors testify to the high morality in the army. This is affirmed by the officers of the army under whose care the soldiers are placed. The army authorities wish that the percentage of dissolute persons among civilians were as low as it is in the army. Despite these facts, rumors of dissoluteness in the army continue with individual instances being represented as examples of a general condition.</p>
   <p>How to Fight Such German Propaganda</p>
   <p>It is not easy to explain in the press every lie released by the enemy or by uncritical persons. Much time elapses during the government's investigation of a rumor and its subsequent explanation in the press. In the meantime other lies are released and are being circulated. Also, the press does not reach all of the people who have been misled by German agents.</p>
   <p>It is not easy to fight these German lies. Their origin and circulation are organized. Frequently the government is informed of new rumors whose circulation is begun in all parts of the country on the same day. Lies are constantly being manufactured and circulated. The most innocent events are intentionally misconstrued to serve the purposes of the enemy. Every political misunderstanding, every social movement and every dissatisfaction is used to promote differences among the people and thus weaken their spirit during the war.</p>
   <p>There is only one assured method of combating these lies: All loyal citizens must harden themselves, must refuse to listen to such lies and, whenever possible, censure those circulating such rumors. When such an enthusiastic scandalmonger is too insistent on repeating a rumor which is injurious to this country, that individual should be reported to the police.</p>
   <p>Nothing can be done with a person who is inclined to believe the doubtful rumors of every passer-by. On the other hand, sensible people must be on guard. They must not allow themselves to be misled or others to be blinded. They must especially warn the storytellers to cease. The loyal citizens must remember that they are in the key positions which the Germans bombard with lies and destroy with the poison of propaganda.</p>
   <p>The enemy must be shown our civilian bravery. We must let them know that they will lose here as well as on the battlefield. We must all keep in mind the fact that trust in this country and the calm of the citizens are necessary for victory. Victory will be greatly hampered by a country misled by German lies. The soldiers depend on us.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians must not be misled; their opinions must not be sullied by the poisons of German propaganda. The beautiful future of the world and, therefore, of the Lithuanians depends on the defeat of Germany's militaristic lords.</p>
