   <p>On Monday, September 30, the Chicago evening schools will start again. Men, do not slumber, take a book and go to the evening school, learn the English language. Remember that without the English language, without education, a man is good for nothing. He cannot get a better job, nor can he start any business.</p>
   <p>Last year we Lithuanians had five evening schools. How many evening schools will there be this year? We do not know, all depends on how many Lithuanians are willing to go.</p>
   <p>All Lithuanians who were attending evening schools last year, do not miss to attend the schools this year, and all other Lithuanians who ought to go to school, do not miss this opportunity.</p>
   <p>Go to school, take the same book you had last year, without a book you will not be admitted to the school. Come to Lietuva's office for the books.</p>
   <p>On Bridgeport the evening school for Lithuanians will be on 31st street. This year again Mr. W. Zacharewiczia will be the teacher. He will teach <span class="page-break">2</span>English and Lithuanian.</p>
