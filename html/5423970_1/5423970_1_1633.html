   <p>A group of Chicago Lithuanian grocers and butchers have decided to form a corporation for the establishment of their own bakery. These merchants will buy all their bakery goods from their own bakery, and thus become independent of the non-Lithuanian bakeries.</p>
   <p>The leaders of this praisworthy and useful movement are M. Narvidas, H. Beinarauskas, D. Petrulis, A. Zelnis, and A. Liepas.</p>
