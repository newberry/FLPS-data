   <p>We all will agree that uneducated people cannot be professors, doctors, engineers, philologists, or great writers of literature. Without educated people the progress of mankind would be impossible and life in this world would be very intolerable. We read with great sorrow how difficult it was for people to live a hundred thousand, or even a thousand years ago. In those days there were very few educated and intelligent people; these usually served not the masses but the privileged few, the wealthy class. In those ages of darkness and misery the working people lived in great distress, in many cases worse than animals; even the very life of a workingman depended upon the will of his master or ruler.</p>
   <p>It is probably true that we Lithuanians have a smaller number of educated people than any other nationality. Of course, no one can <span class="page-break">\2</span>blame us for that, because the Tzarist government purposely held our people in a sea of ignorance and darkness during the past one hundred years. However, educational opportunities are now available to our people, as well as to people of other nationalities. It is our duty to take full advantage of these opportunities. We all know that there is a great lack of educated Lithuanians in all the higher branches of learning. We are especially in need of medical doctors, pedagogues, and people with literary ability and training. This deplorable situation can be, and should be, remedied as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>We Lithuanians have much to learn from people of other nationalities. They are doing everything within their power to have the greatest <span class="page-break">\3</span>number of educated people in all the various branches of learning. They know that knowledge means wealth and power, and they realize that intellectual progress increases the happiness and standard of living of all the people; even the uneducated benefit indirectly from those who are educated. For that reason, all members of their respective nationalities contribute as much as possible to funds to assist students and to establish all kinds of schools of higher learning.</p>
   <p>However, among our people that most important matter, intellectual progress, is almost completely neglected. The yearly sum which Lithuanians contribute toward the support of Lithuanian students is <span class="page-break">\4</span>so small that it is not even sufficient to meet all the financial requirements of one college student.</p>
   <p>Our students are seeking an education under the most trying conditions. They are unable to devote all their time and energy to their studies; they are always beset with financial worries. When those students who had expected assistance, but had not received it, graduated from college they refused to take an active part in Lithuanian affairs, saying: "You did not help me, therefore, I do not owe you anything." Some Lithuanian college graduates remain loyal to their nationality in spite of the fact that they did not receive any assistance. However, these patriots usually meet an early death <span class="page-break">\5</span>because of the hardships which they had suffered during their school days. Kudirka, Vaicaitis, Visinskis, and Biliunas are some of the educated Lithuanian patriots who went to an early grave. We are now making contributions to erect monuments in their memory. If we would have made these contributions to assist them in the hour of their greatest need, when they were students, then perhaps they would still be among the living today.</p>
   <p>We have two organizations whose main purpose is to assist worthy Lithuanian students, the "Ziburys" (Light) Society in Lithuania, and the "Ausra" (Dawn) Society in America, with headquarters in Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The "Ausra" Society has been organized by leading Lithuanian intellectuals of Chicago, such as, William Miseika, A. Olsevskis, J.J. Gertmanavicius, Casimir Gugis, Joseph Adomaitis, etc. This society maintains a school under the direction of Professor William Miseika, and a large Lithuanian-American Library in the Bridgeport Lithuanian colony of Chicago. A number of Lithuanian students are receiving some financial assistance. A number of Lithuanian students are receiving some financial assistance.</p>
   <p>However, the "Ausra" Society is not receiving the proper support from the Lithuanian public of Chicago, in its efforts to aid students financially. The society has only about forty members who pay dues. Each member pays twenty-five cents per month. Therefore, the society collects about $120 per year, which is enough to <span class="page-break">\7</span>pay the expenses of only one student, for only one semester. Adding the $200, which the Lithuanian Alliance of America contributes yearly to the society, we then have a total sum of $320. Therefore, our people contribute annually only enough to pay the full expenses of only one student. This is a very sad state of affairs, and should be remedied at once.</p>
   <p>Our people are not stingy with contributions. However, instead of contributing to worthy causes, their contributions usually go towards the support of evil forces. According to reliable sources, the people of Lithuania spend four million rubles every year for intoxicating drinks. In America, at the rate of only five dollars per person, the 400,000 Lithuanians squander more than two million <span class="page-break">\8</span>dollars annually on beer, wine, and whiskey. If the 400,000 Lithuanians of America would contribute only five cents each and every year to assist worthy Lithuanian students, then we would have an annual fund of $20,000, which would be sufficient to assist about seventy students. The Lithuanians of Chicago alone, can support this number of students. However, the "Ausra" Society, with only forty members, is able to pay the full expenses of only one student.</p>
   <p>Therefore, Lithuanians of Chicago and the entire United States, let us become members of the "Ausra" Society and aid worthy Lithuanian students with our contributions. In doing so, we will be fulfilling our sacred duty, and in return our nationality will be blessed with wealth and power and placed on an equal footing with other nationalities.</p>
