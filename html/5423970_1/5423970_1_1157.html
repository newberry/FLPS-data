   <p>This week will be the last opportunity to buy bonds of the second United States Liberty Loan. According to reports, Chicago Lithuanians are buying a very large amount of Liberty bonds. The Universal State Bank, which is a Lithuanian bank, has bought fifteen thousand dollars' worth of bonds. Some Lithuanians have purchased as much as seven hundred dollars' worth. Several thousand dollars' worth of bonds were bought through the Lithuanian bank alone up to last Monday. It is believed many more bonds will be bought by Chicago Lithuanians this week.</p>
   <p>The Liberty Loan bonds are a very safe investment, and we advise our people to buy as many of them as possible.</p>
