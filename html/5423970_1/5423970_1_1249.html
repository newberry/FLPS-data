   <p>It is apparent from the announcement made last Sunday by the executive committee of the Chicago Federation of Labor that the organized workers of Chicago are enemies of armament proposals. The announcement says that the increase of armaments spawns large munitions trusts which enslave the working people, and make an oligarchy of a democracy. Therefore, the workers must oppose the enlargement of the permanent army and navy. They must demand that the manufacture of munitions be taken out of private capitalistic hands, because the "preparedness" agitation would thereby be destroyed at its roots.</p>
   <p>The Federation of Labor demands industrial preparation in place of military preparation. Give the worker higher wages, shorten his working day, and better his working and living conditions; a healthy, strong mass of people, content with its existence, will be the surest defense of the country.</p>
