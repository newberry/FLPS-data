   <p>The election of United States officials are approaching. We have not seen Lithuanian candidates in higher offices in either of the major parties, Republican or Democratic. Even if Lithuanian candidates were elected, the Lithuanians could accomplish nothing in office because they would have no "show" among either Republican or Democratic politicians.</p>
   <p>Dr. John Szliupas is a candidate from Lackawana County, Pa., on the Socialist Party ticket. We are urging all Lithuanians to support and vote for Dr. John Szliupas. If he is elected to the state legislature, he will protect Lithuanians from there; he would show the American congressmen that the Lithuanians are just as good as any other people.</p>
   <p>In many cities the Lithuanians are persecuted as undesirable people. Dr. Szliupas would stop this uncivil act of the Americans.</p>
