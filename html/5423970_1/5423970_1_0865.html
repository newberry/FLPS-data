   <p>A new Lithuanian Socialist organization has been organized under the name "Lithuanian Socialist Revolutionary Party." This organization will devote its activities to all Lithuanians in the world. Units of the party will be established everywhere, so as to organize all Lithuanian workers into a powerful, class-conscious army of workers, the purpose of which will be to fight against exploitation and social injustice.</p>
   <p>The party will carry on an extensive fight, with speeches and the dissemination of subversive literature, against those enemies of the working class who hold the workers in bondage.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialist revolutionaries, together with the revolutionaries of other nationalities, will seek to replace the present social order with a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>co-operative (Socialist) order, based on liberty, equality and justice. Their aim will be to abolish private property.</p>
   <p>Even in the face of formidable opposition, the party will continue its fight for liberty. Continual appeals will be made to all exploited and enslaved workers with the slogan "Kovej Jus Igysite Savo Tiesa!" (To obtain justice, one must fight for it).</p>
   <p>Mankind is divided into two antagonistic groups: the rich and the poor. The interests of these two classes are directly opposed. For that reason a bitter struggle is now raging which will end in victory for the poor. Some of the exploited are carrying on a strong fight against social injustice. Others are fighting with less ardor because their hope of success has been dimmed.</p>

   <p>The present social order of the world is a system of gross injustice, exploitation, and bondage. A mere handful of people control vast fortunes that have been fraudulently accumulated by exploiting the masses. They live in spacious and expensively furnished homes, and lead luxurious lives of ease and happiness. They never taste any misery.</p>
   <p>The rest of the people are submerged in a sea of misery. They suffer from undernourishment and are forced to live under the most unhealthy and unfavorable conditions. Large families are compelled to crowd into small, brokendown, smoke-stained houses, most of which are located close to factories, dumps, and piles of rubbish. A workman rises very early in the morning and goes to work. Late in the evening, exhausted and covered with filth, he returns to his home, where everything is unpleasant and disagreeable. While they are <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>accumulating vast fortunes for their masters, the workers sacrifice their health, lives, and happiness. When a worker loses his health, he is cast off by his master like a pair of old shoes, without any kind of aid.</p>
   <p>The average workman is uneducated and in a state of confusion. He is enslaved by capitalism and imperialism, and drags the yoke without knowing why or for whom. For that reason, the class-conscious and more educated workers are trying to point out to all workers the road to liberty. They are trying to show them that workmen and their masters are equal in all respects except in wealth, that workmen also possess the right to enjoy the fruits of nature, and that working people also have the right to live in freedom without masters on their backs. The working people have no liberty today; they are living in bondage. For that reason, we workers should fight for liberty. Let us unite into a powerful, class-conscious army.</p>

   <p>Therefore, the Lithuanian Socialist revolutionaries will strive to educate their brother Lithuanians who are ignorant, and unite them into an army of class-conscious workers so that, together with the exploited workers of all lands, they will be able to bring about a new social order based on communism.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialist revolutionaries will fight, not for a democratic republic, which has proved to be just as despotic as a monarchy, but for the overthrow of despotism, so as to establish in its place communism, thereby abolishing all private property, which is the root of all evils. They believe that parliaments do not offer the workers any hope to attain real liberty.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialist Revolutionary Party will employ tactics in accordance with prevailing conditions. It will explain to the workers how they are exploited and point out the necessity of uniting into a powerful army to abolish slavery and establish liberty, equality, and justice on this earth. We will <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>fight to establish real liberty, because we are interested only in real, genuine liberty. In that way this party differs from other Socialist parliamentary organizations.</p>
   <p>The present sharp struggle between capital and labor to abolish exploitation of the working class, is growing more intensive from day to day. Only that labor party which will have the greatest number of followers and whose aims will be more adapted to the needs of the masses, will emerge victorious.</p>
   <p>We workers have heads with brains and are able to understand that we never did, and never shall, receive any concessions from the capitalists without a struggle. We can reach our goal only if we fight for it.</p>
   <p>There are many various parties among Lithuanians and other nationalities. However, we must examine them carefully and determine which has the best program.</p>
