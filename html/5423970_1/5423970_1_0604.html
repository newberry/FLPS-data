   <p>We all know that in Chicago we have many Lithuanian Catholic churches, about eight in all, and that each church has an organist to direct the church choir. Up until now, these Lithuanian organists have been serving the Poles of Chicago; they have organized and entertained the Poles with many musical concerts and theatrical presentations. In that manner, they realized thousands of dollars in profits for the benefit of the Poles. These organists have made practically no effort to entertain or benefit the people of their own nationality, the Lithuanians, with musical and theatrical programs.</p>
   <p>It is very gratifying to note that the Lithuanian Catholics of Chicago finally convinced the organists that their conduct, serving the Poles, and neglecting the Lithuanians, was improper, and should be stopped. The Lithuanians belong to an altogether different nationality, and have nothing in common with the Poles. Therefore, the Lithuanian parishioners had a perfect right to demand that their organists engage in musical and theatrical activities for the benefit of their own people, and not for the Poles. For that reason, the long desired goal finally has been achieved, that is, the separation of Lithuanian organists <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>from the Poles. Last Saturday, August 29, our organists unanimously decided to end their relations with the Poles.</p>
   <p>This separation of Lithuanian organists from the Poles will be most heartily approved and admired by every Lithuanian in Chicago. Our organists deserve great honor for their manly deed. It is now clear that they desire to be free and independent individuals, and not slaves of foreigners. It is hoped that our organists will now devote their talents and energy towards the musical, spiritual, and intellectual uplift of their own people. We also hope and believe that our organists will not fail to produce a number of musical and theatrical programs during the coming winter season in order to console our souls, our hearts. We all feel the lack of real musical programs among our people in Chicago. We also hope that our organists will organize a choral group, such as the Birute Singing and Dramatic Society of the non-Catholic Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us go forward bravely. Life belongs only to the brave, to those with courage, and not to slaves. Our organists can rest assured that they will receive greater support from the Lithuanian masses of Chicago than they received from the Poles, because people of our own nationality are always closer to our hearts.</p>
