   <p>The 122nd Lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America staged "Aukso Dievaitis" (God of Gold), a drama, on April 25, at School Hall, 48th and Honore Streets. This drama was translated into Lithuanian from the Polish language.</p>
   <p>I regret to state that the performance failed to affect the audience in any way, and it would have been better if the 122nd Lodge had not presented this play. Much effort and energy has gone to naught.</p>
   <p>It was impossible to understand any part of the play. Almost all the players behaved like lifeless, wooden statues. Only people who were seated in the first two or three rows were able to hear the voices of the players. In other words, the "artists" were not only lifeless, but they were also silent!</p>
   <p>"Kaisutis" (played by P. Vaiciulis), in whose home all the action of the play <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>took place, spoke in a very dull and monotonous tone; when he started to talk he went ahead without the slightest pause to accentuate sentences and paragraphs, and even failed to raise his voice where that was required. However, it was at least possible to hear his voice. But his mother "Morta" (played by Miss F. Beinora) spoke so softly that no one in the audience was able to understand her. Her actions and behavior created the impression that she was a servant-girl and not the mistress of the house; throughout the entire play she sat in one position behind a table and appeared to be cold and frightened. She answered the questions of her husband in a frightened manner.</p>
   <p>Their daughter "Vanda" (played by Miss F. Bierzinis) did not act like a lively young girl, but like an old woman. The same is true of her sweetheart "Henrikas."</p>
   <p>"Burbulis" (played by M. Jankus), the large landowner, looked more like a poverty-stricken Jew than like a prosperous landowner; when he came out on the stage his appeared to be saying his morning prayers.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"Kraicius" (played by J. Lechas), the merchant and rival for the hand of "Vanda," acted more like a Lithuanian ranch foreman than like a prosperous town merchant; he appeared to show no concern at all whether "Vanda" was willing to marry him or "Henrikas." The latter (played by I. Kucinas) also acted with an air of indifference.</p>
   <p>"Henrikas" acted more like a merchant that a lover; he approached "Vanda" as if he wanted to buy something and not to ask for her love. Furthermore, he was chewing gum while acting! That is altogether out of place on the stage, except in certain American scenes.</p>
   <p>"Sagaitis" (played by I. Zolpas), the baron, did not appear like a baron. He was too young for that part. However, his behavior was better than that of the other players.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, the performance was terrible. It appears that the sponsors <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of that play were more interested in business than in pleasing the audience; even during the progress of the performance, beer venders were passing through the audience, As a result, instead of having only one show we had two: One on the stage and one in the audience.</p>
   <p>How long will our stage artists and theatrical sponsors continue to present unworthy performances?</p>
