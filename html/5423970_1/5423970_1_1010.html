   <p>A Lithuanian mass meeting was held last Sunday afternoon, August 30, to aid J. J. Paurenas in the fight for his life and liberty. Owing to the extremely hot weather, a comparatively small group of Lithuanians attended the meeting. A collection netted the sum of two dollars and twenty-five cents.</p>
   <p>Comrade Paurenas, a Latvian, is an escaped revolutionist from Russia. He is imprisoned in New York, and held for possible deportation to Russia. Negotiations are now going on between the United States and Russia for his surrender. Although his so-called crimes are unquestionably of a political nature, nevertheless, the Russian government classifies him as an ordinary criminal, and states that he is guilty of murder, robbery and the violation of government monopolies. On this basis, the Czarist government is demanding his surrender, in accordance with the terms of a treaty with the United States.</p>
   <p>Although the mass meeting was not large, nevertheless it was very enthusiastic.</p>

   <p>The first speaker depicted the deplorable plight of comrade Paurenas, who has been in prison now for more than ten months. The speaker also described the despotic nature of the Czarist government and its relations with the United States. The second speaker explained what must be done to liberate Paurenas. He also stated that if Paurenas is surrendered to Russia, then many more escaped revolutionists, who are now living in the United States will, likewise, be surrendered. A decision to deport Paurenas would mean a death sentence.</p>
   <p>Mass Meetings are now being held in various sections of the country to raise funds for the defense of Paurenas, and to collect signatures to a petition, which is to be sent to the United States government in behalf of Paurenas. This matter is of great importance to all immigrants of the Russian Empire. For that reason, we, Lithuanians, must support the cause of Paurenas as much as possible.</p>
