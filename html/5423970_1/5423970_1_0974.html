   <p>The Lithuanian Political Club of the sixth ward is growing fast. Sixteen new members joined at the meeting. There will be an election to city offices this fall. Let us Lithuanians work together and we may be able to elect a Lithuanian to some office.</p>
   <p>All those who have citizenship papers join our club; those who have no papers, apply for the papers without delay.</p>
