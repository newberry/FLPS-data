   <p>The workers, on whose backs the greatest burden of such a system falls, were the first to recognize its evil character. Through the lips of their defenders, the Socialists, the workers have been declaring for a long time that the people must abolish private ownership of the means of production and take them over into their own hands as public property.</p>
   <p>The more intelligent members of the bourgeoisie are beginning to realize the necessity of public ownership of the means of production. This class, naturally, <span class="page-break">\2</span>cannot advocate the abolition of all private property, because then they would be renouncing the foundation of their means of livelihood. But in certain instances they sometimes take a firm stand against the present system of private ownership.</p>
   <p>The above fact has been demonstrated during the past three days in the United States Congress. D. J. Lewis, chairman of the committee on labor, made the suggestion before the House of Representatives that the government should take over into its own hands all coal and iron mines. Mr. Lewis, of course, is not the entire Congress, and it is even doubtful if he possesses the necessary courage to carry on a campaign until his suggestion by a leading congressman can be construed as a definite trend of the modern era.</p>
   <p>If the bourgeoisie themselves are beginning to realize that the social order which they uphold is no good, then how can anyone honestly defend that system?</p>
