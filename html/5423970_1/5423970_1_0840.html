   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance presented K. Jasiukaitis' three-act comedy, "Guests from Lithuania," at the Hull House Theater, February 4.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to classify this play by Jasiukaitis. It could be termed a satire, a burlesque, a serious play or a farce. It seems like it contains something of everything. The idea of the play is to deride various groups of Chicago Lithuanians for their flattery to unprecedented visitors. The derison is sarcastic, burlesqued, so that one is forced to chuckle. The author is a talented mocker and caricaturist who knows how to grasp the comical aspects of a situation.</p>
   <p>The situation is this! the Reverends Tumas and Olsauskas are counting the dollars collected from Americans and even their hearts are leaping with joy. Olsauskas wants to send a greeting cable to the Czar, but the far-seeing Reverend Tumas prohibits him to do any such things until they have finished collecting through all of America. Olsauskas would also like to start a fight with the agnostics, but Tumas forbids everything because of the holiest purpose of his mission--the dollar. While they are talking, there is a knock on the door. They hurriedly cram the money into their pockets. But their fears were unnecessary. There enters one of Chicago's intelligentsia, on his knees, offering a five-dollar bill and kissing the priests' hands. Others come after him. They all are holding money, all kneeling; the intelligentsia, agnostics, etc. At the end comes a deputation from the intelligentsia to invite the priests to a banquet; one carries a big drum, another a horn. The first says: "Dear visitors, we greet you and invite you to a feast." He beats the drum, the other blows the horn while the curtain falls.</p>
   <p>The second act--the banquet, Tumas is relating how the Jews, stinking with garlic and onions, are destroying Lithuania, and is interrupted periodically by his listeners' shouts of "Away with the Jews! Death to the imbeciles, etc." Then Olsauskas speaks, shouting: "Long live his majesty...!" but is interrupted by Tumas who blurts: "Colleague!" and Tumas, coming to his senses, continues: "His Majesty, our Holy Father, Bishop, etc." After several speeches a socialist begins to talk. His listeners whistle and, finally, throw out all the socialists. One of the intelligentsia rises on a chair and apologizes to the priests for such insults to them. Everybody kisses their hands and then it is decided to recite three "Hail Marys." They all kneel around the table and recite. The curtain falls. The third act portrays the priests going to bed, while the intelligentsia kisses their hands through the windows and make their departures.</p>
   <p>From this summary the readers can judge for themselves the worth of this comedy. It must be pointed out that the audience laughed until tears came, though it might have pleased some and others not at all.....</p>
   
   <p>The participating actors were : J. Prusinskas as the Reverend Tumas; J. Uktveris as the Reverend Olsauskas; J. Augustinavicius, J. Buragas, and J. Sankunas as three men; Visockiene and Z. Kalvaiciute as ladies. The director was M. Dunduliene.</p>
   <p>As a whole, the comedy was acted not at all badly. Taking the actors separately, Prusinskas was the best in his role as the Reverend Tumas. Lively, nervous, active, liking to stick in his opinion whether it is needed or not--a live copy of the Reverend Tumas.</p>
