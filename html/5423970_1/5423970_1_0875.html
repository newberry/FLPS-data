   <p>The Chicago members of the Lithuanian Socialist Labor Party, branch 4, will give lectures once a month in every part of the city. Even though we meet obstructions when trying to arrange our meetings, we are disregarding all obstacles and we are going forward with our Socialist propaganda. We know that every man wants to have a good living, but his aim to obtain better living conditions is obstructed by the capitalists. Why should such a system exist? One man has too much while millions of people are living in poverty and want. If you want to learn the best possible way of solving this problem, come to the Socialist lecture meeting which will be held at Rasinskas Hall, 633 S. Canal St., July 7, 1906, at 7 P.M. At this meeting there will be good speakers. They will explain why the masses are living in misery while the few are living in luxury; why the people are so ignorant, and why they are duped into thinking that such a system is the best for the working class--the wage slaves.</p>
