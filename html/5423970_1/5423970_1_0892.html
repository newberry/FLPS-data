   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists Alliance was organized in 1905. Before the establishment of the Lithuanian Socialists organization, the socialists and their sympathizers belonged to the Lithuanian Freethinkers Association. When the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance central was organized, local Lithuanian Socialists branches were organized all over America. At the same time there was established a Lithuanian Socialists organ, a weekly newspaper Kova (The Struggle.)</p>
   <p>When several branches of the Lithuanian socialists were organized as a foreign socialists organization they joined the American Socialists Party.</p>
   <p>At the same time in Chicago were organized several Lithuanian socialist branches. When there were organized several branches in Chicago and its vicinity, there was formed the 8th district of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance. Then the organizer was elected. With the help of the 8th district members he organized 12 Lithuanian socialists branches in Chicago.</p>

   <p>THE LITHUANIAN SOCIALISTS BRANCHES.</p>
   <p>Almost every Lithuanian Socialist branch has had its own library, and at lectures, Picnics and other festivals it has sold socialist literature. The profits were turned over to the Lithuanian socialist branch. These branches used to have theatrical groups. They performed many theatrical plays for the benefit of the branch, and the actors performed free and many times at their own expense.</p>
   <p>Several branches had their own choirs. The choirs sang not only for their own branch, but also other branches without any charge. If the choir was asked to sing at a non-socialist organization, the choir leader used to charge a few dollars, but the choir members devoted their time free of charge.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists Alliance branch 81, in the year of 1908 organized its own choir under the name of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance, branch 81 choir. Several years later the same choir was named"Pirmyn" - (Forward). The choir still <span class="page-break">3</span>exists, but the members of this choir at present are almost all American born Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Every branch of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance annually used to celebrate the first day of May as the workers holiday with lectures and songs.</p>
   <p>Every branch of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance arranged several lectures, concerts and picnics every year. During the summer, meetings were held on the streets. Speakers were attacked by the socialists' enemies with rotten eggs and stones.</p>
   <p>We are informed that when the socialists performed a theatrical spectacle during lent, only one Lithuanian girl dared to dance.</p>
   <p>The members of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance to the best of their ability and knowledge participated in various activities among Lithuanians. In many of the <span class="page-break">4</span>Lithuanian national organizations the Lithuanian socialists were the leaders.</p>
   <p>THE 8TH DISTRICT OF THE LITHUANIAN SOCIALISTS ALLIANCE.</p>
   <p>The aim of the Lithuanian Socialists of the 8th district was to bring the socialist branches of Chicago and its vicinity into strong unity, to watch the Lithuanian and American public movements, and to make plans for socialistic activity. The Lithuanian socialist branches of the 8th district held once a year their convention, and at this convention plans were made how to spread the socialistic activity in conjunction with the American Socialist Party and in general the whole labor movement.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists Alliance, 8th district, had several speakers. Lecture tours were arranged for the speakers. They explained to the public the science of Socialism, sold literature, and urged the people to join the Socialist party.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists Alliance, 8th district, several times has established Lithuanian and English language schools. Besides other studies, the teachers used <span class="page-break">5</span>to teach those enrolled how to conduct meetings. The Alliance also had a dramatic circle to give theatrical festivals, and a school to train for public speaking, etc.</p>
   <p>The most important accomplishment of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, 8th district, is the establishment of the Naujienos corporation, which today is publishing the daily newspaper, Naujienos.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the World War, three Lithuanian parties started to publish newspapers. The Lithuanian socialists had no money, but they had a strong organization. They started to publish Naujienos as a weekly newspaper. The Catholics, supported by banker Tananevicius, published the daily newspaper Katalikas - (The Catholic). The nationalists, have as their supporter, the banker A. Olszewski. They published the daily newspaper Lietuva. The last two daily newspapers have stopped their publications and the banks are closed. Only the daily newspaper Naujienos still exists.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists Alliance at its best has had 350 branches with about 6500 members. It had its own organ, a weekly newspaper Kova (The Struggle) and a large <span class="page-break">6</span>monthly journal, the Naujoji Gadyne, - (The New Age). The Socialistic newspapers were: Naujienos - (The Liberty) a daily newspaper, Brooklyn, N.Y.; Keleivis - (The Traveler) a weekly newspaper, Boston, Mass.; and several monthly journals of socialistic ideals.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Socialists Alliance was strong up to the year 1921.</p>
   <p>At the end of the World's War, with the spread of the communistic wave, the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance was torn to pieces. In the U.S.A., there are only 10 branches of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance, and only one branch in Chicago.</p>
