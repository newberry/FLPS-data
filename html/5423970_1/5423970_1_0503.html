   <p>The Zinycia Society held its first massmeeting at the Azukas Hall on Sunday, Nov. 26, 1905. At this meeting the establishment of the Lithuanian colony in the United States was discussed. The chairman, in a long talk, showed the public the necessity and the benefit of such a colony. The same views were also expressed by the representatives of the western railroads.</p>
   <p>For the discussion of the affair of establishing such a colony, it would be better to submit the plan to the Lithuanian Alliance of America during its next convention in Chicago. At this meeting the public will have the opportunity to express its desire and approval of the project.</p>
   <p>No matter who establishes it, whether the Lithuanian Alliance of America or some other organization, the public agrees to support the plan.</p>
