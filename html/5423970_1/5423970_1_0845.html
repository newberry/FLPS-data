   <p>The present city administration is made up of political grafters. The city rulers delivered the city over to the contractors, the coal trust, the greed trusts, and the street car and telephone corporations. They rule the city by exploiting the workers.</p>
   <p>The Chicago workers are living in slums, and yet the city's Health Department pays no attention to the misery of the workers.</p>
   <p>During the recent garment workers' strike, the city rulers sent the entire police force against the strikers. The strikers were shot, beaten and arrested. At the same time, the city administration has never tried to stop the robberies which occur daily in this city.</p>

   <p>Therefore in order to eradicate the graft in the city administration, vote for the Socialist party candidates. A Socialist administration will purge the city of grafters, will protect the workers, will build good homes for the working people, will clean up the slums, etc.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Lithuanian Socialists.</p>
