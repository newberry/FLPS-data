   <p>The Lithuanians of Chicago plan to make a good showing in the sale of the Third Liberty Loan bonds, which was begun last Saturday. The people of America are offering millions to Uncle Sam in order to lend him not only the three billion dollars he requires, but double that amount.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians, it is apparent, will not be the last to contribute: in one evening Lithuanians of Chicago came forward with several thousands of dollars and pledged a like amount.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday the Lithuanians held mass meetings in Town of Lake and in Bridgeport. In Town of Lake, Liberty bonds were purchased to the amount of $6100. In Bridgeport the Lithuanians bought bonds amounting to $2,350. At both meetings several hundred applications for Liberty bonds were requested by people who had come to the meetings unprepared to buy.</p>

   <p>In the 18th Street colony, where a Lithuanian mass meeting was held on Monday night, more than two thousand dollars' worth of Liberty bonds were sold.</p>
   <p>Women Are Active</p>
   <p>In Town of Lake a women's committee was also very active. At a little table in one corner of the hall, Mrs. Berzinskas, Mrs. Martha Elijosius, Miss Kusleikis and Mrs. P. Perzinskas sold more than $2,300 in Liberty bonds in less than an hour. In this district, A. Kareiva is the chairman. Others who are very active are the local pastor, Reverend Alexander Skripka, John Balnis, Frank Veriga and others. The speakers at the mass meeting were J. Giraitis, Attorney J. Kucinskas, Reverend Alexander Skripka, J. Elias, and others.</p>
   <p>In the district of Bridgeport, of which M. Kiras is the chairman, the following are very active: Mrs. Valeria Brucas, Mrs. Kiras, Mrs. Kulis, Mrs. Damijonaitis, Mrs. Nausieda, John Martinkus, Ben Butkus and many others.

   <p>In the 18th Street colony, we are informed the most active workers are the local pastor, Reverend Ignatius Albavicius, Mr. Kurkonis, A. Bruozis and others.</p>
   <p>Society Buys For $1,000</p>
   <p>Perhaps the largest single purchase of Liberty bonds was made by the Simanas Daukantas Society in Bridgeport. This Society, by deciding to purchase a thousand dollars' worth of Third Liberty Loan Bonds, an example to other societies, showed them how their patriotic duty to this country can be performed and how they can invest their money in a safe place. Other societies should follow this example. Mrs. Damijonaitis had the privilege of signing the large Simanas Daukantas Society's bond.</p>
