   <p>As we all know the Chicago Lithuanians decided to organize the Lithuanian political clubs in every ward where the Lithuanians are living. Now the Lithuanians are organizing a political club in the 29th ward.</p>
   <p>Saturday, April 14 at 7 o'clock in the evening, in John Overkas's Hall, 4500 S. Paulina street, there will be a Lithuanian mass meeting. All Lithuanians of this ward are invited to come and join this political club. It is for your own benefit. United we can accomplish great deeds in politics.</p>
