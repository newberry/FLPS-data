   <p>In a clash between police and strikers Thursday, December 15.... a Lithuanian striker, Frank Nagrockis, age 33, 1722 Girard Street, was shot to death.... Another Lithuanian, Michael Longevicius, age 29, was seriously wounded.....</p>
   <p>It should be pointed out that in this strike the only victims have been from among the Lithuanian strikers although there are fewer Lithuanians than Jews, Italians, or Czechs. It is a good thing that the Lithuanians stand so firmly, but it is sad that the policemen's bullets hit only our brothers.</p>
   <p>It is an awful blow to Lithuanians. To date no other nationality has been so exploited by the police as ours. Some of the (American) newspapers react disgustingly toward the Lithuanians.</p>
   
   <p>A Lithuanian mass meeting was held at the Freiheit Turner Hall, December 19, where those assembled expressed their protests against the deeds of the police.</p>
