   <p>When I came from Lithuania to Chicago I saw an entirely different motto of uplifting the nation.</p>
   <p>As one walks on the street, one sees many patriotic signs on windows and doors. Such signs are very pleasing to the eye, but they are very discouraging to the pocket. Those pleasing to the eye and patriotic signs are on saloons, where our Lithuanians drink and fight under the name of patriotism.</p>
   <p>We cannot uplift patriotism by drinking and fighting. It is a time to quit drinking, we must engage in cultural activity in order to uplift our patriotism.</p>

   <p>for drunkenness!</p>
   <p>Oh, brothers! When will you enlighten yourselves and understand the horrible things you are doing. Why don't you show to your neighbors that you are civilized and cultured people, instead of drunken brawlers and fighters?</p>
