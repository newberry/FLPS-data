   <p>How strange and peculiar things occur in our city with the taking of the United States census. City census takers refuse to register Lithuanians as Lithuanians, but as Poles or Russians, making the excuse that they have no instructions about Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>In districts populated by Lithuanians, mostly Polish census takers were appointed. For them it was a good opportunity to take advantage of Lithuanian awkwardness. "To register Lithuanians as Poles in order to delude Lithuanians," announced the Polish newspaper Dziennik Narodowy, a recently started Polish paper in our city, published by Polish nationalists in order to harm other Polish newspapers.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians demand of census takers that all Lithuanians be registered as Lithuanians, otherwise they don't want to be registered at all. Census takers have no right to register us other than as a separate nationality. About this there wan't any explanation from Washington.</p>

   <p>Further, that same Polish newspaper says (maybe on account of its stupidity) that one Lithuanian wrote a letter to the director of the National Census in Washington and received an answer that Lithuanians can't represent a separate nation because Lithuania never was a separate and independent country. That the census takers were given a free will to register Lithuanians either as Poles, Russians or even as Germans.</p>
   <p>We like to ask Dziennik Narodowy why not register as Poles all Chinamen, Turks, Gypsies, etc. Such absurdities proclaim our "Gentlemen Polaks," who call themselves a progressive people. There is nothing else for the Lithuanians to do but to raise a protest against Polish lies and appeal to Washington and ask whether the United States government doesn't want to make a distinction between Lithuanians and "Polaks," or maybe just Polaks themselves spred false rumor about that Lithuanian who wrote the letter to National Census director in Washington.</p>
