   <p>With the publication of our appeal in the last number of the Lietuva, other voices were also raised, asking that a general convention of Lithuanian-Americans be called to discuss the present plight of Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The problem of Lithuania, in the appeals which have made and are making their appearance in the press, is also being viewed from more angles than we had taken cognizance of in our appeal. In our appeal, in our last issue, we turned our attention to the losses Lithuania would suffer in the event of battles between the enemies on her fields; we pointed out how the wealth of the Lithuanians would be destroyed; into what a sea of misery many Lithuanians would be pushed, and in what a sad state our orphans would find themselves. Starvation might look more than one of them in the eye. Those Lithuanians, who will suffer in Lithuania, will very often be our relatives, our gray-haired parents, our brothers, and our sisters.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>When an awful misfortune strikes, one does not look to see whether the sufferers are one's relatives or whether they are total strangers. Common decency commands everyone to answer the pleas of the injured and to aid them as much as possible. A human being, seeing another human being, or even a beast, in trouble, will always stretch out a helping hand. A man who does otherwise is not worthy of being called a human being.</p>
   <p>It is not only common decency that forces us Lithuanian-Americans to go to Lithuania's aid. There, across the sea, we have left behind those who have given us life: who raised us and instructed us and made us what we are today. Our native land remains there and is in need of aid now.</p>
   <p>A person who tramples the voice of humaneness under his feet and kills his sense of humane duty, is a traitor. And a person who forgets his native land and his parents when they are in trouble, is doubly a traitor.</p>
   <p>But we Lithuanians can hardly say that there are many of such traitors among us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Regardless of what tendencies a person has, what viewpoints he embraces, it is very difficult to sink below the level of humaneness and to smother completely the voice of one's conscience. There will come an hour, which will move the soul of a man from its very foundations. It will awaken the sleeping voice of his conscience and he, whom we had come to regard as a traitor, will speak words which he had not spoken for a long time or probably had never spoken. The strings of his soul, which were forgotten in his bosom, and, you will find, had begun to rust, will strike a chord. It is difficult to kill the soul. It only falls asleep. But the hour comes and it is awake again, stronger and firmer than before.</p>
   <p>This belief in man and the innate forces of his soul led us to appeal to all Lithuanians, last week, without regard to their tendencies and differences of opinion, to stand shoulder to shoulder and go to the aid of those who, across the sea, are now standing on the very brink of the abyss of misery. And we sincerely believe that the more noble people of all tendencies will agree with us in this opinion. We think that the contention that the people of some tendencies will refuse to work hand in hand with the others at this moment, has <span class="page-break">\4</span>been expressed too soon and without thorough reflection.</p>
   <p>Our expectation to find a human being in the person of every Lithuanian, permits us to confidently expect the proposal of a general and non-partisan, or interparty convention to have a favorable echo everywhere. Two other appeals were heard at the same time as ours. The reader will find one of them in this issue of the Lietuva. It is the appeal of Mr. J. Gabrys.</p>
   <p>The second appeal was published in last week's edition of the Tevyne and was entitled "Let Us Discuss Lithuania's Problems." Both the author of this appeal, Mr. F. Zivatkauskas, and Mr. J. Gabrys present the question of a general convention from a different viewpoint than we had taken. In the mentioned appeal Mr. Zivatkauskas says:</p>
   <p>"Now that the war has started, the enslaved nations will raise their voices. Those enslaved nations are the Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Poles, and the Ukrainians. It is possible that those enslaved nations, with the exception of the Lithuanians, are already drawing up their demands and are preparing for an <span class="page-break">\5</span>opportunity. Up to now we have not yet concerned ourselves with this matter.</p>
   <p>"A discussion is necessary. It is possible that not only one voice will be raised now. It is possible that there may be a revolution in which those enslaved nations will participate.</p>
   <p>"I, therefore, offer the suggestion that a second Lithuanian-American Political Convention be called. At this convention we would have to consider plans for a fight for Lithuania's autonomy. We could co-operate with a convention which could be held in Vilnius or in Riga, if it would be possible for us to work together with the Latvians and gain our independence with them. At this convention we would have to prepare a memorial of all our demands and send it to every country in Europe.</p>
   <p>"Although such a memorial would not immediately bring us the desired results, at least our voices would be raised, demanding political freedom and the right to live independently. We would thus show that we Lithuanians understand <span class="page-break">\6</span>politics and that we demand for our Motherland that without which no nation can persevere: that is, freedom.</p>
   <p>"Now the opportunity presents itself.... We must take advantage of this opportunity. We have an example in the fact that Albania received her autonomy after the Balkan War.</p>
   <p>"I hereby earnestly advise all the lodges of the Lithuanian Alliance of America to discuss this matter at their meetings and to publish their opinions and the results of such discussions in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>"I especially turn to the newspapers of the Lithuanian-Americans with this matter. Let them raise the question of independence. The Lithuanian Press Society, as an organized body of our newspapers, could concern itself with the calling of such a convention.</p>
   <p>"Men of Lithuania in America! Living in a free country, confer on your Mother-land's freedom, on the autonomy of Lithuania!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Such is the appeal which was published in the Tevyne. It, like Mr. Gabry's appeal in this issue of the Lietuva, places the matter in a purely political category.</p>
   <p>The question of Lithuania's independence, it has been apparent, is a common one to all factions of our people. It seems that all Lithuanians are agreed on the principle itself. One wishes to believe that, in practice also, it would be possible for all to meet for common discussions.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to disagree with Mr. Zivatkauskas' contention that the moment is excellent. No better opportunity is needed to bring this question into the open. And we should concern ourselves with doing so, without delay. The invitation to the Lithuanian Alliance lodges to concern themselves with the discussion of this matter, is undoubtedly a good one.</p>
   <p>However, we must not forget one thing. Mr. Zivatkauskas himself does not make any guarantee that, though this is the hour of all kinds of opportunity, we will <span class="page-break">\8</span>necessarily gain Lithuania's autonomy. That is only a possibility which has nothing inevitably certain about it, regardless of how sincerely we would want it.</p>
   <p>But, on the other hand, we do know certainly that Lithuania will suffer from this war whether it will become independent or whether it will remain under the protection of another, larger nation. And, no matter what questions we do discuss, we must not forget that fact.</p>
   <p>Opinions concerning the "Assistance Fund" which we suggested, are already being expressed. The editors of the Lietuva received the following letter from Mr. J. K. Vasiliauskas, secretary of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance:</p>
   <p>"Honored Sirs:</p>
   <p>A general (nonpartisan) convention</p>
   <p>of Lithuanian-Americans to found a</p>
   <p>Lithuanian Assistance Fund is necessary, and I sincerely support <span class="page-break">\9</span>you in this matter.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>J. K. Vasiliauskas".</p>
   <p>As the reader will find in the "Local News" of this issue of the Lietuva, the Second (Chicago) District of the Lithuanian Alliance raised that matter at its monthly meeting and approved of it unanimously. We believe that the other sections of the Lithuanian Alliance and other organizations will also cooperate as speedily and in such unity.</p>
   <p>However, this matter should be made the concern of all Lithuanians. And that can only be done in the suggested convention.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in our opinion, such a convention would have a twofold purpose:</p>
   <p>(1) to decide finally and put in order the matter of providing relief, and</p>
   <p>(2) to weigh political questions being raised in connection with the present situation in Europe.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>While the calling of a convention is being discussed, it is necessary that our newspapers raise the question as broadly as possible and weigh the various matters. This would be a great help even to the convention itself, for much would be already prepared and the convention would be enabled to decide, more speedily, what should be done.</p>
