   <p>The true meaning of the Monroe Doctrine has been more or less a puzzle for many years. Generally speaking, the doctrine is supposed to mean "America for Americans." However, after many years of bitter experiences, the Latin and Central American republics have finally learned the true meaning of that doctrine--"America for Wall Street." Formerly the "protection" policy of the United States received some sympathy from the South and Central American republics; but now that sympathy has vanished completely. The true nature of that "protection" policy has been unmasked. And now the war against American capitalists is more or less going on in all of South and Central America.</p>
   <p>The South and Central American republics are now seriously considering <span class="page-break">2</span>the formation of a Pan-American League, without the United States. The reason for this movement is to combat United States imperialists, who have succeeded in gaining a dominating influence in all these republics. Some are completely under their control; others are only under partial control. The United States Government is supporting all these imperialistic policies of American capitalists. For this reason, the United States Government has become very unpopular in the South and Central American republics. It is said that the desire of these republics to organize independently of the United States is causing grave concern in political circles in Washington, D.C. If all these republics form a league, without the United States, then the United States, being an outsider, would be unable to control that league. The union of twenty republics, although small, would create a power large enough to successfully resist the domination of American financiers.</p>

   <p>American imperialism is steadily growing more despotic. It can maintain its power only by brutal force. This fact is getting clearer even to the workers of America. This awakening among the workers adds greatly to the welfare of the American labor movement.</p>
