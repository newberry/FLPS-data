   <p>There were times in this world when living organisms did not know how to govern themselves, and did not seek to govern others. However, during the lapse of many ages, certain evolutionary changes took place. One of the results of this evolutionary process was the development of men and women, who later became philosophers, scientists, poets, and great inventors.</p>
   <p>Those primitive ages did not elapse as fast as some people believed they should. They dragged along very slowly. Now they are so far in the distant past that we can view them only with imaginative eyes, and can see only a very obscure picture. Those past ages changed the nature, as well as the environment, of all living organisms.</p>
   <p>There was an age when a women lead an independent life. She governed herself and her children. However, as the ages rolled by, the time came when a woman was no longer able to raise her children without help, she transferred the support of her children to their father, and later she, herself, accepted him as her provider. Later, women greatly regretted the latter step, because they were enslaved by their mates, devoid of liberty, burdened with all kinds of hardship, and even experienced occasional beatings by their mates. Therefore, it is evident that women made a grave mistake.</p>
   <p>However, in the present age, men have raised themselves to a fairly high cultural level (of course, not all men). Today, men do not desire to enslave their wives. On the contrary, they want their wives to be, at least, equal to them in character and intelligence. The modern man strives to find a mate with developed intellect and lofty ideals, who will cooperate with him bravely, and energetically to lead a prosperous and happy life. This high requirement of men in regard to the character of their life mates has forced women to realize that it is a grave mistake to remain merely as obedient servants, housekeepers, and toys of their husbands.</p>
   <p>Progressive women of other nationalities have realized a long time ago that not only men as individuals, but also the civilization of mankind, demands a greater perfection in the character and intelligence of women. These women have developed their talents to a fairly high intelligent level, and now have become bold enough to demand equal political rights with men. The government does not even dare to oppose their demands. They have been permitted to pursue studies in all the various branches of learning, including all the professions, and today they are competing with the most learned men. Many women are now holding very important positions, which were formerly held only by men of high learning.</p>
   <p>However, many men still look upon the lofty accomplishments of women with great skepticism, they scratch their heads in astonishment when they read books on philosophy and poetry, written by women. There are still plenty of men left who, upon seeing a woman on a rostrum bravely speaking to a large crowd of people, cry out in a disheartened manner: "The end of the world is approaching; Judgement Day cannot be far away," when such radical changes take place on earth.</p>
   <p>It is true that a comparison of the modern age with the past reveals the fact that many radical changes have taken place on earth. An outstanding change has taken place in the position of women. After dragging for many centuries the yoke of slavery, and after many centuries of oppression by ignorance, women have finally started to develop their intellectual powers, and are now marching forward into the light of liberty and honor, together with heroic men.</p>
   <p>Of course, we can be proud of the above fact only so far as women of other nationalities are concerned. We are forced to admit that Lithuanian women have accomplished very few lofty deeds. However, Lithuanian women are waking up. Although still in a drowsy stupor, they have started to say to their husbands: "I am no longer your slave, you must respect me!"</p>
   <p>Lithuanian women of Chicago! If you wish to be respected by your husbands, then first of all cast out from your homes those pails filled with foaming beer, and then make profitable use of your spare moments by reading educational books, and by attending educational meetings and lectures. Then, and only then, will you be in a position to understand whether or not you possess the right to ask your husbands to respect you.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Women's Educational Society of Chicago has been organized with the purpose to persuade Lithuanian women to follow, at least, in the foot-steps of the progressive women of other nationalities. The society holds mass meetings with intelligent speakers, lectures and, from time to time, educational, theatrical presentations. The society also conducts evening classes of instruction for Lithuanian women and girls. Various subjects are taught, such as reading, writing, home economics, etc. These classes are now in the process of organization. All those who are interested in these classes are invited to call at the Fellowship House, on West 33rd Place, near Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>The next public affair of the society will be a lecture and dance, on September 27, at Freiheit Turner hall, 3417 South Halsted Street. The lecture will commence at 5 P.M. After the lecture, young Lithuanians will be able to enjoy themselves by dancing. Admission is only 25 cents. Everybody is invited to come.</p>
