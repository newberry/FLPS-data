   <p>The first divisions of the American army are already in France. That is not pleasant news to the kaiser. The Germans had been convinced that America was merely "bluffing" because, for two and one-half years, the United States had been content to send notes to the kaiser, complaining and pleading, almost on her knees, to avoid war and preserve peace if it could be done in an honorable way. The more America pleaded on her knees the more bravely Germany stepped on her "corns". However, the Germans drew the wrong conclusion in regard to American humility. They believed that the United States was a nation of cowards and skunks, and that she was a bent-over tree which goats could climb. Germany looked upon all warnings as usual American "bluff". But, Germany was greatly mistaken!</p>
   <p>A democratic country is very patient, but once a decision to do something is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>made it is carried out with full force and speed. It is not yet three months since the United States declared war on Germany, but already the American flag is waving in France. In addition to this the Government has been supplied with billions of dollars; a war registration of all men of military age has been completed; and laws have been passed to control food, and curb the use of intoxicating liquors. Uncle Sam is determined to show the kaiser that, when the patience of a democratic country is exhausted and that country is pushed against a wall, it knows how to fight for its own violated and trampled rights and for those of all mankind. The sooner the kaiser realizes this the better it will be for him and for all humanity, for he will then renounce his mad ambition to control the whole world. However, if he fails to see the mistake he is making, then the people of Germany will. Then, and only then, will the war come to an end. There will be no peace so long as the German people will have the least hope of winning the war. Thus, it becomes the duty of everyone who desires an early end of the war to strive to deprive the German people of this last ray of hope. America can do that by prosecuting the war with all her strength and power; in that way the war can be brought to a speedy end.</p>
