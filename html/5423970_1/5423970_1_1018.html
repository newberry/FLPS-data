   <p>p. 6 - Last Sunday about 300 prominent Lithuanian business and professional men gathered once more to honor our young Lithuanian-American, John T. Zuris.</p>
   <p>The dinner itself was enjoyed by all those present, but the speeches, as usual, were less appealing, since a number of our distinguished orators made the usual mistake of becoming over zealous in their efforts to do justice to the occasion. For good measure, as master of ceremonies, Dr. Drangelis gave a long speech between each speaker. Our prominent business men, who were never bothered with politeness or good taste, acted as usual, completely ignoring the speeches. The guest speakers themselves attracted more interest.</p>
   
   <p>The Honorable Chief Justice Sonsteby and County Clerk Michael J. Flynn, were both very popular as speakers. The former presented the judicial robe to our judge while the audience sang the Lithuanian and American National Anthems.</p>
   <p>Among the evening's speakers were: Leonard Simutis, Editor of Draugas (Friend); R. A. Vassale, president and council of the Lithuanian Bar Association; Albin Peters, president of Lithuanians Lawyers' Association; Justin Mackevich; Rev. A. Baltutis; Chief Justice John J. Sonsteby, Dr. Strikol; Mr. Vincas Uzdavinis: Honorable Michael J. Flynn, Clerk of Cook County and Honorable John T. Zuris.</p>
   <p>The musical program was given by two soloists: Ann Juozaitis and John Romanas. Both sang well and were complimented by the speakers.</p>
