   <p>We know very well that the United States congress, whose members are supposed to represent the people and their interests, is nothing else but an institution that is in the service of special interests, the interests of the capitalists. The Congress is dominated by, and its steps are dictated by the capitalists of the country. And probably no other Congress has ever been so favorable to special interests as the present one. During recent times the gang of super-rich gangsters has decided to control Congress still more. And if the public, especially the working people, do not immediately wake up and go into action, the capitalistic gangsters will soon rob them of important natural sources of wealth. And the capitalists will, with the aid of Congress, do all that in a "legal" manner.</p>
   <p>These are the gifts being prepared by both houses of Congress for their bosses. The House of Representatives has accepted the amendment of Congressman Madden <span class="page-break">\2</span>to the present postal laws pertaining to the sending of parcels through the mails. According to existing postal laws only the highest department of the post office can decide as to the limit of the weight of a parcel that can be sent through the mails. Congressman Madden's amendment, however, demands that a limit of fifty pounds be placed upon all parcels that are sent through the mails. Why is such a limitation necessary? Is it for the benefit of the common people, for the general public? Do people desire such a limitation that would prevent them from sending parcels through the mails at a cheaper rate than is charged elsewhere? No, the general public does not and would not desire such a thing. That is desired only by the powerful express companies who suffered a loss of business when the government established the parcel post with rates lower than those charged by the express companies.</p>
   <p>Here is another present that is being prepared by the Senate for the capitalists. Senator Shields has introduced a bill, and it has already been accepted by the Senate, that provides for the placing of all water power in the United States into the hands of profit greedy millionaires. That bill has now been <span class="page-break">\3</span>referred to the House for further action. And if the House approves that bill then all the water power of the country, all navigable rivers, will be forever and without any compensation to the government placed into the hands of the gang of capitalistic bandits. And that is wealth that really belongs to the general public. If our national resources, that are still the property of the general public, would be developed and exploited in a non-partisan manner by the government, or by some private institution under direct government control, then the general public would derive many great benefits. The government would then have a big income for public purposes, and the general public would, at least to some extent, be protected from the capitalistic bandits--from exploitation by the coal, electric, gas, and power trusts.</p>
   <p>Here we have cited only two examples in order to show how our Congress, an institution to which the people send representatives to promote the welfare and prosperity of the nation and people, is acting and behaving! How long will the people tolerate such behavior of their representatives?</p>
