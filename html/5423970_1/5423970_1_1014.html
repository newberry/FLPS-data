   <p>Let us Lithuanians look to other nationalities, they have their officials in every governmental office, why have they? Because they are organized! They are no better than we are. But they have their officials in city, county and state offices, because they have strong political clubs.</p>
   <p>There are many Lithuanians in Spring Valley, Braceville, Pana, Toluca, Pullman, Kensington, South Chicago and in many other towns and cities. In these places there must be organized a Lithuanian political club. Just send the names to A. Olszewski, president of the Alliance of Lithuanian Republicans of Illinois, the charter will be mailed at once.</p>
