   <p>p.3. The fourth chapter of the Lithuanian Socialist League held a big mass meeting in commemoration of "Bloody Sunday" on Friday evening, January 22, at Liberty Hall, corner of Union Avenue and 30th Street.</p>
   <p>P. Grigaitis, editor of the Naujienos (News), delivered the main oration of the meeting. He was a student in St. Petersburg during the "Bloody Sunday" of January 9, 1905, when a peaceful delegation of workers were brutally murdered at the winter palace of the Czar.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grigatis explained how the "Bloody Sunday" incident caused the people of Russia to lose faith in the Czar. Up until that time the workers of Russia had believed that the Czar was a messenger of God and was just and friendly towards the workers of Russia. The unjustified slaughter of thousands of peaceful and innocent workers caused the workers of Russia to start a movement against the Czar.</p>
