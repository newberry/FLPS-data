   <p>Let us look to Lithuanians who worked in politics for a couple of years, today they have very good places. If we unite and advertise our ward through newspapers among other nationalities in Chicago, we have hope, that if united Lithuanians work in politics for a couple of years, few scores of men would have good jobs.</p>
