   <p>p.3................On Mother's Day the young peoples' group gave a banquet in the Rose Room of the Sherman Hotel for their mothers. Several of the fathers were heard to voice a little jealousy, because, the girls do not seem to be planning anything for Father's Day. Maybe the girls will surprise you, Dad!</p>
   <p>But, returning to Mother's Day, a group of young ladies of Lithuanian descent,most of whom are college students, decided that Mother's Day offered a good opportunity not only for honoring their own mothers, but for bringing together the mothers of all the members.</p>
   <p>The girls meet at each other's home, and were therefore acquainted with all the mothers, but a number of the mothers had never met each other. And so it was a gala "how - do - you - do" day!</p>
   <p>An interesting point about this banquet is that there were no speeches, except for the short welcome talk given by the president. The musical program, too, was short and sweet. The dinner was really good, and the bunco game afterward was actually exciting and snappy! Both daughters and mothers are all talking of another such a happy day next year.</p>
