   <p>By birth Lithuanians are one of the healthiest and strongest people among the national groups. But, if we compare ourselves with other peoples, such as the Americans or the Czechs, etc., we will see that in sport activity, they are far superior to us. Why is this so? When we are one of the healthiest nations, why are the others stronger than we are? At first glance it would seem to be impossible, but this is really so. It is not enough to be healthy and strong by birth. Since nature has endowed us with such a treasure as health, it is our privilege to conserve this treasure; to conserve it not by destroying our health, but by gaining greater health, and increasing our vitality. This we can gain by physical exercise, by joining sport activities. Other nations have understood the value of sport, and for this reason, have spread the idea of sport as widely as possible among their people. Let us consider the American sports, baseball, football, and the "falcons" of the Poles, etc.</p>
   
   <p>This is the fruit of their effort. Let us look at those nations that have developed their sport to a high degree. We see them vigorous in strength and energy. They are not only strong and healthy in body, they are strong spiritually and mentally. Only in a healthy body will you find a healthy spirit.</p>
   <p>I do not know why we Lithuanians consider sport activities as child's play: that jumping and running are a degrading form of behavior for grownup people. This wrong conception we have brought from Lithuania. But now, in Lithuania too, they have seen their mistake, and now they are trying to correct it. At present in Lithuania, the students are participating energetically in various sports. Sport activity among the students has produced a new spirit among them. That pessimism, that unwillingness to live, that dreaming flight to nowhere, is diminishing very rapidly, and in a short time the pessimism will entirely disappear. But, let us return to the American Lithuanians. The majority of us are hard-working, ordinary laboring people. Day after day in the factories, we are engaged in hard labor. Not one of those workers will say that when his body is tired, he needs no exercise for his body. But, let us look at the other nationalities. They too work hard, their bodies get tired and weary, but they find the time and opportunity to arrange all kinds of games and exercises. They are living under the same conditions that we do. Well, let us take an example from them. When we have the natural gift of strength and health, we should not remain inferior to others, but we must surpass them. Let us develop our sport activities, and we will see good results at once. Let us get rid of our customary awkwardness!</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Because of such nonsense as the above, written by the editor, B. Balutis, the Lithuanians ceased reading this newspaper, and publication was suspended. Lietuva is full of such idiotic articles.]</p>
