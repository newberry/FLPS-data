   <p>On January 26th a lecture on the subject, "The Woman of the Future," was delivered by Mrs. Seskiene. In her lecture she stated in what inequality the human race lives. The most brutal man, who crushed the brains out, shed blood, was worshiped as a hero and great benefactor. This brutal man has enslaved the women and the women became hero-worshipers. The young maidens throw flowers on the road when such a hero comes back from war after slaughtering innocent and defenseless people. Such war heroes have been made gods and worshiped as such. They become our priests and other oppressors and exploiters of humanity.</p>
   <p>But science crushed superstition and hero worship. People began to realize, to think why should the brainless crowned head keep them in oppression. Why should the long-coated priests always keep the people in deadly fear of hell. The new ideas came up in social problems; the leaders of human rights have proved to the people that they should not worship the past with its bended back, that the people must look to the future, how to improve their living condition. The people revolted despite the priests' warning of hell and the devil. The people won freedom, and women are made free; only the free woman can rear children, educate them not with threats, but by kindness and education. Only a free brain and healthy body bring forth inventions and progress. The people began to publish literature, read and educate themselves. Man and woman began to understand each other, that in order to make better future they must work together.</p>
   <p>Such was the lecture given by the first Lithuanian woman of Chicago.</p>
