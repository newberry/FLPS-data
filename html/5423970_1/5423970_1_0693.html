   <p>A rather unusual thing is happening. The anthracite coal companies have inserted big paid advertisements in the larger newspapers of America--in Chicago, New York, and other cities--in which they criticize the demands made by their employees. They attempt to show that the workers are demanding more than the companies are capable of giving them. They say that the companies can grant the demands made by the workers only if the price of coal is raised.</p>
   <p>It is an old story: The capitalists pose as friends of the people, and try to convince the public that the workers are its enemies. But the present occasion is unusual in that the companies are conducting their campaign against the workers with the assistance of the newspapers. Apparently, they are prepared to squander thousands of dollars in an attempt to swing public opinion over to their side.</p>
