   <p>What do those letters, W. S. S., mean? They mean War-Savings Stamps.</p>
   <p>The Government has issued two kinds of War-Savings Stamps: separate stamps which sell for twenty-five cents each, and certificates which sell for five dollars each. When you have accumulated five dollars' worth of the twenty-five cent stamps they should be exchanged for a five-dollar certificate. This certificate bears four per cent interest--more than the banks usually pay.</p>
   <p>The rest of this month is being devoted to a drive to sell more of these stamps. We advise all Lithuanians to purchase them.</p>
   <p>The sale of War-Savings Stamps was one of the best undertakings initiated by the Government of this country during the war. This is attested to by the fact that <span class="page-break">\2</span>millions of dollars' worth of these stamps have been purchased by the people up to now.</p>
   <p>First of all, War-Savings Stamps are a good financial investment, for they pay you four per cent interest. In the second place, they are accessible to all--the poor and rich, the old and young. Anybody can afford to pay a quarter for a stamp.</p>
   <p>In the third place, War-Savings Stamps encourage thrift, a virtue which should be cultivated by all--the young as well as the old.</p>
   <p>Finally, those quarters add up to the millions of dollars needed by the Government to wind up all war business: the transportation of the troops back to America, the completion of various projects, etc.</p>
   <p>This newspaper has often urged its readers to purchase these stamps. It can <span class="page-break">\3</span>give you no better advice at this time. Buy as many War-Savings Stamps as possible!</p>
