   <p>Later for every prominent Lithuanian who came from Lithuania, or from any other country, or any local prominent person there was given a banquet, During the time of its existence, the Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce participated in all the activities of the Chicago Lithuanians, and to the best of its ability, helped the Lithuanian institutions.</p>
   <p>In 1932, at the yearly meeting, J.J. Elias was elected president of the Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce. Since he was the former president of the Universal State Bank, and the bank at that time was closed, the majority of the members were dissatisfied with the results of this election.</p>
   
   <p>The discontented members left the Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce organizations and organized a new society under the name of the Professional and Businessmen Association. Through the efforts of this new organization, the Lithuanian Day was arranged at the Chicago World's Fair, July 16, 1933.</p>
   <p>Later, the Lithuanian Professional and Businessmen's Association was reorganized and incorporated under the name of the Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce of Illinois.</p>
