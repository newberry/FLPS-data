   <p>Dr. A. L. Graiciunas is giving the clericals no respite with his agitation against parochial schools. In Vienybe Lietuviu, he exposed the weaknesses and wrongs of the present parish schools, basing his accusations on reports and statistics from Chicago Lithuanian parochial schools. And he wrote so much that Draugas cannot offer explanations fast enough.</p>
   <p>Unable to defend the parochial schools, Draugas admits they are unfit but expresses the faith that these schools will improve after the founding of the St. Casimir's Convent.</p>
   <p>In Vienybe Lietuviu, Dr. Graiciunas suggests that a petition be sent to the Chicago Archbishop, demanding that the parochial schools be improved.</p>

   <p>I have no confidence for the success of such a petition. It is true that our parish schools are unfit, that they are conducted by semi-educated organists, sacristans, and sisters who do not have the slightest understanding of pedagogic problems, but petitions will not improve them. For the purpose of the church here is not to promote virtues but to collect dollars. A licentious priest who pays large assessments to his bishop will always have the protection of his spiritual authorities.</p>
   <p>It would be best not to send children to the parochial schools, but to send them instead to such public schools as will provide the teaching of the Lithuanian language. We should demand that the government should see to it that all children's schools, no matter of what kind, be taught by accredited teachers, that the pedagogic program be universalized as much as possible, and that all schools be under the supervision of the school board now in charge of the government schools.</p>

   <p>Then, whether they wish it or not, the parochial schools would have to improve.</p>
   <p>I see no other way out.</p>
