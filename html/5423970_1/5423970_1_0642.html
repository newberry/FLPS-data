   <p>Since last Monday the population census is being taken of all the people in Chicago. There are special people appointed for this job. They are going from house to house, registering every man and woman, their age and nationality. Therefore, all Lithuanians be sure to register as Lithuanians, but not as Russians or Poles. By not registering as Lithuanians, you are doing a great injury to the Lithuanian nation, by doing that we cannot prove that we are Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>When the American comes to you for registration, and you cannot speak English, first tell to him that you are from Lithuania, then he will know who you are, and he will register you as a Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>Some Lithuanians are objecting and say that they will not register as Lithuanians, they wanted to register as Samogitians. Samogitians (Zemaiciai) is the same Lithuanian people. In the history of Lithuanians, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the lower part by the Baltic Sea, were called Zemaiciai or Samogitians, because they lived in low lands, and in the other part of Lithuania, the territory south of Vilnius, was called Augstaiciai - higher in-habitants - living on the higher land - were called, or were known as Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Of course, there different minor dialects in the speaking language. We have different dialects because we had no Lithuanian literature, which was prohibited by the Russian government.</p>
   <p>Especially the Roman pope wanted to conquer the Samogitians, and held them as distinct or entirely different nation from Lithuanians. But our Grand Dukes Algirdas and Keistutis, in the 14th century, proved to the pope that the Samogitians were the real Lithuanians, and that they would defend and they did defend Lithuania from the aggression of the pope.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>If you don't want to register as Lithuanian, but to register as Samogitians, then every parishioner would say that he wants to register by his parish name.</p>
   <p>Do not register as Russians, Poles or Prussians - register as Lithuanians.</p>
