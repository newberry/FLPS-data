   <p>We often read articles in our newspapers which lament about the plight of our people in America. They complain that our people lead miserable lives in the cities, that they are ignorant, beset with drunkenness, that it is difficult to find steady employment, and that many are employed only three or four days per week. The blame for all these conditions is placed on the capitalists, and the present social order. For that reason, the removal of the present social order is advocated.</p>
   <p>Can it be true that our people have sunk so deeply into misery that they are unable to get out? In my opinion, the situation is not as hopeless as it is being pictured. Much can be done to improve our lot; all we need is energy and the will to march forward.</p>
   <p>It would take a long time to wreck or change the present social order; such changes take place very slowly. The people of today do not wait for manna to fall from the heavens as it did during the time of Moses. The people of today must adjust themselves to modern conditions. There are still plenty of opportunities left in America for making a good living; we should seek and take advantage of these opportunities. One of the best ways to get ahead is to purchase real property. However, it is necessary to study and determine what kind of real property is the most profitable.</p>
   <p>Many of our people purchase homes in the cities. They purchase them on partial payment plans, and it requires ten or more years to complete the payments. And what do they gain by such purchases? Very little. When one of our countrymen purchases a home for two thousand dollars, he is compelled to work for the rest of his life in a factory or mine, but the gain on his property is very little--usually about ten or fifteen dollars. Very few of our countrymen know how to operate a business, because that requires knowledge, ability, and experience. Therefore, would it not be better if we purchased farms?</p>
   <p>A person who invests $1,500 or $2,000 in a farm, the same amount which he pays  for a home, in a few years he can become a completely independent man. Land in America is very cheap. Land can be purchased for as low as five, ten, or fifteen dollars per acre. It is also possible to obtain land from the government under the so-called Homestead Law at from $1.25 to $2 per acre on time payments. Can anyone expect better terms? Even a person without a cent can secure land and become wealthy. For example, in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan, land is being sold on very easy terms. A person who purchases some of this land on a partial payment also can find employment while he is operating his farm; there are plenty of forest jobs in those two states.</p>
   <p>There are also good opportunities for securing land in the western states. It is not as difficult to secure a farm as some people believe. Payments for a farm can be met with earnings from private employment. There are many opportunities for private employment in the country districts, especially during the summer time, when it is possible to earn from two to three dollars per day. No one can experience any misery in the western states during the summertime.</p>
   
   <p>Farming in America pays fairly good dividends, because nearly all farm products have very good prices. I worked for a long time for a farmer who was renting a farm of fifty acres. He paid an annual rent of $500. He hired two farm hands every summer, and paid each eighteen to twenty-three dollars per month in the form of food, shelter, and washing. In spite of all these expenses, the farmer is leading a very prosperous life.</p>
   <p>I know a person who, while being employed in a factory, rented a small farm for $100 per year. He hired a worker, who tilled the soil and planted cabbage. He paid the worker over $100 for his work. When the cabbage had matured, he gathered the heads himself after working hours, and sold them for $900. Can anyone realize such a large yearly profit by merely working in a factory?</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us stop complaining, and take to the land, where we can lead peaceful and prosperous lives. By doing so, we will rid ourselves of that "rotten social order" and "capitalistic exploitation." If we will continue to lament, with elbows resting on saloon bars, that times are bad, and that it is impossible to find work, then we will never see better days.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us take to the land; there is no misery there.</p>
