   <p>There is in Chicago an ex-monk who is going among Lithuanians and selling pieces of the Holy Mother's skirt, and Christ's nails. Many simple-minded Lithuanians are buying these frauds as relics of Christ and his mother. But when we began to question the monk about the truth of those relics, we forced him to admit that the nails are not Christ's, and that the skirt is not from the Holy Mother's skirt.</p>
   <p>Brothers, Lithuanians, we need education but not relics when we are educated nobody will fool us with all kinds of relics.</p>
