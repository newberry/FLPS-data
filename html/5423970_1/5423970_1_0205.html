   <p>Through the effort of the Polish lawyer Mr.Maximilian Dzemala, the Chicago Board of Education will open an evening school to Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Now, we must have a Lithuanian who can pass an examination in the English language. Also, there must be not less than forty persons who want to attend such a school. Therefore Lithuanians, you have a great opportunity to learn English. The teacher will be a good one because he must pass an examination before he will be qualified to teach.</p>
   <p>Now Lithuanians, come to the office of Lietuva to sign and register your name for such a school.</p>
   <p>The first school for Lithuanians will be in the Bridgeport Mure Holden School, 31st street.</p>
   <p>If there are numerous volunteers other schools will be opened on Canal street and another school on Town of Lake. We are urging Lithuanians not to miss this great opportunity. Come and sign your name without delay. In this school will be taught the English and Lithuanian languages, and the lessons will be given free.</p>
