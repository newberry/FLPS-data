   <p>The Singers' Circle of the fourth branch of the Lithuanian Socialist League, Chicago, successfully presented "Audra Giedroje" (A Storm in Fair Weather), a three-act farce, Sunday evening, at Hull House, Halsted and Polk Streets.</p>
   <p>This was the first time the play was ever presented in Chicago. The play is based on an illicit love affair. It is very entertaining and created hilarious laughter among the audience.</p>
   <p>B. Vaitekunas deserves most of the credit for the successful presentation of the play, because he spent much time and energy in training the performers.</p>
   <p>The leading roles of the play were enacted by the following Lithuanian artists: B. Vaitekunas, the role of "Bertasius"; J. Briedis, the role of "Kupetisa"; and J. Sankunas, who played the role of "Raulas."</p>
   <p>In addition to the play, the audience was entertained with beautiful Lithuanian songs, working class songs, recitations, and monologues.</p>
