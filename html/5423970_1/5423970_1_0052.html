   <p>The Dr. Vincas Kudirka Society, a Chicago Lithuanian mutual aid society, decided at its last regular meeting to donate ten dollars for the upkeep of the Lithuanian students' library in Valparaiso University, Valparaiso, Indiana. This donation was made in answer to an appeal by Mr. Zalatorius, librarian at the university, who stated that immediate help was needed in order to maintain the library.</p>
   <p>More than one hundred Lithuanian students are attending Valparaiso University, and most of them are from Chicago.</p>
