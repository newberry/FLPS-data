   <p>The Bolsheviks consider themselves the most progressive democrats, the true apostles of a Garden-of-Eden-on-earth. It is to be understood that they rule according to the wishes of the working people and with their consent, while the "bourgeoisie" rules the people with whip and deception. The cream of the Socialists, in other words the essence of the most progressive Russian Socialism, would never rule against the wishes and the will of the people. That is the theory.</p>
   <p>Let us glance at the practice. The Bolsheviks rule contrary to the wishes and the will of the people. otherwise, they would not have to kill thousands and thousands of people. The Bolsheviks do not rule with whip and deception because those would be such inadequate tools! They rule with the help of their Red Guards and their bayonets.</p>
   <p>The Red Guards are composed of fanatic Bolsheviks who were formerly criminalistic vagabonds and other dregs of society. The Bolshevik Government, it is said, pays them thirty rubles a day on the condition that they fulfill blindly the commands of their Bolshevik lords.</p>
   <p>In other words, the "most progressive democracy of the world" rules with the help of a hired mob of murderers, thus reviving the "glorious" days of barbarism, when the pirates of the seas conducted a trade of organized robbery.</p>
   <p>Russia today is in no better circumstances under the Bolsheviks than it was in the twelfth century under the yoke of the Tartars. It is in worse circumstances. The Tartars demanded the payment of tribute, but left internal matters to be controlled by the Russians themselves. The Bolsheviks are not only strangling Russia with a rope about its neck, but also are neglecting internal matters.</p>
   <p>What numerous sins are committed in the name of Democracy!</p>
