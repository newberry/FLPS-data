   <p>The fifth annual convention of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Total Abstinence Alliance took place this week in Minersville, Pennsylvania. This convention presents an opportunity to say a few words about the status of the temperance movement among Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
   <p>Temperance is probably one of those movements in our life toward which all the Lithuanian-American political and religious groups have the same attitude. Regardless of religious beliefs or political affiliations, and in spite of all the vast differences that prevail among the leaders and newspapers of our various factions, everybody looks upon intemperance as an enemy of all mankind, and, everyone is waging a fight against this evil in one way or another.</p>
   <p>The foundation of this unity in regard to the temperance question among the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Lithuanian people lies in the fact that every thinking Lithuanian-American is very conscious of the great harm which intemperance does to mankind, especially to the Lithuanians among whom intemperance is probably more prevalent than among the people of any other nationality. Leaders of all Lithuanian factions fully understand that in order to promote any kind of ideals among our nationals, and in order to secure a strong army of followers and supporters, the first thing that must be done is to drive out the evil spirit of intemperance from among our people. That evil spirit intemperance is a common menace to the leaders of all Lithuanian-American factions. That is the reason why the leaders of every faction are equally engaged in the fight against that great enemy of their idealism. We also agree that the promotion of temperance among our people is more important than any other kind of promotional works. In fact, material and intellectual progress is unthinkable among people who are addicted to the drink habit...</p>
   <p>However, when we glance from the idealistic to the practical side of the temperance movement among our people we discover a very strange situation--and <span class="page-break">\3</span>strange situations are not scarce in the life of Lithuanian-Americans. That strange situation is the mixing of the temperance movement with religion.</p>
   <p>The mixing of such two entirely different things as religion and temperance greatly impedes the successful promotion of temperance. We strongly believe that the leaders of our temperance movement would be glad to see every Lithuanian leader who understands the great importance of the movement join in the work of promoting temperance among our people. However, a great wall has been built around the movement, making it impossible for all advocates of temperance to get together and work in unity. There can be no doubt that there are many ardent apostles of temperance among Lithuanian-American Catholics. But there also are many such apostles among Lithuanian Protestants and the so-called Freethinkers. The united effort of all these forces--and there are not very many forces among our people because of the small number of our nationals--is absolutely necessary in order to wage a successful fight against intemperance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>No one can deny the truth of the statement that intemperance is a destructive evil to every individual, regardless of his religious belief or political affiliation. We do not believe that our Catholic temperance promotors would like to see intemperance prevail among the non-Catholic Lithuanians; we sincerely believe that they would like to see temperance prevail among all Lithuanians, Catholics and non-Catholics. After all, we all benefit from the promotion of temperance, regardless of whether the promotional work is done by a Catholic, Protestant, Freethinker, or by a person of some other religious belief.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we are completely at a loss to understand why our Lithuanian temperance promoters who believe in the Catholic religion have set up a religious wall around their activities and in that manner have isolated themselves from their fellow, though non-Catholic, temperance advocates. Why was it necessary for the temperance convention, which took place this week, to be labeled with the letters "R.C."? Why are Lithuanians of other religious beliefs pushed aside and denied the opportunity of promoting temperance with united forces?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>All Lithuanians are shouting that we need unity. Why, then, are we dividing ourselves in the fight against intemperance? Why cannot all Lithuanians, regardless of religious convictions, unite in the fight against an evil which we all recognize as our common enemy? we denounce all those who employ religion or politics in the fight against intemperance. Logic demands that such practice be condemned.</p>
   <p>The goal of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Total Abstinence Alliance is very good and praiseworthy. However, the efforts of that Alliance are far from being as successful as they should be. The reason for this must, first of all, be sought in the practice of mixing such elements with the temperance movement that are altogether foreign, and a hindrance, to the movement.</p>
