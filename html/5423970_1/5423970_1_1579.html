   <p>Our business men are confronted with a grave problem. A small petition has become very keen, and business methods very complex, requiring a large capital and business engineering, which only big business can afford. Chain stores are displacing individual business men very fast, and the general depression is continually growing worse, with records showing weekly business failures in the country, running regularly from five hundred to six hundred. This makes the future of individual business men very gloomy, and we are facing an alternative of either combining resources, and doing business collectively, on the model of chain stores, or going out of business before reaching the point of bankruptcy.</p>

   <p>This development places upon the Lithuanian-American Chamber of Commerce a responsibility to arouse in the Lithuanian business men the realization of the peril threatening their enterprises, and to get them together in order to seek the adequate solution of the problem. This involves a thorough business education, and the integration of their interests under competent leadership. If this is not done, the time may not be far off when they will be forced out of business and compelled to go back to Lithuania, where there are greater opportunities for individual enterprises than there are in this country and where small capital has a better chance.</p>
   <p>There is one line of business, however, that has not been utilized to any great extent in America - that is trading in commodities made by hand in Lithuania and in other Baltic states. These commodities are very much in demand and are in a field in which there is very little competition.</p>
   <p>There is a great opportunity, for the time being, and until the novelty <span class="page-break">3</span>wears off, in dealing in naturally smoked hams and bacon, genuine Lithuanian home-made sausages, dried mushrooms, Lithuanian candy, and especially in what is called in Lithuania "marmalades." Nothing that can equal their flavor can be found in America.</p>
   <p>In the United States both production and distribution of goods have reached the scientific stage. Raw materials are turned into finished goods with the elimination of all waste. "Only the squeal of a pig gets out of the Stockyards." It is clear, that unless American Lithuanians adjust themselves to there conditions they cannot survive this competition. On the other hand, in Lithuania the field of production and distribution of goods has not as yet reached the scientific stage, for lack of capital. The resources and experience of the American Lithuania business men would find there a ready market, even though the cooperative movement there discourages the individual and corporate enterprise. Lithuania holds an open invitation to capital and initiative, and this invitation should not be ignored by us, since even the great American capital seeks foreign markets <span class="page-break">4</span>and is establishing industrial plants in foreign countries at an ever increasing rate. Statistics show that an average of one plant every day of the year moves from America to Europe where labor is cheaper and markets for products are available.</p>
   <p>Even this alternative requires co-ordination of our efforts and reaching proper understanding with the forces operating in Lithuania. Here, too, the Lithuanian-American Chamber of Commerce must face a great problem and seek its proper solution. To being with, our organization should come into a close contact with the Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce operating in the Republic of Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Initiative should come from the National Chamber of Commerce in Lithuania, if not from the Lithuanian government itself. Through a survey made of the opportunities in the country, the Chamber of Commerce could show what is needed most in a community and what the facilities are for manufacturing certain goods.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>A survey of this kind should show what kind of industry is needed, how much capital would be required to carry on this industry, and what profit a manufacturer or dealer could expect to realize from it.</p>
   <p>Whenever such a survey of each individual situation will be made, the Chamber of Commerce in America will be only too glad to advertise these opportunities, and cooperate by securing capital and experts in America to carry out the plan. This is one of the purposes of my journey to Lithuania this year.</p>
