To date there have already been a number of articles submitted for the "Lithuanian contest," but we find that they are from persons living outside of Chicago - as far away as Missouri and Pennsylvania. What is the matter with Chicago's authors? Yes, anybody wishing to win the prize had better put on his or her thinking cap and take pen in and right now, for the closing date is July 21, 1930. No stories mailed after that date will be accepted.</p>
   <p>And who are the judges? Hear ye: Miss Navera Naglevicins, a charming mademoiselle who has traveled in France, England and Lithuania, but who is making America her home. Mr. Stephen Darius, the popular aviator, who will some day, perhaps, take us all to Lithuania in his plane. He too has been over-sea's, though he hails from our United States.</p>

   <p>Dr. A. Zymonth, who is as well known and liked by young folks as by his contempories. The prize? To be announced in the next issue of this section.</p>
   <p>So come on, young Americans who have never been in Lithuania, write down your ideas of what that county is like- or, in other words, write down what sort of a picture Lithuania brings to your mind.</p>
   <p>When writing your story about that beautiful country: There is only one restriction imposed upon you, namely that your story, poem, account, narrative or whatever you want to call it must not exceed five-hundred words.</p>
   <p>And remember, please, to give us your full name, address, education and occupation.</p>
