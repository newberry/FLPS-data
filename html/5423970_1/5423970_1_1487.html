   <p>Up to the present time twenty-four Lithuanian families have bought farms and ten of them are now living on them. J. Balcewiczius, a priest, started to build the church on his own farm. We are helping in the building of the church with our labor. The church is not far from Hazen, Arkansas, where the land is fertile and crops can be raised abundantly.</p>
   <p>(This Lithuanian colony was started by A. Olszewski, editor and publisher of Lietuva.)</p>
