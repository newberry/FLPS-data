   <p>"Save the Belgians!" is the cry in one newspaper. "Remember", this newspaper continues, "how Belgian women were treated!"</p>
   <p>Yes, we remember what capitalism does to the women of America. Capitalism drives our women into houses of prostitution. Capitalism drives our women to insanity, to crime, to immorality. Capitalism deprives our women of the pleasures of life by forcing them to hard labor, by paying the less than is necessary for the bare necessities of life.</p>
   <p>Yes, the women of America are suffering as much from the capitalists as are the women of Belgium from the invaders.</p>
