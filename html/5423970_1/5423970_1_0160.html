   <p>Our rector brought Polish nuns to the Lithuanian school. We have nothing to do with what is going on in the Lithuanian parish school, what and how they are teaching, it is not our affair. We are not against the Polish teachers in Polish schools where they are teaching, but what is good for Polish schools is not good for the Lithuanian school.</p>
   <p>As far as we have heard none of the Polish nuns knows Lithuanian. How can they teach our children the Lithuanian language?</p>
