   <p>Two years ago Varpas (The Bell) cried: "Society, give us women whom we could marry!"</p>
   <p>Really, this is a very important problem. There are many Lithuanian mates to give birth to children, but cultured women are lacking. There are many intelligent Lithuanian men in America who are not married. When you ask one why he does not marry, the answer is that there are no intelligent girls among the Lithuanians. Therefore, for lack of intelligent Lithuanian girls in America, the intelligent men cannot get married and cannot form an intelligent Lithuanian class.</p>
   <p>The progress of the intellectual advancement of Lithuanians is stopped by the lack of an intelligent class of women among the Lithuanians in America. It will take a long time before we will have intelligent women in America.</p>
   
   <p>It is the duty of our men to marry such uneducated women, and after marriage teach them to become educated. Then we will be able to have higher intellectuals among the Lithuanians.</p>
