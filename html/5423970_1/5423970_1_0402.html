   <p>Comrade workers! The month of May is now here. The grass is turning green, the trees unfold their leaves, and flowers decorate the fields. Many living things have awakened after a long winter's sleep and have renewed their perennial struggle for existence. Comrades, it is also time for us to awaken from a long sleep, a slumber that has lasted for many hundreds of years. It is now time for us to open our eyes and see why we are living on this earth.</p>
   <p>We work fifteen or sixteen hours per day for the smallest possible compensation, in the most filthy places of employment where the air is foul and where the rays of the sun never enter. Besides all this, we suffer all sorts of abuses from our bosses who do not consider us as human beings. Our comrades are dying by the hundreds from various diseases which they contracted <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in filthy places of employment, or they die from injuries or are killed in accidents because there is no protection in the factories against such happenings. We who are still alive and healthy do not pay any attention to such matters until we ourselves become such victims of the capitalists and are forced to part with this world at an early age, often in the flower of our youth.</p>
   <p>Why do we tolerate all these hardships and abuses? Is it because our employers are so poor that they are unable to better our working conditions or pay us higher wages? They are not poor, because every year they make millions of dollars profit from our labor. Take, for example, the past year which was the worst year for us. I say that it was the worst year for us because we had to walk from one factory to another, ragged and hungry, and beg the capitalists to be kind and have mercy on us by giving as jobs,but instead of giving us jobs their hired servants split our heads with clubs. While we were suffering from the pangs of hunger and misery, during that same year <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Swift and Company had a net profit of fourteen million dollars. Other companies such as Armour and Company and Morris and Company also enjoyed very large profits. Therefore, comrade workers, we see that these capitalists can greatly improve our living but they do not desire to do so. They are massing millions from our misery. Therefore, let us wake up at least once and enter the struggle against our exploiters. This year is an opportune time to win our fight, and we will probably never have another such opportunity.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us not be content with what we are now receiving from the capitalists, barely enough to keep ourselves alive, but let us demand better working conditions and more pay for our work. I am saying let us demand and not pray or beg, because only a beggar who is too lazy to work and does not produce anything can beg; but we produce everything and for that reason we have full right to demand a better living.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>After we win higher wages and better working conditions we will be able to live much longer because we will be able to save more money, and when an unemployment period comes around, when the capitalists chase us out of the factories, then we will have some money with which to live and the ghost of hunger will not threaten us so quickly as it does now.</p>
   <p>In closing this article I again invite you, comrade workers, to enter the struggle; that is, to go out on strike with those workers who are already out on a strike. Do not believe the sweet words of the capitalists, because they want to fool us and again oppress us as they have been doing in the past. Let us organize a union, for without a union there is no unity, and without unity there is no power with which to force our exploiters to submit to our demands. Therefore, let us unite all of our forces and enter into that uncompromising struggle if we wish to win for ourselves better working conditions and a bigger bite of bread for our families.</p>
