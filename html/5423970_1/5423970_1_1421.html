   <p>In the Middle Ages, when scholastic learning was in full bloom, various scholars were attempting to solve the question of whether women have souls, and even whether women are human beings. Today not only the scholars but also the common people have a hearty chuckle over this question. But in place of this question, a new one has spread widely over the world today: "Should women have the same rights as men?"</p>
   <p>Certainly this question is not very different from the question discussed in the Middle Ages. Only the times have changed and with them the manner of thinking and deliberating. In olden times this question was seriously weighed: "How many devils can fit on the point of a pin?" In the same way the answer to the question of whether women have souls was sought.</p>
   <p>Today science has advanced so far that it is no longer curious about how many devils there are on a pin-point, but instead investigates bacteria which, <span class="page-break">\2</span>increasing rapidly, bring great harm to humanity in the form of contagious diseases. Today we are interested in the evolution of social organization, the causes of that evolution, and the changes that were born of it. We are occupied in learning what relationship the planet on which we live has with other heavenly bodies, the evolution of life by stages, beginning from a one-cell creature almost up to man and the investigation of the paths of this evolution. Therefore, it is not surprising that the question concerning women had to change in its form. A woman is conceded to be a human being now. But is she the same kind as a man? Perhaps she is only the fulfillment, the completion. Perhaps she is not complete in herself. And perhaps she is less trained and has less talent. Perhaps she is a being that cannot account for her work and she might not know how to take care of herself. Such questions and others similar to them are born in the minds of those people who cannot understand life well. They weigh and measure the brains of men and women to ascertain whether women are really as talented as men. Life itself defends <span class="page-break">\3</span>women. At this time we have any women who occupy the highest places in life. With no difficulty we can today find women lawyers, doctors, teachers, and others. In the same manager life comes to the defense of women from other viewpoints. The millions of maids and widows who earn their own and often their families' upkeep, not only without the aid of a man but often in a competitive war with him and in circumstances a hundred times more difficult, must be sufficient proof that a woman is in herself an independent being and has enough strength to overcome all sorts of hardships.</p>
   <p>However, what gave rise to such a question? I have already said that people do not yet understand life. To a person who has watched a woman bending over some kind of a machine all day long, carrying heavy bundles of grain, hoeing the ground all day long and doing other heavy work, then arriving home and hurrying to prepare a meal, taking care of the children and the husband, this question of whether a woman is a man's equal is a question which has no sense.</p>
   <p>This question can appear different to those for whom a woman is a toy, a doll, <span class="page-break">\4</span>a decoration, a pleasure of life. To a Turk, who has several or many do-nothings in his harem, whose only purpose in life is to please their rich owner, to a person who regards a woman as a mannequin on which to hang all kinds of stylish rags and expensive jewelry, to an egoist who strives to use the woman's person for his own benefit--to such people it is necessary to regard women in another light and they today still ask the question: "Are rights proper for women?" But these people stand far from life. They can in no way hinder the changes in life!</p>
   <p>We know from history that in ancient times men and women had equal rights.</p>
   <p>The women were not as weak, even physically, as they are today. The men fished, herded the flock of cattle, and hunted; the women busied themselves with the domestic tasks, with some sort of work and even with the control of the family. Strength and an able mind were necessary for the performance of these tasks; therefore, in the matter of rights the men were absolutely no different from the women.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The inequality began only later, with the passing of time. Warring with foreign nations, the men gained power and learned to regard their conquered foes as inanimate things. They used the energy of their slaves for their own welfare and well-being. Because of this the women became lazy and weak. When the men observed this, they made slaves of the women.</p>
   <p>The weaker and sillier the woman was, the less of the "human being" there was in her.</p>
   <p>So it is today in some spheres of humanity. Working women, it is a known fact, realizing the magnitude of the value of their work and their accomplishments, are fighting for their independence in society. However, the present government is still in the hands of those who, as I have said, find themselves aloof from life and do not understand the true state of women. But the time will come when they will be forced to understand it.</p>
