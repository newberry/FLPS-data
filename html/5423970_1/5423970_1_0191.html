   <p>The Ausra (Aurora) Society, a students' aid and general educational society, looks upon the newly organized Students' Loan Circle as a "competitive hobgoblin." For that reason the former is "employing all kinds of methods in an effort to hinder the development" of the latter.</p>
   <p>J. Puskunigis, of the Students' Loan Circle, states that the Ausra Society really has no reason to fear the new society because there is a vast difference between the basic aims of these two societies.</p>
   <p>The sole purpose of the Ausra Society is to promote in a general way the educational uplift of our people. The Society assists all worthy Lithuanian students regarless of political, religious, or class distinctions; only students of religion, and those students who are attending schools that are being operated by religious groups, are eligible for assistance.</p>

   <p>The Students' Loan Circle assists only those students who are actively attached to the working class movement. The purpose of this Society is to provide intellectual leadership for the working class movement, which aims to "free the masses from the bondage of capitalism."</p>
