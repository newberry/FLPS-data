   <p>"Do not destroy the work begun!"</p>
   <p>The name of Zinycia is united with the past of Lithuania and her honor, as the blood with the body. As long as the Zinycia has existed among Lithuanians, the Lithuanian honor and fame were known all over the world. As soon as the Zinycia was destroyed, the Lithuanian nation was destroyed and the Lithuanians are slumbering.</p>
   <p>At last the thunder of might and freedom is rumbling all over the world. The people have at last awakened, the Lithuanians, too, began to rub their eyes; they saw all their misfortunes in the past and in the present.</p>
   <p>On October the 2nd, 1905, at the Northwestern University Settlement, there was organized a new Zinycia. The old Lithuanian Zinycia took care of all the national problems. Likewise the present Zinycia is taking care of the <span class="page-break">2</span>most important problems of our future. We see that the Lithuanians in America are like an uncultivated field, so we have started to work for the benefit of our members and for the nation's honor.</p>
   <p>The founders of the Zinycia see clearly that at present all the Lithuanians are the servants and slaves of foreign nations. The name of Lithuania was stricken from the map and the Lithuanians are counted as the slaves of other nations.</p>
   <p>The American Lithuanians, even though they have lived for a long time in America, have accomplished nothing to improve their condition. We have organizations to help the sick and bury the dead. This proves that our brothers in America are in such condition that they have nothing to live on when they are sick and when they are dead they leave no place to be buried in. Still, never has there been established an organization that would lay the foundation for public welfare.</p>
   <p>I have known many incidents when unfortunate Lithuanians were in distress <span class="page-break">3</span>and unable to get help from their countrymen. They would have been lost had they not received help from strangers.</p>
   <p>Among all organizations disputes are arising. Lithuanian hates Lithuanian. Disagreement and spite split the Lithuanian Alliance of America into two opposing factions. Instead of spreading enlightenment and improving living conditions, the Lithuanians are fighting among themselves.</p>
   <p>The founders of Zinycia have seen that for over twenty years the altercations have not benefited the nation. They have decided to take a more practical course and work among all the Lithuanians, regardless of their views. Zinycia honors and holds every moral Lithuanian as its brother. Zinycia, by taking such a course, wrongs no one, even though at the beginning denunciations were brought forth against this organization. We did not care to answer the baseless attacks, because national problems must be solved in a peaceful, human way.</p>
   <p>One such baseless denunciation is the protest of the Lithuanian Alliance <span class="page-break">4</span>of America, branch 36, published in Katalikas and in Lietuva. I would have paid no attention to such a protest, but as the newspapers gave space to it, I am forced to give some explanations.</p>
   <p>Did the Zinycia ever demand that branch 36 quit the Lithuanian Alliance of America and join the Zinycia? Did the Zinycia ever stick its nose into other people's affairs as branch 36 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America states? Did the Zinycia start to work on the national field by destroying the work of others, as branch 36 is doing now? No. Because at all of the Zinycia's public meetings, the Lithuanians themselves admitted that this project is the most important.</p>
   <p>We have proof that during the past three months the Zinycia has obtained more members than its enemy has for the last 20 years. In Chicago the Zinycia has three branches with 300 members, while the Lithuanian Alliance of America, the branch 36, has only 151 members.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This proves that the people are seeing the usefulness of Zinycia and they are joining it.</p>
   <p>The Zinycia does not obstruct the path of any Lithuanian organization because it has undertaken a new work. Up to the present time no organization has ever taken up such a project.</p>
   <p>The Zinycia was organized so the people could have those benefits which are gained by science, industry, commerce and solidarity. That means that the Zinycia will not go begging for help, but will conduct its own business in the same way as the American business is conducted. The American businessmen are living in palaces, while the Lithuanians are their servants. For this reason we are inviting to our meeting the railroad agents in order to show our brothers that our project is not for collection of money for the poorhouse, but to buy a tract of land on which our members may build their homes and farms without any fear for the future.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Every reasonable question we will answer with pleasure but to baseless and foolish questions we will pay no attention.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians will serve and slave for others only when they will not have industry and commerce of their own. The Zinycia has understood this; hence this appeal of ours: Brothers: Let us get together into a group and work in harmony; fortune will help us and the honor of Zinycia will arise again, and the weary heart of Lithuanians will be happy.</p>
   <p>Let every one go his own way, let them organize colonies and asylums for the poor, let God bless them. The Zinycia is going its own way in organizing a colony where the Lithuanian not only will have his own home and protected future, but will be able to rejuvenate the lost might and honor of Lithuania, to support science and every branch of art. We shall encourage moral amusements that will lift up the Lithuanian name.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanavicia</p>
   <p>President of Zinycia.</p>
