   <p>The Lithuanian committee of the Zinycia (The Temple) announced four months ago its project to organize the Lithuanian colony in America. The Chicago Lithuanians accepted this idea favorably and organized four branches of Zinycia in Chicago. Now these four branches of Zinycia are calling a convention to make plans for further activity and to make by-laws for incorporation.</p>
   <p>To this convention will be invited all the Lithuanian organizations, the newspapers and the persons who have taken part in national affairs.</p>
   <p>The convention will be held on the 8, 9 and the 10 th day of April at the D. Semaika Hall, corner Union and Canalport Avenues. The program will be published later.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Zinycia is a Lithuanian, scientific organization which is taking care of the present and the future existence of our nation.</p>
   <p>The fortune, power and honor of every nation stand on a strong foundation, when the public workers of the nation understand their aims. Where there is no understanding, even of the greatest national movement, blind plans will not bring the desired results.</p>
   <p>The Zinycia is inviting all intelligent Lithuanians, regardless of their views, to come to this convention, to share their opinions, to uphold the good, to eliminate the bad. Such a convention will bring much benefit to the fatherland and the nation.</p>
   <p>Is it necessary to have such an organization, will it not harm the existing societies?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The oldest and the largest Lithuanian organization in America, the Lithuanian Alliance has over five thousand members, while in America there are over 400,000 Lithuanians. Some of them belong to the benefit societies, while many belong to no organization at all. This is clear: there never was an organization recognized by the public, that would answer the various needs of the Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Zinycia organization took the position of bringing all the Lithuanians into one national union, which movement is supported, not by individual persons, but by reason and the good will of the public.</p>
   <p>The present existing Lithuanian organizations not only are going in various directions, but are spreading prejudice against each other. Such disorganization is against the intrinsic rights of the people and ought to be corrected.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Nature stands in harmony and centralization. Let us look to the water and land, to all living creatures. We shall see that everything is knit together by the unseen hand. The existence of one is due to the others and draws strength from the others.</p>
   <p>The common man will understand much better when he looks at the rational beings - the people - who are separated into nations and kingdoms, establishing their own laws. Such a system brings fortune to some people and misery to others.</p>
   <p>The time of the strong fist of the government is passed. We have seen in the Russo-Japanese war that largeness and multitude make the nation strong; that the strength is born of enlightenment, harmony, love of the fatherland and understanding of the national duties.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Through dissension and disorder our strong and worthy nation was lost. The source of the strength of our ancestors was the scientific national organization called the Zinycia.</p>
   <p>Like the sun that gives vital power, the Zinycia enlivened and strengthened the spirit of all Lithuanians who for centuries knew how to defend and safeguard the liberty of their fatherland.</p>
   <p>Our present movement, the effort to regain freedom and fortune, will bring the desired results only when we understand the Lithuanian spirit of this age, unite all our strength, and join ourselves to the national cause like one man. If there is no such organization, let us organize one without delay. The sooner we take action, the sooner we will receive the benefit. If in the ancient days the Zinycia bound <span class="page-break">\6</span>all the Lithuanians by ties of solidarity, let its name in the present bind us in one organization.</p>
   <p>Do not question who brought up the name of Zinycia; this is a minor issue. Let us use this name because it binds us to our greatness in the past.</p>
   <p>Let us not envy the honor, it is the reward of honorable activity. There is a lot of work to be done. There is enough for all of us, and there is plenty of honor, too. The ants and the bees deserve eternal honor for their work and organization. Let us work likewise, and we shall enhance the greatness and the honor of our nation.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanavicia</p>
   <p>President of the Zinycia.</p>
