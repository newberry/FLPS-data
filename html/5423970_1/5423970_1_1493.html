   <p>The Lithuanian colony farm committee was in Wisconsin to investigate the land. The committee reports that the land there is very poor, white sand and stumps, no timber, but brush. All good land is sold. The committee says, "No wonder the company gives free railroad tickets, because nobody wants to go there." Those companies which have good land do not give free tickets, because they know that they can sell their land without any inducement.</p>
   <p>We advise to Lithuanians to look for land in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and the eastern part of Nebraska and Kansas. Even there is very hard or impossible to get a tract of land in one place for thirty or more Lithuanian families, because the good land there is bought already.</p>
   <p>Two members of the committee, J. Jauksztas and K. Kuncia, got free tickets to Arkansas, and J. Butkus will go on his own expenses. When they come back they will report about the land in Arkansas. We know there is some good land in Arkansas, but the climate there is too hot, and such a climate is not suitable for Lithuanians. It is very hard to find a suitable place for the Lithuanian colony. It requires lots of money for traveling expenses, and while the committee consists of poor workingmen, they cannot spend their own money for the sake of thirty or more Lithuanian families who are seeking farm land.</p>
   <p>There is also a danger; the companies can bribe the committee. But then every family cannot go to look and investigate the land. It is a hard problem to solve.</p>
