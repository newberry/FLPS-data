   <p>Last Sunday, the Chicago Lithuanian Republicans held their mass meeting at Pulaski Hall. The members of the Lithuanian Republican Club held their preliminary meeting at 22d and Wood streets, and from there with a band marched to the Pulaski Hall. But, unfortunately, the marching Lithuanians were attacked by the Poles.</p>
   <p>Two Lithuanians, Jaksztas and Kunoa, were severely lacerated. It was necessary to take them to a nearby doctor to bandage their wounds.</p>
   <p>When the attackers were repulsed the Lithuanians marched forward to the Pulaski Hall, where the mass meeting was held.</p>
   <p>The meeting elected W. Zaoharewiozius, president, and J. Zaoharewiozius, secretary. The first speakers were the city statistician Mr. Eugene Seigers, Mr. Sonenfield, and attorney Max Kasmar. The Lithuanian speakers were Masionis, Polionis and Jonaitis.</p>
   
   <p>At this mass meeting the Lithuanians decided that in the coming presidential election for president of the United States, they would vote for Governor McKinley, of Ohio.</p>
