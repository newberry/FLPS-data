   <p>Many were talking and writing about the progress of Lithuanians in Chicago. I did not believe what was said, I decided to investigate for myself. So the last few evenings I visited a few rooming houses.</p>
   <p>If I would tell all that I saw and heard, many of them would get mad at me.</p>
   <p>In one rooming house there were twelve men. All of them were playing cards, the tables were cracking, money spread all over the table, the house was full of smoke, the beds were wet from beer, all were drunk. This was Sunday. They had not been in church at high mass, because they had been playing cards all night. The cards are all damp and dirty, the players eyes and noses were red.</p>
   <p>Some of the drunkards were lying in the corners and sleeping, others were walking and stumbling in the house, swearing and denouncing everybody. I visited many such houses, and found the same thing. Then I began to think what progress they had made. They made no progress, but they went down into the depths of darkness.</p>
