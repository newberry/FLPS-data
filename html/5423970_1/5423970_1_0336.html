   <p>Kazimieras Lazinskas, the first victim of brutality in the garment workers' strike in Chicago, was buried Monday, December 5. Mourning strikers began to congregate early in the morning, about 9 o'clock, before the Lithuanian St. George Church in 33rd Street, in which the body was laid. More than 10,000 strikers and their sympathizers congregated by the church. The unionists wore their emblems. Most prominent were the emblems of the Italian section of the union, which were draped with mourning crape. You see, K. Lazinskas was killed by an Italian traitor who had sold himself to the Royal Tailors Company and, therefore, the Italians wished to express their protest against the cowardly deed of their fellow-national. The strikers of the Royal Tailors Company carried their flag, thus showing that the workers at Royal Tailors are also on strike and that only traitors are working there. The strikers from Hart, Schaffner and Marx, to which group <span class="page-break">2</span>K. Lazinskas belonged, also carried a flag. The biggest flag was that of all the unions, on which was written in black:</p>
   <p>"We mourn the death of our worker friend, Kazimieras Lazinskas, who fell as a victim of brutality and the greed of the capitalists of the Garment Makers Association."</p>
   <p>There were very many floral wreaths from various branches of the union with statements: "To the eternal memory of K. Lazinskas, a victim of capitalism."</p>
   <p>While the orchestra played a mournful funeral march, all those assembled removed their hats as one. A Mass was held in the St. George Church and the requiem was sung. The Reverend Kriauciunas gave a short sermon.</p>

   <p>All those assembled could not get into the church, therefore there was a large throng of mourner outside. The church ceremonies ended after 11 o'clock. The strikers carried the coffin outside, put it in the hearse, and the mournful procession started its journey to the cemetery.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva's special photographer took a few pictures while the coffin was being put in the hearse and during the procession. Let this be to the memory of a youthful Lithuanian worker, K. Lazinszas, who fell as a victim in the big battle against exploitation and injustice.</p>
