   <p>To strike is to struggle for a better life. But are such strikes as are conducted by the American Federation of Labor beneficial to the working people? Let us take, for example, the strike of the cattle slaughterers in the stock yards. As soon as the white slaves went out on strike through one door, a carload of black slaves was transported into the stock yards through another door. The engineer of that train knows very well what he is doing; he knows that he is transporting black slaves into the stock yards to take the places of the white slaves who are out on strike, and that he is transporting strike-breakers. Why is he doing this so knowingly? Because the American Federation of Labor leaders have divided the workers into various independent classes. A strike that is conducted in such a manner can never produce any desirable results; workers will be able to get results only when they become as strongly organized as are the capitalists.</p>

   <p>However, even such an organization is not sufficient to completely overthrow capitalism. If the workers desire to attain their purpose, to get rid of the bosses, then they must also organize politically. But that means Socialism. Do you want that? Regardless of who is for or against Socialism, a wage earner must supprt Socialism for his own good. Workers, let us organize and work in unity. In that way we will win our rights and on the ruins of the capitalistic order we will establish a co-operative industrial republic.
