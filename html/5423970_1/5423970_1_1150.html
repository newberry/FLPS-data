   <p>The following resolution was sent to Washington by the Lithuanian Roman Catholic societies of Chicago and vicinity on February 26, 1918:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Lithuanians bear equal burdens with the other citizens of the United States in this critical moment, supporting the Government in raising funds for military purposes, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Lithuanians are sending the flower of their youth to the front to defend the flag of the United States in its struggle for the principles expressed by President Woodrow Wilson, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Lithuanians have supported and have shown their loyalty to the Government of the United States, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Russian Bolshevik Government failed to defend Lithuania in the face <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of German aggression, and finally ceded Lithuania to Germany in their ignoble peace terms; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we Lithuanians put ourselves under the protection of the United States, imploring and demanding the same rights and the same aid extended by the United States to Rumania, Armenia, Poland, Finland, et al.; and</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we protest against the annexation of Lithuania by Germany, to be made part and parcel of the German Empire, or to be placed under the protectorate of Germany, and we demand complete independence for Lithuania with a republican form of government, similar to that of the United States.</p>
   <p>"We heartily express our loyalty to and support of the United States Government and will do everything in our power to make this war our common cause resulting in victory for the United States and Lithuania.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"We pray that his Excellency, President Woodrow Wilson, intercede in behalf of Lithuania at the future peace congress and grant Lithuanians representation in the said peace congress.</p>
