   <p>On June 24th the Lovers of Fatherland Society, branch 75, had a meeting with a lecture and a dance. The speaker was J. Jancauskas. He spoke about our fatherland, Lithuania, and the labor movement. He delivered a very good lecture. Not many people came to the lecture but there were many at the dance. The people do not go to lectures because the priest threatens them with excommunication, etc. Yet, the priest asks the people to come to his dances to spend money on drinks, so that he can reap the profits. To encourage drunkenness is not against God's wishes, but to educate the people, to urge them to read educational literature instead of spending money on drinks is wrong.</p>
   <p>After the lecture a collection was made. There was collected $4.23. $2.25 was paid for the hall, and the balance was sent to the Lithuanian Socialist Labor party newspaper Kova (The Struggle) in Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
