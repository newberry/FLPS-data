   <p>Editorial' p.2....We made several comments in the "Naujienos" on a recent editorial in the "Draugas" (Lithuanian Catholic Daily) directed against the evil of saloons. We expressed the opinion in our comments that the "Draugas" will have a hard time combating that evil because according to its own admission, saloons are strongly intrenched in the lives of the Lithuanian Catholic masses. It was not long before our opinion became confirmed by facts. Seven Lithuanian Catholic organizations wrote a sharp protect against the "Draugas" editorial. We will not repeat here all the words of that protest, because it is very long; but our readers can get a good idea of its tone and spirit from the following extract: "Furthermore, we advise the editor of the "Draugas" not to publish any more false and insulting articles; do not try to control something about which you have very little understanding. Write and publish only those articles that will bring benefit to the readers, not indignation and heartaches."</p>
   <p>The poor "Draugas", after tasting that bitter pepper, wrote the following <span class="page-break">2</span>with a discouraged heart:</p>
   <p>"Regardless of how we may view the matter, we have before our eyes a very sad situation: Seven Lithuanian Catholic organizations came forward publicly to defend the saloon and all its effects upon the lives of our parishioners."</p>
   <p>In spite of such facts the "Draugas" dares to claim constantly that Catholic societies constitute a real fortress of morality.</p>
