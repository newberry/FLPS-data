   <p>President Theodore Roosevelt is promising the Philippine people their own parliament. When the Philippine constitution will be made by the American Senate and Congress, it will bring nothing good to the Philippine people. It will be like the Russian Duma. According to the project only those Filipinos can vote who are 23 years of age and who can write in the Spanish and English languages. What about those Philippine people who cannot speak Spanish nor English? They are speaking an entirely different language. The Spanish and the English language is not the Philippine language.</p>
