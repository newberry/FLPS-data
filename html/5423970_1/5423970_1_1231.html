   <p>President Wilson called both houses of Congress together yesterday and delivered a speech. He reported that he had sent the last note to Germany in regard to the submarine question, and that now it depends upon Germany whether or not friendly relations can be continued between these two countries. If the German Government will not immediately promise to make a radical change in her policy toward merchant and passenger ships on the high seas, then the Washington administration will have no alternative but to sever diplomatic relations with Berlin.</p>
   <p>This means that the great critical hour has arrived. Tomorrow or the next day should make clear the sort of relations which will henceforth exist between these two great nations. Relations will probably remain peaceful, but it is possible that in a day or two the situation may take a turn for <span class="page-break">\2</span>the worse. If the United States severs diplomatic relations with Germany, there can be little doubt that in a short time afterwards these two countries will become involved in a war. Therefore, the question of peace or war is now being considered.</p>
   <p>But how is that question being solved? Who has a voice in its solution? Only the governments of the two countries! The United States Government has made its demand and has formulated it in such a manner that it can be answered only by a "yes" or "no". The German Government has the choice of selecting one of these two answers; the question of peace or war depends upon which answer she selects. The people have no voice whatever in this matter--neither the ordinary citizens nor their representatives.</p>
   <p>When President Wilson wrote his note to the Kaiser's diplomats, he did not consult Congress; he merely informed Congress later of what he had already done. The Government of Germany will also act in exactly the same manner; neither the people nor their representatives will be consulted when a reply <span class="page-break">\3</span>is drafted to Wilson's note. The Government will sign whatever it desires and that will be final.</p>
   <p>The governments of today decide the question of peace or war, and the people pay for their decision with their blood and wealth. This was the way the present slaughter in Europe started; all other wars have been started in the very same way; and this is the way hostilities may begin between the United States and Germany. According to the Constitution of the United States, Wilson has no right to declare war; that right belongs to Congress. Nevertheless, Wilson can prepare all the steps that inevitably lead to war, and he has already prepared nearly all of them. His last step practically placed this country on the brink of a bloody abyss, and now only one careless and undeliberated move is necessary to push this country into that abyss. And when this country is actually falling into the abyss, the President will again come before Congress and ask that body to proclaim that "we are at war with Germany". Will that proclamation mean anything other than the confirmation of an existing fact?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In spite of all the democracy in America, the people of this country are just as powerless to act on the most important public questions as the people of Prussia, Russia, or any other despotic country. When will the people wake up and wrest from the hands of their rulers the right to decide the fate of the masses?</p>
