   <p>The United States has formally entered into a war with Germany. Such a move on the part of the United States Government has been expected. America had no alternative. She either had to sit back and fold her arms, and watch the Germans, oblivious to all humanitarian laws and principles, drown innocent American citizens--men, women, and children--or she had to adopt measures of some sort to defend her rights and the lives of United States citizens.</p>
   <p>During the past two and one-half years America has been trying to find peaceful means of defending the lives of her citizens, her rights, and her honor. She negotiated, pleaded, prayed, and even threatened Germany in an effort to avoid war. But that which usually happens in such situations has happened: The more you plead, the more you relinquish, the more fear you show, the more brazenly your enemy, encouraged by your policy of appeasement, will ignore your rights, and the more aggressive he will become. The more notes America sent to Germany, the more agressive toward America Germany became.</p>

   <p>Germany was not satisfied with sinking American ships and destroying the lives of United States citizens, but on top of that she threatened the peace and security of the United States. Germany filled America with spies who arranged the dynamiting of bridges and factories; she tried to foment strikes through her agents; she spent much money in this country to organize and maintain various so-called "peace" propaganda groups in order to divide the people and create disorder. The Germans were not satisfied with these activities alone. They even started plotting to deprive the United States of a number of her states, and they also attempted to involve the United States in a war with Mexico and Japan. That was entirely too much. No country can stand for such abuses. Any country that would permit another country to heap such abuses upon her would soon lose her independence.</p>
   <p>In spite of these abuses, America suffered patiently, and made every effort to avoid war, which everybody abhors. The United States made repeated requests of Germany. She pleaded with Germany to cease using her submarines to slay <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>peaceful American citizens who, according to all recognized laws of the world, have a right to travel on the seas wherever they wish.</p>
   <p>No one will dare to say that America had no right to demand that her citizens not be killed like rats. Germany could have avoided war with the United States a week before the war started. Germany did not have to push the United States into war. All that Germany had to do was to assure America that German submarines would not sink any more American ships, and would not kill any more American citizens.</p>
   <p>However, the German Government refused to heed the pleas of the United States. Instead, Germany reaffirmed her policy that, regardless of consequences, she would not restrict her submarines, and would continue to sink ships without consideration. That forced the United States to choose the only alternative to defend her rights. And the only alternative was war.</p>
   <p>We repeat that America did not desire or seek war, that she became involved in it through no fault of her own; Germany trampled on America's rights and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>refused to stop.</p>
   <p>This incident shows that it is not always possible to avoid war. No matter how strongly one side desires to avoid war, it can never be avoided if the other side desires it.</p>
   <p>The big European war has already produced a few good results. One of these is the overthrow of monarchism in Russia. Two more monarchistic nests still remain in Europe--Germany and Austria. America interceded on the side of the democratic countries; this action will undoubtedly help to speed the destruction of those two remaining monarchistic nests which for many years have been breeding despotism, oppression of the people, and the seeds of bloody wars. America has fought more than once for lofty humanitarian principles, for the liberty of the people, and for the liberty of nations. Today America enters her greatest battle: She fights for the freedom of the entire world, to destroy the last remains of autocracy.</p>
   <p>The price of war is very dear and the sacrifice is horrible. However, the</p>
