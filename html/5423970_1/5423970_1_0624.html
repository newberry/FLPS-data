   <p>In last Sunday's issue of the Chicago newspaper, The Record, there was published an article about the immigrants from. Russia that are living in Chicago. About the Lithuanians it states that one part of the Lithuanians are Christians, while the other part are still worshiping the holy oaks. That shows that the writer of that article has not the least conception about Lithuanians, and yet he writes about these people. In Europe not only the co-workers of the newspapers, but even the primary school pupils, would not write or tell such an absurdity about America, nor what the ignorant writers of America are writing about the European nations.</p>
   <p>It seems that the writer of that article obtained the information from the Russian Jews, who for a joke told this so-called American writer about the Lithuanians, and the ignorant American newspaperman took it for a reality. Against such foolish writings it is not worth even to write a protest.</p>
