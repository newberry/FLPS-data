   <p>p. 3.... One of the first moves of the newly organized Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce in Kensignton, Ill., was to investigate the bad practice of some local companies engaged in ice-cutting operations during the winter months. The companies were discriminating as far as the community residents were concerned, inasmuch as they refused to employ local help. All employees were hired through a loop employment agency at a fee. The Lithuanian Chamber of Commerce sent a delegation to confer with the executives of the companies and succeeded in persuading them to abandon their old policy of discrimination. The company agreed to hire local residents if they applied with reference letters from local business men.</p>
   <p>Although not all Lithuanians who applied were hired, because the supply here is greater than the demand, nevertheless, a large number were employed. They are, therefore, very thankful to the organization.</p>
