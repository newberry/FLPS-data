   <p>Leland Olds, famous economist, made the following statement recently about "prosperity" in the United States:</p>
   <p>"While record breaking corporation profits have increased the fortunes of industrial capitalists to hitherto unheard of levels and the trusts of multi-millionaires have reached new fabulous heights, the capital of American farmers has fallen as much as 30% - even below pre-War values".</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The above statistics have been taken from figures supplied by the United States Department of Agriculture. They show that the small-scale farmers are facing bankruptcy. Many of them are losing their farms entirely and are increasing the ranks of the proletariat. During the past year alone, statistics show, over 103,000 small-scale farmers, were unable to meet expenses and have lost their farms. About 3<span class="gap">[gap]</span>,000 other farmers were forced to sell their farms in order to pay back taxes.</p>
   <p>And that is what "good times" mean to small-scale farmers. These so-called "good times", affect the small business man <span class="page-break">\3</span>and the workers of America in the very same way as they affect the small-scale farmers - real prosperity for a privileged few, misery for the greater majority.</p>
