   <p>The families of the workers are now bidding good-bye to the old year of 1925 and greeting the new year of 1926. However, no matter how often nor how heartily they wish happiness and prosperity to each other, only one change will take place in their lives. That one change will be in the form of a higher cost of living. According to reports of the Department of Agriculture and the various stock yards of the country, the prices of twelve out of twenty-three most widely used food products have been raised considerably; while the prices of three of these products have remained the same, and nine have been slightly reduced.</p>
   <p>The cost of living is being steadily increased, while wages are being lowered, and working conditions are becoming worse. Furthermore, unemployment is also increasing. When a worker loses a job he experiences great difficulty in finding another. Those workers who are still employed, do not dare utter a single word of protest against low wages and poor working conditions for fear of losing their jobs.</p>

   <p>Regardless of whether the year is new or old, the workers continue to live under unbearable living conditions, and the same old misery remains with them. However, the method through which these miserable conditions can be eradicated or at least lessened is still the same--the road of struggle. In order to carry on a successful struggle we must be organized. There fore, our New Year's greetings are: Let us become more strongly organized, and become more active!</p>
