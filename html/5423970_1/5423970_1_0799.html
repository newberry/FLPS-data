   <p>Branch No. 1, of the Lithuanian Socialist Youth League, helf an important meeting on Sunday, April 16. Among other things, the following interesting question was raised and discussed: Would it not be a good thing to call a conference of the Lithuanian Socialist youth of all organizations, clubs, societies, and branches located in Chicago and the surrounding territory? After careful and long discussion on the above question, it was decided that such a conference of the Lithuanian Socialist youth would be very beneficial and highly desirable. Such a conference is especially desirable because our Socialist youth, regardless of where they live or to what organizations they belong, have either the same or very kindred aims and interests. Such a conference would give them an opportunity to become acquainted with each other and to establish relations between the various separated groups. This, in turn, would give them greater energy and enthusiasm to carry on their activities.
