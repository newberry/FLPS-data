   <p>We have urged our brother Lithuanians many times to learn to read and write, but unfortunately such an appeal was without success.</p>
   <p>Without knowing how to read and write you cannot get a better job. You have the hardest jobs with a smallest pay. Without education you cannot get a good, easy job, nor can you get an office job.</p>
   <p>Many of our Lithuanians cannot even write a letter to their parents or relatives in the old country.</p>
   <p>Americans regard such people as wild. Americans cannot imagine how a man can live without knowing how to read and write.</p>
   
   <p>If you want to elevate yourself, to improve your condition, you must learn to write, then everybody will respect you.</p>
   <p>To learn to read and write is very easy. Come to me, I will show you how easy it is to learn.</p>
