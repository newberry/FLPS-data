   <p>Newspapers report that in the recent war registration not even one Pole claimed any kind of exemption from army service. "Not one Pole claimed an exemption," the English-language press reports. It is said that the Poles received a word of thanks from Washington, D. C. for such loyalty to this country. They are determined to fight for the liberty of this country and their fatherland.</p>
   <p>Among Lithuanian-Americans there are some, though not many, "slackers"; not all Lithuanian-Americans view the war with the same degree of enthusiasm. It is interesting to know the reasons for this Lithuanian-American attitude. There are several. The Poles are more warlike and temperamental than Lithuanians who are more calm and less temperamental; however, once they decide to do something they are more stubborn and have much more endurance than the Poles.</p>
   <p>The memory of historical traditions, independence, the army, the flag, national <span class="page-break">2</span>liberty, and the kings of Poland are still fresh in the minds of the Poles, but among the Lithuanians the memory of the glorious historical traditions of Lithuania is five hundred years away. The Lithuanians, generally speaking, are still either feudal slaves or members of the first generation of feudal slaves. As a result, this new generation knows little of the national liberty of historical Lithuania and has not yet fully tasted new liberty. During the past five hundred years the Lithuanian has fought and shed his blood not only for his own but also for foreign interests: Polish, Russian, and German. For that reason a feeling has been inculcated in the Lithuanian, generation after generation, that he can fight only when forced to do so by foreigners and not through his own free will. Such slogans, "He who does not know how to defend liberty loses it" or "He who does not want to fight for liberty does not deserve liberty," are foreign and unfamiliar to most Lithuanians. That is not at all surprising!</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians did not know or taste liberty for centuries, and that had to leave some mark upon the soul and character of the entire nation. To most <span class="page-break">3</span>Lithuanian-Americans the army, army service, and the war appear to be the same as the army and wars of old Russia. In new Russia, where monarchism has recently been overthrown, a new ray of hope for the freedom of Lithuania has begun to radiate; as a result, the Lithuanian people have assumed a new and an entirely different attitude. A strong voice has been raised by Lithuanian war refugees in all corners of Russia, calling for the formation of Lithuanian legions, which would later become the nucleus of a Lithuanian army when Lithuania regains her freedom.</p>
   <p>The second cause which has bred a certain number of "slackers" among Lithuanians is the half-open agitation that was waged by orators and certain newspapers. In a cultured country any person can criticize and oppose a proposed law until it is definitely adopted or rejected by the government. However, when the becomes becomes a law then it must be obeyed without opposition. Some of our people, who do not understand a highly developed democracy, even attempt to oppose a definitely enacted law. Those who do that, and those who urge others to do so, are not friends but are the enemies of progress and order, because <span class="page-break">4</span>they are planting the seed of anarchy among the people. We must beware of such people and fight against them, because they are promoting disorder among the masses. Not all of the people can be masters at one time; we must abide by the decisions of the majority.</p>
   <p>Finally, there is another cause deserving attention, which has bred more than one "slacker" among Lithuanian-Americans. We recently came across the following statement in one of our Lithuanian-American newspapers: "It is a good thing for Poles to join the American army and fight. The Washington Government has recognized and announced more than once that America is waging war for its own and for Poland's liberty. But, did the Washington Government ever clearly state that Lithuania, also, must be freed after the war? It is true that the Government did state that it is fighting for the freedom of all oppressed nations, but so far Lithuania has not been mentioned specifically. Therefore, are we Lithuanians going to fight again in order that Lithuania shall be placed under the domination of Poland?" These words are very significant and deserve our attention. It is the duty of our leaders to bring this matter to the <span class="page-break">5</span>attention of the Washington Government, for this fact is cooling off the enthusiasm of a certain number of Lithuanian-Americans for the participation in war service and the purchasing of Liberty bonds.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, Lithuanian-Americans are fulfilling their duties and obligations toward this country as much as the immigrants of any of the other nationalities. A Lithuanian does not brag or advertise as much as a Pole, but rather fulfills his duty quietly, feeling that it is not proper to brag about such matters.</p>
