   <p>The number of farmers increased in Arkansas, but the Lithuanian farmers are fast running away from here. Their farms are bought by strangers. Many Lithuanians sold their farms to the people of other nationalities. The majority of our Lithuanians who started here to farm were not farmers, they did not know how to farm, the task was too hard for them. Only a few Lithuanians are staying here on their farms, because they know how to work them.</p>
   <p>Those Lithuanians who had been farmers in Lithuania succeeded as farmers here. The Lithuanian farm colony was ruined here by tailors who had never been farmers before, and they did not know how to work the farm land.</p>
