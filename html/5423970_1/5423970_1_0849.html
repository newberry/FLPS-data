   <p>The 81st Chapter of the Lithuanian Socialist League presented "Bomba" (The Bomb), a two-act comedy-drama written by Antanovas (pen name of Dr. A. Montvidas), on March 28, at the University Settlement Hall, which is located in the Town of Lake colony. The play is well written, interesting, and highly entertaining.</p>
   <p>The leading roles were played by the following: The old woman, by Mrs. M. Dundulis; the spy, by K. Pocius; the country boy, by K. Karakis; the village guard, by P. Rameika; the Jew, by D. Dragas; the soldier, by J. Mickus.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, the performance was satisfactory. However, a number <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of faults and much room for improvement were noticeable. The spy behaved like a lunatic; the Russian police, who acted like statues, had their backs turned to the audience most of the time; the chemist, who performed an operation on the bomb, did not act with the required caution. The performances of Mrs.H. Dundulis, J. Mickus, and D. Dragas were very good. G. Karakas and P. Rameika also displayed some talent.</p>
   <p>During the intermission period the audience was entertained with piano music, songs, a recitation by C. Matulis, and a monologue entitled "The Landowners' Revolution in Lithuania." The men's chorus sang a working class song " Let Us Fight."</p>
