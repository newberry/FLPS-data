   <p>In practice, all people, regardless of their political or religious convictions, now recognize internationalism. It is recognized by our Clericalists [Catholics]when they strive to maintain relations with Clericalists of other nationalities. Do Lithuanian priests in Chicago, for example, order their parishioners to disobey Archbishop Mundelein because he is not a Lithuanian? Not at all! They order their parishioners to honor and respect him as their spiritual leader, regardless of his nationality.</p>
   <p>Internationalism is also recognized by the Nationalists when, through the diplomats of other nationalities, they strive to promote the interests of Lithuania. They appeal to Russian, French, German, American, and Dutch diplomats, not forgetting that the latter are non-Lithuanians. Certainly, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the attempt to establish relations with people of other nationalities is internationalism.</p>
   <p>The only difference between the internationalism of the Socialists and the internationalism of other parties is that the Socialists are striving to establish relations with one class of people of other nationalities, while the Nationalists or Clericalists, for example, are seeking to establish relations with another class of people of other nationalities. The Nationalists and Clericalists attempt to establish relations with influential bishops, government officials, capitalists, ambassadors, etc. of other nations, while the Socialists advocate the unity of the workers of all nations. The slogan of the Socialists is: "Workers of the world, unite!"</p>
   <p>Therefore, enemies of the Socialists have no grounds for denouncing the internationalism of the Socialists. Certainly, the unity of the workers is of no less importance than the unity of the members of the upper class.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>It seems to us that the unity of the workers is a more lofty and important ideal, because the aim of this unity is to free the poor masses from misery and slavery, whereas the unity of the upper classes leads only toward still greater slavery for the masses.</p>
