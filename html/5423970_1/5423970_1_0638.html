   <p>The lack of unity, harmony and solidarity is one of the saddest manifestations among the Lithuanian American intelligentsia of the present time. Regardless of their political differences, national aim and religious belief, the people of the very same opinion are accusing one another, because one individual wants to become a leader and the other and both causing disharmony among the members of the organization. Some of the members who have a strong desire of becoming leaders are not willing to recognize other members of the organization who worked just as hard as any other member. Under such circumstances we cannot have a national unity, and we cannot accomplish much of anything by fighting one another. We have to come to some kind of agreement or else our organization, which took us years to build, will break up. If our organization breaks up our hard work will be in vain. We don't want to see our organization go to pieces; we must put all our efforts to save it from breaking up. First of all, we must create harmony among our members; then we will be able to save our organization.</p>
   
   <p>We have to blame our newspapers for creating disharmony among our members. We cannot expect much from our members if our newspapers disagree among themselves. For example, our two newspapers, Garas and Tievyne, both are of the same opinion; yet they disagree on certain points and those points are so trivial that they hardly mean anything. One paper wants to take a leading part in the community and the other paper has similar desires. These two papers create disagreement among our members in the organization. This situation is deplorable from a national standpoint. Instead of trying to create and maintain our strong national unity, they create disharmony among our brothers. Our papers have failed completely to perform their civic and national duties, especially in maintaining our national unity. We have very good examples of our two newspapers, Garas accusing Tievyne for taking the leading part in raising funds for the erection of the monument in honor of Rev. A. Burbos. The newspaper Garas accuses Tievyne for employing dictatorial power and claiming to have originated the idea for raising funds for the erection of a monument in honor of Rev. A. Burbos. If Rev. A. Burbos were alive, he would not allow such an argument among our members and newspapers. We hope this controversy about Rev. A. Burbos will end soon and leave his soul to rest in peace. If he has earned anything in his life, he will be well rewarded by God and the nation. We will pray for his soul and good deeds, which he performed for the honor of our Supreme Being.</p>
   <p>Rev. A. Burbos had no desire for empty honors; his desire was to serve his people in the name of God. He performed his civic and religious duties as a good Catholic and his work will not be in vain.</p>
   <p>Hereafter we hope that peace will reign and all controversies will end forever among our Lithuanian brothers.</p>
