   <p>In yesterday's issue of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> (News) we wrote of how the capitalists became seriously <span class="gap">[gap]</span>; we pointed out out that they bee me so concerned that, in order to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> influence of <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Rockefeller proposed at the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> convention of the Young Men's Christian Association the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of a <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. It is a known fact that these <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are not concerned with Christian ideals, and they are not interested in <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, but they seek to reform that element which say it represents Christianity--<span class="gap">[gap]</span> accurately, the Christian church--or the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> have become <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. They have not been <span class="gap">[gap]</span> with sufficient energy their duty to instill the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> with the spirit <span class="page-break">\2</span><span class="gap">[gap]</span> <span class="page-break">\3</span>particularly in the state of Colorado. That is also the reason why the capitalists are so <span class="gap">[gap]</span> supporting the Young Men's Christian Association. Thus very extensive and highly developed organization is fully, with soul and body, in the service of the capitalists (Mr. Rockfeller himself is one of its most active members).</p>
   <p>Many people, especially working people, who are not closely acquainted with the Young Men's Christian Association believe that it is an innocent young peoples' cultural institution. But that is a gross error. The Association is carrying on the same kind of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> work for the benefit of the capitalists as do all priests and ministers. The active clergymen of that organization go into factories and during the noon hour they conduct services, read passages from the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, sing holy hymns, and employ other tricks to cloud the minds of the workers. During the past year alone (1915) the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the Young Men's Christian Association conducted services in factories <span class="page-break">\4</span>in various towns and cities in which nearly two million workers participated.</p>
   <p>Today in America there is a widely known revivalist of Christianity, known as Billy Sunday, a former athlete. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> has a very good throat and has become famous for his efforts to bring back into the Christian fold those who have gone astray. Tens of thousands of people assemble to hear him talk, mostly poor people. And Billy Sunday does not hesitate to threaten those people with devils, flames of hell, and boiling tar. Incessantly he hammers into their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and pray, work and pray! <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Sunday religious revival meetings are arranged for him by capitalists in various towns and cities and they pay him hundreds of thousands of dollars for his services.</p>
   <p>That, then, is the kind of Christianity that is desired by the capitalists: Christianity that will fool the workers. That is the kind of Christianity that is being advocated by our own Lithuanian priests. They not only advocate <span class="page-break">\5</span>it, but are busily engaged in organizing unsuspecting and ignorant people so that they will sacrifice their bodies and souls upon the altar of the capitalists. They have established and control the St. Joseph's Workers Association, the slogan of which is: "Workers of all lands unite for one purpose! And that purpose is very great: Pray and work, pray and work!" The only trouble is that not many people want to pray and work.</p>
