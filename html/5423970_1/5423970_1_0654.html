   <p>Up to the present time twenty-four Lithuanian families bought farms; ten Lithuanian families are living there already. The priest J. Baloewiczius started to build the church on his own farm. We are helping with our labor to build the church. The church is not far from Hazen, Ark.</p>
   <p>The land there is fruitful, can raise all crops abundantly.</p>
   <p>Translator's note: - This Lithuanian colony was organized by A. Olszewski, editor and publisher of Lietuva.</p>
