   <p>Since last Monday, Nov. 12, the Chicago evening schools have been open. If the Lithuanians would take as much interest in schools as they do in saloons, they could get three Lithuanian evening classes: one at Wells School, Ashland Avenue and Cornelia Street, for Northsiders; another at Bowen School in South Chicago, Houston Avenue and 93rd Street; and the third at the Garfield School, the Canal District at 14th and Johnson Streets.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians, do not forget that by education we will uplift ourselves among the Americans by attending the schools instead of saloons. This coming Monday, Nov. 19, go to the above mentioned schools and demand Lithuanian teachers. It would be a disgrace to the Northsiders not to have a Lithuanian school because they had one before. We are urging the girls to attend the evening schools, because reading and writing are the most essential things in life.</p>
