   <p>A gigantic Fourth Liberty Loan parade, in which Lithuanians participated, was held in the downtown district last Saturday.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians had their own float, which had been beautifully decorated under the supervision of the artist, J. Sileika.</p>
   <p>The float pictured a war-torn home, with a mother and her little children calling for help to withhold the threatened stroke of the Kaiser's sword. Uncle Sam, as the protector of the oppressed, restrains the Kaiser.</p>
   <p>The float made a great impression on the public.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians had two good bands in the parade.</p>
