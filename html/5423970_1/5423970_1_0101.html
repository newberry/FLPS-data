   <p>The newspaper Tevyne in its review raised the question about the Lithuanian schools. Tevyne remarks that we have several societies to help the poor students, but we have no society to take care of the teachers.</p>
   <p>It says that our schools in American are limping for lack of good teachers. In America, to get a good teacher is very difficult, but when you do get one, you must pay him good salary.</p>
   <p>The Tevyne's reviewer further states that he has a practical way to solve the problem of the teachers. It says that the nuns are the cheapest teachers. That in many of the church schools the standard of education stands on an equal basis with the public schools. That the nuns are teaching cheaply because they have devoted themselves to that cause.</p>
   <p>Very well then, we have no educated Lithuanian nuns. We have in Chicago, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the Lithuanian parish, a Lithuanian school where the Polish nuns are teaching the Lithuanian pupils. In order to have Lithuanian nuns we must have a school for them, to make them fit teachers.</p>
   <p>Now then, who will uphold and support the convent for the nuns? This would be a very expensive proposition. The nuns cannot be reliable teachers because they are trained to be supporters of fanaticism. The churches are built by the people, but the people have no rights nor voice to control them. It will be the same thing with convents. The people will build them, support them, but the convents will be under the despotic rule of the clergy. The nuns only will be beneficial to the priests, but not to the Lithuanian public in general.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the people have had enough of the clergy's despotism; the people do not need another despotism under a different name.</p>
