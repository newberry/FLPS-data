   <p>The Lithuanians of Chicago distinguished themselves in the sale of War Savings Stamps. A goal of twenty-five million dollars has been set, and it is hoped that this will be reached in one week. Despite the bad weather, about a half-million dollars was collected the day before yesterday.</p>
   <p>The foreign division, which includes the Lithuanians, made the best showing. The Lithuanians sold twenty-three thousand dollars' worth of stamps. The Germans sold the most--forty thousand dollars' worth.</p>
