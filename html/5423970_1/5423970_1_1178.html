   <p>The newspaper Naujienos (News) reports that the American Workers Council, recently organized in Chicago, has established a bureau to assist those men who desire to be and can be exempted from military service. The Naujienos suggests that a similar bureau be established among Lithuanians. Such a bureau would be alright and of service to the people if properly conducted. However, we fear that it would be conducted the same way as the various local"advisory" groups, in connection with the recent war registration. Because of some of this advice many men (who were ignorant enough to accept it) are now wailing in jails. In most cases that advice was given by agitators to promote the selfish interests of their political parties. Some of our radical newspapers even openly advised men to register as socialists, and falsely stated that this would exempt them <span class="page-break">\2</span>from military service.</p>
   <p>We fear that the bureau which Naujienos proposes would produce the same results as the "advisory" groups, because in the same issue Naujienos, in connection with the proposal, makes an attempt to agitate for the recently organized Lithuanian-American Workers Council which, even according to the newspaper Kova (The Struggle), organ of Lithuanian-American Socialists, is neither this nor that. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Naujienos urges that branches of the Council be established everywhere.</p>
   <p>It appears that the bureau which is proposed by Naujienos would be an imitation of an organization known as the Liberty Defense League. This organization, despite its high sounding name, has been organized for the purpose of obstructing the government, so it would be unable to make proper preparations for war. That is the purpose of that organization. We are afraid that the proposed bureau of Naujienos would become a "branch" of that organization.</p>

   <p>The members of the Naujienos staff may of course, do as they please, because they will answer for their own deeds. However, we are concerned about the thousands of Lithuanians who will probably get into trouble, but for whom the Naujienos staff will not answer. Therefore, our advice to Lithuanian-Americans is as follows: Let every Lithuanian act according to his own best judgement, and let everyone beware of those whom he suspects of attempting to take advantage of the present war situation to promote the selfish interests of their partisan groups.</p>
