   <p>p. 4. "Wanted: One million dollars. Apply to Ella Flagg Young, Superintendent of Schools." Such an advertisement might be published since the public schools of Chicago are short one million dollars.</p>
   <p>The finance committee has been working on the budget for a long time, but has been unable to figure out how to stretch an income of twelve million dollars so as to cover an expense account of thirteen million dollars. Arithmetic, algebra, and all other forms of mathematics were employed, but without success. The matter was finally placed into the hands of Ella Flagg Young for solution.</p>
   <p>Ella Flagg Young also is unable to solve that puzzle. At first she decided to ask each school teacher to donate two weeks salary, but even that is not enough to cover the deficit. She then threw up her hands and said: "I will go home and pray to God, and ask Him to send some money."</p>

   <p>There would be no money shortage if all unnecessary school officials were removed from the pay roll, and if the school department were free from interference by politicians with "great" brains. The politicians have woven the school department into their net of corruption and are exploiting it for their own selfish ends.</p>
   <p>Without the interference of politicians there would be no budget problems, no worries about covering deficits, and our schools would be free and on a higher level.</p>
   <p>Or elso, let us take the money that is now used for paying the police, who are engaged only in splitting the heads of unemployed workers, and turn it over to the school department. Then our schools will be well taken care of and there will be no deficit.</p>
