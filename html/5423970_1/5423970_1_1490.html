   <p>We, the committee, are recommending to establish a Lithuanian farm colony in the State of Arkansas, Prairie County.</p>
   <p>We have been in Wisconsin to investigate the land and in Wisconsin we found the land to be very poor.</p>
   <p>We went through Illinois and Missouri states, everywhere we saw the farmers were poor, their buildings were shabby, the live stock miserable. But when we came to the State of Arkansas, in Prairie County, we found there farmers prosperous and happy; the farm buildings in good condition, the live stock fat.</p>
   <p>The farmers have good clothes, good farm implements, they eat good food and plenty of it, have money, in other words, the farmers there have <span class="page-break">2</span>everything they need.</p>
