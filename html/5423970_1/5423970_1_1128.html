   <p>Almost two weeks have gone by since the United States' Third Liberty Loan bonds were put up for sale. During this period the Lithuanian Branch, in the Universal State Bank, sold more than fifty thousand dollars' worth of bonds--mostly to Lithuanians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians will receive credit for these purchases from the government. During the first two Loans, Lithuanians bought no less than they are buying now, but they received no credit because their purchases were not made in one place, under the designation of "Lithuanians." We should have learned something from this.</p>
   <p>Subscribe to the Liberty Loan bonds and do so through the Lithuanian Branch. Workers, let your employers know that you want to purchase bonds through the Lithuanian Division in the Universal State Bank, 3225 South Halsted Street, Chicago.</p>
