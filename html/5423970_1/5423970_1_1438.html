   <p>Nothing results in so much evil to humanity as ignorance. Ignorance brings misfortune; in turn, misfortune brings misery and want, etc. Who suffers most? Why, the ignorant mother. She suffers most in all respects.</p>
   <p>The capitalist owns the machinery, while the mother brings up the children - slaves for the capitalist's exploitation. And because of existing conditions, they do not develop normally. How many so-called criminals we have today! A poor young lad is forced by want and starvation to steal and rob. The end is jail. Then he is denounced as a criminal and thief, while the worst thieves are occupying public offices.</p>
   <p>It is about time for mothers and girls to look for the spring of knowledge. At present, in Chicago, the Lithuanian women have a great opportunity to gain enlightenment and education through the Women's Enlightenment Society. At every meeting this society gives lectures, which are delivered by our own members and sometimes by outsiders.</p>
   <p>At the next meeting, a lecture will be given by a student, Miss S. A. Rutkauskas. The subject will be "The Conditions of Women at the Present Time and What They Seek for the Future."</p>

   <p>Mrs. M. Seskiene.</p>
