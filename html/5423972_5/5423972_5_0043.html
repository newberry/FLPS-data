   <p>As is known to the readers of the Courier, two pictures in Mr. Block's recent exhibit at Chicago's Arts Club were interesting and impressive portraits of Jewish types: "The Writer," and "The Psalm Singer."</p>
   <p>Besides two non-Jewish art connoisseurs, there were many amateur judges present. Of his masterpieces, the Jewish painter Block said, "that he hoped they might land in Jewish hands."</p>
   <p>Last week Mr. S. B. Komaiko imspected the two pictures and bought them.</p>
   <p>We hear that Mr. Komaiko also wishes to obtain a third picture of Mr. Block's known under the title of "The Soul of a Violin," or "The Transmigration of a Melody."</p>
