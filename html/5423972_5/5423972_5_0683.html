   <p>sullen and disillusioned, until at last he took the Bible and found the passage "Eli, Eli, Lomo Azavtoni?" (Oh, God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!)</p>
   <p>From these beautiful words Mr. Sandler created his world-famous song.</p>
   <p>The first to sing it was Mrs. Karp, who had a great success. The song, published without the authors's name passed from mouth to mouth and became popular among both Jews and non-Jews as a folk song.</p>
   <p>Years later "Eli, Eli" became popular in the music world, and strange as it seems, Mr. Sandler, the author, was unaware of this fact.</p>
   <p>He retired from the music world entirely to live with his family in the Bronx, where he established himself as a clothing salesman, and only during the High Holidays he used to conduct choirs in the synagogues. As the years passed by, he was totally forgotten as a Jewish song-writer.</p>
   <p>One evening his daughter, coming home from an operatic concert in the Metropolitan Theatre, related to her father how Sophie Braslow had delighted her audience by singing the beautiful "Eli, Eli."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sandler although realizing the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>tness of his song saw that it was rather too late to have it <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>When several days later, Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, popular Jewish playwright, met Mr. Sandler in the street, he almost <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ded the latter for not taking legal action for the rights of his song. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>he <span class="gap">[gap]</span> explained that song music publishers clai<span class="gap">[gap]</span> it to be a <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and that they <span class="gap">[gap]</span> <span class="gap">[gap]</span>any changes in it that it is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to recognize the original "Eli, Eli." Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>omer and the children and friends of the author insisted <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that the modest Mr. Sandler was <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the incident public. Finally he agreed to publish the story of "Eli, Eli" in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sandler is almost sixty years old old his <span class="gap">[gap]</span> was great when he learned that his beloved song had been <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. The original "Eli, Eli," is very rhythmical and harmo<span class="gap">[gap]</span>us.</p>
   <p>It is about time that <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ny musicians and music lovers who appreciate this remarkable co<span class="gap">[gap]</span>sition mention and honor this humble and sincere musician's name.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Jacob Koppel Sandler, although a clothing salesman and off-time choir leader during the holidays, deserves recognition as the author of this immortal song.</p>
