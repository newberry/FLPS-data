   <p>The Public Library, after a great deal of coaxing by Jewish Organizations, have finally purchased a number of books in the Yiddish Language. Some of the finest Yiddish writers are represented in the collection numbering several hundred books. Directors of the library state that if this practice proves popular, many more books will be added to the present collection. We call upon our Yiddish reading public to take advantage of this very opportunity provided by the Chicago Public Library. Remember! The more books you read, the more variety of books you will be able to read because the Chicago Public Library is certain to increase the number of Yiddish books if a favorable response is forth-coming from the Yiddish Book lovers.</p>
