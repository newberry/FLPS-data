   <p>The Hebrew Theological College of Chicago, better known as the Beth Medrosh L'Torah, is not and must not be a school for professionals, must not be a trade school in any shape or form. Its main task is to bring up a generation of learned Jews, so that they may be equipped intellectually and morally to preside over Jewish destinies of Jewish communities and to continue the traditions of our people. The Hebrew Theological Seminary has actually one task to perform--to spread light, the light of Jewish knowledge. Everything else is a matter of second consideration. It is up to the student to determine whether he wants to become a Rabbi or not. It is up to the student to say whether he wants to become a Hebrew teacher or not, but the spirit prevailing in the institution must be a spirit of intellectual unselfishness and a spirit of true learning. The institution will have performed the function for which it was called into being if after five years from today it will produce a generation of young and <span class="page-break">2</span>ambitious Jewish scholars. Whether these scholars prefer to remain Rabbis or laymen will not affect the college in any way.</p>
   <p>The trouble with American Jewry is that it has learned very little and that it has forgotten a great deal. To eradicate ignorance is the task of the Hebrew Theological College of Chicago, and to be frank about it, we are concerned with the number of lay-scholars the college may produce than with the number of Rabbis be graduated from the college [sic]. Of course if a young student is very pious and believes himself fit for the Rabbinate and the Board of Directors of the institution holds the same view, then he should not be denied a special Rabbinic training. But the college should not force boys into the Rabbinate or even try to persuade them to join the Rabbinic class, unless those young men who choose the Rabbinate as a career will be successful Rabbis. Those, however, who become Rabbis because they are forced into the Rabbinate or because they think they have nothing better to do in life than to become Rabbis, will give poor services to the Congregation and will be very poor Rabbis.</p>

   <p>The same holds good of Hebrew teachers. We need more Hebrew teachers in the Middle West, and even if the Theological College should produce fifty a year, they will all find positions, for there is a scarcity of Hebrew teachers in America. But no student of the Theological College should be pressed into the teachers class and he should not be persuaded to embark upon a teacher's career, unless he feels and the Board of Directors feel that he will be fit for his job, morally, psychologically, and intellectually. A man may be a fine scholar and make a very poor teacher. Teaching is an art in itself, and it is an art that cannot be acquired. When the students will receive a thorough Hebrew and Talmudic education, they will surely be able to determine what they could do best. There is no doubt in our mind that a great many will choose the Rabbinate as their career, while others will prefer to embark on a teacher's career, that may be as remunerative as any other career. But the principle that the Hebrew Theological College has as its main task to spread the knowledge of Judaism must never be forgotten or overlooked.</p>
   <p>Although the Hebrew Theological College has been established by the Chicago <span class="page-break">4</span>Jews, it should not serve the purposes of the Chicago community only, but it should serve the purposes of the Middle Western Jewry at large, and should give preference to young men from the Middle West. By doing so it will invite the sympathy of the Middle Western Jewry and finally it will also get the support of the Middle Western Jewry. If the Board of Directors will bear this in mind it will make it its business to get in touch with all the Jewish communities in the Middle West and try to get the support of each and every community in the Middle West. The Middle Western communities should be made to feel that they are partners and co-owners of this institution and that they are obligated to the institution.</p>
   <p>It is not only important from a financial point of view, but it is important from a moral and intellectual point of view. The interest a Middle Western Jewish community might take in the Hebrew Theological Seminary will contribute to the intensifying of the Jewish intellectual life of that community. It will accompany with the keenest interest the development of the institution and it will take pride in the fact and it will make it its business to find positions <span class="page-break">5</span>for the graduates of the institution.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education of the Theological Seminary must consist of Hebrew and Talmudic scholars, men who are not well versed in Hebrew and Talmudic lore have no right to be members of the Board of Education. They may do a good many things for the institution when serving on the Board of Directors, but they should not serve on the Board of Education. The Board of Education of an academic establishment and the Hebrew Theological College is supposed to be an academic establishment--should consist of men alive in their task. They must be in a position to follow the developments of the institution from a purely intellectual and scholarly point of view. They must give the institution its intellectual standard, and unless they are intellectuals themselves, they will not be able to do so, and the institution will remain a Talmud Torah or a second class Yeshivah. The very nature of the institution, its very function, necessitates the Board of Education consist of learned men.</p>
   <p>If the leaders of the institution will be mindful of these three things,--first, <span class="page-break">6</span>that the institution is primarily called upon to spread the knowledge of Judaism; secondly that it is to serve the purpose of Middle Western Jewry at large, and thirdly that it must be a high class academic establishment, then there is no doubt in our mind that it will be one day not only the pride of Chicago, not only the pride of Middle Western Jewry, but the pride of American Jewry at large.
