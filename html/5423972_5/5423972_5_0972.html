   <p>Starting next Sunday, the editorial office of the Courier will feature a new column for its readers entitled: "The wheel of Life". Our readers themselves will be the sole contributors to this column, its editors, if you will, because all well-written human interest stories will be printed there. This column will be an honest reflection of life; one can expect to find joy, as well as sorrow, depicted there.</p>
   <p>We wish to take this opportunity to speak briefly about [the vicissitudes of] life. Life has been likened unto a wheel. Life does not remain static any more than a wheel does. It [life] is constantly moving and changing. Everything that happens is momentary, and soon disappears. Other incidents take their place; these also are subject to change by still other events. The life of an individual is like a wheel; its spokes are the joy and sorrow, the hope and disappointment, the love and hate, the belief and despair <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>[which he experiences]. Thousands of voices call upon man to enjoy his life. The sun shines brightly upon him. All of his energy is awakened. His soul is filled with joy, and melodies of love ring in his ears. From thousands of women, a man selects but one and vice versa.</p>
   <p>When a couple marry, who are as happy as they? The world appears to be a paradise to both the husband and wife. All difficulties are minimized. They cannot believe that they will ever have to bear a heavy burden.</p>
   <p>But life is not what it appears to be in one's dreams. When the wheel [life] begins to turn, it often becomes so complex that it becomes a difficult burden for man to endure. Life is changed into a well of tears, an abyss of profound suffering.</p>
   <p>Many years after marriage, when a man and wife have brought children into the world; when they have become accustomed to each other, the wheel of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>life begins to spin. Occasionally a serpent comes between them, in the form of an intrigante, and a quiet, peaceful family life is shattered. Both the man and woman begin to look at each other wryly. This arouses hatred in them, which poisons their souls, or jealousy, which disturbs their consciences. And their peaceful life becomes an unbearable hell.</p>
   <p>And what about unfortunate love affairs? These also will have their place in the "Wheel of Life". There was a time when an unfortunate girl, forsaken and uncared-for, whose heart was broken, and whose life was ruined, was the sole ideal of some young man. At least, that is what the girl thought. Her path in life was covered with roses and blossoms. The perfumed air exhaled a fragrant aroma all around her. Ecstasy pursued her and good fortune smiled upon her. Who else could attain such happiness? She would call her loved one, "my happiness," "my treasure," "my friend," "my soul." Who said that the world was bad, or that life was horrible? Probably they were people who had never been in love. This is what the innocent girl thought. She did not realize that the wheel was constantly spinning. She was duped by <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>her sweetheart. Her lover was untrue to her. When he wasn't with her, he was unfaithful to her. And at a time when he had promised to be eternally faithful, when he took her in his arms, he was either thinking of someone else or he was only satisfying his physical desires. And when she realized the truth, she felt bitterly defeated. She would cry, and murmur, despondently, "Why am I so unfortunate? Why was I born into this world? Why is fate so horrible, why am I tortured?"</p>
   <p>A shadowy cloud covers the life of this young soul. She strikes the chords of lamentation and despair on the harp of life. Tears stream from her eyes and her soul is enveloped in sadness. It seems as though she can never again attain peace, and she despairs of finding love and fortune.</p>
   <p>Even among elderly people, those who have passed their youth, and have lived through all the hopes and disappointments, all the joys and sorrows of youthful love--even among these people, changes take place. Each time <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>that fate spins the wheel, the poor suddenly become rich and the rich, poor; the hope of receiving happiness from children is shattered by the bitter realization that children can also bring grief and trouble to their parents. Parents face many hardships when they raise children. They work constantly in order to make their children's lives comfortable. They give them an education and teach them either a trade or a profession. Are the burdens of life too heavy for a father or mother? No! They carry their burdens joyfully, disregarding their weight. But the aged mother and father trust that their children will respect them and repay them for the hardships they have endured. But great disappointments often occur. The wheel of life, which is constantly spinning, turns and the happiness of parents is shattered when their children ignore them. The parents of such children are brokenhearted because the latter are ungrateful.</p>
   <p>Such events go on without stopping. Who can enumerate and count so many? These incidents will be reflected in the new column, "The Wheel of Life," which will begin next Sunday in the Jewish Courier.</p>

   <p>The readers of the Courier will be the authors and editors of this column, and everybody will be given a chance to record his or her experiences. Each will receive an appropriate answer to all questions.</p>
