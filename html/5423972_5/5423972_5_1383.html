   <p>Nothing has been heard recently about the Hebrew Theological College in Chicago. It is true that the building activity is going on, but when the building is ready in a few months--what then? Is it not about time that the representatives of the community came together and began to do something to insure the future of the institution? The completion of the building is only a part of the work. Ways and means have to be found of financing the institution. A definite policy has to be adopted regarding the educational work--how to educate the students, which system to adopt, how to finance the education.</p>
   <p>The present leaders of the Hebrew Theological College are deeply devoted to the great undertaking and are doing everything in their power to complete the building, but not all of them are authorities on the problem of higher Jewish education. If the president of the Hebrew Theological College were a man who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>looked ahead, he would call a meeting of rabbis, synagogue presidents, and scholars, and would explain the situation to them. The meeting should elect two committees--a financial committee which would work out plans of financing the institution, and an educational committee to work out an educational program and a proper curriculum.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Leiserowich does this, he will arouse great interest in the Hebrew Theological College among the Jewish circles in Chicago.</p>
