   <p>Press notices in Yiddish and Hebrew announced a few months ago that Chicago will open a Jewish educational institution. Everyone interested in the education of Jewish children was highly pleased with this announcement. The Jewish Socialist Sunday School on Ashland Blvd. is a great success. Many Jewish Socialist wanted their children to learn to read and write Yiddish, and had there not been a scarcity of Jewish teachers, more schools would certainly be opened in other localities of the city.</p>
   <p>However, it materialized into an absurdity. The chief figures of the "educational institution" are planning a rabbinical seminary, and we soon read a report that the Chicago Hebrew Theological Colleges, where Talmud is being taught, engaged a certain butcher as its president, and that is the beginning of the realization of a rabbinical seminary.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, Chicago is blessed with two competitive synagogues, the Anshe Sholom Congregation and the Russian Congregation. The planned rabbinical seminary, with the participation of a butcher as a president, is connected <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with the rabbi of the Anshe Sholom. It is understood that, in such a case, the Russian Congregation must also have a rabbinical seminary.</p>
