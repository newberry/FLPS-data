   <p>In 1889 the Hebrew Literary Association of Chicago, a society organized by a number of Russian Jewish reformers in the interest of the Hebrew language and literature, made an attempt to publish a monthly magazine in Hebrew. Two issues appeared under the name of "Keren Or" (Ray of Light). These numbers contained articles written by Dr. Felsenthal, Mr. Peretz Wiernik, and H. Eliassof. But it seems that no Hebrew paper can exist for any length of time in this country, and it was discontinued.</p>
