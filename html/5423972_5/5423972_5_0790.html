   <p>Chicago is to have an institution for medical research similar to the one founded in N. Y. by John D. Rockefeller. The new institute is the gift of Mrs. Nelson Morris and the sum of $250,000, which is needed for the erection and complete furnishings of the hospital, has been donated by her as a memorial to her husband. It will be known as the Nelson Morris Memorial Institute of Medical Research and will be connected with the Michael Reese Hospital.</p>
   <p>The plans for the new building, which are being drawn by Richard E. Schmidt, will be ready for Mrs. Morris' inspection the latter part of Sept. Work will begin as soon as these plans are approved. It is hoped the Institute will be ready for occupancy by next Spring.</p>
   <p>The building will be constructed according to the ideas of Dr. James W. Jobling, chief pathologist of Michael Reese Hospital and until recently pathologist at the Rockefeller Institute.</p>
