   <p>Henry Ford has committed many political blunders in his life, but the greatest blunder that he committed was his attempt to bribe the Jewish press in America by offering it large advertisements, and by believing that the "Ford-Ward" [name applied by Courier to Forward because latter printed Ford's ads], the only Jewish newspaper that printed his advertisements had any influence upon Jewish life in America. He does not know that the "Ford-Ward" has no more influence than any other rag which prints filthy literature and arouses the lowest instincts of the masses. People read the "Ford-Ward" just as they read the Chicago Star, a pornographic sheet which reports scandalous stories that no decent newspaper would print. The "Ford-Ward" would go out of business within forty-eight hours if it ceased its pornographic activity. People do not take the opinion of the "Ford-Ward" seriously, just as they do not take the opinion of the Chicago Star seriously. A "well-informed" man like Mr. Ford should have <span class="page-break">2</span>known that his advertisement in the "Ford-Ward" did him more harm than good.</p>
