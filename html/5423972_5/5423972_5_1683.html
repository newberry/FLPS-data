   <p>There has been almost no Jewish immigration into the United States because of the terrible conflict raging in Europe, so that in our department of English for Foreigners, where last year it was necessary for us to hold over a long waiting list of eager immigrants, who had an insatiable desire to learn the language of our country and its customs, this year we were fortunate in being able to place all of the newcomers in classes immediately. We are only beginning to realize now what a satisfaction it is to be in a position to accommodate all those who come applying for admission into our Evening School, without telling them that there is no more room and that a waiting list is the only thing we can accommodate them with for the time being. We have been conducting ten unbroken classes throughout the year, meeting four times weekly, from 7:30 to 9:00 o'clock each evening. The total registration for the year was 1,640 as compared to 1,104 of the year before</p>
