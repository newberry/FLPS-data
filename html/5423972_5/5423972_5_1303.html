   <p>Greetings! May fortune be your lot! We now have in Chicago a Hebrew Teachers' Seminary, and I wish it good luck.</p>
   <p>This institution is so important for the future development of the Chicago Jewry that it would be worth while building a special edifice and organizing a special staff of teachers for this division of the Hebrew Theological College. Whether the Hebrew Theological College will produce great rabbis, I do not know and no one else knows, although in that institution there are today several young men who are well posted in Hebrew and who are qualified for rabbinical positions. But it is certain that the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will produce a generation of Hebrew teachers and of scholars in general, who, in turn, will bring up another generation of scholars, because many students of the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will remain Hebrew teachers.</p>

   <p>The Jews nearby Chicago should know that the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary is not only a local institution but an institution for the entire Middle West. The Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will train Hebrew teachers and these teachers will accept positions not only in Chicago but in all Jewish communities around Chicago. And all communities which will engage teachers from the Chicago Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will certainly profit from their proficiency. It is, therefore, the duty of every Jewish community around Chicago to contribute annually to this institution. The Chicago Jews built the edifice of the institution, but it must be maintained by the entire Middle West. The spiritual and religious life of the future Jewish generations in the Middle West depends entirely upon the success of the Hebrew Teachers Seminary.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow the Jewish masses on the West Side and Northwest Side will have the opportunity personally to acquaint themselves with Dr. Chaim Weizmann. The brilliant Zionist leader will address two mass meetings tomorrow night, which will be held at the Knesses Israel Congregation, Homan Avenue and Douglas <span class="page-break">\3</span>Boulevard, and in the Tifereth Zion Synagogue, Lincoln Avenue. Dr. Weizmann understands the psychology of the Jewish masses better than any other Jew of our time--he understands their spirit and their soul and how to infuse new life into them. Until now the Chicago Jewish masses have not heard Dr. Weizmann, and when they will personally acquaint themselves with him tomorrow evening, they will recognize in Dr. Weizmann a typical Jewish leader. If Dr. Shmarya Levin understands the psychology of the Jewish masses, Dr. Weizmann is a true example in this field--and when he speaks to them, he speaks in the language of their soul and their spirit. [Weizmann's visit here was in connection with drive to raise funds for Palestine.]</p>
