   <p>A benefit performance in honor of Mr. Joseph Kessler, Star and Director of the Haymarket Theatre, will be held this evening.</p>
   <p>A part of the history of the Jewish Theatre in Chicago will be associated with this evening's affair. It is, therefore, worthwhile to consider the local theatre in general, and the role that Mr. Kessler played in its development for the past few years.</p>
   <p>When speaking of the development of the theatre, it does not only mean the progress that the theatre has made in its cultural sense, it also means the numerical expansion of theatrical attendants, who were attracted by the theatre throughout the course of its existence.</p>
   <p>The cultural side: If one should be strict, uncompromising, the decision could be expressed in one word - poor. And not only in Chicago. The Chicago theatres derive their benefits from the New York theatres. And if any criticism should be given, New York, with its art temples, is above all.</p>
   <p>However, this is not the only reason for the cultural failure of the local theatres.</p>
   
   <p>They, who are interested in the Jewish Theatre and who are often visitors of the performances, will argue that Joseph Kessler attempted, more than once, to drive trash from his theatre.</p>
   <p>However, the result was - a vacant theatre.</p>
   <p>Whose fault was it, the management, the actors? Neither.</p>
   <p>The management was interested in one thing only - the financial success of his theatre. Each play that resulted in a packed house, is considered by the management as the best in Jewish repertory.</p>
   <p>And if the play is actually a literary one, the management will certainly not hesitate to run this play for many weeks, if it only satisfies the treasury.</p>
   <p>It is certainly not the actor's fault. They would like to appear in literary plays, impersonate types and characters who are artistically inclined. More than once an actor boasted that he appeared in Gordon's repertoire, in Scholom Asch's plays.</p>
   <p>Ben Ami, Mark Schwade, and other actors, who possess a sense of fine acting and who would certainly not like to lose their reputation as intelligent actors, must still appear in "Hannah in America," and in similar trash.</p>
   
   <p>Consequently, who is guilty that the theatres are disappearing? The theatrical fan.</p>
   <p>Here, it is not a matter of the "selected," of the critics of a small intelligent group, who would certainly be pleased to see good literary plays. This is only a small group, that would be unable to cover the expenses of a theatre. It is a concern of the great masses, who are unable, as yet, to digest any literary plays, and are contented with jazz music and cheap jokes.</p>
   <p>Many people affirm that the theatre is a people's institution. In what respect?</p>
   <p>If the theatre should suffer a material loss, who would come to its aid? Will the management be justified in turning to the Jewry with an appeal for donations? Would the people respond to such an appeal? No.</p>
   <p>The theatre is a private enterprise. The management is the exclusive owner of this enterprise.</p>
   <p>This owner seeks to satisfy his "customer." The "customer" demands trash and trash is given him.</p>
   
   <p>Who should educate the race? The theatre? No.</p>
   <p>One, who goes to the theatre enters it with a specific demand. In short, one who visits the theatre definitely desires, in advance, good or poor plays. And the theatre can do nothing in such case.</p>
   <p>The press lectures and debates on literature and drama, on art and plays. All these are the methods of developing the race and implanting in it something more beautiful, more literary and more artistic.</p>
   <p>There is a theatre here. Thanks to the efforts and abilities of Mr. Joseph Kessler, Chicago possesses one of the finest Jewish theatres in America.</p>
   <p>There is, also, no scarcity of Jewish actors. The presentation of Madame Goodinsky, together with Joseph Kessler, is sufficient evidence that Mr. Kessler does not spare any money in order to satisfy the Chicago Jewry.</p>
