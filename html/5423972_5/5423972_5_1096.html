   <p>In the Pompeian Room of Gold's Restaurant, a reception and banquet were given in honor of Alexander Harkavy, noted Jewish lexicographer and linguist, whose dictionaries have contributed greatly to the rapid Americanization of our people in this country. This banquet was largely attended by leaders of organizations and institutions and welfare workers who have become gray in public service, as well as by many intellectuals and representatives of the various professions.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Horwich was toastmaster of the evening. He spoke of the virtues of the honored guest and the wonderful work that Mr. Harkavy had accomplished. The speakers were: Mr. S. J. Rosenblatt, Dr. S. M. Melamed, Judge Harry M. Fisher, Rabbi [A. L.] Lassen, Mr. S. B. Komaiko, Mr. Nathan D. Kaplan, Judge P. Bregstone, and several representatives of the radical group.</p>
   <p>A committee of ten was appointed to popularize Harkavy's new Yiddish-English- <span class="page-break">\2</span>Hebrew idiomatic dictionary and to procure 1,500 subscriptions for this masterpiece, which Mr. Harkavy has now completed.</p>
   <p>In his unique way, the distinguished guest thanked the leaders of this city for the beautiful reception [given him], and gave a summary of his lexicographic work and of the new features [to be found] in his idiomatic dictionary.</p>
