   <p>The children of Nathan Fox gave six thousand dollars for the Ba-Tay Midrashim La-Torah, in memory of their father, who died October 26, 1922. This is the largest individual donation which the Ba-Tay Midrashim La-Torah has yet received.</p>
   <p>Nathan Fox was one of Chicago's respected citizens, a man of knowledge, a scholar, and a great philanthropist. He was treasurer of the Hebrew school of the Anshe Emeth Congregation and, shortly before his death, brought over twelve families from Europe. Of the six thousand dollars which his children, Sidney Fox, Mrs. Levin, and Miss Lilian Fox have donated in his name, one thousand dollars will go to the Library Fund of the Ba-Tay Midrashim La-Torah and five thousand dollars to the Endowment Fund of the institution.</p>
