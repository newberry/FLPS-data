   <p>The Peoples ball of last evening which was attended by hundreds of men and women, was the concluding evening of the Peoples Relief bazaar.</p>
   <p>The officials of the bazaar, Mr. A. Minkus, general chairman, Mr. A. Lurie, chairman of the Peoples Relief, and Mr. Joseph Fieder, general manager, made the following statement yesterday:</p>
   <p>The bazaar of the local Peoples Relief Ort Committee, that was held for the benefit of the children's homes and schools in Europe and for the constructive activity of the Ort, netted more than $15,000 profit. We feel that we have sufficient reasons to be satisfied with the results considering: 1. The dire condition of the great member of unemployed. 2. The difficulties of sponsoring any undertaking before Christmas, when all are engaged until late in the evenings and have no time for amusements.</p>
