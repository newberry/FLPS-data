   <p>Peretz Hirshbein is one of those writers who has a "cockeyed" outlook on life and therefore sees things differently from most other people. He is a Jewish poet from the rural country, not simply a country man, but a true dyed-in-the-wool one. To this very day the tones of the village are more familiar to him than those of the city. By having a perverted outlook on life, and being one-hundred-per-cent rural, he was able to write "A Forsaken Corner," a genuine Jewish fiery-drama of strong dramatic conflicts, tragic depth, and of unique Jewish beauty. If Peretz Hirshbein did not write under the influence of Hauptman, then he surely is a very original realist. His "Forsaken Corner" reaches the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>heights of Hauptman's realism.</p>
   <p>If he had the good fortune to be born Hirshbein, we mean by that a poet with many marvelous talents, he also had the good fortune to meet Morris Schwartz, Ludwig Zatz, and Celia Adler, the three artists responsible for urbanizing the country man and for putting life, motion, and passion into his play.</p>
   <p>"A Forsaken Corner" is a drama in three acts. The first act is more than a poem, or naive folk lyric. The plot is very simple. Note, the grave-digger, has a daughter, Tzirele, who falls in love with Noah, the son of Hyman Hersh, the miller. Both Note and Hyman Hersh are lifelong enemies unto death, because the grave-digger wishes to quit his work to become a miller, thus giving Hyman Hersh competition. Both are <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>strong, passionate, healthy folksmen, and like all country men, obstinate. They are neighbors who out of pure mutual animosity wish to do away with one another, stopping at nothing, setting fire, fighting, etc.</p>
   <p>Note, the grave-digger, meets a rich young lumber merchant who desires to finance his wish provided Note's pretty daughter Tzirele becomes his wife. But Tzirele loves Noah with the strength and passion of Nature's children. Noah returns this love. But the mutual deadly hatred of their fathers lies in their path. This hatred between the elders begins to assume such proportions that a catastrophe is inevitable. Tzirele runs away from her father, the grave-digger, and comes to Hyman Hersh's home where she is sheltered by his wife and son. At this moment of intense dramatic heights, old Tudrus, the grave-digger's father, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>arrives on the scene seeking to bring about peace. Tudrus has his son in hand, for he is his son. After much efforts and talk, the elder succeeds in securing some control over Hyman Hersh, for he, the old man Tudrus, had officiated at the death of Hersh's parents, offering their souls to Heaven. When Hyman Hersh tries to remain obstinate, the old man cries aloud, "Lowly creature," and Hyman Hersh controls himself. In the end Tudrus succeeds in bringing about peace between the two fathers, thus making it possible for Tzirele's and Noah's heart dreams to become a reality.</p>
   <p>We find in this drama a wealth of psychological phrases which are simple and rapturously beautiful. Here we see Note, the grave-digger, a Jew of about 50, strong, healthy, wild, obstinate, clever, desiring to use his strong fists. With a whip in his hand he tries to force Tzirele to follow in his ways, but, at the crucial moment, in comes <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>old Tudrus and reprimands him. Note is still obstinate. Then Tudrus shows him the whip, Note becomes a mouse. . . . The big strong Note, with his long beard, stands before his aged father as Tzirele would stand before him. In this expression of true Jewish respect for parents, lies so much deep human culture, such as really only the Jew can portray.</p>
   <p>These small psychological phrases make the play a Jewish one, and justify the happy ending. With two powerful heroes in the play, there must be a catastrophe, while a type like Tudrus is only possible among Jews.</p>
   <p>Now, twenty years after the drama was written, it is being presented on the stage. I, at least, have never in my lifetime seen such realistic and extraordinary artistic acting in the Jewish theater. Only Max Reinhardt's company in Berlin can in their actions call forth so much illusions as Morris Schwartz and his troupe do in this play.</p>

   <p>Here Jewish tragedy is not presented with signs and tearing cloth ( for the dead), but by means of wonderful mimic, through candid worthy acting and rythmic movements.</p>
   <p>The greatest surprise in this performance is not the roguish and beloved Celia Adler; neither is it Morris Schwartz, nor A. Goldshmidt, who play Hyman Hersh, the miller, and Note, the grave-digger. It is rather the comedian Ludwig Zatz, who here reveals himself as one of the greatest tragedians. He plays the old Tudrus. Portraying an old man can only be accomplished by mimic, not by motions, because an old man's motions are very slow and not individualistic. All grandfathers are of the same pattern except that each smells his tobacco in his own way, such is the standing tradition. Ludwig Zatz is a master in mimic. His art consists of a variation of expressions which form slowly and definitely the type of the old Jew, the old father, the clever elder. As he molds this character, he stands before our eyes <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>so true and impressive that we cannot forget the picture he presents, everything else being soon forgotten except Tudrus as played by Ludwig Zatz. The old Tudrus is not simply a spirited live figure but also a deeply tragic one which suppresses its tragedy with the aid of the psalms. But, when tragedy finally does pierce through suppression, it is heartbreaking, penetrating our senses and our hearts.</p>
   <p>What makes Zatz the great artist is the simple way in which he works. He can awake the deepest, most touching tones from an ordinary "fiddle" with only one string. In general Jewish actors work with drums and trumpets. Ludwig Zatz plays his most touching role on a small violin and creates an immense impression [Translators note: All this is figuratively speaking.] He is therefore unique in his art.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Of Celia Adler, what more can we say: "Her talent is inherited." She acts with her two large eyes and gracious movements. She is, in the play, only as she can be, the sweet country maiden, all child, all girl, all woman. You have to know how to do it. But she knows, and let the Gods not envy her, though she earns their envy.</p>
   <p>Morris Schwartz and A. Goldshmidt present their roles so artistically and characteristically that one might question: "Who gives the better performance?" Both present successfully the role of the obstinate country man in a true rural manner.</p>
   <p>If Morris Schwartz has reached his goal in acting, he attained it through mimic, but his duties are not as difficult as that of Ludwig Zatz, whose role is the stronger. Goldshmidt, on the other hand, who plays no less brilliantly than Morris Schwartz, must portray motion <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>and so outdoes the role of Note, the grave-digger, with extraordinary artsmanship.</p>
   <p>Under the direction of Morris Schwartz, Tanenholtz, playing the miller's son, and lover of Tzirele, improved in his art. He plays with a certain charm, developing his character as the play progresses. In the first act, Noah is quite a boy, in the last he is all man. His training under Morris Schwartz has greatly developed his acting ability.</p>
   <p>Boris Rozenthal, who plays Chatzkell, the lumberman, has but a small part from which we cannot judge his talents. The same may be said of the three women in the play, namely, Rosa Rosenthal, who plays Note the grave-digger's wife; Sophia Nadalski, as the wife of Hymen Hersh, the miller, and Sarah Filler in the role of a grandmother, a craze <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>woman who roams the cemetery where her children lie buried. The two mother roles that Peretz Hirshbein created here are too conventional to give Madame Rosenthal and Madame Nadalski a chance to display their talent. Sarah Filler, on the other hand, sets forth a few interesting phrases.</p>
   <p>How will Chicago welcome this new revelation of Jewish dramatic art and acting. Does Chicago only wish to see Jews in comedy or is it interested enough to receive such a play as "The Forsaken Corner" as presented by the artistic troupe of New York's Irving Place Theater? Unintelligent people need not go to see this play.</p>
