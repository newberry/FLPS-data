   <p>Through the influence of Rabbi Saul Silber, Mr. Boruch Krohon, formerly of Grand Rapids and now of Boston where he has a leather business, has promised to give $15,000 for the purpose of erecting a building in Chicago that will house both the Beth Midrash Larabonim (Hebrew Theological Seminary) and the Yeshivath Etz Hayim (Hebrew Theological College). It is estimated that the building will cost about $60,000. The only request that Mr. Krohon made was that the building should bear the name of his deceased father, Mr. Sholom Cohen.</p>
   <p>Officials of Beth Midrash Larabonim and Yeshivath Etz Hayim elected a committee to draw up the plans for the building, and to submit them to the directors of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities for approval. The committee is composed of Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, Shmarya Levin, I. Shechtman, S. B. Goldberg, S. R. Plat and Rabbi Silber.</p>
