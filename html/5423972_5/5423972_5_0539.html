   <p>Lilac Party and Dance sponsored by West Side Ladies Society.- -</p>
   <p>To be held on May 14th at the Illinois Hall, Madison and Ogden Ave. The affair promises to be the largest of the season.</p>
   <p>The West Side Ladies Charity Society is sufficiently well known to Chicago for us to espouse their virtues. It is an organization of Jewish women whose sole purpose is to lighten the burden of the unfortunate poor and help them wherever possible. As is well known to people engaged in charity work, the outlay is always greater than the intake. Therefore, this Party and Dance is being run to help defray the expenses of their worthy charitable works. The many necessary committees have been organized, and the affair promises to be highly successful. Our West Side public is cordially invited to attend.</p>
