   <p>The new choir organized last week by the educational committee of the Workmen's Circle, one of Chicago's largest Jewish organizations, is on a very good basis. It is rapidly developing with much success.</p>
   <p>Friend Paul Lemkoff, the well-known composer and musician, who is well-experienced in organizing and directing choirs of adults, was invited as director of the Workmen's Circle Choir. Registrations of new members in the choir can be made at the office of the educational committee, 1224 S. Albany Avenue.</p>
   <p>Members of the choir will not only learn singing but will also be taught to read notes in order to acquaint themselves with the theory of music.</p>
