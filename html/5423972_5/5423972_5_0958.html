   <p>Several of our readers will perhaps wonder angrily why we continually bring to their attention the existence of the Courier. They must not forget that the reactionary elements in Jewish life are rich in material resources and are able to publish a paper even though it is despised by the Jewish masses. The Jewish Press actually exists in Chicago, edited by Abe Liebling, and the Courier by Leon Zolotkoff. Both are "patriots" and "pro-war" until the end. The difference between them is that the Courier has the power to hypnotize the Jewish masses in time of election.</p>
   <p>The Courier controls the Vad Harabonin (organized rabbis), the Central Relief for war victims, the Marks Nathan Home, and other charitable institutions, Hebrew schools, presidents of the synagogues, and the entire Zionist movement of Chicago. The Courier takes advantage of these organizations for its political, financial, and "social" purposes.</p>
   <p>The Courier recently made a sandwich of Jack Loeb's Christmas-Zionism and "war until the end patriotism." It reiterates all the reactionary editorials from the capitalist press and disguises its vile form under the blue-white banner of Zionism.</p>
   <p>The Courier is a bad actor and only idiots believe its "patriotism," "Judaism," and "Zionism." It has greater success in the role of a Purim actor than by declaring that its Zionists do not recognize the government of Trotsky and Lenin and they did so on the same day that mighty England hinted that she will recognize them.</p>
   <p>The Courier is a greater cripple when it wants to throw a stone at the Socialists in an indirect manner. Being in constant fear that the Jewish Socialists will succeed in tearing off its mask of "American Patriotism," "Jewish Social Work," and "Zionism," the Courier, therefore, seeks to discredit the Jewish Socialists, who want to cleanse the Jewry of Chicago from the plague from which it wishes to become free. The Courier is too much of a coward to publicly attack the organized Jewish Labor Movement of Chicago, so it seeks to discredit it indirectly by spreading false rumors about its comrades.</p>
