   <p>After the representatives of local synagogues had decided, at a meeting which was held last week at the Waller Street Talmud Torah, that there should be only one shelter home in Chicago, they also decided that the money [which was originally intended for the building of another shelter home in Chicago], and which is in the hands of certain people, should go for another charitable purpose. Thus the question arises, what shall be done with this money?</p>
   <p>There are many ways in which to spend this public money. Some people contend that this money should be turned over to the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities, which is the clearinghouse for all charitable institutions. This would be a very good plan if our Jewish community could be satisfied with the institutions which are already in existence, and will not crave any new ones. But our Jewish community is constantly growing, expanding, and developing to <span class="page-break">2</span>such an extent that new demands are constantly arising, which many institutions must meet.</p>
   <p>For example, let us take our newly settled Lawndale District. This district is blessed with everything, with a wealthy class of Jews who are able to support not only magnificent synagogues which beautify the entire district, but also institutions of a social or educational character.</p>
   <p>We hear complaints from many residents of the Lawndale District that Jewish boys of that neighborhood are growing up without any discipline, and the only place where they acquire [any] habits, and learn how to be sociable, is in the poolroom.</p>
   <p>Much to our regret this is true. That which is to be expected of children who graduate from the poolrooms is readily foreseen. They will not grow up to be sages of the Talmud, or rabbis, nor will they be an asset to the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>But will it not be a great crime if this district continues to be neglected, and <span class="page-break">3</span>if nothing is done to save from degradation those young children who will have to carry on the traditions of Judaism?</p>
   <p>The older Jews, however, believe that by merely erecting synagogues where they meet daily for morning, afternoon, and evening services, they have discharged their duty to Judaism. But this is a grave mistake on their part. This would be like eating a good meal and refusing to give a morsel of food to a hungry child standing nearby. Isn't this what is happening in our new Jewish settlement in the Lawndale District?</p>
   <p>The older Jews have taken, for themselves alone, all the manna from Heaven, the spiritual food that nourishes the Jewish body, and have left nothing for the young people. Consider the tragedy of the following picture: On the Sabbath, or on a holiday, when a father and son walk out of their home together, they immediately separate, each taking a different path. The father goes to the synagogue and the son--to the poolroom. The father goes to listen to sacred words and the son--to utter profanity. The father beseeches the Lord, asking that He <span class="page-break">4</span>grant him means of earning a livelihood and the son hopes that he will find good fortune in either a card, billiard, or dice game. While the father is in the synagogue donating money for charitable institutions, the son is losing money in the aforementioned games.</p>
   <p>This is sad and painful indeed. But still sadder and more painful is the parents' indifference to this abnormal condition.</p>
   <p>Much to our regret, the parents of these children are quite indifferent to this situation; they believe that they alone are obliged to be Jews, and have no obligations toward their children, just as the pious Jewish woman who does not wish to desecrate the Sabbath, nevertheless, tells her child to strike a match in order to light the gas. [Translator's note: The striking of a match on Sabbath is a violation of a Jewish law.]</p>
   <p>All our welfare workers, who are directing Jewish social life, should, therefore, take this situation into consideration, and should correct this great wrong which <span class="page-break">5</span>is being committed by Jewish parents against their children.</p>
   <p>Something must be done for the young, Americanized, Jewish men of that district who are victims of poolrooms where their careers and moral attitudes are being corrupted.</p>
   <p>The only thing that can save them is a large, modern Talmud Torah, which has spacious rooms, good Americanized teachers, a large Jewish and English library, and rooms for meetings and various entertainments. This would serve as a center for the various groups within the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>And who knows what time may bring? It is possible that a small beginning may lead to the establishment of a large Hebrew institute in the Lawndale District, such as the one which is now on Taylor and Lytle Streets.</p>
   <p>The present Hebrew Institute was originally organized in a small way. Ten years ago, a few young, Americanized, Jewish men began some cultural activity in a small building on Blue Island Avenue and Twelfth Street. Their venture proved to be so <span class="page-break">6</span>successful that with the aid of rich patrons, they built the present large structure of the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>The same thing might happen to a modern Talmud Torah which would be built in the Lawndale District. Everybody, rich and poor, needs such an institution. It would, therefore, take on the character of a philanthropic institution. For this reason,many rich Jews in that neighborhood might become interested, and would support the enterprise.</p>
   <p>May the movement to build a new Talmud Torah begin in the Lawndale District. By such a movement, the Orthodox Jews will prove that they are providing not only for themselves, but also for their children.</p>
