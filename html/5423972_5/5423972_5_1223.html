   <p>Now that it is calm again in the city, the committee of five, which was appointed by a conference attended by representatives of the rabbis, the [United Jewish] Charities, the Talmud Torahs, and prominent citizens, can get to work and make up a list of twenty persons, of which seven will be selected by the Charities to be members of the Committee on Education. Of course, there are many Jews in Chicago whose educational qualifications and character fit them for membership on this committee. It is a question, however, whether all those who are capable of doing the work and bearing the responsibility, will do the work. The committee of five should seek men who are not only capable but who are also willing to do the work. Education must be the prime qualification of those twenty men. An uneducated person should not even dream of handling such a delicate thing as education. Some of the twenty men should also have administrative qualifications and experience <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>because sooner or later, the Charities will turn over the entire work to our Jews; the present Committee on Education of the Charities is only a temporary affair. A great deal depends upon the work of the committee, and you and I can only wish it success.</p>
