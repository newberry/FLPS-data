   <p>Our young friend, Leon Zolotkoff, late of the Jewish Jargon weekly, Jewish Courier, it seems has had some bitter experience with one Houvitz, to whom he intrusted the management of his venture.</p>
   <p>The rotter turned traitor, sold out the concern and left Mr. Zolotkoff high and dry. But, it seems that the Jewish World, a new Jargon Jewish paper, has just appeared with Mr. Zolotkoff as editor.</p>
   <p>The Sacasohn and Son of the Courier, will find it hard to combat the new paper.</p>
