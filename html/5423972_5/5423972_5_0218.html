   <p>The Empire Theater ended its season yesterday. In other Jewish communities the theater is a private enterprise, but in Chicago it is a communal institution. It is the only Jewish center here of literature and art, as well as of philosophy. Therefore its fate must interest all Chicago Jews who desire that such a center shall remain in existence.</p>
   <p>In the history of the Jewish theater of Chicago, the season just closed yesterday will be considered the most remarkable because it was, from every standpoint, very fruitful. Never before has Chicago seen so many truly great Jewish dramas, nor greeted so many great artists as it did this past season. Chicago may be a provincial city, but we doubt very much whether even one Jewish theater in New York presented any finer performances this last season, or satisfied their audiences to any greater extent than was done here in <span class="page-break">\2</span>Chicago. The directors of the Empire Theater, Mr. Tzukerberg and Mr. Palei, spared no efforts to bring before the Chicago Jewish public the best to be gotten in the field of theater art and literature. The best actors from New York, both young and old, played for many months in good plays, which drew the great masses of people to the theater.</p>
   <p>Thus, for the first time we witness Chicago as a theater-loving city in which Chicago Jews are eager to patronize Jewish theater art if the theater directors can furnish good actors and good plays.</p>
   <p>It can be said, without exaggeration, that more Chicago Jews attended the Jewish theater this year than in previous years. It is also important to emphasize this--that throughout the entire season, the Empire Theater presented no plays that a conservative person could not see or enjoy. Not by sensational, humorous plays but by good sober dramas and good actors were the theater directors able to fill their house night after night. The public is indebted <span class="page-break">\3</span>to them for this and thanks should be offered by all who are especially interested in a good Jewish theater in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Because of their excellent accomplishments during this last season, the Empire Theater has gained the confidence of the great masses as well as of the educated. We can only hope that in the future the theater directors will follow in this same direction and will pursue the same principles they established this last season. Only then will they be certain that the masses and classes will in the future too be ready to patronize the performances which last year proved to be a blessing to the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Of no less importance than as an art center is the need of the theater as a philanthropic center. Many philanthropic societies owe part of their existence to the Jewish theater. Not all of our readers know that during the last theater season a sum of two hundred thousand dollars was collected for the various Jewish philanthropic enterprises. Almost all charitable circles and many social organizations on Chicago's West Side have, through benefit <span class="page-break">\4</span>performances in the Empire Theater, collected hugh sums of money which enabled them to carry on their work. The Chicago committee of the Denver Sanatorium has in itself, through a number of benefit performances, collected many thousands of dollars. Many smaller circles, auxiliaries, etc. could not exist without the theater. In a word, our Jewish theater in Chicago is, next to the Federated Charities, the largest philanthropic agency in our community. Therefore, those representing our community must take a greater interest in the Jewish theater. They should patronize it oftener, and, as far as possible, care for it, that it may have a secure and undisturbed existence. The better the Jewish theater in Chicago, the more it can accomplish for the community, and the more it can contribute in the field of art, literature, and philanthropy.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, up to the present time, we do not see that the community leaders have been taking any active interest in a Jewish art institution which is also a great center for every kind of communal activity. Only a numbered <span class="page-break">\5</span>group of persons who are very much attached to Jewish literature and art, supported the Jewish theater's struggle for existence this last season. If the Jewish theater were only an art institution it could not take the liberty of demanding patronage of people who are not interested in Jewish art and literature. But, as we have shown by cold facts, it is also one of the greatest philanthropic and socio-economic agencies in the community. On these grounds it is the honorable duty of our community leaders, who do not possess sufficient interest in art, to pay more attention to our Jewish theater since it spares them much work, effort, and anxiety.</p>
   <p>In closing we wish to express, in the name of all friends of Jewish art and literature, our thanks to the directors of the Empire Theater for their efforts to lift Jewish theater art in Chicago to a higher level, and for their honest attempts to give the Jewish public in Chicago the best and most beautiful which our literature and theater art possess.</p>
   <p>Through their successful work, the directors comforted thousands of Jewish hearts, brought joy and health to broken Jewish souls, and aid to thousands of needy and unfortunates.</p>
