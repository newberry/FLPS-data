   <p>The leaders of Chicago Jewry have come to the conclusion that an attempt must be made to combat the deadliest foe of American Jewry--illiteracy, and they have also reached the conclusion that a large Jewish center like Chicago, has certain spiritual obligations, and something must be done to elevate the spiritual life of the city. To attain this objective the Hebrew Theological College has been built--an institution whose task it is to rear a generation of savants, scholars, rabbis, and teachers, who, in turn, will hand down their knowledge to the next generation. The task of the Hebrew Theological College, as we have already emphasized, is not a one-sided one. The Hebrew Theological College is not a trade school; it is the spiritual and educational center for the [Jewish] Orthodox community of Chicago. Therefore, it is the duty of every Chicago Jew to take an interest in this institution and help it as much as possible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>If, however, every Jew in Chicago is obliged to help the Hebrew Theological College, then certainly every Orthodox synagogue is obliged to do so because only the Hebrew Theological College can assure the future of the Orthodox synagogue. If the next generation of Jews in Chicago is illiterate, the synagogue will become superfluous. In the Old Country, where human activity was limited, even an illiterate could be a Jew. But entirely different living conditions prevail in America. Here, if a person grows up illiterate, we can rest assured that he will not be a Jew in our and your opinion, because he did not have the training in a Jewish home that a Jewish child received in the Old Country. Thus, the Hebrew Theological College in Chicago is not a cultural luxury, but is rather an elementary necessity for the development of a Jewish environment in this large and powerful Jewish community. It is, therefore, the duty of every Orthodox synagogue in Chicago, whether large or small, to help this institution, which has such a great task.</p>
   <p>We say that every synagogue, without any exceptions, must pledge itself to give an annual contribution to the Hebrew Theological College. The two largest synagogues in the city have established a precedent by setting a good <span class="page-break">\3</span>example for the others. They have pledged to give no less than five hundred dollars a year to this promising institution. Now the other synagogues should show what they can do, and what they are willing to do.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that Congregations [Anshe] Liebawitch, Tiphereth Zion, Kehilath Jacob, and Shaareithora Anshei Maarov, as well as B'nai Moshe and other large synagogues in Chicago, will do their duty. They will give no less than the Congregations Anshe Kneseth Israel and Anshe Sholom have given, but what will the small synagogues do? After all, the majority of the organized Orthodox Jews in Chicago are found in small synagogue organizations. Therefore, we cannot put the full responsibility upon the ten or twelve large synagogues.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, there are more than one hundred Orthodox synagogues, small and large, and the future of the Hebrew Theological College does not depend upon what the few large synagogues do, but upon what the majority of the small synagogues do, because the members of small synagogues constitute the majority of the Chicago Orthodoxy. The small synagogues must not evade <span class="page-break">\4</span>their duty, and we hope that they will keep that in mind.</p>
   <p>We understand that the directors of the Hebrew Theological College have appointed a committee, whose task it is to contact the various synagogues and to urge them to fulfill their duty to this institution. As we understand the situation, it is the duty of this committee, primarily, to contact the small synagogues, because it is practically certain that we will not have to argue much with the representatives of the large synagogues. The latter have helped to build the beautiful edifice and they are already interested in it. The small synagogues, on the other hand, have not, as yet, been attracted to this work and have not yet manifested any interest in this institution, which is as essential for them as it is for the large synagogues. If the Hebrew Theological College is to have the firm support of the Chicago Orthodoxy, it must not be the support of a few large synagogues, but the support of all the synagogues.</p>
   <p>To the Chicago synagogues, whether large or small, we say this: Do your duty. You have an opportunity now to lay a sound and healthy foundation for <span class="page-break">\5</span>traditional Judaism in the second largest Jewish community in the world. If a generation of savants and scholars, of learned rabbis and competent Hebrew teachers is developed, the Chicago Orthodoxy will not only be assured of a future, but also will become a great force in American Jewry. This is the prospect of the immediate future. Let every Orthodox synagogue in Chicago give a decent annual contribution to the Hebrew Theological College, and if the institution develops normally, the future will be safe.</p>
   <p>Two synagogues have already stepped forward, and made unequivocal pledges. What will the other synagogues do?</p>
