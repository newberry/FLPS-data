   <p>The Jewish Courier, will be the title of a new (Jargon) Jewish newspaper to appear on or about December 2, inst., at 422 S. Canal Street, under the auspices of Messrs. L. Zolotkof, I. Segal, and M. Mintz, and will be an organ devoted to politics, literature, and the sciences.</p>
   <p>We understand that the form will be the size of the Occident and for the present will consist of four pages. The leading object of the Courier will be to inform the Russian-Polish citizens of country who are as yet unacquainted with the English language in regard to the history, customs, laws and political systems of our country in the Jargon and thus educate this foreign element in all that relates to the United States. But aside from that object, the Courier will contain foreign and domestic news relating to Jews and Judaism.</p>
