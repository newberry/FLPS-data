   <p>Morris Rosenfeld Theater Benefit, Big Success.</p>
   <p>One of the most successful theater benefits took place last evening, at the International Theater, where Mr. Glickman and his troupe of actors, played the Jewish "King Lear." The theater was packed with a highly intelligent audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Hurwitz, Mr. A. Heller, Mr. Titus, Mr. Edelman, and others of the Arrangement Committee thanked the public for responding to this benefit, as it was for the worthy cause of raising funds for the assistance of a sick Jewish poet. Mr. Glickman reports a net profit of $600.</p>
   <p>A number of compliments were paid Mr. Glickman by the company of actors, for the way Mr. Glickman handled the affair, bringing it to such a successful conclusion. There was a letter with many thanks from Mr. Heller, expressing <span class="page-break">\2</span>his appreciation for the interest Mr. Rosenfeld, and the Chicago Jewish public have taken in his present condition. He also espressed his great hope that he will soon sing again for his lonely exiled people.</p>
