   <p>Dear Editor: The question of the old-fashioned school, that I raised in the issue of the Courier of January 3, is of such importance to us Orthodox Jews, that once more I must ask your permission to use the columns of your newspaper. I wish to reply to my critic, Mr. Herman, head instructor at the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah, on his article entitled "An Answer To Ger Ve-toshav" [the phrase is used as a pen name, signifying that the author is a resident of Chicago, but a stranger as far as Hebrew politics are concerned]. This article appeared in the Courier on Monday, January 9. I also wish to touch upon some points that I overlooked in my previous article. Once more I wish to emphasize the fact that I do not want to discredit this or that institution, or this or that teacher. My motives are honest and my intentions are to discuss the entire question of a religious, Hebrew education in America from every possible angle, to arouse the interest of the Orthodox public in that question and to create a public opinion in favor of a general improvement of the education of our children so that they won't grow up to be ignoramuses, <span class="page-break">\2</span>assimilators, and anti-Semites.</p>
   <p>Your reply to me, Mr. Herman, contains a few puns and some witty comments--to obscure the real issue by throwing dust in the eyes. You also point your heavy cannon at me, which, you claim, are capable of shooting a great distance. You do not seem to understand that no problem can be solved with phrases and witty remarks; you need facts. Your cannon are so rusty that they backfire at you.</p>
   <p>1) You state that Ivrith Be-Ivrith [teaching system in Hebrew schools: Hebrew subject matter explained in Hebrew] is no good at all, because in the Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs of Chicago, they do not teach the Pentateuch, and because the children who have studied in such Talmud Torahs cannot even read a simple prayer, such as "Blessed be He Who said". As proof of your contention, you state that some children who studied for a few years in "the best and most popular Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torah in Chicago" were brought to you for "correction" because they could not even recite a simple prayer. Well, it is not my duty to take under my protection the Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs of <span class="page-break">\3</span>Chicago (not even the best and most popular). In those institutions, many faults are being corrected, many things are being improved. In any case, they are young institutions in the process of development, and they are not deaf to any constructive suggestion from anyone to whom Jewish education is dear.</p>
   <p>As a very frequent visitor to the Chicago Talmud Torahs, I must declare here openly that your statement about the Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs of Chicago is false. The Pentateuch and the Prophets are taught there, more thoroughly than they are taught at your school, Mr. Herman. The children are taught and know the simple prayers. The management does not depend upon God's miracles and it is not "certain that when the children graduate from the Talmud Torah, they will know Hebrew, Hebrew literature, history, and folk tales"; that is why the children are taught these subjects. The doors of those Talmud Torahs are open for you as well as for me--visit them a few times. You will find in those schools quite a number of students who have studied and know the entire Pentateuch, most of the Prophets; who speak and write a very fine Hebrew, who have studied and know Jewish history and folk tales, who can read not only a simple prayer, but also <span class="page-break">\4</span>the writers Mendele, Frishman, Freidberg, Smolenskin.</p>
   <p>You will also find classes there for very young children. They study the Pentateuch, and they can read, write, and speak Hebrew well. They can tell beautiful stories, in Hebrew, about Rabbi Johanan ben Zakay, Rabbi Akivah, Bar Kokhba,and so on. Do not look surprised, Mr. Herman! You ought to know that all subjects in those schools are taught in Hebrew, and only in Hebrew! Even some of the commands of the Bible like "Thou shall not eat any offal" are taught in Hebrew. Please listen to me, Mr. Herman! Take a walk, once or twice, from one Talmud Torah to a second, a third--honestly, you will not regret it. You will find out that everything I write here is true. You will also be surprised to find quite a number of children that have been brought from your Talmud Torah for "correction" because they did not know the Pentateuch and could not read a simple prayer.</p>
   <p>2) You, Mr. Herman, claim that the child is taught Hebrew while he is learning the Pentateuch in Hebrew. This is not true, Mr. Herman. Studying the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Pentateuch in Hebrew does not mean studying the Hebrew language, just as studying arithmetic in an English textbook does not mean studying English; this is even more true when the English words of the arithmetic text are translated into a language which is not understood, which is the case at your school, with reference to the study of the Pentateuch.</p>
   <p>3) You write, Mr. Herman, that "The Pentateuch should be taught in a Jewish translation. Do you know why? It is because in the Pentateuch, the child sees written, in black and white, "Thou shall not eat any offal," and then he understands why his father is interested in Kosher food; because in the Pentateuch it is written (again in black and white), "Thou shall eat and bless the Lord thy God," "Thou shall not eat leavened bread," and so on. Well, Mr. Herman, don't you think this is funny? Because it is written in the Pentateuch, in black and white, "Thou shall not eat any offal," we have to translate this sentence to the child in Jewish, a language (I must stress that point) he neither understands nor respects. Do you think that if he is taught the same thing in Hebrew he will be unable to understand why his father <span class="page-break">\6</span>is interested in kosher food? If he is taught, "Thou shall eat and bless the Lord" in Hebrew, do you think the child will not know that he has to say grace after eating?</p>
   <p>4) You write that "if the Orthodox Jews waited to teach the Pentateuch until the child knew Hebrew, they would have to wait until doomsday". Well, I will advise you again to visit a "Hebrew through Hebrew" Talmud Torah a few times. You will then find out that in most cases they begin to teach the Pentateuch eight or nine months after the child begins to study the alphabet; in other words, in eight or nine months, the child acquires a sufficient knowledge of Hebrew to begin the study of the Pentateuch without any translations.</p>
   <p>5) You write that "it is true that when the child begins to study the Pentateuch in Hebrew, which is translated into Yiddish, he does not know any Yiddish, but when he graduates from the Talmud Torah, he knows Yiddish thoroughly". For goodness sake, Mr. Herman, use a little logic! If I can teach a child to understand Yiddish, by translating a Hebrew text into <span class="page-break">\7</span>Yiddish, can't I teach him to understand Hebrew, so that he can learn all of his Hebrew studies without any translations, if I go about it in a systematic, gradual way?</p>
   <p>6) You write that "as long as the American-Jewish press is written in Yiddish, as long as we have in America Orthodox Jews who speak no language but Yiddish, as long as our rabbis deliver their speeches in Yiddish, as long as parents desire that their children shall not discard Judaism and shall not become estranged from them--just so long will we teach the Pentateuch and only the Pentateuch in a Yiddish translation in our Talmud Torah, which was founded and is maintained by our Orthodox Jews". Do you know, Mr. Herman, this is somewhat of an insolence on your part? Your statement is a libel against the Orthodox rabbis and against the Orthodox Jews. I may be, according to your words, "a stranger in regard to Jewish education in America," but I am sufficiently a "resident" to know that during the last five years, one hundred and forty-two Talmud Torahs in America gave up the system of teaching the Pentateuch in a Yiddish translation and changed to the "Hebrew through Hebrew" system.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Everything is taught in those institutions by that system: the Pentateuch, Prophets, Hebrew, history, folk tales. All of these one hundred and forty-two Talmud Torahs were founded and are maintained by Orthodox communities under the leadership of learned rabbis. Do you know why those Talmud Torahs discarded the old method of teaching the Pentateuch only in a Yiddish translation? They did so because the rabbis and the communities realized that a child who has been taught the Pentateuch only in a Yiddish translation (which he does not understand), and a little bit of Hebrew, cannot become a good Jew. Let me tell you a "secret," Mr. Herman; the Mizrachi, at the head of which there are great, learned rabbis (among them are some of our own, Chicago rabbis) keeps up a teachers' seminary where Hebrew teachers are trained in the "Hebrew through Hebrew" system. Those teachers, when they graduate from the seminary, will teach the little children of America in the "Hebrew through Hebrew" system, whether you like it or not. And did you know that this teachers' seminary, founded by the Mizrachi, is maintained by synagogue Jews?</p>
   <p>You speak about children not being estranged from their parents, and that is <span class="page-break">\9</span>why you want to teach them the Pentateuch in Yiddish, although they do not understand Yiddish. This is a job for the politicians of the Workmen's Circle and for the pseudo-socialist comrades. They need a beggat's sack. They have discovered that they have to found Workmen's Circle Schools to teach American children Socialism in Yiddish, so that they won't become estranged from their parents. But we, the Orthodox Jews! We know that their remedy is not a remedy but poison. We, Orthodox Jews, have a true way of keeping our children, of preventing them from becoming estranged from their parents and their people. Our remedy is: teach our children a great deal of the Torah, a great deal of Hebrew, Hebrew literature, Jewish history and folk tales. But in order that our children may learn and know all those studies we have to install in our Talmud Torahs the "Hebrew through Hebrew" system.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Ger Ve-Toshav.</p>
