   <p>A Jewish woman of Chicago, a mother of two grown children, is now being admired by the greatest sculptors of the land for her wonderful achievement.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Elizabeth Nathanson, who is widely known in many art circles of Chicago, as a great critic and lover of art, has perfected the art of sculpture by inventing a natural mask, revealing the exact features of a person accurately and permanently.</p>
   <p>She practiced on her own daughter, Pauline, who acted as her mother's model. Mrs. Nathanson brought plaster and other necessary materials and began working with trembling hands on the beautiful face of her daughter. And after applying her entire knowledge thereto, the mask was made.</p>

   <p>At first, famous sculptors of Chicago, were astonished by the work of Mrs. Nathanson. It later became very popular among the wealthy class. Beginning with Mayor Dever and ending with the multi-millionaire, Harold McCormick, and his wife, (Mrs.) Ganna Wolska..........everybody soon began to desire to have masks made by Mrs. Nathanson.</p>
   <p>However, the Jewish sculptress ignores everything. It is too dear to her for commercial purposes. She views it only from an artistic stand point.</p>
