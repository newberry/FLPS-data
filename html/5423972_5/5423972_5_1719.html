   <p>It is only natural that in a rich home there is available to the housewife every conceivable ingredient for preparing a good meal.</p>
   <p>In a poor home, where even the bare necessities of life are lacking, the opposite holds true. To demand of a poor housewife an excellent and tasty meal would be ridiculous and shameful.</p>
   <p>The above is in direct contrast to the Jewish Community in Chicago, in which over thirty thousand children are in need of a Jewish education. Ten per cent of these children receive a very limited Jewish education in Talmud Torahs and other private or semi-private schools, while ninety per cent receive no Jewish education at all, and may be considered literally "dead" from a Jewish national and religious standpoint. They are dying of hunger, "not for the lack of bread, but for lack of the word of God." Despite this fact, all we hear are lengthy discussions concerning the ingredients needed for a meal which we haven't got.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Common sense should tell us that instead of wasting time in methodology, it would be much better to teach the children at least something that will be of general benefit.</p>
   <p>The main 'rift' at present is that between Yiddishists and Hebrewists. One would have to be an ignoramus to overlook the irony of the situation.</p>
   <p>Take for example the dispute going on at John Smythe school, on the North West Side, between the Yiddish and Hebrew elements. The former demands that education be in Yiddish, not in Hebrew; the latter that it be in Hebrew, not in Yiddish. The victims of this dissension are several hundred of the thirty thousand Jewish children in Chicago.</p>
   <p>If the Yiddishists and Hebrewists are really in earnest when they emphasize the need of a sound Jewish education, then why should all the above language bickerings exist? On the North West Side thousands of Jewish children have received no education in either language. On the West Side thousands could receive a Jewish education, for, regardless of which system is taught, the <span class="page-break">\3</span>result would be the same and thousands of Jewish children would grow up with a full knowledge of Jewish history, ethics, dogmas, and understanding. The fact that one group receives its education in Hebrew and the other in Yiddish, does not hurt or affect the main purpose. As adults both groups will be able to unite and choose to their satisfaction the language to be used in the Talmud Torahs and schools that they will establish.</p>
   <p>Order and method are very good things, but not the kind of order of a Russian official, in a small town, who did not permit the fire to be extinguished, even if the town were burned, until he could find the correct system.</p>
   <p>All over the world, throughout the long exile to which Jews were forced for centuries past, each little Jewish community considered itself an authority in Jewish matters, expecting all others to follow its lead. This trait is also found in Chicago, among the various societies of old country settlers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The education of Jews in Chicago should be governed by a general educational system capable of embracing all Jews, those from Budapest as well as those from Berlin, Russia, Vilna, Arabia, and Saloniki, etc. It is necessary to find a common Yiddish or Hebrew, understandable to all. The desired result is that the older generation, the refugees from all four corners of the earth, live in peace and harmony among our own numerous established congregations, each representing the locality from which they came, with the hope that our children in Chicago, at a future date, will be in a position to unite these small congregations into one large community.</p>
   <p>How many dialects have there been throughout the centuries? Josephus Flavius, Emil G. Hirsh, Mimonidies, Gretz, and countless others of historic fame have each used his own provincial dialect.</p>
   <p>Dialect is just a word; they do not exist. The Englishman of today could hardly understand the English used several centuries ago. The same applies to the German, French, and all other languages.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>In the meantime, there is only one method for educating Jewish children in Chicago: whosoever has the ability and willingness to teach Jewish children, let him open a school and teach them. Let the community pay the general expenses for the schools and Talmud Torahs, so that when the present generation pass out there will be in its stead a new one more capable of serving the needs of the Jews in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Listen to and learn every language from which you may benefit. And remember, instead of quarreling among the Yiddishists and Hebrewists, let there be unity for the sake and encouragement of our youth and our future.</p>
   <p>P. B.</p>
