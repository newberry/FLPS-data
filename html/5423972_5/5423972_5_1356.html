   <p>The modern person of culture must understand the language of colors, which express the character of persons and things. It is as important to understand a good painting, as it is to understand good literature. The great artists stand on the same pedestal as great masters of literature.</p>
   <p>If you wish to have a complete cultural education bear in mind that it can not be complete without a knowledge of art. If you are skilled in art, it is possible that you have a natural talent which can be developed.</p>
   <p>If you are interested in Art, register in the art classes, that are being opened by the Worker's Circle League under the direction of S. Astrowsky. You can register any evening from 8 to 9 O'clock at 1224 South Albany Avenue.</p>
