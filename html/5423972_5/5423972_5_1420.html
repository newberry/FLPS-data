   <p>An interesting discussion is taking place in the pages of the Courier concerning the old-fashioned Heder and the modern system [of teaching]. As one to whom the Hebrew language is dear, and as one who has been a teacher in the old country, I would like to express my opinion on this subject, without being partial to either side. I do not defend anyone, nor do I accuse anyone.</p>
   <p>The Ivrith Be-Ivrith system [Hebrew subject matter explained in Hebrew] is as good as any other system, and the claim of its opponents that it is not, is unjustifiable. There is no need to relate here the virtues of the old-fashioned Heder [Old World type of Hebrew school]. We all know what a Heder is. Everyone of us who knows how to read Hebrew has, at one time or another, studied in the old-fashioned Heder.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This is the problem; which system is the most practical under the present circumstances? Which system offers the child better instruction in Judaism and Hebrew--Ivrith Be-Ivrith or Ivrith Be-Yiddish [Hebrew subject matter explained in Yiddish].</p>
   <p>First of all, let me say a few words about conditions in the old country, as compared with America. In the old country, the older and the middle-aged people knew and spoke Yiddish; this is similarly true here. The younger generation, those from fifteen or sixteen years of age up to twenty-five or twenty-six, know how to speak Yiddish but seldom do. As for the children up to fifteen or sixteen years of age, some of them know and speak a fine Yiddish; some speak very little Yiddish, but everyone of them hears everyday Yiddish spoken around him,and, naturally, he understands the language very well.</p>
   <p>There is no need for me to tell anyone that in hundreds, in thousands of Jewish families, the father or the mother speaks to the children in Yiddish, but the children reply in English (or Russian or German). This proves that though the <span class="page-break">\3</span>children do not speak Yiddish, they understand it. It is quite true that there are a number of children who do not understand Yiddish at all. Those children come from the families of the German Jews, the assimilators, the Reform Jews, who aren't particularly interested in Judaism in general, and still less in Jewish "education."</p>
   <p>So far as Jewish education is concerned: The parents who send their children to a heder and the parents who send their children to a Ivrith Be-Ivrith school, are all ordinary Jews. When they are out, they may speak various languages, but at home, among themselves, they speak Yiddish, and a very idiomatic Yiddish at that. Such a typically Yiddish expression as "Layg Sich Kein Fogelach in Buzim" [Translator's note: Do not put birdies in a broom. This expression means"do not delude yourself"] are heard quite frequently at their homes. The children, American-born, hearing such expressions often, come to know their meaning. It is, therefore, unfair to the American-Jewish child to say that he does not speak Yiddish, or that he does not understand Yiddish.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>So far as the system of teaching is concerned: If the child is among people who speak Yiddish at home, and if the child speaks or understands Yiddish, then why all the fuss about teaching a child Hebrew through a Yiddish translation? If, occasionally, there is no Yiddish word to convey the exact meaning of the Hebrew word, there is no harm done if an English word is substituted for the Yiddish one.</p>
   <p>Ivrith Be-Ivrith is a good system, as I have mentioned above. But where do they speak Hebrew in this country? How can a child develop his knowledge of Hebrew when he hears the people around him speak every language in the world except Hebrew? At home he hears English and Yiddish, the same is true on the streets; nowhere does he hear a word of Hebrew spoken. Under such conditions, is there any sense to his speaking Hebrew? They teach classical Hebrew, literary Hebrew, in the Ivrith Be-Ivrith school. The child is able to tell a story in Hebrew that he has read in a book. He will tell it in the language of the book, not in the living, fluid language of the street. He cannot do otherwise. He has nobody to talk to, nobody to converse with, nobody from whom he can hear something <span class="page-break">\5</span>new. Such a child cannot develop. To develop, a child has to ask questions. If he is surrounded by barriers and cannot ask any questions he remains a dull-witted boy. Ivrith Be-Ivrith is a good system, but not in this country, where nobody speaks Hebrew.</p>
   <p>Those who have attended high school or college are acquainted with the system of teaching foreign languages used here. The writer of these lines has studied a few foreign languages in American schools. The only system used is the "French in English," "German in English," "Latin in English," etc. Sometimes the teachers began to teach "French in French," or "German in German," but after a few attempts, they always came back to the system of teaching in English, i. e., "German in English," "French in English," etc. After studying "French in French," for three years, we could not speak French. This, you inderstand, happened not to little boys, but to grown-up young men, eighteen or twenty years old, who were attending college.</p>
   <p>Consider one thing more: Question any greenhorn who has recently arrived from Europe, and who is attending night school. Ask him how he likes the "English <span class="page-break">\6</span>in English" system and just listen to what he tells you. From my own experience, I know that I have cursed myself when I had to go to school. I just sat and stared at the teacher, while a torrent of words, none of which could I understand, rushed out of her mouth. I was bored the whole evening. I went home, my spirits were low, and I cursed Columbus. I would think: Why don't they introduce in the night schools, where the greenhorns study, the system of teaching "English in Russian," "English in Yiddish," English in Italian," etc.? I learned the English language not through the "English in English" system, but on the street, in the shop, by translating "English into Yiddish" and "English into Russian."</p>
   <p>In conclusion, let me ask this question: Where did all those who now advocate the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system learn the Hebrew language? Did they learn it in an ordinary Heder or in a Ivrith Be-Ivrith school? Where did our great men, our geniuses, of the past and present, like Mendele, Sholom Aleichem, Peretz, Slonimsky, Mapo, Smolenskin, Frishman, Ahad Ha-am, study Hebrew? They all studied in the old-fashioned Heder, and sometimes at the seminary. But where <span class="page-break">\7</span>are the great men who studied in the Ivrith Be-Ivrith schools?</p>
   <p>The situation is like this: One who knows Hebrew may, sometimes, be able to speak it. But, if one occasionally speaks Hebrew, it does not necessarily mean that one knows Hebrew. A child forgets quickly the little Hebrew that he learned, because there is nobody to whom he can speak Hebrew.</p>
