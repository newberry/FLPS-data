   <p>The literary contest inaugurated by the English department of the Daily Jewish Courier is in full swing. Those who are ready and willing to participate in the contest will certainly be interested in the list of subjects for essays and short stories published in today's Courier. Ambitious young men and women, with scholarly or literary inclinations will do their best to say it in an original, striking manner.</p>
   <p>A good essay does not consist of an enumeration of ideas and thoughts, but it consists of style, plus ideas. The contents of an essay, of course, are very important, but the style, the composition, how one expresses a certain thought or a certain idea, is as of much importance as the contents. Good style is first of all directness, then immediacy of expression and clearness of thought.</p>
   <p>The list of subjects for the essays published in today's Courier are so <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>varied that they may appeal to, and inspire, young men and young women of different temperaments, and of different interests in life. We Jews are not only an individualistic people, but also an individualized people, and only the Jew Heinrich Heine could say that every grave is a world's history of its own. Every Jew or Jewess has his or her own specific literary interest, has his or her own literary and artistic inclinations. It is with this thought in mind that we have deemed it advisable to widen the scope of our literary contest, by giving wide variety to the list of subjects.</p>
   <p>The same holds good of the list of subjects for fiction and poetry. They are apt to kindle the fantasy of young men and young women of different temperaments.</p>
   <p>To those who are ready to participate in the contest, we wish to say: Don't go out of your way while writing an essay or a short story. Use simple language, and be sure that the premises are right, that your starting point <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is logical, and that the conclusions at which you arrive tally with your starting point. The essays should not be of a technical nature and should not be scholarly in character. They should not consist of a compilation of extracts from books or from encyclopedias, but of a composition of the personal thoughts of the author, on the respective subjects. Therein lies the literary and educational value of an essay. The essays are not meant to be academic papers, but they are meant to be literary essays, thoughtful and beautiful at the same time.</p>
   <p>To those who mean to try their expression in poetry, we have no advice to offer, for even the technique of poetry cannot be acquired. It is innate and inborn. But to those who mean to test their ability as short-story writers, we wish to point out that the short story is not a sketch, and that they should always be aware of the difference between a sketch and a short story. A sketch may be a description of a person or of a situation, etc. A short story, however, is more than that. Just as it requires two to make a matrimonial match, so does it require two for the make-up of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>a good short story. There must be some sort of a conflict described, and those who are involved in the conflict must be visible figures and not ghosts. In short, character portraying plus description of a conflict are the component parts of a short story. There is a certain short story technique that can be acquired and developed, but as a rule, short story writers develop their own technique, and unless one has no literary experience at all and has not read very much either, it is not necessary to offer him or her advice regarding the technique of short-story writing.</p>
   <p>We urge all Jewish young men and young women with literary ambitions and ability to participate in this contest, because it may prove to be a good starting point in their literary careers, and it may give them encouragement to concentrate on their literary work and to enter the literary profession. We can assure the contestants that the opinion or the verdict of the judges will be absolutely impartial, and that all the participants in the contest will have an equal opportunity to get both prizes and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>credit for their work, and to embark eventually upon a literary career in life.</p>
