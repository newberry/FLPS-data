   <p>One of the outstanding features of the grandios art-evening, which is being arranged by the Workers Circle League, Tuesday, October 17, in Glickman's Palace Theater, will be an oratorio by the noted composer and conductor, Peretz Lemkoff.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lemkoff had written this oratorio from a poem bearing the title "Lonesome" by the famous musician, Solomon Golub. Famous music critics praise Mr. Lemkoff's composition very highly. This oratorio evokes memories of childhood and awakens the deep but unattainable desire to become once again a free unconcerned child. Eight voices will sing this oratorio: Jack Amado, Max Brodsky, George Smith, J. Henderson, Ellen Golden, Mrs. Yeta Tolchin and others.</p>
   <p>Besides this oratorio, two literary one-act dramas will be presented and also a musical program of opera arias and Jewish folk-songs</p>
