   <p>Heard and Seen.</p>
   <p>The heavy rain last night did not prevent the Hebrew Literary Society ball from being a great success. Mr. Max Schulman and his sister led the spectacular march (grand) of two hundred young couples. This was undoubtedly the most beautiful grand march the Jewish people of Chicago have ever witnessed.</p>
   <p>The ball of the Hebrew Literary Society was a big success, financially and socially. The dancers spent a most enjoyable evening and those who did not dance passed their time indulging in a few glasses of carmel wine and other good drinks. When the clock struck three, the crowds departed, feeling that it had been worth while to spend the evening with the Hebrew Literary Society.</p>
