   <p>Chicago Jews will soon have an opportunity to see Jewish art work of the Bezalel school in Jerusalem. Mr. Nathan D. Kaplan, Grand Master of the Order Knights of Zion- announces that he has made all necessary arrangements for the original Jewish art exhibition.</p>
   <p>The exhibition will be held at the Douglas Park Auditorium from Feb. 11th to Feb. 16th. The exhibition will be closed all day Saturday.</p>
   <p>Professor Boris Shatz, the founder of the Bezalel school, is now making a tour in America where he thus far has been very successful wherever he has displayed for the first time genuine Jewish works of art from the only Jewish school of art in Jerusalem.</p>

   <p>In New York and other large cities where the public already has had the opportunity to see the exhibition, the inspiration was great. Every where it aroused wonder and interest in the great progress that Jewish artists have made. In Chicago, America's second largest city, Professor Shatz expects the same success as in New York.</p>
