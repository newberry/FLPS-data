   <p>Immediately upon the heels of the Institute players guild definite success with Molnars Liliom comes the announcement that Bernard Shaws outstanding comedy Arms And The Man, will be produced December 1. When the guild announced its plans during the opening weeks of the season, there was much comment at the ambitious program of the players group.</p>
   <p>Never had any organization definitely planned a new production every month of an outstanding play. But the large playing organization of the guild with it excellent theatre equipment places it in a position whereby big things can not only be planned, but accomplished.</p>
   <p>In choosing Arms And The Man, the Institute Players Guild seizes the Irish dramatist's most outstanding comedy. Thavian to the final line, it has a plot development that keeps an audience in continuous laughter throughout the play.</p>

   <p>Arms And The Man, needs little introduction to followers of what is best inthe theatre and foremost in dramatic Literature.</p>
   <p>It presents an anti-romantic satire interlarded with dialogue that fairly scintillates with good fun. When done in London, the Illustrated London News said of it, "There is more thought, more wit, more accomplishment inthis play than any piece before the Boards." Again referring to the files of newspaper acclaim, the Athenaeum, (famed London paper), said, "Shaws comedy,after being kept out of sight formany years, is now revealed to usas a classic."</p>
   <p>Arms And The Man, is actually chock full of wit and good humor. The story of the soldier of fortune who seeks relief from capture in a Bulgarian lady's bed chamber and in so doing upsets a sham-romantic romance is as modern today as it ever was. In fact, the piece could have well been written in this modern day. The Guild Company has a well selected cast and rehearsals for the play are progressing rapidly.</p>
