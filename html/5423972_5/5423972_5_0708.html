   <p>Several of the prominent and well-to-do Jews in Chicago have started a movement which is still in progress, to organize a society to be named Yehoish Literary Group. The purpose of this body will be to translate into English, in complete or partial form the poetry of the famous Jewish poet, Yehoish (Blumgarten), in order to acquaint the English speaking public with his great literary works. A meeting will be called shortly, the group will be fully organized, and a definite program will be formulated and put into reality. We, on our part, congratulate this novel undertaking. From our brief acquaintance with this group, we can say that they are not merely trying to advertise themselves, but are actually willing to spend money and labor to put this plan in action. Yehoish is the only Jewish poet who has never made a living from his poetry. The translations of his works into English would be the only reward the Jews could give him.</p>
