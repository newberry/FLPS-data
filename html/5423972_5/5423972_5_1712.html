   <p>With becoming ceremonies, the new Hebrew school for girls opened Sunday in the Anshe Knesis Israel Congregation. A large crowd came to greet the opening of this school in the Douglas Park District. In an elegant discourse, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein explained the principles and objectives of the new school. Rabbi Katkow and Dr. A. Levinson stressed the necessity of founding such schools in all localities of the city, where Jewish daughters will be brought up in a real Jewish atmosphere.</p>
   <p>The parents have expressed their desire to maintain and support such schools. More than two hundred children have already been registered, which is practically as many children as space will permit.</p>
   <p>The school is under the supervision of Miss Anna Goldberg, who has devoted many years to this field.</p>
