   <p>The Maccabee Yiddish schools on the West Side and on the Northwest Side have been united. Both are now under the supervision of the Society for the Yiddish Folk Schools. From now on, the West Side school will be called the Sholem Aleichem Folk School. On August 5, a third school will be opened in the Lawndale district: the Peretz Folk school.</p>
