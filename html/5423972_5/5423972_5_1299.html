   <p>The Chicago Jewish community can congratulate itself upon the establishment of the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary in conjunction with the Hebrew Theological College, of which Rabbi Saul Silber is president. The Hebrew Theological College is to train not only rabbis and scholars but also modern Hebrew teachers because there is actually a crying need for more Hebrew teachers in the entire Middle West. Many a minor Jewish community cannot open a Hebrew school because it cannot get a trained Hebrew teacher to run it, and the result is that hundreds of Jewish children in the minor communities grow up without any Jewish education whatsoever. A Hebrew Teachers' Seminary in Chicago will solve the problem of Hebrew teachers not only for Chicago but for the entire Middle West. For this reason the Jewish communities around Chicago are in honor bound to come to the aid of the newly established institution, and we hope that they will support it, for it <span class="page-break">\2</span>serves their interests as much as it serves the interests of the Chicago Jewish community.</p>
   <p>Our readers will be interested to learn that the new branch of the Hebrew Theological College, the Teachers' Seminary, will train teachers of both sexes. For the time being seventeen boys and thirteen girls have applied for admission, and they will all be admitted because they can satisfy all the scholarly requirements of the institution. Those who have applied for admission have received a good elementary Hebrew training, and in many instances are already thorough Hebraists. It is noteworthy that the girl applicants, mostly born and bred in Chicago, can pass the test with the same ease as the boys. The girl applicants speak Hebrew fluently and have a good mastery of the difficult Hebrew grammar. They are also well versed in modern Hebrew literature. We wish that the graduates of the Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati would know as much Hebrew as these little girls of the Chicago Hebrew Teachers' Seminary who are just embarking upon a Hebrew teacher's career.</p>

   <p>We believe that after the lapse of four or five years the Chicago Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will produce a class of teachers of whom the community will be proud. The program calls for a five years' course, and we are convinced that the teachers to be trained by this seminary will be perfect Hebrew scholars and a good type of teachers. It should be borne in mind that all the students of the seminary are permeated with a spirit of true idealism, that they are not only able but also industrious because they want to acquire as much knowledge as possible, and in five years one can learn a great deal.</p>
   <p>Those who will graduate from the Chicago Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will have not only a thorough knowledge of Hebrew but they will be familiar with all the branches of Jewish learning, Jewish history, history of Hebrew literature, Jewish religious philosoply, Jewish theology, Jewish liturgy, Jewish life in the various lands, and so forth. Such teachers will make a success in life and will render the greatest service to the cause of Jewish education in this country. These teachers will be <span class="page-break">\4</span>truly American Hebrew teachers.</p>
   <p>We hope that the community will understand the importance of this institution and will maintain it in a dignified manner. We do not underestimate the importance of the two other branches of the Hebrew Theological College, but we beg to submit that for all practical intents and purposes the Teachers' Seminary is the most important branch of the great institution, because it is the teacher who is shaping the character of a Jewish generation and without Hebrew teachers or with poor Hebrew teachers the activities of the rabbis will be of no avail.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the president of the Hebrew Theological College, Rabbi Saul Silber, upon the first great success of his administration, marked by the opening of the Teachers' Seminary and we hope that he will still go from strength to strength in developing the College and in making it the center of Jewish learning and Jewish education in the Middle West.</p>
