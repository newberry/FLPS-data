   <p>Chicago Jewish Theater lovers were in a very good mood yesterday evening when they gave a hearty and stormy reception to Mr. Morris Schwarts and his artistic troupe.</p>
   <p>Schwarts and his art company played Sholom Ash's play, "Uncle Moses."</p>
   <p>"Uncle Moses" is a comedy of Jewish life in America. It is highly dramatic and exceedingly romantic. Exquisite folk scenes of the life of Jewish workers are beautifully depicted by the players.</p>
   <p>The public has accepted this drama with much excitement.</p>
   <p>"Uncle Moses" will be played Saturday and Sunday.</p>
