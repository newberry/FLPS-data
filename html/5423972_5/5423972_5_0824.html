   <p>In the year 5684 since the creation of the world [i.e., 1924], Israel Zangwill, a great and celebrated man, came to Chicago. Sometimes he, like all great and celebrated men, gives his approval to certain spiritual things. In the same year of 5684 since the creation of the world, the "Bintel" newspaper, now known as the "Fordward" [two terms of derision applied by Courier to Forward], made a deal with Henry Ford of the kind known as "scratch my back and I will scratch yours". Henry Ford began to advertise in the "Fordward" and the "Fordward" began to pat him on the back, picturing him as an innocent lamb, led astray by bad men.</p>
   <p>Jewish public opinion in America became aroused and sharp protests began to be expressed against a Jewish newspaper making a deal with the leader of <span class="page-break">\2</span>international anti-Semitism. The "Fordward" felt itself to be in a predicament. What excuse could it give for its criminal act--socialism, love of humanity, proletarian moral, class struggle, Jewish honor?</p>
   <p>The situation was bad. The "Fordward" could neither admit that it was wrong nor could it give up the receipt of the fat Ford checks. The men connected with the "Fordward" had an inspiration: get the approval of a great man. If a celebrated Jew would say that it was permissible to take ads from Ford, then everything would be all right. This idea, however, had one serious drawback: all the leaders of American Jewry strongly condemned the Ford-"Fordward" deal. It was, therefore, necessary to get the approval of a great non-American Jew. Israel Zangwill's arrival in Chicago looked to the "Fordward" like an opportunity sent from heaven. Zangwill is a celebrated Jewish leader, a good Jew, a Zionist, and a nationalist. His approval would carry weight.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>A "Fordward hunt for the man began as soon as he arrived in Chicago. The "Fordward" wanted to get him into its office; they wanted to explain everything to him, get a statement from him, monopolize him, arrange lectures for him. The scheme was a simple one. Zangwill is a stranger in America. He is a friend of the Jewish people. It would not be difficult for the "Fordward" to monopolize him. The "Fordward" boys, however, made their plans without considering hat the boss had to say about them, and the boss in this case was J. Loebner.</p>
   <p>J. Loebner disappeared from the world for ten days and became a shadow; he snadowed Zangwill. Wherever Israel Zangwill went, Loebner went. The days in Chicago were dark and cold. The sky looked like a great, gray sack. People could not imagine what the sun looked like. In those days, Zangwill, the poet, believed that the sun was shining in Chicago because in front of him and behind him, there was a shadow. This shadow was none other than our J. Loebner who deemed it his duty to prevent an honest man from being <span class="page-break">\4</span>besmirched.</p>
   <p>"What do you think of a Jewish newspaper," asked J. Loebner of Mr. Zangwill, "which accepts advertisements from Henry Ford and pats the anti-Semitic leader on the back?" Zangwill did not even take two seconds' thought before giving his opinion: "Such a newspaper is a blackguard." In this way, the Jewish press in America immediately found out what Mr. Zangwill thought about the "Fordward".</p>
   <p>This, by the way, happened before the "Fordward" men had a chance to ask Mr. Zangwill for an approval of their policy. Our pseudosocialist brethren, however, did not lose heart. Well, they thought, if we cannot get Mr. Zangwill to give us his approval, let us, at least, show the world that he is a good friend of ours, gives lectures for us, attends our banquets, participates in our undertakings, in short, treats us as representatives of the people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Suddenly there sprang up in Chicago a great many Jewish culture societies, culture leagues, culture associations, and women's culture associations. One would think that Chicago was swimming in an ocean of Jewish culture. All of these culture associations, culture leagues, and culture societies, bombarded Mr. Zangwill with invitations: "Speak to us, lecture before us; here is a check for five hundred dollars, a thousand dollars. We will give you as much as you want, only....." Israel Zangwill invariably replied, "Sure, speak to my friend, Mr. Loebner of the Courier. He arranges everything for me."</p>
   <p>J. Loebner did arrange [everything]. He arranged a lecture at the Hebrew Institute, at the Covenant Club, and so on. He arranged them quietly, without any fuss, without any committees. The culture leagues, culture associations, and culture societies, which are all run by and for the "Fordward," had to apply to Mr. Loebner if they wanted Mr. Zangwill to lecture to them. Mr. Loebner, who had to protect the interests of a great <span class="page-break">\6</span>man and to see that his name was not besmirched, explained the whole situation to Mr. Zangwill, and our great guest was grateful to the good Jew for his advice.</p>
   <p>Our pseudosocialists evidenced signs of great activity. They ran around town, arguing, yelling, hoping that maybe they would succeed in reaching Mr. Zangwill, even for five minutes, so that the next day the "Fordward" could brag that Mr. Zangwill had visited its office, that he was friendly to it, and so on.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zangwill was close to the "Fordward" office several times. He was at the Palace Theater, he visited the office of the Courier, he visited relatives on the West Side, but he did not visit the office of the "Fordward".</p>
   <p>There was a tense moment when Mr. Zangwill found himself surrounded by the "Fordward" boys while he was at Glickman's Palace Theater. It seemed as <span class="page-break">\7</span>though there was no way for him to escape. How could he, when he was surrounded on all sides? There was a joyous sparkle in the eyes of our pseudosocialists. At last! Suddenly, J. Loebner appeared, grabbed Mr. Zangwill by the arm, and they both left for Mr. Rosenwald's residence, in Mr. Rosenwald's big car. Our pseudosocialists felt like crying. Zangwill was within five yards of their office and they did not succeed in getting him to enter it.</p>
   <p>Right after this event, plans for lectures in this or that auditorium, began to be sumitted to Mr. Zangwill. People tried to convince him that he would earn a fortune from the lectures which the pseudosocialists would arrange for him. To all proposals, he invariably replied, "Sure, go and see my friend, Mr. Loebner."</p>
   <p>I have never asked J. Loebner whether the pseudosocialists ever saw him, and what reply he made to them. However, if they did see him, I can imagine <span class="page-break">\8</span>the kind of a reply he would give them, and I can imagine the innumerable curses he received. He had done, however, a good piece of work. He kept Mr. Zangwill from getting a mud bath, he showed himself to possess the talents of a detective, and he prevented the pseudosocialist comrades from laying hands upon Israel Zangwill. He deserves the thanks of the community and of Israel Zangwill for his work.</p>
