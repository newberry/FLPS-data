   <p>They (the gentiles) have schools and we have talmud torahs. They have teachers and we have melamedes (Hebrew word for teacher). They have universities and we have theological seminaries. And yet what a striking difference.</p>
   <p>Their schools are light and our talmud torahs are dark. Their universities are greater, wealthy and are highly respected, and our seminaries are sunk in poverty. Their teachers are well taken care of materially. If they engage a teacher his position is good for life and if one of their <span class="page-break">2</span>teachers becomes ill, aged, or disabled he receives a pension, and among us, even in the city talmud torahs the tenure is valid only for a period of six months, or to be more exact twenty-two weeks. And if a melamed becomes ill, disabled, or aged he is forsaken - the most unfortunate of all unfortunates.</p>
   <p>They, the gentiles, realize that a teacher cannot render his services continuously throughout the twelve months of the year. The mind and body must rest for a brief period so that they might be able to continue their work for many years. But we, the nation of the book, the nation of the wise and learned, know that it is our duty to keep on teaching for ever without a let up. And for holidays, the only days which the talmud torahs are closed, we enforce measures to reduce the melamed's wage. Are we not the nation of the wise and learned?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>And if you think that the gentile teacher worked harder to attain his profession than did the melamed, you are badly mistaken. The melamed devoted a great deal of energy and effort to his profession during his life. He first attended the talmud torah, he studied in the theological seminary, he then spent many years in studying the Talmud in the different synagogues, and then he finally became a melamed. The Jewish melamed is the Jewish professor in the diaspora. It is pitiful that a professor must pedale his merchandise.</p>
   <p>And in reality what do we witness? No other nation in the whole world treats the teacher, who instructs and rears the youth, as badly as we Jews do. We look upon the word "melamed" as an insulting word. Every good-for-nothing among us Jews is called a "melamed" of which one feels even more offended than when called a thief or swindler.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>We, the chosen people, we the teachers of all nations, regard our teachers as the lowest of all beings and detest his profession. Is it surprising then that we are hated by all nations? We are treated by them as we treat our teachers.</p>
   <p>And we ask: Are our teachers really more foolish than all other people? Are our teachers, really the lowest men whom our people possess? We can answer this by saying no, no, and a thousand times no! The melamed is not more naive, nor smarter than any business man. The learned man is only the one who earns a lot of money. A smart man is one who sells his merchandise at a high price. If one can sell tin for silver, copper for gold, cotton for wool, water for brandy he is all right. If one cannot do this, if one cannot be honest, he cannot be a learned man.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Jewish melamed has always contributed more to the Jewish people than he received in turn. The only thing he lacks is the arrogance to demand recognition for his services. Therefore, he is looked upon as is any naive business man who sells his valuable merchandise at a ridiculously low price. It is true that in Europe, also the teacher was poor and his family lived in misery, want, and privation, but neither did the cobbler and the tailor live any better. In America, however, every profession and trade is highly estimated. One may ask: Why should the teaching (Hebrew) profession stand so low and be so under-rated? The melamed works arduously and he earns less than any working man. For this reason alone, he has a lower standard of living than anyone.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The melamed will always be a "melamed" until he will organize and state just demands. And even if he will get no more than what he is entitled to, he will become an independent man, and the epithet "melamed" will become an honorary title.</p>
   <p>And why not? Don your thinking caps for a moment, and picture how our society is governed. We pay a high price for clothes, we do not bargain when buying food, beer, or whisky, we pay our servants more than our incomes allow, we are not parsimonious in a restaurant, we tip our barbers and waiters liberally, we pay the piano teacher whatever he asks for, but when dealing with a melamed we always look for bargains. We become poor and broke upon hiring a melamed for our children.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>There are many well-to-do business men in Chicago who are not ashamed to pay their Jewish teacher a dollar or two a month and, furthermore, they want the melamed to call at their homes to teach a couple of children, for two or three cents a lesson.</p>
   <p>Is it surprising, then, that there are melameds in Chicago who cannot even read a Jewish newspaper? Old and disabled veterans have adopted the title melamed and canvass from house to house with the prayer book. They rear a generation of ignorant and ill-mannered children in the Jewish camp. The father doesn't enterfere; the mother doesn't know anything, she merely wants a bargain, and she and her children are gulled.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Trained teachers must organize themselves. Only those qualified in the profession should be accepted in the organization, and whoever shall be in need of a good teacher will be able to make inquiries at the office of the organization.</p>
   <p>It is an undesirable experience to witness how a melamed is hired at the local talmud torahs. There is no fixed price for his salary. The directors can fix a different price ten different times, but as soon as a teacher is to be hired they begin to bargain. The melameds are interviewed one at a time and at different dates so that they should not know anything about each other. The offices becomes transformed into a market as where fish-wives meet.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Such business transactions are abhorrent. The talmud torahs should agree upon a standard price and stick to it without bargaining. Should the talmud torahs not act now, the teachers will soon take up matters themselves and do their own price fixing.</p>
   <p>And if a teacher is given a contract for a semester, it should be understood that he must be paid for holidays. I know of a case where the directors agreed to pay for Passover and when the teachers were to be paid off they didn't get any money for the holiday......They concede the poor the right to apply for relief....The melameds are brought to infamy and disgrace! It would be more decent and humane to give them their due amount and not treat them as mendicants.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>If we want to glorify the Jewish educational system we must first of all respect the Jewish melamed. If we want to honor the Jewish Torah, we must recognize those who created it. If we want proficient teachers, we must realize the value of Torah.</p>
   <p>The melameds do not want any favors. They demand justice and recognition for their services, and they will get it.</p>
