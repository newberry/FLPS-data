   <p>At last night's meeting of synagogue representatives, which was held in the Waller Street Talmud Torah, a committee of fifteen was elected to devote itself to the task of putting into effect the resolutions passed at Thursday's meeting. The committee will hold a conference today with the architect so that he can change his plans for the construction work on Grenshaw Street.</p>
   <p>This committee will immediately begin to raise the necessary funds to change the Grenshaw Street building into a Talmud Torah [instead of a shelter home as was orginally planned]. All collectors for the building fund are asked to cease collecting money and to bring all their books and receipts to the next meeting , which will be held in the Congregation Anshe Kneseth [Israel], Douglas Boulevard near Homan Avenue. It was also decided that the temporary shelter home on Turner Avenue, which is maintained by the organization that began to build the new shelter home on Grenshaw Street, should no longer accept lodgers.</p>
   <p>From now on, all lodgers will be received only at the Morgan Street Shelter Home. After the meeting last night, all the delegates visited the Morgan Street Shelter Home and they were loud in their praise of the conditions they found there.</p>
