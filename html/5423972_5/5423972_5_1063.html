   <p>A NEW JOURNAL.</p>
   <p>The Sanitorium is a new journal published once every two months, as the "organ of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society."</p>
   <p>Actually it is not merely an organ but a good journal, which should interest every Jew, whether he is a member of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society or not. It would be highly desirable that every Jew receive a copy of each obtainable at a yearly subscription price of twenty-five cents. The Sanitorium is printed in both Yiddish and English for young and old and in the interest of the sponsors of the Denver Sanitorium in Denver, Colorado. The publication has many pictures and interesting articles on the sanitorium and the care of patients at the sanitorium. One will find many Chicago Jews among the list of donors and sponsors.</p>
   <p>While on the subject of publications we would like to remind our reading public of the appearance of a new book, in Chicago, the Jewish Musician.</p>
