   <p>For thousands of years Jewish atheists and foes, who sought to find faults with the Torah of Moses, pointed to a passage that states, "he sets the sins of the father upon the children, and grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to the third or forth generation." The cry arose, - what an unmerciful God to punish the children and grandchildren for the sins of their fathers and grandfathers.</p>
   <p>This was one of the principal arguments against the Torah of Moses, and whosoever it pleased mocked and ridiculed it. Only a few great men, numbered scholars found at all times in all generations, understood the deep meaning of these sacred words of our sublime Torah. They knew that these words are not applied to mean man's sins against God, but man's sins against himself. When a person sins against nature, it means he sins against himself, and that nature will retaliate to reckon even with him, his children and their children until the fourth generation. But those who understood dared not express it because they lived at a time in which ridiculing everything that was holy was in style.</p>

   <p>Only toward the end of the nineteenth century did conscientious thinkers come to this conclusion based on their most careful observations of life. They began to notice that bad habits, drunkenness, and vice in the life of man must eventually show some signs in their children and their children's children. Life has proven that. The studies of the origin of the "degenerates" which are found in every city have furnished the necessary proof. The proof established, it was next necessary to acquaint the people with these facts. And the best method of impression is the stage.</p>
   <p>Henry Ibsen was the first dramatist to bring this great problem upon the stage in his drama, "A Doll's House." But here the only intimation given was in the person of the doctor. Of late the entire world became interested. A movement was begun to agitate these facts openly, to prove how detrimental it was upon children when their fathers or mothers do not know how to care for themselves in sexual matters, especially if one of them is stricken with a venereal disease of which he is in ignorance. Children born of such a marriage suffer from various diseases and rightly deserve the name of "Damaged Children."</p>
   <p>"Damaged Children" is the name of a Jewish drama which deals with this problem. This drama was freely written around the theme of "Damaged Goods," <span class="page-break">3</span>a drama which was presented for a period of several weeks at the Blackstone Theater, and of which a criticism appeared in this newspaper. The drama of "Damaged Children" is being presented today (Thanksgiving), matinee and evening, and Saturday and Sunday evenings, in the Empire Theater at Madison near Halsted. Taking part in this drama are Madame Kennie Liptsen, Mr. Elias Rothstein, Mr. Jacob Cohen, Mr. Katzman, Madame Simon, etc.</p>
   <p>The presentation of this play is something new and different from the usual themes and presentations being shown in the theaters. Madame Liptsen and Mr. Rothstein, at the head of their marvelous company of players, are presenting us types such as are seldom seen, but nevertheless are always present. "Damaged Children" opens the eyes, showing a new world of which we until now had no idea existed: a world which deserves more ardent attention and thought. That is the "Damaged Children" that Madame Liptsen is presenting today at the Empire Theater.</p>
