   <p>The Agudath Ivrith, (Hebrew Literary Society), is an organization for the purpose of spreading the study of the Hebrew language. The organization has club rooms at 332 W. 12th Street. Room #21, where one may find many current Hebrew Newspapers and Journals.</p>
   <p>Every day from 3 to 7 P. M., the Hebrew language is being taught to the small Jewish children in accordance with the latest methods. There is also going to be a Hebrew class for adults, for which we are accepting applications now every evening.</p>
   <p>This Saturday evening, the 23rd of November, we are having at the club a special literary evening. Mr. Haft, will recite and read a few compositions of some noted Jewish Hebrew writers. After this free debates will be in order.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
