   <p>With the opening of a branch office of the Courier on the Northwest Side, a new chapter is started in the history of our community in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In that part of the city, the Courier reaches almost every Jewish home where Yiddish is read and Jewish customs followed, and where it obtains its share of advertisements from the businessmen. The Jews of the Northwest Side, who are active in various fields of public endeavor, are not too lazy to come over to the West Side--to the office of the Courier--to discuss this or that matter and in this manner most things are undertaken and carried out for the benefit of all, with no extra expense to this office.</p>
   <p>The publisher of the Courier, who spares neither effort nor money to make this newspaper an outstanding daily, has undertaken not only to deliver a fine <span class="page-break">\2</span>Courier into their homes, but also to see that the Jewish Northwest Side accomplish for its own benefit and the benefit of the entire Jewish community, more than ever before; that more Jews become interested in the local Jewish institutions; and that everything there that concerns the Jew as a Jew, as a businessman, and as a workingman, shall have space in the Courier.</p>
   <p>The branch office, which is located at 2448 West Division Street, is in the very heart of the Northwest Side Jewish neighborhood, and was placed under the supervision of the well-known David Kenigsberg, an honorable family man, a scholar, and an active businessman.</p>
   <p>The representative of the Courier on the Northwest Side believes in impartiality and punctuality. He promises to investigate all reports, before they leave the branch office for the main office at 1214 South Halsted Street. He invites the representatives of all elements and groups of the Northwest Side Jewish population to visit him in his office for a closer acquaintanceship, with <span class="page-break">\3</span>the promise, that all their good-intentioned and important undertakings--liberal or conservative--will receive from him all necessary attention and support, through the Courier.</p>
   <p>In short, the Courier will do as much for the Northwest Side Jewish social life as it does for other parts of the city.</p>
   <p>If matters of concern to the general public on the Northwest Side were either entirely neglected or improperly carried out, it was because the Jews there lacked a direct connection with the Courier. Now they have this connection. Institutions on the verge of decay will be revived; the flourishing ones will flourish still more and new, important ones will be founded.</p>
   <p>Jewish leaders of the Northside! If you cannot pay a personal visit to your branch office of the Courier to have a talk with Mr. Kenigsberg, do so over the telephone, Humboldt 7510. Also, all those who know of an important happening or any other item of news value, are invited to report it at once to Mr. Kenigsberg. The new branch has the services of the pen of Mr. Kenigsberg <span class="page-break">\4</span>and of other reporters.</p>
   <p>The Courier strives for improvement not only for financial reasons. It has the personal satisfaction of knowing that the Yiddish reader finds rich and instructive material, as well as the latest news items. It, therefore, congratulates the Northwest Side Jews on the opening of their new branch office, and hopes to see them, their institutions, and their movements reach a higher standard and have a wider scope.</p>
   <p>Hanuccah Sunday is for Palestine</p>
   <p>Today is Zionist Flag Day. Several hundred young Jewish girls will march into the streets to sell miniature, beautiful Zion flags for the benefit of the Jewish National Fund; our fair sex will stop every passer-by to pin on them the flag of white and blue, and will expect a nickel, dime or quarter for it. Don't refuse them, give as much as you can.</p>
   <p>Hanuccah is a holiday in which we celebrate the national awakening of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Jews during the time of the Maccabees. In such a time, the conscientious Jew remembers that he also is a member of a nation which at one time owned its own soil, spoke its own language, and conducted its own policies.</p>
   <p>The great world upheaval gave us back our country. It is obvious that the redemption is here. Palestine awaits with open arms to embrace its exiled people.</p>
   <p>Bear in mind, that every cent now going to Palestine is for bread for the Jews there. Work is being created for them on the farms and plantations, and industries are developed by it.</p>
   <p>The National Fund is not an ordinary almsbox, but a "purpose box". This fund is to be used not merely to still the hunger of the individual, but to create a fund for public institutions, to buy ground in Palestine and populate it with Jews to work it and enjoy their labor; the soil can never be resold for <span class="page-break">\6</span>it belongs to the entire Jewish nation.</p>
   <p>As you see, the greatness of the National Fund is not merely temporary, but permanent. Therefore, buy the flag with affection, and pay for it generously. Support the already founded institutions and create new ones.</p>
   <p>[Reorganization of Young Judea Clubs]</p>
   <p>The Young Judea clubs of Chicago are being reorganized. In order to give them real importance, they must have capable leaders. For this purpose, it was arranged with Mr. P. Rudens, a capable and experienced teacher, to give instruction to those who will undertake to direct the clubs. The directors are required to have a high-school education, and a profound knowledge of the Bible.</p>
   <p>The function of the Young Judea clubs is to give a national Jewish education <span class="page-break">\7</span>to our boys and girls who did not have it when they were small. A noble work! It brings back to the Jewish people the past, and their hearts glow with affection at the nation's present tasks and strivings for the future.</p>
   <p>To direct the Young Judea clubs costs money, and it is the duty of every real Jew to help the clubs to function.</p>
