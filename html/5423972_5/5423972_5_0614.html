   <p>On Sunday, February 2, it will be thirty years since the Hevrah Shohare Sefath Aver (The Society of the Revivers of the Hebrew Language) organized itself in Chicago. Thirty years have elapsed since a small group of intellectuals laid the cornerstone of a Jewish cultural center in Chicago where young Jewish men and women who love the Hebrew language can meet and plan ways of spreading the language among the great masses of the Jewish people. Thirty years have passed since a foundation was laid for this Jewish institution whose task it is to disseminate Jewish culture and science among the Jewish people. In the past thirty years the Jewish people have passed through many vicissitudes. Various advocates of various dogmas have appeared on the scene--but there remains no memory of them.....</p>
   <p>Anyone who has his finger on the pulse of the Jewish people knows what the other so-called cultural centers have accomplished. They have aroused confusion in the minds of those intellectuals who change their ideals and attitudes as quickly as dust changes into a storm. They have created spiritual cliques which have seduced the Jewish worker from his race and from his faith, and have made him a victim of nihilism.</p>
   <p>The Hevrah Shohare Sefath Aver, however, well understands that, in order to develop a high morale in a people, the child must receive the proper cultural food. The Hevrah can, therefore, point proudly to the healthy children which it has reared. The followers of other organizations, however, have remained foreign to the Jewish people and foreign to themselves, while we meet former members of the Hevrah Shohare Sefath Aver in all walks of life. They have come to be our present social workers; they take an active part in everything pertaining to Judaism.</p>
   <p>No one can doubt the fact that every Chicago Jew, who considers the Hebrew language sacred and who knows that in order to preserve the Jewish nation he must first of all preserve the Hebrew language, will come and greet the Hevrah Shohare Sefath Aver on their thirtieth anniversary.</p>
