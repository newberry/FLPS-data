   <p>I want to tell my dear Jews of Chicago that no matter how philanthropically inclined the West Side may be, it is not strong enough financially to support both the local Jewish lower schools and a national institution like the Hebrew Theological College. It now costs eighty thousand dollars a year to support the Hebrew THelogical College, and soon it will cost a hundred thousand dollars a year. It costs between seventy and eighty thousand dollars a year to keep up the West Side Talmud Torahs. It will cost about two hundred thousand dollars a year to support them, if they are properly reorganized so that they can educate an additional five thousand children. The West Side Jews alone cannot, by any means, raise three hundred thousand dollars a year for Jewish educational purposes. In other words, if the West Side Jews want to take over and finance their Talmud Torahs themselves, they <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will have to say good-by to the Hebrew Theological College. Are they willing to do that? I would like to hear from them. If they want to do that, they ought to consider whether they will be able to do it; whether they can carry out such a plan.</p>
