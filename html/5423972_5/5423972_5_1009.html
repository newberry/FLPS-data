   <p>All intelligent Jews, orthodox and radical understand what an ugly and harmful effect, the Jewish Courier has upon the Jewry of Chicago.</p>
   <p>For the time being the masses are not yet familiar with the character of the Courier and there are people who believe that the Courier is a helpful organ for the Jewish community. In order to show these orthodox masses what a bad bunch of hypocrites are connected with the Courier - I will write a few articles.</p>
   <p>The writer of these lines is an orthodox Jew, that has sought and studied the methods of the Courier and the characters of its bosses and its few petty writers. I wish to inform the Chicago Jewish public what a disease the Courier is upon the orthodox Jewry.</p>

   <p>The intelligent Jews of all parties, who understand the dangers and the falsehoods of the Courier have no idea of its insolence. The boasting, the nerve of the Courier, are known only to those who come into close contact with its gang.</p>
   <p>Very often the Courier brags of the good it has done, but never did they brag as much as in the issue of December first, where the braggart of the "Jewish Labor Ghetto" stated, "There is not enough money in the world to pay me for writing anything against my will, that the owner of the Courier is more liberal, more respectable than is the Jewish Socialist Publishing Association, giving freedom to all the writers, to write without censorship; that there are many writers in the Courier and that the least of them is a professor in comparison to the greatest of the Jewish Labor World."</p>

   <p>Whether the Courier writers can write as they please will be discussed later. Meanwhile, I want to draw the readers' attention to the insolence of the statement that there are enough writers on the Courier and that the least of them may be a professor in comparison to the greatest of the Labor World. According to these statements, you are told that the Courier has 2,288 writers, but I will let you in on a secret, the entire Courier staff consists of two ignorant treacherous little anarchists, that is all the writers the Courier has and no more.</p>
   <p>The Labor World has a much larger staff than the Courier and publishes more reading matters in one issue than the Courier prints in six <span class="page-break">\4</span>issues. Most of the articles and sketches printed in the Courier are stolen. Original articles are printed only when they can make a few dollars by either flattering or insulting someone.</p>
   <p>The articles now appearing in the Courier are being stolen from old European sheets, the Freind, Yud, magazines, etc. The Courier needs no good writers, and no respectable honest person can work there.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zioni, whom the Courier brought from Europe and engaged as their editor, barely escaped from them. The bosses of the Courier figured on using Mr. Zioni as a tool to extract more money from the Jewish institutions and politicians, but when they saw that he refused to transform himself into a tool, they began to make things so miserable that he ran away from the editorial room before even supplying himself with another job.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The owner of the Courier goes to the synagogue to pray, because it pays him in his business, yet he forces all his workers to work Saturdays which is against their will, even Yom Kippur, Atonement Day, they write for the Courier and the pious boss knowing this very well, goes to the synagogue and plays the role of the pious Jew. Even the owner's only son is forced by his father to work on Saturdays.</p>
   <p>This article is written to inform the Jewish institutions and the entire Jewry of Chicago the true colors of their representatives in the press.</p>
