   <p>The winter season brings in its wake, many interesting things. Of course there's the freezing cold but there too is much happiness; there are the activities in all fields of sports. Clubs revive their spirit of work and entertainment. At the Hebrew Institute the various clubs and departments are already functioning sponsoring the lecture season, the concert season, as well as many other activities.</p>
   <p>These last two nights have been devoted to Junior and Senior oratorical contests. Many children participated. The audience was spellbound with the oratorical abilities displayed by the young Jewish children.</p>
   <p>The results of the first night's debate have already appeared in the Courier and we shall therefore devote our time and space to the results of last night's victories.</p>
