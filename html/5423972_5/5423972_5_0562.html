   <p>Chicago can boast of being the only city that has three magnificient charity balls every year. The institutions assisted and the new ones started are constant evidence of the amount of good done by these entertainments.</p>
   <p>The pioneer charity ball in Chicago was given by the Young Men's Hebrew Charity Association eleven years ago, and each succeeding year has shown an increase in interest and profit. The amount distributed last year was almost $15,000, the expense of earning it was less than $2,200.</p>
   <p>As usual, the Y. M. H. C. Association will open the charity ball season with their affair at the Auditorium on December 15th.</p>
   <p>The boxes will be auctioned at the Standard Club, December 5th, and judging by the applications, the sale will be interesting and lively.</p>
