   <p>The Jewish Labor World is being published by workers for the purpose of helping to improve the material and spiritual conditions of the Jewish workers of Chicago and other large cities.</p>
   <p>As a labor newspaper struggling for the workers' interests, the Labor World will aid and assist with all her might, the trade unionist movement, whose aim is to abolish slavery for the workers in the factory and sweat shop. We will help to enlighten the worker as to how sacred the union must be to him, always - be it in time of peace or in time of strike; how much his fate depends on the power of his union, depends on his loyalty and devotion. In time of a strike or any other trouble with his bosses, the worker will always find as a true friend, a defender and supporter - our newspaper. We will often have sections devoted to literature and art, of prominent critics and judges. Articles of history and philosophy and science, written so clearly that anybody will be able to understand, will also appear in our paper. In short, the program of the Jewish Labor World will be a newspaper teaching Socialism, science and literature.</p>
