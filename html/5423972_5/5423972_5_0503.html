   <p>Thanks to the untiring efforts of Mr. Samuel Malts, president of the Sixteenth Street Bank, the long-planned carnival on Sixteenth Street will be opened finally tomorrow evening. It will extend, on Sixteenth Street, from Kedzie to Crawford Avenue, and will continue until June 24.</p>
   <p>This carnival will be interesting and amusing. Participants have exerted their greatest efforts and energies to make it a success. Streets will be decorated, bands will play, and various amusing games will be held.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meyer Blaz, promotor of the carnival, has arranged, besides the various shows and animal displays, to have Mr. Harry Rich, the noted actor, perform, free of charge, some of his famous tricks, such as pulling two automobiles with his teeth, having a shell explode after a huge cannon is tied to his teeth, etc., etc.</p>
