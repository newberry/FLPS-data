   <p>7. To develop in them idealism and the striving towards great deeds, which are so necessary for every child of the oppressed class to possess in his struggle for a better society.</p>
   <p>In order to attain these aims, the following courses are being taught:</p>
   <p>a. The Yiddish language: reading, writing and speaking; b. Yiddish literature. c. Biographies of great people, Jewish and non-Jewish, especially of those foremost in the struggle for freedom. d. Music, dancing, and elocution. Also every school celebrates certain Jewish and labor holidays. Discussions of current events are included in the school courses. Storytelling is also an integral part of the curriculum. Excursions to museums, parks, theaters and other important institutions also are incorporated into the school program.</p>
   <p>So as to enable every child to develop his musical talents, courses in piano, violin and other instruments have been organized. The period of instruction is from 4:00 P.M. to 8:00 P.M. Every child attends three days a week, every other day.</p>
