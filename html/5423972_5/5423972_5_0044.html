   <p>To the usual patron and observer, the young Jewish painter, I. Mortimer Block, whose pictures are being exhibited at Chicago's Art Club, casts a reflection throughout the whole riotous gallery of symbolic works and his portraits catch the eye like a red thread, the exoteric, diaspora characteristic of the artist's conception.</p>
   <p>Whichever, embroidered phantasy of Mr. Block's many hued collections you may inspect, whether the exotic nature studies or his original monotypes, you notice almost everywhere a finely colored fantastic <span class="page-break">\2</span>veil, or troubled heavens, lone and colorful tremors, or ireful clouds reflecting a melancholy and hellish atmosphere, all of which are molded into his landscapes or figures--all colorfully tragic.</p>
   <p>Block's brush although free and easy, is also very bold and audacious in color application. The artist is not ultra-modern but very rich in originality and decorative technique.</p>
   <p>The impressions of his war pictures are not expressed in forms of fiery envisioned horrors or in gigantic destructive processions, but in quiet touching sorrow, in silent yet unfailing influence of tears, helplessness and love throes. And, therefore, the principal figure of Block's war images is woman, rather than the fighting soldier.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Woman is the symbol of love and suffering, the most favorable object of the artist's diaspora inspirations.</p>
   <p>Block's "War Bride," is a dreamy Madonna with a naked baby in her arms. Both faces radiate with holy naivety, appealing even to the coldest hearts. On both sides of the "War Bride," watch two black robed figures of nuns. One, bent, expressing affliction and wretchedness, the other, pride and courage. There is no trace of a smile on the entire picture, not even an illuminating line.</p>
   <p>"The Dead City," displays a woman in black, a type of chaste woman who stands among the ruins of a former flowering country, mourning and praying. An atmosphere of despair and darkness. On the very top, peering out of the thin veil is a ray of light, hardly visible. The eye retains only the darkness and tragedy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"To Eternal Hope," reveals a decorative symbolic scene of life's downfall. Above, a red heaven, the sun setting forever. Beneath, between two dense forests, in the darkness on a quiet stream a soldier hurries his canoe containing a fallen hero in the black portals of death.</p>
   <p>Block's allegorical fantasies are also molded from the artist's diaspora psychology; of torment and sorrow, of dramatic effects and sentiments of pity.</p>
   <p>"The Fiddler," or more exact "The Transmission of the Fiddle," portrays an old man who sits as if glued a lifetime to the same stool, absorbing the tones of his beloved instrument. The floor and everything around him is in a state of decay, the earth has grown up around it. You seem to see the man, his fiddle, and stool become an integration that continues forever. The man playing his instrument until the ground itself "swallows" them. How beautiful and impressive.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The lyric heights of Block's artistic imagination does not gleam from his physical or symbolical figures. His creative powers, his soul, his individuality, the young artist encases in his Jewish penal works, where the diaspora characteristics of his corporealistic imagination and monotypes have proven to be exceptionally prominent, rich, decorative, rhythmically formed, and above all original.</p>
   <p>Block's "Diaspora," is not a procession of bent, wandering beggars with staffs, but an old, dreaming Jewish shoemaker, deep in thought, a partriarchal type wearing a skull-cap. He sits all alone on the steps of his shop, shouldering the yoke of his struggle for the right to exist.</p>
   <p>The entire diaspora imprints, the compassion of his nation lies on his glorious oriental face, his forehead's wrinkles, the deep longing eyes, <span class="page-break">\6</span>and too, in his shadow.</p>
   <p>Block's "Eternal Wanderer," is the antithesis of his painting the "Russian Fanatic" (Rasputin). These two symbolic heads are, in their central line, in rhythm, and in outer form, similar. The fanatic unites, in his glances, seriousness with wickedness, religious fervor with prophetic torror.</p>
   <p>"The Eternal Wanderer," is a patriarchal beauty. His smooth bright forehead and mild longing and sorrowful eyes express suffering, anxiety, great courage and forgiveness. Not a single wrinkle on the old rabbinical forehead. Is this a rythmic error? No. It is the iron strength of the diaspora Jew!</p>
   <p>"The Scribe," is engrossed in his parchment, his holy task, before him on the wooden table. "The Jewish Nature Artist," with his free thought, naive, satisfied look; the symbolic accompanying woman's head and the <span class="page-break">\7</span>background; the old "Diligent Man," (picture 26) fettered to his table near his beloved book; all are alike clothed and shrouded in diaspora impressionistic strokes with a Jewish charm, form, and rhythm in the personification, the background are in light and shadow.</p>
   <p>The Jewish portraits, roses of Block's imaginative garden, are masterpieces.</p>
   <p>In "Madam Kolish," we recognize immediately the noted, ethereal, yearning, aristocratic daughter of Zion, in a rich colorful background of oriental symbolism depicting the historical destruction of Palestine.</p>
   <p>The background and all its figures, are woven around the actress in a reddish-white, strongly visioned stage of nature.</p>
   <p>The picture "Moon Shine," is the portrait of a young Jewish dramatic actress in a New York theater.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>You see a being with wild flying hair and dramatic features. From the left eye falls a tear. On the face falls light and shadow from the moon, reflecting on the illuminated picture. So much unhappiness, so much despair.</p>
   <p>In the gallery there are many more personal portraits, as that of New York's Governor Smith, Dr. S. M. Melomid, Nathan Yud, and others.</p>
   <p>The English press points to our young Jewish artist as a new light in the field of American painters. For us Jews, Block is a new modern diaspora artist, whose original creations we welcome with pride, although the young master has not yet found his path, his "soul's home."</p>
