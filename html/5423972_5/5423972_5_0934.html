   <p>Mr. Harry Lipsky, manager of the Jewish Courier.</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Lipsky: Permit me to congratulate you, the readers of your newspaper, and all the Jews of Chicago for the great achievement in obtaining the services of Dr. S. M. Melamed as chief editor of the Courier.</p>
   <p>Perhaps I am in a better position to appraise the value of Dr. Melamed than any other Jewish reader, because I have followed Dr. Melamed's career of philosopher and publicist since his appearance in the Jewish neighborhood. I have read his works in more than one language, and had a worth-while visit at his home in London in 1914.</p>
   <p>I have always admired Dr. Melamed's literary vigor and philosophical intelligence. Dr. Melamed is one of the few Jewish writers who have a historical conception about Jewish life, who have studied and understand Jewish history, and who are in a position to compare the events of Jewish history with the history of other nations. Dr. Melamed has lived in many countries, has studied the literature of many nations, and uses it all in the field of Yiddish-Hebrew endeavor.</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding his knowledge and views as a philosopher, Dr. Melamed devotes himself to the work of publicist and journalist, and for the last few years we have read his opinion about all questions concerning Jewish life in various countries. Dr. Melamed is not an academician who hides himself in a corner amidst old books, he is a writer full of life, he connects body and soul, and uses his historical information in explaining daily occurrences.</p>
   <p>I must confess, that I did not agree with Dr. Melamed in all the subjects which he touched upon. Nevertheless, I always have had the highest respect for his ideas and sincerity.</p>
   <p>Concerning his style of writing, it can be said that he is magnetic. When you begin to read an article of his, whether it be written in Hebrew, Yiddish, English, or German, you do not wish to stop reading it until you have finished. His style is slightly flavored with humor, and his vocabulary is inexhaustible; he alwaysfinds the proper words for his thoughts.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to enumerate Dr. Melamed's qualifications in a short letter. I only want to relate that, in a conversation with a doctor last week, he told me that he cannot thank me enough for the favor I have shown him in enlisting him into the ranks of subscribers to the American Jewish Chronicle, because he believes that it is the best reading matter that he has had in the last twenty-five years. Hundreds of readers of the American Jewish Chronicle read every article of that publication. The truth of the matter is that the American Jewish Chronicle, which Dr. Melamed has founded and edited, is the best Jewish- English periodical that we ever had.</p>
   <p>In view of the above-mentioned facts, I am taking this opportunity to congratulate you and your readers for the great achievement in securing the services of Dr. Melamed as editor in chief of the Courier. I trust that we shall appreciate Dr. Melamed, and that he will do for Jewish Chicago as much as he did for Jewish New York, and that he will help us in all our important undertakings.</p>
   <p>Devotedly yours,</p>
   <p>A. Levinson.</p>
