   <p>David Kessler, the noted Jewish actor, and his worthy company, are playing at present at the Empire Theater.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kessler opened yesterday evening with "Lost Hope," which took the audience by storm. The same play will be presented tonight and tomorrow, Friday evening. Also Saturday and Sunday, matinee and evening.</p>
   <p>"Lost Hope," New York critics say, is one of Z. Libin's most powerful and thrilling dramas. It depicts the deplorable family tragedy of an ill-suited marriage, and the sufferings of a father for his unfortunate child.</p>
   <p>In the Kessler company we have the following talent: Madame Ray Schnayer, Madame Becky Weinshtoib, Becky Frank, Mr. Jacob Frank, Mr. Louis Hyman, and, to Chicago theater-goers, that so well known soubrette, Miss Rosetta <span class="page-break">2</span>Bialis.</p>
   <p>Miss Rosetta Bialis has played this season at the Eighth Street Theater, Philadelphia, attaining great success. For next season she will be Chicago's own, being induced by Messers. Shugarberg and Paulee to play in their Empire Theater company.</p>
   <p>Mr. David Kessler is one of the most outstanding and significant Jewish actors that the Jewish stage possesses, and his coming to Chicago should be acclaimed by everyone.</p>
   <p>As expected, the play "The Riddle Woman," in which Madame Bertha Kalish portrays the heroine, is a huge success. The Woods Theater, where it is now showing, is filled to capacity every night. Many admirers of the great artist must be turned away because the "house is sold out." To <span class="page-break">3</span>secure a good seat, one must get tickets three or four days in advance.</p>
   <p>The press greeted Madame Kalish with a hearty reception. All critics of large newspapers in Chicago are enthused by her splendid performance, her fine diction, and her majestic appearance. More people come, not so much to see the play, than to see Madame Kalish. She is the center of the show.</p>
   <p>Messers. Paulee and Shugarberg have this Monday closed the season of their Empire Theater performances by giving a banquet for actors and reporters of the press. At this affair, Mr. Shugarberg announced the coming engagements for next season to be opened sometime in the last days of August, with a cast which includes Miss Rosetta Bialis, Mr. and Mrs. Krohner, Mr. and Mrs. Bulman, David Scheinholtz, Vasha Rosenthahl, Harry Hochstone, and the noted Prima Donna Madame Clara Rafalo.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>This is not the complete ensemble for the Empire Theater. More talent not now forthcoming will soon be announced by the management.</p>
   <p>At present they are busy with attractions for the summer season, to be presented first with David Kessler and company.</p>
   <p>Eighteen performances were presented at the Empire Theater by Leon Blank. His was both a moral and a financial success.</p>
   <p>During six of the eighteen days, it rained and was generally bad weather, but the audiences came, filling the theater from end to end.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leon Blank may truly state that the Jewish theater-goers of Chicago are with and for him, notwithstanding circumstances outside the theater. Sorrowful news from across the seas, the various glamorous amusements <span class="page-break">5</span>here have not hindered them from coming to see him. Jewish theater lovers in Chicago now ask: "When will Mr. Blank visit us again?"</p>
