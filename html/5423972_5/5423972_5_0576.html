   <p>At the West Chicago Club House last Monday evening, 1200 people filled the hall and enthusiastically acclaimed the entertainment given for the benefit of Zion Temple Sabbath-School children. An amateur orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Franz Wald, skillfully rendered the music, and general praise was bestowed upon the children for their rendition of the "Children's Crusade". Credit went to Mrs. Joseph Stolz, who trained the 250 pupils of the Sabbath School.</p>
