   <p>On Thanksgiving evening, November 30th, at the Hebrew Institute, a Memorial Concert will take place for the purpose of raising funds with which to assist the family of our recently deceased Humorist and Writer, Mr. D. Apotheckar.</p>
   <p>Mr. Apotheckar was one of the greatest Humorists in our Jewish Literature, and still he could not avoid the lot of the other Jewish writers, and he left his family destitute.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Jewish Public to do everything possible to assist this poor family in their distress. We are patiently awaiting the report of the Committee, which is working without any letup to make this undertaking a success.</p>
