   <p>The Rabbinical College, which is located at Grenshaw Street and Kedzie Avenue, is in great need of books. And in order that this great (Jewish) educational institution shall be able to continue its existence, all Chicago Jews are requested to send in as many books as they can, as soon as possible. Most of all we are in need of: a Sha's (a set of Talmudic tractates), Ramba'm (the works of Moses Maimonides), Teshuvoth (books of Requiems), Meforshim (Commentaries), and Poskim (Interpreters of the Law). You can see us daily at the office of the Rabbinical College from 2 to 8 P.M.</p>
