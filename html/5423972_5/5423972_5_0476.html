   <p>You have crossed the Atlantic and traveled thousands of miles to join us in celebrating Jewish Day at "A Century of Progress." Chicago Jewry is happy for the opportunity to greet you and welcome you.</p>
   <p>We are looking forward to the inspiration of your presence, freighted and fragrant as it is with the soil and the soul of Eretz Yisroel, and looking forward happily and anxiously to hear your message which will strike a responsive chord in our hearts.</p>
   <p>You who have done so much to unite all Jewish hearts and have fired Jewish hopes everywhere, come to us at a time when we need your counsel most.</p>
   
   <p>Never has Chicago been privileged to be host to so many loyal Jewish hearts who have come from distant corners of our great country to witness the magnificent spectacle, "The Romance of a People," which tells the story, in dance and song, of the martyrdom and triumphs of the Jews during the past four thousand years. It is an honor which the Jews of Chicago are proud of and happy for the responsibility that is theirs.</p>
   <p>May your visit bring understanding and concord, peace and unity.</p>
   <p>So speaks the heart of Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>H. L. M.</p>
