   <p>Mrs. Julius Stone, secretary of the Chicago Hebrew Institute, announced that today March 10, is set aside as Hebrew Institute Day, with a view to procuring new members for this highly important institution.</p>
   <p>In the introduction to the announcement, Mrs. Stone says that the Hebrew Institute faces a deficit of $6,000 to cover the expenses for the Institute's fiscal year, which ends April 1914, and, consequently, Institute Day is part of a drive to enroll new members to help bear the costs of the Institution, which is a great social requirement on the West Side.</p>
   <p>We regret that this information has come to us so late that we cannot give this resolution the requisite amount of publicity that it should have. According to our opinion, it is indeed a privilege and an honor to cooperate in such work. We believe that institutions such as the Hebrew <span class="page-break">2</span>Institute are the coats of mail of the Chicago Jewish community, the protectors of our youth, lest they be impeded by unsuitable surroundings; the preservers of the Jewish spirit, and the buttresses for maintaining Jewish traditions.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute is not a charitable institution that can appeal to the sentiment of the good-hearted people. Orphans are not fed there, nor is shelter provided for the aged, nor medicine dispensed for the sick, nor shrouds supplied for the dead. So the Institute cannot be kept up by asking alms for the sake of pity. The Chicago Hebrew Institute is a place that not only makes it possible for the orphan to become independent, but also keeps his spirit alive.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute does more than any other institution to remove young Jewish men from gambling dens, Jewish children from pool rooms, and Jewish girls from street corners. The 2,111 Jewish young people who were active in various clubs of the Institute for the month of January, the <span class="page-break">3</span>4,200 Jewish men and women who participated in the various cultural activities for the same month, the 5,500 who assembled for special Institute undertakings, and the vast number of children who fill up the Institute's library during the day and in the evening, were all taken away from the "back rooms" in the saloons, from pool rooms, from gambling dens, and from all other places where Jewish youth should not be found.</p>
   <p>It stands to reason that these thousands of Jewish children will have no occasion, when they enter manhood, to resort to the braggadocio of being convicted for arson, for election frauds, for pick-pocketing, for gambling, for running houses of ill-repute, and for other such evils with which the newspapers are replete with Jewish names of people who did not share the good fortune of having a Chicago Hebrew Institute, when they first came here.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is not for the sake of pity that anyone who can afford it, should become a member. It is a debt that must be paid by everyone who <span class="page-break">4</span>would like to evade embarrassment when being reminded that he is a Jew. Let everybody who is financially able, forward his application to-day for membership in the Chicago Hebrew Institute and thereby let the directors know that, by April, there will be no deficit in such an institution like the Chicago Hebrew Institute.</p>
