   <p>The Sears Roebuck Y. M. C. A. has invited Rabbi Leon Fram of Temple Judea to conduct a Bible class composed of Christians and Jews. Rabbi Fram will give a series of lectures under the general topic of "The Modern Message of the Bible".</p>
   <p>This is the first time in Chicago, and perhaps in the entire America, that a rabbi has been invited to conduct a Bible class under the auspices of the Young Men's Christian Association. It is an evidence of broad-mindedness in which the Christian and the Jew might well rejoice.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Fram received the rabbinical degree at the Hebrew Union College in 1920, and has been spiritual leader of Temple Judea since his graduation.</p>
