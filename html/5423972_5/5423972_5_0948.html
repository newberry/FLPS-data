   <p>I'm beginning my work as associate editor of the Courier, I wish to say to all of you that I realize my responsibilities in this capacity, and that I hold in great esteem the honor which the publisher of this newspaper has accorded me.</p>
   <p>I did not come here to install new policies, to collect debts, or to do anyone a favor. I came here for the mutual interests of myself and the Courier--which means also the interests of the reader. I came here to make the Courier a better, finer, and richer newspaper both in content and significance.</p>
   <p>I have been a journalist since my youth. I have always been active and have often joined in the demands made by Jewish interests in every aspect of human endeavor, both through the periodicals to which I contributed and through the organizations with which I was connected. Thus I obtained a broad personal acquaintanceship with prominent people, and generally gained valuable ideas not only pertaining to Chicago, but to other parts of the country as well. The advantages thus gained I will gladly share with the readers of the Courier through my articles.</p>
   <p>The present World War causes many changes, in business, in politics, and in social conditions. It will be my task to observe these events, and to discern where and how they affect the interests of the readers and the advertisers, then to state the facts as they are. I shall discuss problems as impartially as possible and will fight for all that is just.</p>
   <p>As a journalist, I wish to say modestly,that I am very well known to the local Jewry. I am also known to non-Jews. I know everyone, and everyone knows me. I know all institutions and organizations from the ground up; I know what they have and what they lack. I know their usefulness and their shortcomings.</p>
   
   <p>They shall all receive my due consideration.</p>
   <p>I believe in encouraging and helping every worthy undertaking. I wish to see the businessmen more successful, and the workers more satisfied. I shall agitate for the observance of the sacred traditions and high ideals of the Jewish nation; and I will seek to effect a better understanding between our various elements so that opinions shall be respected and principles shall not be attacked with insults and threats.</p>
   <p>Henceforth I shall dedicate my loyalty, time, energy, experience, as well as my pen, to the Courier. I shall serve no one group, but rather work for the benefit of all. It is therefore in place, here, to unite everyone in our community to consider me as their friend, and to assure them that their voices will be heard and their opinions will receive their due place.</p>
   <p>A new life, a new interest in the Jewish community, is approaching. My profession, as a journalist, compelled me to take an interest in every department of the publishing business. I know everything, from the where and how of getting news, to the distribution of the newspapers to the newsstands. I have studied and analyzed the latest and best methods in the non-Jewish newspaper world, methods that make possible the utilization of each department to the greatest extent.</p>
   <p>I am not a stranger to the Courier. I worked here for almost six years. Since I left, it has grown to be one of the biggest Jewish industries in the country. It ranks with the most successful of our newspapers; in its circulation it includes Jewish Chicago and most of the cities of the West; it is the highest Jewish platform in this part of America and its voice resounds everywhere. I know all this; and because I know it, I shall consider my task even more sacred as long as I am working for the Courier.</p>
   <p>I do believe that this newspaper, even though it is a Jewish newspaper, should also deal with [problems of] general interest. Don't forget that besides being Jews we are also American Jewish citizens, citizens of a glorious republic--America! As such, we have other duties as well. I shall write about all of this. I only beg (of my readers) a little patience. My heart is in my work, and my sole aim is to make myself worthy of my profession as a writer in the Courier--the newspaper of and for Chicago.</p>
