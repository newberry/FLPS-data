   <p>Even during the Biblical period, Jewish literature differed from all other national literatures. It is the only one which did not develop in any particular country and does not bear the stamp of a specific locality. It has neither a local character, nor a local color.</p>
   <p>True, there are many scholars who assert that Jews have many literatures but no national literature, because a national literature can develop only in a specific territory, under a specific type of political organization, with specific national traditions. Those scholars claim that a nation can produce a large number of authors and poets and yet not produce a national literature. Superficially, it would seem that those scholars were correct; but when we take into consideration the psychological effect of Jewish literature since the Jews have become a nomadic people, we are then justified in doubting the <span class="page-break">2</span>truth of those scholars' claims. Although Jewish literature has undergone various radical changes, a change in language being one of them, and although it is not as stable as the Jews have been in their instability--they have been compelled to wander from place to place--nevertheless, it has been successful in maintaining certain high standards of a special character which would permit one to call it a national literature.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish document has its [special] Jewish character even though it does not reflect a particular locality. The Hebrew-Italian school of the eighteenth century is, in many respects, similar to the Hebrew-Spanish school of the Middle Ages. And the Hebrew-Russian school of the present day is not only similar to the Hebrew school of the twelfth and eighteenth centuries, but is even very similar to the Biblical period. The work of Bialik alone is an illustration of how close we are to the spirit of the Biblical period.</p>
   <p>This similarity of the Jewish literature of various periods is true with regard to poetry. When we consider prose writing, however, then we see the <span class="page-break">3</span>effects of Jewish wandering. The Jewish literature of the Alexandrian period is hardly similar to the Jewish literature of Babylon, and the Jewish literature created in Europe differs entirely from that created in Central Asia and Africa. In other words, during the period when Jewish specilative thought was fortunate enough to retain its highly original character, Jewish literature compelled certain [Jewish] groups to assimilate [themselves into the Jewish fold]. So long as the Hebrew language was used for the expression of the Jewish literary spirit, the wandering from one country to another affected the literature only in so far as it became more picturesque and more interesting. It did not, however, affect its content. Very often the new environment was not noticeable at all in the literature. This is only natural, because the Hebrew language, as it has developed, contains a certain philosophy of life. The fate of the Jews for many centuries, more or less similar in every country, has contributed to the psychological effect of Hebrew literary thought. This is particularly noticeable in the Hebrew elegy. When an individual reads Bialik's "Songs of Wrath," his thoughts immediately turn to poems written many centuries ago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>But since the Jews entered the modern world and accepted non-Jewish languages as the medium of Jewish thought, the effects of the wanderings began to be felt in Jewish literature in an unpleasant way. The unpleasantness consists not in the fact that many languages are being used, which makes Jewish literature so colorful, but in the fact that a variation in thought and opinion is revealed. The work of Jewish authors in various European languages, who deal only with special Jewish problems, cannot be considered as a part of Jewish literature and cannot be considered as Jewish national treasures, because there are to be found non-Jewish elements in their work which impress their stamp upon it. Quite often it is very difficult to distinguish between the Jewish and non-Jewish in these works. Everyone who is acquainted with the theological development of Judaism for the past hundred years knows how Jewish theology in the West has gradually lost its original Jewish concept and has become closer to the Christian concept. No less a theologian than Schleiermacher characterized the so-called modern Judaism as very close to modern Christianity. We must understand that it is not modern Christianity that has come closer to Judaism, but Judaism that has come closer to Christianity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It would naturally be historically fallacious to assume that the non-Jewish element has stealthily crept into Jewish literature only in the past one hundred years. On the contrary, it is a well-established fact that since Jews began to use foreign languages many non-Jewish elements have crept into their work. This was the case with Philo, as well as with maimonides in his Guide to the Perplexed.</p>
   <p>Isn't it remarkable that all the synthesists between Judaism and an alien world perspective have written their philosophical works either in Greek, Arabian, or another modern language, whereas all Jewish philosophers who wrote in Hebrew did not seek to be synthesists at all? Philo, who wrote in Greek, wanted to be the synthesist between Plato and Judaism. Maimonides who wrote his Guide in Arabian wanted to become the synthesist between Aristotle and Judaism. Naturally, there are exceptions. Nachman Krochmal was a true Hegelian and he wrote his Guide to the Perplexed of Our Time in Hebrew. But such an exception only proves the rule. Most of our philosophers who wrote in Hebrew have developed a Hebrew philosophy, more or less, and have contributed to the development of Jewish thought, which finds its true expression <span class="page-break">6</span>in the Bible, the Talmud, and the Agadah.</p>
   <p>Thus, everything we have stated can serve as proof that the psychological effect of Jewish literary thought and the true development of the Jewish concept in general can only be preserved through the use of Hebrew. Hebrew is for the Jew and for the literature of the Jewish people more than an ordinary language. Hebrew contains the many different elements which are necessary for the healthy development of a national literature. We do not have a country, a political organization, local traditions, etc. However, as long as Hebrew is the language medium of Jewish literature, it will have a national character and will deserve to be called a national literature. If, however, Jewish thought is not expressed in Hebrew, then Jewish [literary] creations cannot possibly belong entirely to us and cannot be our national property. It will belong to others as well as to ourselves, and perhaps more to others than to us.</p>
   <p>This is where the importance of the Hebrew language lies for the development of Judaism and Jewish thought.</p>
