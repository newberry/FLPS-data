   <p>The Progressive Literary and Dramatic Club:</p>
   <p>The Progressive Literary and Dramatic Club is one of the Institute organizations that has in no way permitted the warm weather to interfere with its work. The meetings have been well attended, and the business has been conducted in a spirited manner. It has been said that when a group of people become of one opinion, mental stagnation results. Surely, this Club is in no danger of such a prospect, as the members seem to be alive to each situation and interesting ideas are always forthcoming. One would almost be led to think that thinking in Yiddish is conducive to sharp wits, for the meetings are conducted entirely in this tongue.</p>
   <p>Try-outs are now being held in order to select the caste for "Die Mischpoche", by Numberg. This is a very intense Yiddish drama; one that appeals to the lover of the best in Yiddish Dramatic Art.</p>
   <p>The selection of such a play certainly gives weight to one of the principal objects of the Club, namely, the elevation of the Yiddish stage, which has been on the decline since the death of Jacob Gordon. With such an aggressive Literary and Dramatic Club, these performances are among the most well-attended of those given by Institute organizations.</p>
