   <p>Four newspapers devoted entirely to Judaism are published in Chicago. They are all issued weekly. Three are published in English and the fourth is issued in Hebrew characters in the Russian and Polish dialect. Prior to 1889 there was but one paper published in the city in the interest of Jews and Judaism. The Occident was the first paper to espouse the cause and was started in 1873. The Jews then numbered about 20,000 in and about Chicago, and the Occident being the being the first venture of its kind west of New York City, it rapidly acquired a large clientage - for those days. The paper was first issued and edited by its present owner, Julius Silversmith. Besides being the first Jewish paper published in the West, The Occident was also the first Jewish reform paper to come into existence in the world. The next Jewish paper to make its appearance in Chicago was the Chicago Israelite. This was founded about five years ago. Rabbi Isaac M. Wise is the editor and the paper is edited in connection with the American Israelite published at Cincinncat. The Israelite is also in a measure a reform paper, although the Rev. Dr. Wise still favors the Saturday service. Three years ago the third Jewish paper, published in English, made its appearance under <span class="page-break">\2</span>the title of the Reform Advocate. Equally as radical in reform is the Advocate as The Occident, and its editorials are supplied entirely from the pen of its founder, the Rev. Dr. Emil G. Hirsch. Some few years ago a paper called the Juedische Courier (Jewish Courier) made its appearance on the West Side, published in Hebrew characters, in the Russian and Polish dialect. The paper was owned and edited by Leon Colotkof for three years, when Sarasohn and Son of New York City bought him out. The Courier circulates among the 25,000 Russian and Polish Jews of the city who speak no language perfectly, but who have a smattering of Hebrew, Russian, Polish and German. The Jewish Courier is issued also in New York City on the same day that it appears in Chicago, Thursday evening. Upon selling the Courier, Mr. Colotkof immediately started another organ, calling his new venture the Neue Welt (New World), but after a year of hard struggling the paper went out of existence; Mr. Colotkof being convinced that the Russian Jews of Chicago and the West would not support more than one paper - the Chicago Record.</p>
