   <p>Again we change the figures on our title page and The Occident enters into the seventh volumeof its existence. This time we have reason to congratulate ourselves that the precarious life of our journal is happily past and the Occident assumes its place among the journals of Chicago as a firm and well established newspaper enterprise. We had hoped that as a Jewish theological organ in its infance, we might conduct it with profit and advantage, but in that we labored under misapprehensions. We trusted to awaken an interest in our readers for science and philosophy, and for that effort we were sadly berated.</p>
   <p>We profited by this our latest course to make the Occident a purely Jewish Society organ---From every section of the Union and even from great Gotham. The news is portrayed through these columns. From that auspicious moment on, our subscription rose to a respectable list of names, and the Occident is now read by Young Israel in Washington Terr, as well as in wilds of Minnesota to the States bordering along the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
