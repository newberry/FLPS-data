   <p>To the large staff of collaborators of the Courier has been added another colleague from New York.</p>
   <p>The Courier has succeeded in engaging the services of P. Novak, who has been a prominent contributor to the New York Jewish press. Mr. Novak has been engaged as a permanent collaborator of the Courier and will write each day on questions regarding everyday life, Jewish and American interests, and essays.</p>
   <p>Mr. Novak is a journalist with vast experience. He possesses a brilliant and sharp pen, and writes in a simple but attractive Yiddish. His engagement is a great gain both for us and for the Jewish readers of Chicago and environs.</p>
   <p>We also wish to inform our readers that a number of improvements for the paper are now in the making. The Courier will presently introduce several new features each day in order to make the paper still more interesting than before.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, we wish to announce that a new feature will begin Friday, i.e., the "Family Page," a page for the Jewish women, for the Jewish child, and for the interests of the Jewish home in general. This page will be interesting, easy to read, attractive, and will deal with the vital interests of the family; this page will also have a column for children.</p>
   <p>On Fridays we will feature the "Theater and Music Page," where the most interesting and important happenings of the American Jewish stage, as well as of the movies, will find an echo.</p>
   <p>Every Thursday we will review everything that takes place in the Jewish labor movement.</p>
