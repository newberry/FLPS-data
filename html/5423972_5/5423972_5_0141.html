   <p>Mr. Frank Shmuckler, the personal representative of Miss Anna Tabak, told us the following regarding the young Jewish Prima Donna of Mecca, which is now being played at the Auditorium Theatre. She began her career at eight years of age and within the ten years that she has been on the stage she has developed into one of the most famous of the young prima donnas. Ten years ago, Miss Tabak appeared in Boris Thamoshifsky's Peoples Theatre in Blind Love, and then left with the entire company for Chicago. That was the first time Miss Tabak ever was outside of New York.</p>
