   <p>The local Jewish Intellectuals will celebrate tonight at eleven o'clock. The publication, in book form, of the collected poems of Israel Blum, will be celebrated at a banquet in Rosenthal's Restaurant, 936 W. Roosevelt Road. Israel Blum is one of our talented poets.</p>
   <p>The poet wrote the poems now appearing in book-form, in the moments when the muse came "to call". Then he segregated himself from the material world and wrote poems of love of nature and of the working-class, life and struggle.</p>
   <p>Representatives of labor and cultural circles will speak at this banquet.</p>
