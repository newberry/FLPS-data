   <p>Jews should forget that one can go to the synagogue on a holiday at no expense. It costs money to go to a synagogue. Those days are gone when one could go to a synagogue and pray to one's heart's content, without any cost whatsoever. Nowadays to go to the synagogue means more than to go to pray and thereby earn a place in Paradise. Nowadays one goes to the synagogue to pray and also to do something for Judaism.</p>
   <p>I say this apropos the approaching holiday of the Pentecost. On that holiday the Jews will have to prove that they love the Torah and that they want to do something for the Torah. An appeal for the Hebrew Theological College will be made at that time. The appeal must be effective, which means it must bring in money because money is needed to finish the building for the Hebrew Theological College. If you contributed to the relief last Rosh Hashanah, if you <span class="page-break">\2</span>contributed to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] last Passover, be ready to contribute to the Hebrew Theological College this coming Pentecost. You will certainly give, whether you like it or not, because a spiritual center in Chicago must not be destroyed because of your niggardliness.</p>
   <p>I hope that the rabbis and the synagogue presidents will see to it that none of the Jews prays gratis and thereby evades his duty.</p>
