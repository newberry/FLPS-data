   <p>We are the only society which responds quickly with relief to the needy. As soon as we hear of anyone in need of relief. We immediately get busy. Therefore we appeal to our Sisters, Brothers and friends who possess a Jewish heart and Jewish sympathy to help us supply the unfortunate needy ones with the necessities of life this winter. Our treasury at present is almost empty, and we have decided to give a benefit ball in order to raise sufficient money for the poor and needy this winter. We appeal to you again to help us make this ball a success, by as many tickets as you can for by so doing you will help us take care of all who come to us for help and we will not have to turn away the the poor who appeal for help. The ball will take place Saturday evening, Dec. 30th at the Illinois Hall, Madison and Ogden Sts. We assure the public a most enjoyable evening. We hope that you will all come and help us make this a success. Music by Teller's orchestra, Yours Respectfully Sarah Lipschitz, President, Minnie Ziskind, chairman, Lena Lerman, Ball chairman, Sarah Grawick, Treasurer, Lena Sackheim, Secretary.</p>
