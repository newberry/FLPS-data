   <p>The art school entertainment last Saturday evening at the Metropolitan Hall sponsored by the Poale Zione Ladies Auxiliary will be long remembered. The house was full of people from all parts of the city, and from all walks of life. The hall was packed with people who came to demonstrate their great love for the new institute which the Jewish nation has established in Palestine.</p>
   <p>The evening was opened by Miss Sadie Greenspan, who spoke of the roles as being played by the members of this art school of geniuses. She also described the living conditions of the artists in the art school and in conclusion explained the importance of this institution in Palestine, which the Jews of Chicago and other Jewish communities must help support. The school is sponsored mainly by the Poale Zion organization. Dr. Marcus also spoke on the subjects of Chanukah and the art school in Palestine. He stressed the importance of the school, stating that its existence depended upon American Jews.</p>
   
   <p>After these addresses, a grand choir sang a few beautiful Jewish songs; recitations followed. The audience spent a most enjoyable evening, which also proved to be a great financial success for the Bezalel Art School.</p>
