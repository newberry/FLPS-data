   <p>Great achievements often have small beginnings, so small that they are hardly noticed or appreciated. Those who accomplish something worth while must expect to meet discouragement and disappointment at every step of the way, but the difficulties and the obstacles are gradually overcome, if an individual believes in his idea and has will power. As the enterprise progresses, the public begins to realize its great significance and begins to give it generous support.</p>
   <p>A few years ago, a few Chicago rabbis, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, Rabbi Saul Silber, Rabbi [A.] Cardon, and Rabbi Rubenstein, decided to establish a college for rabbis. However, educating rabbis for the future generation was a secondary consideration with them. Their basic motive was to strengthen the Orthodoxy of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>future generations by educating young scholars, who would absorb the traditions of Jewish Orthodoxy and Jewish scholarship, as well as receive the benefits of a secular education. The beginning was small and difficult. The founders gathered together a group of young men, good scholars, most of whom were former students of the Etz Chaim Seminary, which was then the chief Jewish pedagogical institution. They gave the students the opportunity to study the Torah while they were finishing their general education in high school or university. The founders were the sole supporters of the institution, which could hardly be called, at that time, a "college for rabbis". The public at large hardly knew of the existence of such an institution, and only a few people, of those who heard about it, could understand and appreciate the significance of laying the foundation for the future of Orthodoxy in America.</p>
   <p>This was the situation a few years ago, but today that idea has been embodied in the large and magnificent structure on Douglas Boulevard. Today every Jew in Chicago knows of the Hebrew Theological College, which is a real monument to Chicago's Jewish Orthodoxy.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The Hebrew Theological College can no more be compared to its predecessor, the College for Rabbis, than an ancient, old-fashioned heder can be compared to a modern, magnificent American public school. The idea, however, is the same--to create a fortress for Jewish Orthodoxy. This idea is the spiritual foundation of the magnificent institution on Douglas Boulevard, whose full significance will be appreciated only in the future.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Theological College has a triple significance; it is a merger of three institutions which complement each other. The three institutions, which comprise the Hebrew Theological College, are: the Etz Chaim Seminary, the old Chicago Torah institution which was reorganized upon a new basis, in accordance with the general aim of the Hebrew Theological College; the College for Rabbis, the original institution out of which the Hebrew Theological College developed; and the Pedagogical Institute, which was founded about a year ago.</p>
   <p>Each of these three educational institutions has a program of its own, which is strictly adhered to. The curriculum in every one of them is organized upon a <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>modern basis, which does not hinder the students from studying the Torah.</p>
   <p>The Etz Chaim Seminary has been in existence for twenty-three years. It has given us three rabbis: Rabbi [Benjamin] Daskel, Rabbi Siegel, and Rabbi Rosenbloom. Children who have graduated from the local Talmud Torahs are accepted as students. The average age of the children, at the time they enter the Seminary, is twelve years. The course of study extends over a four-year period. The entrance requirements for children is a knowledge of the Old Testament and a slight knowledge of [Hebrew] grammer. The subjects taught at the Seminary are: the Talmud and its commentaries, Hebrew, the Prophets, and Jewish history. Upon graduating from the Seminary, the students receive a diploma, which entitles them to enroll in the College for Rabbis.</p>
   <p>The entrance requirements of the College for Rabbis are: a knowledge of two hundred pages of the Talmud, the ability to read, unaided, a page of the Talmud, a thorough knowledge of the Prophets, and the ability to write Hebrew well.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The College for Rabbis has an eight-year course of study. A graduate of that institution must know one thousand pages of the Talmud, about two hundred chapters of the Mishnah, about three hundred sections of the famous Talmud commentaries, such as Iore Deio, Ibn Ezra, and so on; they must have a wide knowledge of Jewish history and of rabbinical literature.</p>
   <p>The Pedagogical Institute aims to prepare teachers for the Talmud Torahs and for the seminaries. The course of study extends over a five-year period. Pupils are accepted who have graduated from a Talmud Torah where the method of teaching is Ivrith Be-Tvrith [Teaching system in Hebrew schools: Hebrew subject matter explained in Hebrew], as in the Talmud Torahs of Congregations Anshe Sholom and Kehilath Jacob. The Hebrew language reigns in the Pedagogical Institute. Everything, including the Talmud, is taught in Hebrew. The students who enter the Institute must possess a good knowledge of oral and written Hebrew. Students of the Etz Chaim Seminary can enter if they have an adequate preparation <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>in Hebrew. Rabbi Jacob Greenberg is the principal of the College for Rabbis and of the Pedagogical Institute. The students of the Pedagogical Institute study the Talmud, Hebrew, Jewish literature, grammar, Aramaic, and so on.</p>
   <p>At present, there are two hundred and twenty-one pupils in the Etz Chaim Seminary and ninety-three in the College for Rabbis. Next Sunday, one will be installed as a rabbi in a synagogue. There are twenty-three students in the Pedagogical Institute.</p>
   <p>The students of the College for Rabbis cannot receive the title of rabbi upon graduation unless they receive at the same time, a degree from a university. An exception is being made for students from the old country, former students in European seminaries. They simply have to have a high school diploma. The institution supports the students. It pays the university expenses of many of them. The subsidy to the students, plus the salary of the teachers, and the other necessary expenses of the institution, make the cost of running the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>institution considerable, but it should not be difficult for a large and rich community like Jewish Chicago to raise the necessary funds.</p>
   <p>It is worth while to mention, in conclusion, that the Hebrew Theological College has a library which has over three thousand books of the rabbinical and modern Hebrew literature, including many rare books. Among the rare books, there is one called Sefer Hatrumo, written by one of the Talmud commentary writers, which was printed in Venice four hundred years ago. It is surely one of the oldest Jewish printed books. The library will soon be increased by another thousand books.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Theological College is an impressive institution, although not everything is running smoothly. One must not forget, however, that this is an institution in the making. The progress that has been made up to now leads us to hope that in the course of time, it will reach a high degree of development and will be an ornament to the Orthodox Jewry of America.</p>
