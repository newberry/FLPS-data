   <p>Mr. H. M. Meites, secretary of the Jewish Historical Society of Illinois, has finished, after ten years of unceasing labor, a great book--History of the Jews of Chicago. The printers have already finished their work and now it is in the hands of the bookbinders.</p>
   <p>A meeting of truly historical significance will be held on Monday evening, May 19, at the building of the Chicago Historical Society, Dearborn and Ontario Streets. The Chicago Jewish Community will be presented at this meeting with the book. The presentation will take place under appropriate and impressive ceremonies.</p>
   <p>It is expected that either Arthur Brisbane of the Chicago American, or the former vice-president [of the United States], Thomas R. Marshall, will be the chief speaker of the evening.</p>
