   <p>The conference for a daily labor periodical in Chicago that finally realized the old dream by publishing The World, at a meeting yesterday, held in the United Hebrew Trades Hall, 1145 Blue Island avenue, terminated that glorious chapter of its work, by creating the Jewish Socialist Publishing Association.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Socialist Publishing Association is an organization of representatives from three sections of the Jewish labor movement in Chicago - Socialist branches, trade unions, and the Workmen's Circle, and this association has now officially taken the paper under its control, guaranteeing its success by that great undertaking. After adopting the constitution, stating that every Socialist or Progressive organization may become a member of that body, the association immediately took up the question as how to enlarge The World to meet the great demand of the masses. It was understood that above all, it is important that our paper shall possess its own press, so that it should not be printed some where else, which creates considerable difficulties in publishing the newspaper in regular time. For this purpose, the association determined to issue loan certificates at five dollars and higher, for a general fund of $5,000.00</p>
   <p>The Jewish Socialist Publishing Association expects all workers and organizations that are in sympathy with the workers, as well as individual persons, to participate in the loan and help further the success of The World. The certificates can be redeemed within one year after its issuance, i.e. the association borrows $5,000 from the friends of The World for only twelve months time and then everybody will receive his or her money back for the certificates at maturity.</p>
   <p>The following were elected officers of the association: Hyman Schneid, president; Sam Diamond, secretary-treasurer; H. Snyderman, recording secretary, and I. Silverstein, sergeant at arms. Members of the administrative council are: H. Witt, M. Lerner, A. Stern, I. Blumen, A. Alpert, and L. Hanock.</p>
