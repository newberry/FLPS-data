   <p>Louis Ritman, a product of Chicago's West Side, has won an enviable name for himself in Paris art circles. He came to America with his parents, from Russia, about three years ago, and studied lettering and decorative designs at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. His talents attracted the kindly interest of two Chicago artists, P. C. Stohr and Rebecca Kruttschritt. Through their assistance he was able to secure commissions for portraits and had soon saved enough to study in Paris. Two of his pictures, "The Toilette," and "Sunlight" were accepted and hung in the Salon where they attracted considerable attention.</p>
