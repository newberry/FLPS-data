   <p>Banquet in honor of Mr. Adolph Krause.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Lodge of the order B'nai B'rith celebrated the re-election of their Grand Master, Mr. Adolph Krause to that office with a very impressive banquet yesterday evening.</p>
   <p>The banquet which was one of the most elaborate ever given by our German Jews, took place at the Hotel La Salle. Mr. Hugo Sonnenschein was toast-master. Mr. A. B. Zalenfreund, the Grand Secretary of the order B'nai B'rith spoke of the virtues of the organization comparing favorably with the World Zionist Congress.</p>
   <p>Mr. Samuel Alschuler spoke on the life of Mr. Krause, and being Mr. Krause's business partner, he was very well able to speak on the far flung activities of Mr. Krause. Congratulatory telegrams were received from all the lodges of the Middle Western States. The West Side Jews were represented at the banquet by Mr. B. Horwich, Leon Zolotkoff, and Mr. S. B. Komaiko.</p>
