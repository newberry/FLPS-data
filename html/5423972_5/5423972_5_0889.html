   <p>$5,000 is waiting for someone!</p>
   <p>Last week we issued a challenge to the Courier, which has not been accepted to date.</p>
   <p>We are prepared to give $5,000 to any charity if the following statements are proven false!</p>
   <p>1. That the Courier has no more than 1/3 of circulation which it announced in a notarized circulation-statement.</p>
   <p>2. That the Forward has twice as much paid-circulation in Chicago as the Courier.</p>
   <p>(Adv.)</p>
