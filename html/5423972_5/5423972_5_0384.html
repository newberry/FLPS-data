   <p>The Symphony Club Orchestra gave the fourth and final concert of its season on Tuesday evening, at Central Music Hall. Director Jacobsohn is developing the talent at his command to excellent effect. Von Suppe's Overture, "Poet and Peasant," was surprisingly well done, likewise the new Kensington waltz by Liebling. Ambrose Thomas' overture "Raymond" was fairly well done. Jerome O'Connell, a new member of the orchestra essayed the difficult trombone solo, Wagner's, "Evening Star."</p>
   <p>One of the most interesting features of the evening was a violin solo by Mrs. E. S. Jacobsohn, Spohr's "Concert No. 9."</p>
