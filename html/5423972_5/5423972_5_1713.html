   <p>The Jewish District in Douglas Park will be enriched by a new important institution, which, it is hoped, will be of good benefit to the young Jewish generation of that district. It will be a Hebrew school for girls. The need for such a school has long been felt in that district.</p>
   <p>The school for girls will be opened in the Anshe Knesis Israel Synagogue, 3411-19 Douglas Blvd. The school, under the supervision of Miss Anna Goldberg, will impart Jewish girls with a strictly Jewish education; it will be open every afternoon and on Sunday mornings from 10 to 12.</p>
   <p>The opening will be solemnized next Sunday at 10 A.M. Rabbi Ephraim Epstein will discuss the importance of such a school for the Jews of Douglas Park District. Drs. A. Levenson and Katkow will speak on timely subjects <span class="page-break">\2</span>in English. Cantor Vladavsky and his choir will render beautiful musical selections.</p>
   <p>The education of Jewish girls in the typically Jewish spirit and in religious folk-lore and Jewish history is one of the chief problems of American Jewry, which can only be attained through specially well-organized Hebrew schools for girls. Unfortunately, the vast Jewish population of the Douglas Park District have until now been short of such a school. It is only hoped that every Jewish mother and father, to whom the Jewish future of their children is so dear, will not neglect to send his or her daughters to this school.</p>
