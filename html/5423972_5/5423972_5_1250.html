   <p>The drive for new members for the Hebrew Theological College is in full swing and is going well. Representatives of twenty-two synagogues in Chicago met Monday evening at the Hebrew Theological College. Mr. Sam Ginsburg was chairman of the meeting. The speakers, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein and Rabbi [A.] Cardon, urged that the drive be supported; as a result of their appeal, those present at the meeting pledged to enroll twelve hundred new members.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Theological College will give a banquet next Sunday evening at six o'clock at the College, Douglas Boulevard and St. Louis Avenue. This banquet will be one of the most beautiful affairs Chicago Orthodoxy has ever had. The most prominent Jews of Chicago are expected to attend. Over three hundred reservations have already been made. The invitations committee for the banquet consists of: Samuel Phillipson, chairman; B. J. Schiff, treasurer; B. Horwich, Louis Bomash, Max Shulman, Emil Broide, Louis Brosilow, and J. M. Hofman.</p>
