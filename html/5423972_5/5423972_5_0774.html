   <p>A club composed of Jewish professional people has been organized recently in the interests of the Hebrew University in Palestine. The formation of such a club seems to be very timely just now to judge by the response which has been evoked at the various meetings already held. The club fills a distinct place in the community. Since there are, no doubt, a great many who have been eagerly awaiting the formation of just such an organization, an open meeting has been planned for next Sunday. A social hour will follow the meeting. A cordial invitation is extended to all interested to come Sunday evening, February 4th, at Steinway Hall.
