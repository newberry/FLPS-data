   <p>The Chicago Hebrew Institute will now have as its superintendent, one of the most capable Russian-Jewish men in America, Mr. Philip Seaman, former superintendent of the St. Louis Educational Alliance, and now associated with the New York Removal Office, (Immigrant Society).</p>
   <p>The committee, confronted with the task of selecting a suitable man for this important office, announced yesterday that, after a great deal of correspondence, Mr. Seaman finally has agreed to accept the position.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Seaman has been for many years connected with charity work. As superintendent of the St. Louis Educational Alliance, he was liked by all classes of Jews.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seaman departed from the St. Louis Educational Alliance because his energy requires a larger field for activity.</p>
