   <p>There are four thousand Jewish children attending Talmud Torahs in Chicago at the present time, and we must see to it that at least sixteen thousand more children enter the Talmud Torahs during the next few years. We must build new Talmud Torahs because we do not have enough Talmud Torahs to take care of such a large number of children. We must also train a great many new Hebrew teachers because there are not enough of them at present to teach so many children. Another thing: Many parents do not understand the necessity of sending their children to Talmud Torahs. We will, therefore, have to send the parents to the Talmud Torahs first, so that they can learn what their duties are. We also need money to build new Talmud Torahs, and, since we do not have any money, we must raise it in order to build those Talmud Torahs.</p>

   <p>To sum up: We have to train Hebrew teachers, we have to build Talmud Torahs, and we have to do something to convince the parents that they must send their children to Talmud Torahs. Otherwise, everything is all right and we have grounds to be proud of the condition of Jewish education in Chicago.</p>
