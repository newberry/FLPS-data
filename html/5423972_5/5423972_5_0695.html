   <p>At one time the effective literature originated with the classical drama or with the great lyrical poem. That time has long since passed. Today, as we become more "developed" and more "educated," such literature does not begin with the poem. But with the newspaper advertisements. Today, the press dominates the literary field and the most important part of the press is devoted to the interests of the publishers and the public, not the half-literary text, but the "unliterary advertisements." With this "development" we, who devote our lives to literature, cannot rejoice, however, we can not escape it. A newspaper that has many advertisements can also, if it wishes, publish good literary contributions. If it hasn't enough advertisements it cannot even publish half-literary articles. What I mean to say is that the literature, as it is afflicted at present, is entirely dependent on economic factors. The times no longer exist when a litterateur devotes his entire life to one literary piece; when the poet sacrifices himself for his muse-today, the writer and poet also want to live better. They can only live <span class="page-break">2</span>by their literary efforts, provided the press publishes their literary work and pays them well for it. Today one can not eke out a livelihood from books alone--only the few great dramatists and novelists can live off their books. Today the press itself must be the medium between the creative writer and the public. If the press is powerful economically, the literature of the people can develop normally, making it possible for the writers to thrive and work. However, if the press is financially below the mark, as for instance among us Jews, art is exposed to beggary and the literature develops only through miracles.</p>
   <p>I need not mention that nearly twenty-five of the literary productions in modern Hebraic and Yiddish literature, were first made known through the press. Bialik and Peretz, Chernichowsky and Rosenfield, Sholom Aleichem and Mendele, Jacob Cohen and Schneur, at first published their finest works in newspapers and journals. These men have no profession other than in the literary field, and must live by their writings.</p>
   <p>If the multitude of Jewish and Hebrew writers are paupers, the only reason for <span class="page-break">3</span>it lies in the impoverished condition of the Jewish and Hebrew press. The Jewish newspapers have few advertisers because there is neither Jewish trade nor Jewish industry. The only Jewish business from which the Jewish, and especially the Hebrew press profits a little, is the business of the biblical literature, and particularly sacred objects, as phylacteries, prayer shawls, door-post schedules. (parchment schedule with inscriptions from the Bible, attached to door-posts), or by doubtful doctors for still more doubtful ailments.</p>
   <p>Although, there is no Jewish national trade or industry to support the Jewish and Hebrew press, there could still be a fragmentary power having more influence on Jewish life if publishers would be more practical. The Jewish or Hebrew journalist is almost likened to the Jewish Reverend. He has become a journalist, not because he is qualified or because he possesses the required political and social background, but because he could become nothing else, hence, our press is not taken seriously by the public.</p>

   <p>What is the "Hatcheiyah"?</p>
   <p>It is a New York Hebrew newspaper founded by a Jew from Warsaw, Poland, who came to New York, and with no conception of the living conditions in America, established, on the day following his arrival, this journal. It features neither advertisements nor articles--it only offers complaints to the Jewish public. I could furnish more examples of similar publications.</p>
   <p>Even the large Hebrew publications that have some influence on literature and Jewish life, display illiteracy, sophistry, and political ignorance. The reportorial work is poor, the so called light they shed is often too dim to be seen, the information on Jewish life is inaccurate, and the feuilleton is as poor as a gypsy.</p>
   <p>To the youth, the Hebrew newspaper is a plaything, to the elders a luxury. The Jewish young man, having a knowledge of Hebrew, considers it his duty to contribute to the newspaper so that his name can be seen in headlines. But <span class="page-break">5</span>one might have a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, and yet have no literary ability. Writing at such a low degree is turned into a football in the hands of sophists. I am sorry to say that, with but a few individual exceptions, this writing is only a plaything for naive and incompetent youngsters and uneducated grandfathers. Thus, the Jews do not realize the significance of a Jewish press, because they lack the national Jewish, responsible sentiment.</p>
   <p>If an English or French journalist knew an important fact and believed that the publication of this fact would harm his nation, he would never publish it, regardless of how poor he happened to be, because he is not only a journalist, but also a citizen possessing politico-patriotic, responsible sentiment. A Jewish journalist (of course there are a few exceptions) can not abstain from publishing such facts, even though he realized the harmful consequences.</p>
   <p>I do not want to accuse any individuals because I am not considering this from a personal, but from a politico-historical point of view.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>A people who have lived two thousand years without a country, thereby, not living a national-political life, can not have the same highly developed social and political responsible feelings as people living a normal political life.</p>
   <p>What is the moral of this article? That the Jewish and Hebrew press must have at the apex, educated and cultured men. The Jewish and Hebrew press can acquire influence, not through economic factors, but through the personal, intellectual, and moral superiority of its members.</p>
   <p>The fate of our literature depends upon our press, and the fate of our press depends upon its directors and representatives. And so long as a portion of the directors of our press will be uneducated men, without fully developed responsible sentiment, and without literary ability, it will remain what it is today; and fine Jewish literature will continue to ask alms.</p>
