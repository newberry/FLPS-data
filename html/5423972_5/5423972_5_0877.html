   <p>[Translator's note: The Jewish newspaper Forward has a daily column entitled "Bintel Brief", a bundle of letters.]</p>
   <p>The "Bintel" paper, which is run by a few boys, is very anxious to get advertisements because experienced businessmen advertise only in a newspaper which brings good results. The "Bintel" paper gets its advertisements in various ways. It begs for some, others it gets by threats and terror, others it obtains through Democratic or Republican politicians, to whom it promises indirect support before election, and others it gets on the basis of a percentage proposition. The last-mentioned kind of advertisement it receives from concerts, cantors, balls, and theaters. It takes tickets from the advertiser in payment for the advertising. It forces individuals and labor organizations to buy those tickets, and thus it earns a few cents. No <span class="page-break">2</span>responsible newspaper conducts its advertising business that way. No private newspaper, no party newspaper, whether conservative or radical, would sell its advertising columns the way the "Bintel" newspaper does.</p>
   <p>Recently, when the Courier exposed this method of doing business by the "Bintel" paper, the "Bintel" paper replied by publishing a list of "important firms" which advertise in its pages and do not advertise in the Courier. These firms do not advertise in the Courier because the Courier does not sell its advertising columns for small change. Moreover, the Courier demands payment for its advertisements because advertising is a business and because advertising in the Courier brings good results.</p>
   <p>The "Bintel" paper, as mentioned above, published a list of "important firms" that advertise exclusively in it. This list can now be augmented by the name of a new advertiser who advertised a certain product as a "medicine for epilepsy and convulsions, nervous sickness, constipation, headaches, physical <span class="page-break">3</span>weakness--impotence," a medicine that is prepared by none other than the "great rabbi Jarachmiel Gdaliah Zucker, of Brooklyn, New York."</p>
   <p>GOOD NEWS FOR ALL SICK PEOPLE</p>
   <p>of Chicago and vicinity:</p>
   <p>Everybody in the United States Knows about</p>
   <p>RABBI ZUCKER'S</p>
   <p>patent medicines for epilepsy, convulsions, nervous sickness, rheumatism, and headaches. These medicines are registered in the United States Patent Office and the Health Department of the city of New York. Many people use this medicine and all receive good results from Rabbi Zucker's patent medicine. We, therefore, announce that Rabbi Zucker will remain in Chicago for an indefinite period, and anyone who needs his <span class="page-break">4</span>medicine can visit his office,</p>
   <p>1248 SOUTH KEDZIE AVENUE.</p>
   <p>Office hours are from ten in the morning until one in the afternoon, and from five to six in the evening.</p>
   <p>This is the ad of the rabbi's miracle medicine. No responsible paper would print such an advertisement. The Courier rejected a contract for three hundred dollars which Rabbi Zucker sent in for his advertisement. The Courier did not want to be a party to the sale of a medicine which is of doubtful value. Furthermore, Rabbi Zucker is facing a law case against him in New York.</p>
   <p>The "Bintel" paper, being very eager to get advertisements, sent a representative to Rabbi Zucker as soon as it learned that he was in town. The "Bintel" paper obtained forty-eight dollars from the rabbi for this advertisement, which it printed on Wednesday, featuring it with a special heading so that the "comrades" would buy the medicine, and Rabbi Zucker would have good results <span class="page-break">5</span>from his advertisement. Thus he would be induced to pay more money to the "Bintel" paper for printing his advertisement.</p>

   <p>Just as the "comrades" refused to buy the ham and pork which the Bintel paper urged them to buy, so the "comrades" refused to buy the doubtful medicine from Rabbi Zucker--and Rabbi Zucker now demands his forty-eight dollars back. "Bintel" boys, give the rabbi back his money!</p>
   <p>We include in our columns a photograph of the rabbi's advertisement and a photograph of the receipt for the forty-eight dollars, which the "Bintel" paper gave the rabbi. The rabbi's advertisement suddenly became nonkosher on Thursday because the rabbi refused to pay another forty-eight dollars for the advertisement. "Bintel" boys, pay the rabbi back his money!</p>
