   <p>Mr. Noel, owner of Queen Theatre, 2543 North Avenue, has had the bright idea of importing films from Ole Olsen's Film Company in Copenhagen, which are being enjoyed by a great many Danes every Monday afternoon and evening. It is a genuine pleasure to sit in the theatre and recognize buildings, streets, and landscapes, and see some of the foremost Danish exponents of this new art. Most of the films are of excellent quality, technically as well as artistically.</p>
   <p>Next Monday "Bonds of Passion" will be presented, and the following week a picture will be shown with Mrs. Betty Nansen, the Sarah Bernhardt of Scandinavia, in the leading role.</p>
