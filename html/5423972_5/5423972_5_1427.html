   <p>In discussing the question of the curriculum in our Talmud Torahs, a more serious attitude toward that problem should be taken than the one assumed by the above-mentioned gentlemen [Herman and Gordon] with regard to the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah. One has to be more or less objective in one's attitude. One must consider seriously the fundamentals of the various curricula, the circumstances under which they are taught, and then compare the results. To do so, a knowledge of pedagogy, child psychology, and so on is required. Since they do not have any logical and factual arguments, the gentlemen mentioned above, hurl insults and abuse not only at their opponent, Ger Ve-toshav [the phrase is used as a pen name, signifying that the author is a resident of Chicago, but is a stranger as far as Hebrew school politics are concerned], but also against all Ivrith Be-Ivrith [teaching system in Hebrew schools: Hebrew subject matter explained in Hebrew] Talmud Torahs and their teachers. If we had wanted to engage in abuse and becloud the issue, we could have said many personal things against <span class="page-break">2</span>the chief offender, Mr. Gordon Yerushalmi (who comes in daily contact with ninety-nine per cent of the children who attend the Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs). But we will not do so because professional ethics do not permit it, and because, by engaging in personal abuse, one cannot prove the usefullness or the lack of usefullness of a curriculum.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Herman and Gordon made a mistake when they confused a system and a curriculum. This is absolutely incorrect. One can give a thorough religious education in the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system and a very radical education in the "translation" [i.e. explaining the Hebrew subject matter in Yiddish] system. One can teach the Prophets, history, literature, even Talmud in the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system, and one can teach Karl Marx and Plekhanov in the "translation" system. It is also possible that nothing may be learned or accomplished under either or both systems.</p>
   <p>Ivrith Be-Ivrith is not a new invention and not a specifically Jewish invention. This system is recognized by our greatest pedagogues and literary <span class="page-break">3</span>men, as well as by all prominent pedagogues of the world, to be the best and the easiest pedagogical system. The adherents of the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system think that it is the only system that does not dull a child's mind and that makes it easier for him to learn the Hebrew language, and to read Hebrew.</p>
   <p>The Ivrith Be-Ivrith system is a national necessity with us Jews, now that our nationalist ideals have been awakened. Only through that system can we make Hebrew a living language. We actually see that in Poland and Lithuania, Hebrew culture has, in the last few years, reached a high stage [of development] only because in all Hebrew schools, the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system has been introduced (those children also speak a good Yiddish). Hundreds of high schools and seminaries have been opened, at the head of which are well-known pedagogues, who are known all over the Jewish world for their devotion to the Jewish people. In the older high schools and seminaries, the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system was also introduced. The Ivrith Be-Ivrith system is also recognized and has been introduced in the best and greatest Talmud Torahs of New York, as well as throughout America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Most of the teachers there are not only good Hebraists; they are also good Talmudists.</p>
   <p>It is not our task now to discuss the correctness of the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system. To do so, would require a series of articles. At the present time, we only want to reply to the assertions of Messrs. Herman and Gordon that the Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs in America are a failure.</p>
   <p>It would not help to argue with them, so we will answer with facts. We assert (and we assume full responsibility for this assertion) that children who have attended an Ivrith Be-Ivrith school in Chicago for about four years, speak Hebrew fluently, know the Pentateuch thoroughly, as well as the Prophets, history, folk tales, laws, customs. They have a good knowledge of modern Hebrew literature, read Frishman, Mendele, Sholom Aleichem, Friedberg, and others fairly well. The Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs have libraries from which the children of the intermediate and higher classes take Hebrew books home to read, and they actually read those books. The <span class="page-break">5</span>children of the Ivrith Be-Ivrith Talmud Torahs are devoted to those institutions and participate in all of their activities.</p>
   <p>Has any one of the Talmud Torahs which use the "translation" system accomplished as much? You, Messrs. Herman and Gordon say "Yes;" we say "No". Very well! Let us come together and elect a certain number of impartial persons, well-known scholars in Chicago, and let them investigate the conditions in all the Talmud Torahs of Chicago. The results of this thorough investigation should be reported in the Courier. We will then appeal to the community leaders of Chicago (who have at heart only the success of the educational institutions) with the words of Elijah, the prophet: "If the Lord be God, follow him". If the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system is a failure, discard that system and introduce the Ivrith Be-Yiddish [Hebrew subject matter explained in Yiddish] system! But if Ivrith Be-Ivrith is a better system, if the children who study that system can accomplish more than the children who study under the Ivrith Be-Yiddish system, then discard the Ivrith Be-Yiddish system <span class="page-break">6</span>and all "translation" systems, and introduce the Ivrith Be-Ivrith system.</p>
