   <p>The "Ford-Ward" [Editor's note: Name given by Courier to Forward because latter prints Henry Ford's ads] to celebrate its fifth anniversary, distributed three thousand dollars to "charity". Included in that amount is five hundred dollars for the Gewerkschaften [Jewish labor unions], which means the "Ford-Ward"; five hundred dollars for the Workmen's Circle, which means the "Ford-Ward"; five hundred dollars for the Socialist party, which means the "Ford-Ward"; two hundred fifty dollars for the Cook County Socialist party, which means the "Ford-Ward"; all these organizations support the "Ford-Ward" by their advertisements. Giving money to them means taking money from one pocket and putting it into another. There are in Chicago a great many philanthropic and cultural institutions, such as the Marks Nathan Orphan Home, Home For The Aged, the inmates of which are, for the most part, <span class="page-break">\2</span>poor Jews; in the majority of cases, they are former workers or orphans of Jewish workers. The "Ford-Ward" did not even give them one cent. There is in Chicago a Hebrew Theological College, where three hundred sons of poor Jewish parents, who are in most cases workers, are studying. The "Ford-Ward" did not give them one cent. There are in Chicago many Jewish Talmud Torahs, which are all attended by children of poor Jewish workers. The "Ford-Ward" did not give them one cent. The recipients of its charities are the Gewerkschaften, which means the "Ford-Ward"; the Socialist party, which means the "Ford-Ward"; the Workmen's Circle, which means the "Ford-Ward"; the "Ford-Ward" believes that charity begins at home. There is in Chicago an organization called Bread To The Hungry, which feeds the hungry; there is the H. I. A. S. [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society], which helps the destitute immigrant. The "Ford-Ward" has not a cent for them but it donates money to the Socialist party of Chicago and of Cook County, which will use the money to advertise in the "Ford-Ward." The "Ford-Ward" thus gives charity to <span class="page-break">\3</span>itself and it bluffs the people into believing that it gives charity to the poor and helpless. Henry Ford also gives such charity.</p>
