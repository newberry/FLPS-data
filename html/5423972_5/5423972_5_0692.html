   <p>Last evening more than 1,200 people filled the assembly hall of the Hebrew Institute and with enthusiasm greeted the noted Jewish writer and dramatist, David Pinsky, now in Chicago for the first time.</p>
   <p>It was a thrilling moment when Pinsky was introduced, at the close of the evening, arranged by the Dramatic Literary Society, when from all sides roses were tossed on the platform. It was one of the most spectacular welcomes ever given to a Jewish writer by the Chicago intelligentsia.</p>
   <p>In addition to a colorful musical program, Dr. Israel Marcus, chairman of the evening, introduced the following speakers, who greeted the honored guest in behalf of their organizations:</p>
   
   <p>L. Areshkes of the Dramatic Society, Attorney Julius Sovitsky, J. Duo, secretary of the Literary Club; Dr. Hyman Cohen, D. Aberson, H. Sneid, and many others. This reception of Mr. Pinsky was remarkable in that it showed how interested we are in Jewish literature. Mr. Pinsky emphasized this in a brief talk before reading his one-act "Beth Shevah."</p>
   <p>David Pinsky will address the meeting of Local 197 of the Amagamated tomorrow evening at 409 S. Halsted St. The tailors will surely not fail to attend this lecture by their beloved friend.</p>
   <p>Pinsky will address the National Labor Alliance Wednesday evening in the Hebrew Institute.</p>
