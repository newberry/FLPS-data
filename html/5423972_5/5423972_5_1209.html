   <p>This is a plain notice to the rabbis and synagogue presidents of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah, in which more than a thousand children receive a Jewish education, will be closed if Mr. Leizerowich, the president of the institution, is not able to pay to the teachers the back pay due them for many months of work in the past semester. The condition of the teachers is very tragic and shameful. The condition of the Talmud Torah is a shame to the Jewish community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Nobody will reopen the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah if it should be closed. The responsibility for the existence of the Talmud Torah lies upon the rabbis and synagogue presidents of Chicago. They can bid good-by to the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah if they do not raise immediately an emergency fund <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of a few thousand dollars to pay the poor teachers. No president of a West Side synagogue will be able to evade his responsibility and his guilt if the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah should now be closed. I mean you, Messrs. Joseph Weil, Morris Salk, Jacob Cohen, and the presidents of the other big synagogues. Well, what do you expect to do?</p>
