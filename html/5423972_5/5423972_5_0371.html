   <p>Piano School.</p>
   <p>Our Piano School was continued throughout the year. The registration for the year was 51 - 46 female and 5 male, against 37 last year, with a total attendance of 368 against 451 the year previous. Owing to the great demand made upon this school it was decided to keep the school open five days a week instead of four as heretofore. While as yet we have not discovered a Rubinstein or a Mozart, we have nevertheless enabled a good many children to cultivate a taste for music, and in time perhaps even to develop superior talent. A charge of 25Â¢ per lesson was made.</p>
