   <p>The members of the Shuchrie Shopas Ever gathered this Simchas Torah at their club rooms to celebrate this truly Jewish holiday in the good old fashioned Jewish way. They spoke of the Torah which is the greatest pride of the Jew. They are therefore jolliest on this day. One could feel strongly the atmosphere of Jewish anthusiasm and happiness.</p>
   <p>The Shuchrie should be frequented oftener by the Jewish people. Everyone is heartily welcome. There are interesting books to read, not only in Hebrew but also in the Yiddish. Quite a number of them are in the Yiddish literature.</p>
   <p>Also many Hebrew and Yiddish newspapers from Russia and elsewhere. If you wish to enjoy a cultural evening be sure to visit the club rooms of the Shuchrie Shopas Ever.</p>
