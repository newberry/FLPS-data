   <p>The cooperation between the Jewish People's Institute and the Jewish Board of Education has resulted in the establishment of yet another Jewish educational problem at the Institute, in the form of an extension High School which will meet every Monday and Wednesday evenings in the Shelley and Browning rooms. The purpose of this new school will be to supplement the Jewish knowledge of the high school boy and girl who has brought to a halt the Jewish training of his youth. Under capable, well-trained teachers, the following subjects will be taught: Jewish History, from the earliest to modern times; Jewish Literature in a general survey; Modern Jewish Life; and Hebrew. These four courses together comprise a Jewish background that will serve every Jewish boy and girl in whatever Jewish situation he may find himself.</p>
