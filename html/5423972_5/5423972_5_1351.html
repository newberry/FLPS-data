   <p>When the campaign was being carried on for the erection of a Hebrew Theological College, the leaders of the institution publicly declared that there would be three divisions in that building, viz., a talmudic elementary school, a rabbinical seminary, and a teacher's college.</p>
   <p>The doors of the Hebrew Theological College are open, and hundreds of young men are now seated in the comfortable, light, and warm rooms, engaged in their studies. But, so far, nothing has been said of the establishment of a teacher's college, which, after all, is far more important and of greater significance than the rabbinical college because, whereas one congregation of 5,000 members requires only one rabbi, the very same congregation needs five teachers; the education of the youth is more important than anything else in Jewish life.</p>
   <p>If it is true that the Holy Temple was established primarily for the sake of <span class="page-break">2</span>little children, it is also true that Palestine will be rehabilitated only when the Jewish youth know what Judaism means. Should illiteracy be perpetuated, and further extended, through the scarcity of teachers, American Judaism will have no future, because the only foundation of Judaism in the Diaspora is knowledge--knowledge of Judaism, both practical and theoretical. And if the source of this knowledge dries up, then--then we will represent the last generation of Jews in America. The generation that will follow us will doubt its Judaism, and the third and fourth generations will have but a faint memory of Judaism. If there is a power, an agency, that can save American Jewry from going under, that agency is the Hebrew school, the Talmud Torah, the Heder [Old World type of Hebrew school] the Heder Metukan (reformed Hebrew school), etc. In order to have Hebrew Schools in America, we must have Hebrew teachers, and one of the objectives of the Hebrew Theological College is to found a teacher's college, and thus provide a generation of teachers for Talmud Torahs and Heders.</p>
   <p>If the Hebrew Theological College does not try to do what it promised, if it does not organize a teachers's college--it will not fulfill its purpose.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>From the very beginning, we supported the Hebrew Theological College as much as possible. We gave it more attention than any other institution because we realized how important it was. We appealed to Chicago Jewry in behalf of this institution because we had a firm and definite assurance that a teacher's college would be organized. The other two divisions of this institution are certainly necessary and worthy of our support--but the most important division, in our opinion, is the teacher's college. Apart from the fact that a teacher's college has not been organized, not even a word is said about organizing it.</p>
   <p>This we cannot understand, because the directors of this institution ought to know that the public will support the Hebrew Theological College only when it has a teacher's college, and each day that the announcement of the establishment of a teacher's college is deferred, the institution suffers both materially and morally. In Chicago there are Jews who will support the Hebrew Theological College only when it has a teacher's college. There are Jews in Chicago, who will double and triple their subscriptions to the College when the teacher's college is established. It is also in the interest of the other two divisions <span class="page-break">4</span>of the institution that the third division should be established.</p>
   <p>We hold it our duty to call the attention of the directors of the Hebrew Theological College to the fact that the promise they gave the public should be kept immediately.</p>
   <p>Until now the Hebrew Theological College was probably in no position to do what it should have done. But now, when the reorganization of the management and leadership has been completed, there is no excuse whatever for not establishing the teacher's college. A promise by the directors of such an important and recognized institution to the public is sacred--it must be kept--and no excuses can be accepted. If the Hebrew Theological College believes that it is competent enough to maintain a division in which rabbis are trained, then it is certainly competent enought to maintain a teacher's college. We believe that it is much easier to organize a staff of teachers and professors for a teachers college than it is for a rabbinical seminary, because Chicago possesses adequate facilities.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The teacher's college must be opened soon, if the Hebrew Theological College is to strike a deep root in the Jewish life of Chicago.</p>
