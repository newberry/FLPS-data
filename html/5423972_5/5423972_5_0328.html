   <p>To the Lodges and Societies.</p>
   <p>This is a letter to officers of the different Jewish charitable organizations. Dear Officers: I realize that you are aware of the fact that winter is knocking at our doors and you will need lots of funds for your charitable undertakings, much more now than at any other time of the year. This is the opportune time to study and formulate plans for the raising of funds for the necessities of the poor, this winter.</p>
   <p>As a possible method, allow me to suggest a Theater Benefit. As a means of raising money for charitable purposes in a large lump sum. Therefore, as I am manager of the Louis Metropolitan Jewish Theater, the only Jewish Theater in Chicago, which satisfies the public fully, permit me to suggest the following plan to you gentlemen: We play every evening with matinees Saturdays, and Sundays, the prices are reasonable, and we always have a capacity house.</p>

   <p>Our Theater is ready and willing to serve you by letting you have as many theater tickets as you desire. You sell them on a commission basis and we can assure you of very profitable results.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>Jacob Louis, Mgr.</p>
   <p>Metropolitan Theater.</p>
