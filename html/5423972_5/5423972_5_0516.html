   <p>Yesterday a few hundred people greeted the opening of the Bezalel Exhibit in Sinai Center, 46th Street and Grand Boulevard. Many prominent Jewish civic leaders, who were among the guests, were the first ones to purchase Jewish antiques produced in the Jewish homeland by Jewish artists.</p>
   <p>Jews representing practically every stratum of the Chicago Jewry were present among them, Mrs. Rosenwald, the mother of Julius Rosenwald, and her daughter, Miss Isenstradt; Mr. and Mrs. H.A. Loeb; Judge and Mrs. Julian W. Mack; Professor Kolin; Dr. and Mrs. Stolz; Mr. and Mrs. Greensburg; Mr. and Mrs. Israel Cowen; Dr. Yudelson; Mr. and Mrs. Isenstein; Judge Hugo Palm; I.B. Lipson; D. Hecht; Mrs. Fish;Max Cler, and a committee representing the council of Jewish women.</p>
   <p>The first patronizer of Jewish art was the mother of Mr. Rosenwald, the famous <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>philanthropist; and the second was her daughter, Mrs. Nathan D. Caplan. A great number of visitors followed the precedent set down by the first two buyers, and Professor Shatz was immediately in receipt of many offers for his artistic work.</p>
   <p>The crowd was immensely pleased with these specimens of Jewish art, which are being displayed for the first time in Chicago. Every person left the exhibit satisfied at having witnessed the great strides made by Jewish artists in so short a period.</p>
   <p>The exhibit itself was a beautiful sight which enraptured everyone. Costly oriental rugs were displayed in all corners and knitted and weaved articles represented Jewish biblical scenes. On one small carpet there was a picture of a meditative shepherd leaning on his staff and keeping watch over his sheep. Other carpets bore different Jewish pictures. The crowd, who stood discussing the significance of these pictures, was momentarily carried back to Jewish biblical times.</p>

   <p>Later in the evening the crowd was augmented by more visitors. A great number of Jews from the West Side did not wait until the exhibit had gone to them, but came to it. This also brought together many Jews from various sections of the city, who came to witness the fine artistic work of the Bezalel School.</p>
   <p>In the early part of the evening, the religious group made Professor Shatz the center of their attention. With a pleasant smile the professor received the men and women who came to introduce themselves. A very busy man, with long black hair through which there could be detected some silver threads, the professor fluttered to and fro and, climbing to the stage with agility of a youngster, described the articles to the prospective buyers.</p>
   <p>When the crowd drew close to the stage, they saw a richly decorated four-cornered glass case which attracted their attention. The card on it bore the name of Nathan Strauss, who bought it. The glass case was the work of Borris Shatz himself.</p>

   <p>When the Courier's reporter left the exhibit, a long row of automobiles were parked around the temple and throngs were still trying to enter it. At the time a moderate wind was blowing over the quiet boulevard, just the right setting for the imagination to wander off to those far away places where Jewish artists are still creating such artistic masterpieces.</p>
