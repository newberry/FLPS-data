   <p>The Chicago Jewish community is expectantly awaiting, with satisfaction merged with curiosity, the visit of the talented Jewish poet, M.S. Blumgarten, better known to lovers of Jewish poetry under his pen name, "Yehoash." A reception committee of perhaps a hundred intelligent Russian and German Jews, has been formed for the special purpose of welcoming the honored guest with all due cordiality that he deserves. On Sunday evening, May 9th, a literary evening and a concert will be given in his honor, at which the poet will recite some of his own poetry. A program of the finest music and recitations has also been arranged.</p>
   <p>Those who were instrumental in arranging this reception deserve our sincere thanks. We do not know of any other Jewish writer or poet in America who deserves as much adoration and respect from Jews as Yehoash.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of Mr. Yehoash's visit is not to claim the honor that the Jews of Chicago owe him. He comes here in the interests of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society at Denver. Mr. Yehoash, who was forced to move to Denver because his lungs had been affected by tuberculosis, is, naturally, interested in the sanitarium for Jewish tubercular patients. Mr. Yehoash devotes much of his time and talent to helping the institution which is doing great work in saving many consumptive people from a premature death. In the East, his visit was a tremendous success, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and it is hoped that it will be as equally successful in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Jews in Chicago have a two-fold reason for arranging a reception for the great Jewish poet; first, to give honor and respect to one of the finest Jewish poets of the age, and second to help a great charitable cause, a cause which will save thousands of lives from the dreadful white plague.</p>
