   <p>On Saturday, February 4, 1911, The Sentinel made its appearance in Jewish Chicago. Louis Berlin and Abraham L. Weber were publishers and they promised a weekly journal devoted to Jewish interest. On its first appearance it contained the following announcement: "We intend to publish for an intelligent Jewish public, a Jewish newspaper devoted to its interests, without regard to the particular class to which the reader may belong. In promising that we shall discuss many Jewish questions, we have in mind that this term is broad enough to include questions relating to Jews reformed and orthodox, or the Jews, who have equal respect for both and all classes. The fact remains that however differentiated among themselves they may be, Jews have many interests in common, and the chief events affecting one class affect no less the others."</p>
