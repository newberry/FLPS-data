   <p>Chicago's Jewish Annual Ball. This ball is the only public affair is which Chicago Jews will have the opportunity to get together with their wives, sons and daughters and enjoy a truly enjoyable Jewish evening in an up to date style.</p>
   <p>This ball must bring in enough money to build the new home in Chicago for the 200 Jewish orphans. The 24th of December is the day of the ball at the Colosseum and we expect the Jews of Chicago to come to the ball in masses and thereby assure the building of the orphans home, which will be called the Marks Nathan Jewish Orphan home.</p>
