   <p>During the past year we started a monthly publication, called the Chicago Hebrew Institute Observer. The purpose of this unpretentious pamphlet is to enable the members of the Institute as well as many outsiders, to keep in touch with our work. In addition thereto, articles and editorials are published, having particular bearing on the work of the Institute, which we hope may be of some benefit to social workers. The pamphlet also contains a column on vocational guidance contributed by specialists in the various professions and occupations. We are glad to report that this enterprise has thus far met with great success. Some of our material has been quoted and favorably commented upon in various papers of the country as well as by individuals.</p>
   <p>Subscription to this paper is fifty cents per year, including postage. We regret to say, however, that the number of subscribers is not as large as we had hoped it would be by this time. At present we have 384 subscribers. We hope, however, that in time at least the members of the Institute will find it worth while to subscribe. At present we are mailing this pamphlet even to those members of the Institute who have as yet not subscribed. Those who have had any experience at all in such work will realize that it is not a very easy task: we need the cooperation of at least the members of the Institute in order to assure the success of this enterprise, which we feel is very much needed in our work.</p>
