   <p>The purpose of the Socialist schools is to educate the children in the broad and free spirit of International Socialism, while at the same time not neglecting the explanation of the various factions and differences of principle within the Socialist movement, nor ignoring the intellectual abilities of the children. The child should be trained to think for himself on various questions and problems. A feeling of tolerance for opposing view points also should be inculcated within him; but, most important is that the child be developed into an independent thinking man.</p>
   <p>Yiddish should be taught and spoken in the schools, and all courses should be taught in Yiddish. Jewish history and legends, Literature, Music, Tradition, etc. should not be neglected. All courses must be presented according to the Socialist interpretation of events and in accordance with the intellectual capacity of the child. In the discussions which are to be held regularly with the children, the discussions should concern themselves with workingmens' problems.</p>
