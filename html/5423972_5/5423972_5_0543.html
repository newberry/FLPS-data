   <p>The Jewish youth of Chicago should take advantage of this opportunity and come to the ball en masse, for not only will they enjoy themselves, but they will also share in this noble Institution-The Hebrew Institute, which was founded with the sole objective of implanting Judaism and American Patriotism among the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>To miss this affair will mean to lose an evening of merriment, of which you may have sweet memories in the years to come. Jews of all walks of life will participate in this affair, and this offers an opportunity, to meet people, whom you have not seen for a long time, and whom you will not be able to meet elsewhere.</p>
   <p>The need for the Hebrew Institute is deeply rooted within the hearts of Chicago Jews, and it is therefore, our sincere hope that this ball will be a success.</p>
   <p>Remember the ball Sunday evening, where you will surely enjoy yourself and help lead a Jewish Institution to success.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute is located at Taylor, Little and Sybley Streets; All cars take you there.</p>
