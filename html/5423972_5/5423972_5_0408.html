   <p>A splendid, festive program of entertainment will be presented in the Lawndale Theater, on the second night of the Passover. Theater lovers will enjoy a very interesting melodrama with delightful music. Jennie Goldstein, popular Jewish actress, will play the leading role. The name of the play is, "Her Golden Dream."</p>
   <p>Miss Goldstein made a big hit with this role in New York, and it is certain that she will be a big success in Chicago also.</p>
   <p>This noted actress has been absent from Chicago for the last three years. During those years Miss Goldstein played on the English stage with enviable success.</p>
   <p>The length of Miss Goldstein's stay in Chicago is not determined as yet. However, she may perform here for at least six weeks.</p>
   
   <p>Miss Goldstein is beginning her performance Thursday night.</p>
   <p>The coming program in the Lawndale Theatre will include Morris Schwarts, Molly Picon, and Michael Michalesco.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday night, the well-known Celia Adler bid farewell to her Chicago fans. The theater was filled with admirers who came to say good-by, to her, and also to see her in the title role of "Street Women."</p>
   <p>The plot of the show was gay and sad in turn. The performance was splendid. Miss Adler was unique in her role.</p>
   <p>The artistic performances of the two famous Hebrew actors, formerly with the Moscow Art Theater, and later with the Habima, have aroused great interest among the intelligent theater patrons.</p>
   
   <p>These noted artists were highly praised for their artistic performances by Gorki, Stanislavsky Shaliapin and noted Jewish critics.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vardi is an exceptional comedian, his characterizations bringing laughter and happiness to his audiences.</p>
   <p>Madam Yoliet will recite passages from the Bible and also Hebrew poems from classical and modern Palestine.</p>
   <p>Vardi will play roles from his own plays. He will perform scenes from the Russian Revolution and show pictures of American-Jewish life and scenes from Italy and Palestine.</p>
   <p>Among his popular presentations will be the "Jewish Mother;" "Trotzky near the Red Square;" "The Japanese and the Jen Tribes;" "Three and Four;" "Sabbath in a small Town," and numerous other worth while and entertaining numbers.</p>
