   <p>Every Jew in Chicago is ready to accept the job of a director in an institution; every Jew in Chicago wants to be a socially active person. All this is very fine, but how many directors of Jewish institutions in Chicago know what is going on in those institutions, and how many of them care at all about those institutions?</p>
   <p>Forty Chicago Jews have undertaken to be directors of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah. Perhaps they feel that Chicago needs such an institution. The title, "Director of the Chicago Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah", sounds good, and what Jew does not want to have a fine-sounding title? But when the president of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah calls a meeting, only six or eight Jews appear, and the others stay home and yawn.</p>
   <p>Well, I beg of you, my dear directors, social workers, social leaders--if you want to help the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah, then do your duty as it <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>should be done; do not run after a title for the sake of the title; that is not at all nice.</p>
