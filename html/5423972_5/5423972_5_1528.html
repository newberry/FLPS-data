   <p>To the parents who will visit the Northwest Side Radical Folk School.</p>
   <p>Today your children must not go to the public school. They should be at 1:30 P. M. in the school-house, 2642 Le Moyne, where the children will be organized into a children division for the mourning procession.</p>
