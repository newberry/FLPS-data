   <p>The Judisihe Presse of this city makes, apropos of the late judicial election, some very good remarks. It ascribes the defeat of Julius Rosenthal, Esq., to the callousness of our German brethren, to their indifference in the work against vulgar prejudices of the masses against the Jews. The Presse takes occasion to urge the Jewish nations of Russia and Poland to throw aside their exclusive habits and customs, and to become true children of this country, where the law knows no distinction between the rights of Jew or Gentile on account of religious prejudices.</p>
