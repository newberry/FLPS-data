   <p>Our last guest artist, Mr. Leon Blank, who has so many admirers in Chicago, and who always plays here to a full house, has not been successful with his latest play. He, personally, acted as usual--just as the audience likes it. His failure, however, should be charged to his manager, Mr. Edwin Relkin, and to the New York Actors Union which tricked him. Mr. Relkin was guilty of sending him to Chicago too soon after his recent success here, and the Actors Union of sending him poor supporting actors. The Union seems to pity the unfortunates and receives them into its folds regardless of ability. Therefore, Mr. Blank was tricked. Naturally, the Union does not have to worry about its good actors; they make their own way in life. For that reason, it concentrates on these others, and when the opportunity presents itself, they are sent out.</p>
   
   <p>This possibly helps the individual player but is a great hindrance to the Jewish stage, for these players do not hold the Jewish audience. Later, when a good troupe comes, the public becomes skeptical and unwilling to attend, thinking only that they will be fooled again. Such actors only discredit the stage and its good actors. If the Union had the interests of the theater at heart, it would be more careful to send out good supporting actors, and not "hams" who will only ruin the theater. We hope that in the future Mr. Leon Blank will not permit himself to be led by the nose by either the Actors Union or his manager, Mr. Relkin. If he cannot get a better troupe than this present one, he should remain at home and enjoy the much-needed rest he is entitled to after such an arduous and successful season.</p>
   <p>The failure of Mr. Leon Blank is to be regretted since it followed so close upon his greatest theater success in Chicago. I am referring to his production of Peretz Hirshbein's "The Blacksmith's Daughter" supported by the troupe of Mr. Morris Schwartz. This troupe was triumphantly successful. Both the plays that they presented in Chicago, "The Forsaken Corner" and "The Blacksmith's Daughter", were received by the audiences with indescribable enthusiasm. It appears that our Chicago public knows how to appreciate good plays and good actors.</p>
   <p>In "The Blacksmith's Daughter", Morris Schwartz and Celia Adler gave such exceptional performances that the audience was simply enchanted by their acting. Such scenes as Chicago had never witnessed before delighted the audiences. The actors were literally carried on the shoulders of the crowd, while some even stopped to kiss Mr. Schwartz. Celia Adler's acting was one of wonder upon wonder. Often in the same scene, the entire range of human emotions was brought into play. Besides, she was original throughout in all her movements. Her role was so well portrayed that Mr. Hershbein can thank her as much as the public [for the success of the performance].</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Vichial Goldsmith played the role of a grandfather which the audience enjoyed immensely. Ludwig Zatz proved, with his small part in the fourth act, that an artist can create something out of nothing. Peretz Hirshbein could never have believed that such an insignificant part as played by Ludwig Zatz in the "Blacksmith's Daughter" could produce so much genuine humor and laughter. Now we can readily understand what chances Mr. Leon Blank could afford to have taken with his present troupe after these productions with Morris Schwartz, Celia Adler, Ludwig Zatz, and Vichial Goldsmith.</p>
