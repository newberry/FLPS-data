   <p>Before us lie three volumes of biblical stories published in English and entitled, Scripture Stories, by Dr. Mendel Silber. These biblical stories were written by Dr. Silber especially for the Jewish-American youth in order to acquaint them with the Book of Books and also to instill them with the Jewish spirit and Jewish sentiment.</p>
   <p>Such books are very helpful to the young Jewish-American generation, and Dr. Silber has done a splendid thing by contributing these stories as a gift to young Jewish readers. Dr. Silber has done for young Jewish readers what Charles and Mary Lamb did for the broad English-speaking masses by their popularization of Shakespeare's dramas. Prior to the time of these two writers [Charles and Mary Lamb] Shakespeare's dramas were little known to the broad masses. The intelligentsia read them, but to the broad masses they were a sealed book. Charles and Mary Lamb felt the need of retelling Shakespeare's dramas to the people in a popular and simple style and their work was crowned with success. Hundreds of years after Shakespeare's death, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the English-speaking masses have, through Charles and Mary Lamb's stories, begun to realize that so great a genius as Shakespeare lived at one time, and they have begun to go to the theaters to see his immortal dramas enacted on the stage. The critics of Charles and Mary Lamb have rightfully designated them as "the discoverers of William Shakespeare".</p>
   <p>Similar to the work of Charles and Mary Lamb is the work of Dr. Silber who retells the biblical stories for young Israel. He discovers the Bible for them, and thereby awakens in them an interest in further Jewish studies. These retold biblical stories were written by Dr. Silber in very simple and attractive language, appealing to young readers.</p>
   <p>Since the Bible cannot be studied without commentaries, Dr. Silber sprinkles his narrations with comments and logical morals so that the young readers may learn, when they read these stories, Jewish customs and laws and Jewish tradition in general.</p>
   <p>The great value of Dr. Silber's Scripture Stories lies in the fact that they <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>were written in a truly Jewish spirit and in harmony with Jewish tradition. Obviously there have been many popular biblical stories written for children, but they have been written either in the Catholic or in the Protestant spirit, and when the Jewish child reads the latter, they have an iniquitous influence upon his soul. Therefore Dr. Silber's books now occupy a niche among Jews that has hitherto been empty. The book has already been published by the New Orleans Jewish Ledger Publishing Company.</p>
