   <p>The enrollment in the classes of Chicago Sinai Temple Religious School for the year 1916-1917 was just over 800 with an average attendance during the months of October, November, and December of nearly 750. Quite a record when one realizes some of our pupils come from great distances as far north as Ravenswood, as far south as Homewood and Hammond.</p>
   <p>The confirmation class numbered 95 at the beginning of the year; the number has decreased somewhat. The confirmation class had an enrollment of 48.</p>
   <p>On December 24th the School celebrated Chanukah with a Children's Service in the Temple, and upon dismissal each child was presented with a box of candy. On March 20th, in commemoration of Purim, the children were given a fancy dress party in the Center.</p>
