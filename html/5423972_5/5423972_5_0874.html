   <p>Another statement that the Courier has no more than about 8,000 circulation in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Charles Roeske, under oath, swore that he had full charge in the circulation department of the Courier in Chicago, with the exception of the South Side. Therefore, he knows that the Courier circulation in the districts where he was in charge, was no more than 7,400. The Courier denied that Mr. Roeske had charge of this entire circulation. Last week we printed the affidavit of a driver, Hyman Goldman, in which he swore that he worked for Roeske almost a year, delivering the Courier. Today, we present another affidavit of a second driver who worked for the same Roeske about a year and a half, delivering the Courier after Goldman left. He quit his job this 10th of May.</p>

   <p>Affiant further states that he remained in the employ of the said Charles Roeske, doing the delivery of the Courier on this route from December 1920 to March 8, 1922, and after that, when Charles Roeske left the Courier's Service he continued to do the same work for Jake Lichten, who is in charge of the Courier delivery now, up to May 10, 1922, when he resigned.</p>
