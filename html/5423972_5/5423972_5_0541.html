   <p>Past Commanders Association. Order Knights of Joseph.</p>
   <p>We wish to inform our worthy public that we are having a minstrel show of 45 participants entertaining us at our Entertainment and Ball to be given tonight at the West Side Auditorium, 12th and Center St.</p>
   <p>We assure you a most pleasant evening of joy and entertainment. The actors, who have, incidentally, made their own costumes have assured us that they will spare nothing to entertain our public. Come and see what Past Commanders can do in the way of providing for your entertainment.</p>
