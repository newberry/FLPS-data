   <p>A triumph, in which intellect, fellowship, humanity, and art combined made of the pageant "The Romance of a People," presented at Soldier Field last Monday evening as a climax to Jewish Day at A Century of Progress Exposition, a thing to be remembered by Jews the world over.</p>
   <p>One hundred and twenty-five thousand Jews and Gentiles filled the vast spaces of Soldier Field, and watched and listened to the unfolding of a spectacle that brought to our consciousness and to our vision the vicissitudes, the trials, and the victories of our race in its progress and development in the course of its four thousand years of existence.</p>

   <p>Such a pageant, colossal in its inception, tremendous in its scope, and realistic in its art, has never been presented here before, and we must first of all give due praise to the originators of the idea, to the inspired labors of those who devoted their talents and their executive gifts to make of the event an outstanding occasion in Chicago's history and in the advancement of the Jewish race.</p>
   <p>Judge Harry M. Fisher, chairman of the Jewish Day Committee, acted as spokesman, and after the audience had assembled, about an hour and a half later the announced time for the opening of the pageant, introduced the guests of the evening, Governor Henry Horner, Professor Chaim Weizmann of London, the executive director, Isaac Van Grove, Rabbi Solomon Goldman, and Albert H. Rosenberg.</p>

   <p>"The Romance of a People" depicts in some six episodes, a prologue, and several interludes, the history of the Jewish race from what we might say the Creation to the present day. Many passages are from the Torah, from the Book of Genesis, from the Bible and from the stories of tradition of lore of the race.</p>
   <p>There were several distinguished principals in the cast, including Adolph Muhlman, the internationally famous baritone, whose voice had the resonance, the beauty and the musical qualities that have endeared him to all music lovers. Boris Schiffman, cantor of Rodfei Zedek Congregation, whose tenor voice entranced the huge audience with its clarity and range, Emma Lazaroff Schaver - not mentioned among the leading artists - who disclosed a high and brilliant soprano voice, and Avrum Mathews, who contributed much by his admirable singing to complete the cast of the principal singers. We must also give credit to Hannah Kichhaven, the leader of the Miriam Dance.</p>

   <p>The performance was enhanced by the spoken word, and by solo and concerted song, in which more than thirty-five hundred singers, actors and dancers took part.</p>
   <p>As for the music itself, directed with authority and genial talent by Mr. Isaac Van Grove, we may state that for the greater part it was traditional and handed down through thirty or forty centuries, from almost the dawn of recorded history. It was characteristically Oriental in color, in melodic line, and in rhythm. It has sturdiness, and at times pathos.</p>

   <p>How Mr. Van Grove controlled this immense ensemble without being seen is almost incomprehensible to the ordinary spectator, but the performance which lasted until nearly twelve o'clock, proceeded to the close without the slightest hitch of any kind. The immense chorus of several thousand mixed voices, the thousand dancers, and several hundred actors and their properties, had been efficiently drilled and rehearsed and went through the episodes of the pageant admirably.</p>
   <p>There were megaphones, and amplifiers, and the novel stage, and its lighting of the vast spaces of Soldier Field were all items in a most memorable occasion.</p>
