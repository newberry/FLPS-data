   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Kindly publish in your worthy newspaper the following report on the I. L. Peretz Literature Verein, branch of the A. N. A. F. No. 77:</p>
   <p>This branch meets the 1st and 3rd Sunday of each month. The meetings are mostly devoted to debates of every nature, lectures on all subjects, recitations and discussions. The purpose of the meeting is, in general, to develop the literary aesthetics of the members. This branch also has a library in which there are 250 books by different authors to suit the individual tastes of the readers. Winter is now setting in, with its long nights in which we can transact activities. We urge those who are nationalistically inclined to become members of our branch and support us in our important work.</p>
   <p>Trusting that you will publish this report. I remain,</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Molly Ginsburg, secretary.</p>
