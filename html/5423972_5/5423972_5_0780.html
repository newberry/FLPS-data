   <p>"Lelamed Bnai Yehudah" is the name of a new Jewish organization on the West Side, whose aim is to study Jewish history throughout the centuries of Jewish suffering. This organization was founded by Rabbi Isaac Kaplan of Congregation Agudath Jacob Anshe Kroz, and is sponsored by the Adas Bnai Israel, an organization founded eight years ago to foster observance of the Sabbath. Meetings are held every Tuesday evening at the Congregation Agudath Jacob on West 15th Street and South Homan Avenue, where part of the evening is to be spent in group study of Jewish history. A speaker will conclude the evening's program with an address on some Jewish question or topic.</p>
   <p>Large public meetings will be held November 14, 28, and December 12, 1920, in order to acquaint the Jewish people with the purpose of the organization. Rabbis S. Glick, Isaac Kaplan, A. Cardon, A. Fraum, and M. Fineberg have promised to help the organization. The charter is still open and all who are interested are welcome to join.</p>
