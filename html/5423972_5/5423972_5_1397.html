   <p>The [World] War and its aftereffects created great problems for the Jewish people, and the Jews in all the western countries are busy solving those problems. Every Jewish community in the western countries is busy raising money for relief, for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], and for other great, Jewish national enterprises. It is true that we have to exert all our forces to solve those problems, but we must not forget that we have some obligations toward ourselves and that we must fulfill those obligations. No Jew should think that by giving money for relief and for the Keren Hayesod, he has fulfilled all of his duties as a Jew. No Jew should contribute to the national Jewish undertakings at the espense of his local obligations. He must do his duty to our suffering people in Europe and to Palestine, <span class="page-break">\2</span>but he must not forget that he is a Jew at home, as well.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, many of our beloved Jews believe that by contributing to relief and to the Keren Hayesod, they have fulfilled all of their obligations to the local Jewish institutions. Giving money for Palestine and at the same time destroying the Jewish life here doesn't make sense. The Jewish life here must go on, regardless of how much we give for the great, international Jewish purposes. The discharge of one obligation does not release us from discharging other obligations.</p>
   <p>We call our readers' attention to this because we see that the relief and Keren Hayesod work have weakened our local Jewish work.</p>
   <p>A few months ago, the synagogue presidents and the rabbis of Chicago came together and resolved to begin to build a Hebrew Theological College, a very <span class="page-break">\3</span>important and necessary institution. The executive committee of the Hebrew Theological College immediately began to carry out the decision of the representatives of Chicago Orthodoxy. They began to build at once, in the reasonable expectation that those who had ordered the building to be constructed, would finance the undertaking.</p>
   <p>The foundation of the building was laid when the Keren Hayesod drive opened, and this, of course, gave all our civic workers plenty to do. They all threw themselves into the work for the Keren Hayesod, and they really accomplished a great deal in a relatively short time. They forgot, however, that besides having a duty toward the Keren Hayesod, they must also bear in mind their responsibility to the community and its needs. We regret to say that they have somewhat forgotten their local duties.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Hebrew Theological College expected that the <span class="page-break">\4</span>representatives of Chicago Orthodoxy would not neglect to finance this important local undertaking, although they were busy with the Keren Hayesod. The committee went on with its building work, and now the committee is in a quandary. The contractors do not want to continue the work unless they get some money and the committee has no money.</p>
   <p>Shall we stop the building activity? This would be ruinous to the institution. The entire organization will fall to pieces and the project would fail completely. It would be a shame and a disgrace to permit such an important and necessary institution, in which so many thousands of dollars have already been invested, to fail. It would be a moral death blow to the Chicago Orthodoxy. The Reform Jews and the radicals would laugh out loud, the Chicago Orthodoxy would lose its prestige, and it would become morally so weak that nobody would pay any attention to it.</p>
   <p>At stake, therefore, is not only the fate of an important and absolutely <span class="page-break">\5</span>necessary institution, but, primarily, the honor and reputation of the Chicago Orthodoxy. The Orthodox Jews of Chicago cannot and must not be indifferent to the future of the Hebrew Theological College.</p>
   <p>Well, what is to be done now? We cannot go on with the building activity because the treasury of the Hebrew Theological College is empty. On the other hand, we cannot stop our building activity because the entire organization, which was built at the cost of much energy and labor, would then fall apart.</p>
   <p>We do not despair of the future. We are confident that in the future the Orthodox Jews of Chicago will give generously to the Hebrew Theological College. We are worried, however, about the present critical condition. What can be done at the present critical moment to save the institution from ruin?</p>
   <p>It seems to us that the first thing to be done immediately, is to get the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Chicago synagogues to extend temporary help to the Hebrew Theological College. Each synagogue should contribute according to its means, but none less than one hundred dollars. Seven or eight thousand dollars can be collected this way in a short time. With this amount in cash, the committee will be able to survive the present financial crisis.</p>
   <p>In regard to the further financing of the institution, we must say that Rabbi [B.] Margolin's plan of selling a thousand certificates at twenty-five dollars each, appears to us to be both logical and practical. There are a thousane Orthodox Jews in Chicago, each of whom would be willing to contribute twenty-five dollars for the Hebrew-Theological College. Maybe some will buy two, three, or four certificates, and in this way, within a short time, another twenty-five thousand dollars can be raised.</p>
   <p>Finally, we must invite the women of Chicago to participate in this work. We <span class="page-break">\7</span>have in Chicago a great many Orthodox women who participate in our civic life and respond generously to every appeal made in behalf of a great Jewish undertaking. Women built the Infant Home on the Northwest Side, women built the Home For The Incurably Sick Jews at Oak Forest, women helped to build the Home For The Aged, and many other important institutions.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Hebrew Theological College must organize the women to help to do the work and they will do it; perhaps they will even do more than the men.</p>
   <p>To ensure the further existence of the Hebrew Theological College, these three proposals must be put into effect immediately. Later, it may be too late.</p>
