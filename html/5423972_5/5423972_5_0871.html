   <p>The Daily Jewish Courier has only 8,000 circulation. The following facts have established it beyond any doubt.</p>
   <p>1. On Monday May 15, we published an affidavit signed by Chas. Roeske, who worked for the Courier for the last nine years, and who was in charge of the circulation, in the Jewish section of the West Side, Lawndale District, Albany Park and the North Side. In that affidavit, Chas. Roeske stated that the net paid circulation of the Jewish Courier in March, 1922, was not more than an average of 7,400 copies daily. He also substantiated his statements by publishing copies of checks which represented the collection for the full circulation of which he had charge.</p>
   <p>2. The Courier answered in their issue of May 16-17-18 by first showering a torrent of abuse on the Forward and the said Chas. Roeske, and then by denying point-blank that Roeske ever had full charge of their circulation in the districts mentioned. Furthermore, they made a cut of the signature <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of Chas. Roeske, and above it have set up in type without any notary public seal or witnesses, a repudiation purported to come from Chas. Roeske, that the affidavit he published in the Forward was obtained through intimidation and threat of discharge by Mr. Turavlin, an employee of the Forward.</p>
   <p>3. Mr. Turavlin is suing the Courier for libel for publishing the above mentioned false statement about him, and the case is now pending in court. He has witnesses to prove that the affidavit obtained from Chas. Roeske, was given in a voluntary and a legitimate manner. Suing the Courier for libel proves beyond any doubt the authenticity of the Roeske affidavit.</p>
   <p>4. On the 20th of May, we published an open letter to the Courier, wherein we made the suggestion that an impartial committee of advertisers should be formed and the Courier should open their circulation books to them, in order to show their real circulation; or if the Courier objects to a committee of advertisers, they chould become a member of the Audit Bureau <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of Circulation and this bureau should investigate their circulation books. The suggestion was not answered.</p>
   <p>5. On Sunday May 21 - we published an affidavit signed by Mr. Hyman Goldman in which he states, that he was working for Chas. Roeske for eleven months in 1920, doing the delivery of the Courier for him. This affidavit corroborates Roeske's statement, that he had full charge of the Courier's circulation.</p>
   <p>6. On Monday May 29, we published an affidavit signed by Mr. Harry Greenberg in which he states that he also worked for Mr. Roeske, doing the delivery of the Courier, from December 1920 to May 10, 1922, and that he (Roeske) had full charge of the Courier's circulation.</p>
   <p>All the above facts, establish beyond any doubt that the Courier's circulation in Chicago is not more that 8,000 daily.</p>
