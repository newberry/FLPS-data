   <p>Although many Jews of Chicago, adhering to the class interested in the Hebrew language, will not approve of everything that Mr. I. Suballsky, the publisher and editor of the Hayahudi, stated when appealing to Chicago Jewry, to help him establish a newspaper, printed in Hebrew, in America, there will be many who will contribute, no less than one dollar to such a fund and there will apparently be several who will contribute an honorable sum.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago will not contribute toward this fund because of the reasons expressed by Mr. Suballsky in his appeal. The conception, that the American, or the Chicago, Jews are mendicants or parasites because they are satisfied merely with Hebraic newspapers from abroad is not only ridiculous but also very naive.</p>

   <p>If Mr. Suballsky will publish the Hayahudi in America, and if he will have as many subscribers as the European - Hebrew newspapers have in America, he will not exist very long.</p>
   <p>Lovers of Hebrew, nationalistically minded Jews, rabbis, shochtim, cantors, and Zionists have no more reason to subscribe and to render aid to an Hebraic newspaper than the common layman, especially when the editor confesses that his newspaper will be an impartial one. The newspaper will hold the interests of nationalists, if the paper will be nationalistic; rabbis - if city publishes biblical literature; cantors - if it publishes musical literature; it is not the language in which a party man is interested, it is the matter which is being treated.</p>

   <p>It is neither pitiful nor disgraceful that two million Jews are unable to support a small Hebraic press; they can support one should they want to. They fail in their support not on account of meanness, but merely because it is a Jew, holding reactionary ideas, who appears disguished in the word "Hebraic Press" and wants to impose his opinions upon the great masses.</p>
   <p>The reason why Mr. Suballsky will receive the support which he requests - and from the non-Hebrew patriots - is due to the fact that we are well off materially and everyone will do his best to give Mr. Suballsky, or others an opportunity, to establish and support an Hebraic newspaper.</p>
