   <p>The average reader of Jewish newspapers often resents the apparent monotony of the reading matter. It seems to him that the Jewish newspapers are publishing every day the same news, and that the articles are all on the same style and on the same subject.</p>
   <p>To a certain extent, the resentment has a certain foundation in fact. One may take any Jewish newspaper, a daily or a weekly, and one will find nearly every day or every week the same news--pogroms, Jewish massacres, anti-Semitism, anti-Jewish riots, Jewish oppression, Jewish persecution, slanderous libels against the Jews, and so forth and so on. We have only to look on the locality of information to know the contents of the information. If the news comes from Warsaw, it means Jewish oppression, Jewish persecution. If it comes from Lemberg, it means Jewish wholesale pogroms. If the news <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is dated London, it means either an attack by the Morning Post against Zionism, or a new libel against the Jews, or it may have something to do with Zionism, and the Zionist organization. If the news comes from Budapest, we know that it carries a message of woe and pain.</p>
   <p>So it is to a certain extent true that Jewish newspapers are monotonous, because Jewish life is monotonous; that is to say, it consists of one phase only. Of course, we are not the only people that is subject to suffering and persecution. There are many more people on God's earth who suffer just as bitterly as we do, if not more. But still their life is not as monotonous as ours, because they are not as passive as we are. If they suffer, they make their enemies suffer too. If they are being beaten, they sometimes beat their enemies too. And often enough they even enjoy full revenge.</p>
   <p>That is not the case with us. Our people is beaten and maltreated, but no <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>one has the desire and the opportunity to beat and to maltreat others. For instance, there is an "Armenian-Turkish war", that is to say, a Turkish plan of massacre of Armenians. The victims are the Armenians, but still there are a few Armenians who take up arms against the Turks, and wage war against them. It has never happened yet that Jews should have an opportunity to do likewise. We only hear of Jewish pogroms, but we have never heard of the Jewish pogroms against their enemies, we have never heard of Jewish counteracting the Poles. This being the case, the Jewish news is often monotonous, and we do not blame the reader who is getting tired of it.</p>
   <p>What is true of Jewish news is also true of Jewish newspaper articles. No conscientious Jewish journalist can overlook the two main activities of the present time--of relief work and Zionism. And most of our publicists are actually devoting their time and their ability to the elucidation and exposition of these two problems and all the problems related to them. The Jewish press, if it should discharge its duty conscientiously, must devote <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>its energy to these two problems, on the solution of which depends the future of our people in Europe and in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Other peoples, better established than we are, have a life richer in colors than ours. They have their own government, their army, their navy, their administration, their domestic problems, their social and artistic problems, etc. But we are at present interested only in two problems--Zionism and relief. And hence the monotony of the Jewish press. But unless we solve these two problems satisfactorily, we will never have a richer life, and the monotony will perpetuate itself, so that in order to overcome the monotony, we must at present devote all our energies to the solution of these two problems, even if we feel the monotony strongly. A well established Jewish homeland in Palestine, and a settled Jewry in the Diaspora, will brighten Jewish life, and will give it tone and color, and will make our life more interesting and the Jewish press will be more interesting, too.</p>
