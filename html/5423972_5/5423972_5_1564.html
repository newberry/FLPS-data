   <p>Kehilath Jacob Center School</p>
   <p>After many attempts the Kehilath Jacob finally succeeded in getting Mr. Mandel <span class="page-break">\2</span>Schure to become chairman of their Hebrew school. Mr. Schure was one of the organizers of this school and its first chairman. Under his administration the school made great progress and received the compliments of other schools and served them as a model.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that with Mr. Schure's advent into the office of chairman, the school will derive great benefits and will again become a model school in the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the "Hebrew Camp"</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the newly organized Hebrew Federation of the Vaad Hapoel [Board of Workers], the program committee handed in the program and rules which they had worked out and according to which the general Hebrew activities of Chicago and vicinity are to be carried on. Every point of the principles and problems was taken up and discussed; and with few changes <span class="page-break">\3</span>and modifications, the rules were approved.</p>
   <p>It was decided to organize immediately two classes for adults on the West Side. One class for beginners will be held every Tuesday evening, and a more advanced class, every Wednesday evening. All those who wish to join one of the classes in order to learn Hebrew should go immediately to Dr. H. Epstein, 1259 West Twelfth Street, and register.</p>
   <p>A general open meeting will be held this Saturday, June 15, at 8 P. M., at the Kehilath Jacob Center, Hamlin Avenue and Douglas Boulevard. The problems that are before the new Hebrew movement will be explained at this meeting. The principles of the Federated Hebrew movement will also be read and discussed. Members [of the organization] and friends of Hebrew are invited to come en masse.</p>
