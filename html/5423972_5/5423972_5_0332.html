   <p>Jews in the Theater Professions.</p>
   <p>Jews in America and in other countries as well, have perhaps at present more than their share of representation in the theatrical world. Some of the most famous producers, managers, and theater owners in America are Jews. Moving pictures, which are only beginning to make headway are also controlled by Jews.</p>
   <p>Can it be that Jews have a special leaning toward the theater? The opera in America has its greatest support from Jews. Although not many of the operatic stars are Jews, most of the musicians and members of the choirs spring from our people.</p>
   <p>A prominent theater manager writes in response to our query - "The truth is that there is something in the theater that attracts Jews. Perhaps it is because the theater combines art and business, such as no other business contains. My friends have told me that the Jew is a natural born actor and where the opportunity for both business and art present themselves, the Jew is perfectly at home.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Jew is an artist and a poet. This can readily be seen from the great poetic works of our people which constantly reverberates through history. The Jew is also a traditionally good business man. Therefore the Jew's adaptability to the theater can readily be seen."</p>
   <p>Another Jewish theater manager writes - "The Jews have stabilized the theater. Managers no longer run away from their companies if they become stranded in some small town. This practice has been greatly curtailed since the advent of Jews in the theater management and producing fields."</p>
   <p>Still another writes - "I would not like to say that Jews are the greatest actors, although our people have given the world very fine actors. However, the rank and file of actors in theaters are composed almost entirely of Jews. It seems to me that the Jew seeks not the money that he can earn, but the freedom, the spiritual freedom, and the freedom of the soul. The Jew finds that he can more easily <span class="page-break">3</span>develop his personality and individuality on the stage, and that is why he is so well represented in the acting profession."</p>
   <p>No matter how we look at it, the Jew has an active part in the theater world of today - be it in the grand opera or in the cheap burlesque houses.</p>
