   <p>Jewish Day at the "Century of Progress Exposition" reached its climax Monday night when 125,000 men, women and children crowded Soldier Field to witness a Biblical pageant, "The Romance of A People."</p>
   <p>Music handed down through forty centuries filled the stadium as 6,200 performers told the story of a people's struggle to find God and bring freedom to the earth.</p>

   <p>On a stage that rose tier by tier at the north end of the Field, the cast under the direction of Isaac Van Grove, conductor of opera and the symphony, portrayed in the mediums of music, light and mass, the trials of Israel from the day of creation. It was a striking spectacle; the benedictions sund by white-robed priests whose bejewelled breast plates flittered; the roar of ram's horn trumpets, the tolling of bells, the waving of palms, and the movement before the eye of the shifting lights and masses of the drama.</p>
   <p>In the vast audience were thousands of Jews from every part of the United States and many from Canada and other countries, representing every shade of orthodoxy and liberalism. Attending as a unit were the 5,000 delegates and friends of the Zionist Organization of America, whose annual convention yesterday pledged $8,000,000 to carry out a four-year program of colonization in the Palestinian homeland.</p>

   <p>"The Romance of A People" began with the creation. A tiny shaft of light pierced the darkness of Soldier Field and focused the silent expectancy of the throng on an altar in the center of the field, where lay the Book of the Ages. A solitary figure turned a page. Out of chaos, at the bidding of the word, came order. A blinding light fell upon the scene depicting the first ecstacy of being and the adoration of the creator.</p>
   <p>But the psalms of adoration died away and again the voice spoke, but now with sadness: "They forsook God". Unchained ambition, passion and fear ruled in tumult; hunger, birth and death tormented men.</p>

   <p>He peopled the world with demons. His child he hurled into the lap of Moloch, while Baal claimed his daughter's virtue and Mammon his conscience. A scene of Abraham's sacrifice flowed into that of the land of the Pharaohs. A fierce sun heat down on thousands of slowly swaying slaves. The masters' whips stung, but Abraham was forgotten. The great idea - the allegiance to God - had faded.</p>
   <p>YOKE OF BONDAGE THROWN OFF.</p>
   <p>An apparition detached itself as from a wilderness; the burning bush and: "Moses, the one God, the God of Abraham, the God of Justice, Commands your service. Bend not your backs to idols. Liberate yourself from Egypt's sins. There are prophets in our flesh and martyrs in your bones."</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The vibrant voice of Miriam rang out in triumph as the people, freed from the yoke of bondage, breathed again the free air of the desert. In a pastoral interlude came the vision of Israel established in her land.</p>
   <p>Now Israel was assembled before the temple. The shofar trumpeted; thousands of white hands flashed in the light and there was the soft melody of prayer.</p>
   <p>A sudden clanging dissonance struck a note of terror. A golden eagle glittered. Flags fluttered, and the muffled trend of the hosts of Rome was heard. Titus captured Jerusalem with carnage unequaled in the long history of wars. Into a new slavery were the remnants of the people driven. Then nearly 2,000 years of wandering and exile as nations rose and fell, and triumphs were commingled with defeats.</p>

   <p>Again the stage blazed, now with the Stars and Stripes, symbol of a new land and a new freedom. The temple glowed with a new brilliance and an exultant voice cried: "Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof."</p>
   <p>Just before the figure at the altar turned the last page of the great book was the scene of Israel at home again, after ages of wandering. "And he shall judge between the peoples, and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."</p>
   <p>The light slowly faded. The star remained. It shone on all the world.</p>
