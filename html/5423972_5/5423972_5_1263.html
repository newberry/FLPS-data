   <p>The [Jewish] Educational Council in the city, which should have been formed years ago, but which is only now being organized, faces a great task: to improve the existing Talmud Torahs, to organize new Talmud Torahs, and to introduce a common program for all Talmud Torahs. Its first task, however, should be to put some pressure upon the Jews of Chicago to send their children to the Talmud Torahs. This is the most important thing of all. We will have Talmud Torahs, we will have teachers, and we will have a responsible and productive Educational Council [only] if all Chicago Jews send their children to the Talmud Torahs. As long as the Jewish Masses of Chicago are not conscious of their duty to the Talmud Torahs, as long as they do not send their children to the Talmud Torahs, just so long will the Educational Council only attempt to improve the existing Talmud Torahs, and its activity will, naturally, be very limited. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>Educational Council should immediately begin some intensive propaganda work among the masses in behalf of Jewish education; it must be effective propaganda, if the Council wants to broaden its activity.</p>
