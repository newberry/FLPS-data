   <p>In almost every European language, there is a popular literature dealing with medical problems, and problems of hygiene. All scientific authorities in the field of popular health are convinced that everyone of us can, with the aid of preventative measures and so-called home remedies, better protect himself against various diseases, than a physician can, after the body has been attacked, as a result of carelessness. Our Jewish literature, unfortunately, has very few popularly written medical books or books on hygiene.</p>
   <p>If we omitted Dr. Liber's periodical Our Health, which no longer appears, and Dr. Lande's well-known "library" dealing with sexual diseases and their cure, there is no book available in Yiddish, dealing with the problem of the people's health.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Parlin's attempt to enlighten the Jewish masses in a short, popularly <span class="page-break">2</span>written brochure about the important problem of dental diseases and oral hygiene is, therefore, a very important and welcome contribution to Jewish scientific literature, from the point of view of health and from a sociological point of view.</p>
   <p>In his brochure Your Teeth And Your Health, the author expresses his opinion, based upon experience and observation, that although the dental profession has achieved remarkable progress in the field of curing and mending sick teeth, it has done very little to eradicate dental diseases which are ruining human health, and it has done very little to enlighten the masses in the way to avoid dental diseases.</p>
   <p>Dr. Parlin discusses the chief causes of sick teeth, of their decay, of the pain they cause, of the bad effects sick teeth have upon the entire body. He describes briefly the anatomy of the teeth, and he demonstrates, using illustrations, how the parasitic bacteria which arise and multiply in an unclean mouth, destroy all the elements of the teeth, including the nerves; <span class="page-break">3</span>how they are carried by the digested food into other healthy parts of the body, how they weaken and sometimes paralyze the proper functioning of those healthy parts of the body. The author shows many easy ways of taking care of the teeth, which are a very important part of the body, not only from an esthetic, but also from a functional, physiological point of view, and tells us how to guard the mouth against disease.</p>
   <p>Dr. Parlin has given a great deal of attention to the pathological condition of the teeth during pregnancy, and their care [during that period]. He also discusses children's teeth and their development. This is an important social problem.</p>
   <p>The most remarkable part of the brochure is the chapter discussing the statistics on dental diseases, drawn up by the [public] schools. These show, by actual figures, how the neglect of oral hygiene by school children affects their intellectual capabilities and their educational progress. The author also proves that intellectually backward children <span class="page-break">4</span>become normal as soon as their teeth are properly attended to.</p>
   <p>Dr. Parlin also points out the sad fact that the United States does not have a sufficient number of dentists for such a large population; there is only one dentist for every two thousand inhabitants, most of whom suffer from dental disease and need dental treatment.</p>
   <p>The contents of the brochure Your Teeth And Your Health are arranged systematically and carefully. The language used is so simple and idiomatic that even an ordinary reader will understand it easily. In a way, this book may prove the best cure for an average person's dental trouble, because it will convince him that the removal of the causes of a sickness is of greater importance than the curing of the sickness itself. We hope that the work of Dr. Albert Parlin will gain the recognition of all Jewish organizations, particularly of Jewish labor unions, who are concerned with the health of their members.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It is very advisable that these unions should spread a great number of these useful, popularly written scientific brochures among the Jewish masses. They will save large sums of money paid out in sick benefits, because no sickness prevents a worker from going to his job as often as a chronic toothache, which robs him of his sleep, his appetite and his desire to work.</p>
   <p>It would be still more desirable if our well-known West Side doctors would follow the admirable example set by Dr. Parlin, and would write similar books on medicine in Yiddish for the people. This would help to remove many of the evils of society.</p>
