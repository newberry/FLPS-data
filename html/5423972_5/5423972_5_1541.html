   <p>The bakers have won a raise in pay. They accepted the raise--that's all there's to it. No one ever inquired how it came about, or who demanded a raise. That was left unaccounted for. The reason why this situation existed is that, in Chicago, our movement has not established educational centers similar to those in New York. The unions in New York have educational centers--regular universities of their own; while in Chicago such institutions are not to be found. The movement to establish educational centers in Chicago has never materialized.</p>
   <p>A few months ago a representative of the workers' institute approached the United Jewish Federation, the central body of the Jewish unions, and asked them to take an interest in the movement to convert the workers' institute, located in the only building devoted solely to the workers, into an educational center, <span class="page-break">2</span>and to help support it. The federation considered this proposal seriously, and called special meetings of the representatives of the larger and smaller locals. Plans were made to convert the institute into an educational center, and an educational director was immediately placed in charge.</p>
   <p>We expected the locals to come to our assistance and enable us to record that the Jewish trade unions have accomplished something. But, to our sorrow, we cannot say they have.</p>
   <p>The following subjects were to be taught at the institute: speaking, reading and writing the English language, elementary and higher arithmetic, commercial law, economics, and psychology. Most important of all, the trade-union movement [would have secured], through an extension department, lecturers on topics which would have been discussed at union meetings. The instructors [for the proposed courses] were to have been: Professor McQuin, Professor Robert M. Lovett, Miss Wilcox, Miss Fogel and Director Irwin Saint John Tucker.</p>
   <p>This plan in itself is proof that everything was well on its way. The trade <span class="page-break">3</span>unions, however, did not take advantage of the offer made by the institute. Meanwhile, the conservative American Federation of Labor organized an educational center with a program similar to the one planned by the workers' institute. What is to be done now? A special educational conference must be called, and all the organizations must pledge a sum of money. Then, perhaps, something will be done. The problem of education must be the most important of all problems for all the organizations. Start today.</p>
