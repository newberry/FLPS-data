   <p>The Zeta Mu Phi Medical Fraternity, which is now meeting at the Hebrew Institute,has recently affiliated with the Aleph Yod He Fraternity. The former was organized in Chicago about six years ago, and now has chapters in all the leading medical colleges of the country. Its aim is the stimulation of interest in the solution of Jewish problems among medical students and physicians.</p>
   <p>The local chapter of the Zeta Mu Phi is now working on a proposition to amalgamate all the Jewish fraternities, medical and non-medical, in the world. According to Dr. Max Kern, originator of the idea, the purpose of the movement is to form one strong federation with a common object, the elevation of the standard of Jewish students.</p>
   <p>Plans are now on foot for the publication of a magazine to be known as the Zeta Mu Phi Herald, which is to be strictly Jewish in nature.</p>
   <p>Among the leaders in the federation movement, in addition to Dr. Kern, are Dr. Benjamin H. Breakstone and Carroll A. Teller.</p>
