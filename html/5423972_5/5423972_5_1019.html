   <p>A new jargon daily and weekly under the name of "The Jewish Call" was started here a few months ago in the Jewish Settlement on the West Side. Morris Rosenfeld, the celebrated poet of the Ghetto, was engaged by the publisher to assist in editing the new paper. He wrote a number of editorials and poems for the journal. The name of Rosenfeld and his poems gained for "The Jewish Call" a wide circulation.</p>
