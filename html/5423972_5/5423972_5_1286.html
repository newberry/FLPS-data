   <p>The members of the family of the late Nathan Fox are to be congratulated upon their noble deed, in donating six thousand dollars to the Hebrew Theological College in memory of the departed head of the family. They could not possibly have bestowed their generosity upon an institution that is worthier than the Hebrew Theological College of Chicago, for this institution is destined to make Chicago a center of Jewish learning and true Jewish piety, and the cementing power of Orthodox Judaism in the Middle West. The future of Orthodox Judaism in Chicago and the Middle West is indissolubly connected with the fate and future of Hebrew Theological College, and he who comes to the aid of this wonderful institution is strengthening the cause of Orthodox Judaism and the cause of Jewish learning. The institution will, in due time, produce a generation of Rabbis, scholars, Hebrew teachers, communal workers, and communal leaders. We therefore <span class="page-break">2</span>believe that it is the duty of every intelligent Jew in Chicago, who has the future of Judaism in Chicago at heart, to come to the aid of the institution and to assist it in every possible manner, so that it be in a position to continue its activities, to expand, to develop, and to become the center of Jewish light, knowledge, and true piety. The normal development of this institution is the best guarantee for a better Jewish generation in Chicago, and the best guarantee for the perpetuation of traditional Judaism in Chicago and the Middle West. By selecting this institution as the object of its philanthropy, the members of the family of the late Nathan Fox have displayed considerable wisdom and farsightedness, and have, in addition, set a wonderful example for others to emulate their noble deed. The Hebrew Theological College needs two things to promote its development, a large membership and a large endowment fund. Unfortunately it has neither, which is due to the fact that the institution has been in existence only a short while, and its leaders could not possibly have accomplished these two things.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>But we hope that the first business of the leaders will be to get a large membership, say of four to five thousand, and that it will also work on the endowments, toward which a good beginning has been made by this donation. The wealthy classes of our people in Chicago must realize that it is their duty to maintain not only charitable institutions, but also to support Jewish educational establishments. Among the Jewish educational establishments in Chicago, the Hebrew Theological College is the most important, because from this institution must come Jewish learning and true Jewish scholarship, and it must produce a generation of Jewish leaders for the entire Middle West. All other major Jewish institutions in Chicago have large endowment funds, and continue their work without finding monetary obstacles in their way. The Hebrew Theological College, however, growing from day to day as far as the number of students is concerned, does not have an endowment fund worth mentioning. It needs one more than any other philanthropic institution, because an academic establishment which is not in a position to distribute <span class="page-break">4</span>scholarships to its students cannot be a great educational center. The way of the young Talmudic student is not strewn with roses. As a rule, he belongs to the poor section of humanity, and he surely is entitled to continue his studies without feeling the pangs of hunger. For this consideration alone, the Hebrew Theological College must make an effort to secure as large an endowment fund as possible, in a relatively short time. The Fox family has made a beginning and has set a wonderful example to others. Now let others do their part.</p>
