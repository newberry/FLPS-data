   <p>There was a meeting last Monday night at the Hebrew Institute. A great many Jewish civic workers gathered at the invitation of the [Jewish] Federation [of Orthodox Charities] to discuss Jewish educational problems in Chicago. The first speaker, Rabbi Ephraim Epstein at once raised the question of the teaching method, and all the other speakers of the evening, with the exception of Mr. Horwich, stressed that point. Mr. Horwich, head of an educational bureau in Boston, in a very interesting speech, laid greater emphasis upon the content of Jewish education than upon its form.
