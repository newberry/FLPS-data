   <p>Among the many newspapers expecially the Anglo-Jewish weekly periodicals, which deluge a newspaper office and which a journalist is subject to peruse, we have found this week the Sentinel. This weekly periodical, which is published in Chicago, is new to us.</p>
   <p>When opening this periodical, with the usual yawn which a writer is wont to give when he is about to look through the large stack of papers and journals, we become intensely interested in it. We immediately notice that the Sentinel is somewhat different from all other Anglo-Jewish weekly journals. It is a novelty in the Anglo-Jewish newspaper world.</p>
   <p>We have in mind the literary side of this journal. The news items are treated much the same as in all other periodicals. As far as obituary notices or social announcements are concerned, the Sentinel is no exception to the rule.</p>

   <p>Naturally, the Anglo-Jewish periodicals are organs of the editors. Most of the editors of the Anglo-Jewish periodicals are rabbis. And in most cases the rabbis' articles are merely a repetition of their sermons. Therefore most editorials appearing in the Anglo-Jewish newspapers are along religious lines and not secular.</p>
   <p>The Sentinel is distinguished from all other newspapers because its editorials do not only correspond with but are rather diametrically opposed to the views of the editor. In this respect, the Sentinel is almost like the daily Jewish newspapers. The editor of the Sentinel is Rabbi Abraham Hirschberg, a Jew who "believes" that every Jew who is a Zionist ought to be deported from America. Yet the Sentinel is adorned with the Star of David and its associate editors are constantly disseminating the principles of Zionism.</p>
   <p>Upon looking at the Sentinel, with the Star of David and Rabbi Hirschberg as editor, all this caused us to cease yawning.</p>
