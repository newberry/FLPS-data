   <p>A movement has arisen on the Northwest Side to establish a modern Hebrew kindergarten. This movement is well worth the moral and financial support of the Jewish people. One of the greatest and most difficult problems in Jewish life is the problem of rearing children. The old-fashioned Jewish Heder [Old World type of Hebrew school] has almost entirely disappeared. The mighty stream of time, against which there seems to be no power of resistance, began long ago to wash away the Heder's foundation. And those who thought its structure was eternal have begun to feel that in a little while it will sink into the sea of oblivion. Those whose vision was directed toward the future, forsook this structure in good time; they began seeking new ways, new directions; they began to build a new foundation for the system of rearing and educating Jewish children that would be in keeping with the spirit of the time.</p>
   <p>But to say that the younger Jews have already found the way and the place would <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be overstating the case. They are still in the process of seeking, of contemplating, still in a state of imagining. All of the accomplishments are still provisional, experimental; they are moderate tests, not the result of practice or experience.</p>
   <p>And here in the process of building [a new educational system], a question arises. What kind of material should be used so that the result may be blended into a form, a figure, in which shall appear the outlines of the Kaporeth (the drape covering the ark of the covenant), the Aron (ark of the covenant), the Luhoth (the tablets of the Ten Commandments), and the Kerubim (angelic figures placed in a hovering position over the ark), and which shall not include an Egel (calf--reference to the Golden Calf which the Hebrews worshipped in the desert), a figure of an idol, an image of an alien people, of an alien spirit?</p>
   <p>Many are not concerned with the specific Jewish spirit and traditions, and (as the Hebrews in the desert), dance before the calf which wanders stupidly over to alien camps to which it lures its followers, where they intermingle <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with the rest and disappear from Jewish life.</p>
   <p>Experience has already shown this to be true on many occasions. We have seen the results of assimilation and indifference; those Jewish sons and daughters who are strangers to the Jewish feeling and spirit, whose Judaism consists only of the fact that after their death they are given a Jewish burial. It is thus entirely superfluous to introduce any more facts to demonstrate the decadence of that course.</p>
   <p>However, there are those who are concerned only with "pure" Jewish education, which, at the same time, is in keeping with the spirit of the time. These have a difficult task before them. On the one hand, they have the indifference of the parents toward a Jewish upbringing; on the other, the apathy of the children for Jewish learning. The Jewish parents of this country usually do not lead a traditionally Jewish life and are little grounded in the modern nationalism, the Neo-Judaism which seeks new bases for the security of its existence.</p>

   <p>And therein lies the importance of a Hebrew, or, as we shall call it, in a broader sense, a Jewish kindergarten, which will influence the child when his first impressions are being formed. Through games, the children will become acquainted, in this Jewish kindergarten, with Jewish and Hebrew expressions, names, and proverbial lore. It will be a reproduction of that particular period when we were first brought to the pedagogue and were shown, for the first time, the A B C's with a hand-sized pointer, and the angel dropped us a penny from heaven. [Translator's note: A relation or teacher standing behind the child drops a penny from overhead as a reward or encouragement for good reading.] Through games of a specifically Jewish character, and Jewish and Hebrew songs, the child will, of his own accord, learn Jewish concepts which will serve him in good stead in his later Jewish education. The parents will certainly derive great pleasure from this. By nature, our Jewish parents really love a Jewish upbringing and feel a great awe and respect for it; they merely doubt its possibility, and, therefore, become indifferent. When a Jewish kindergarten can prove to them that there is a way and means to obtain a Jewish upbringing, then, they will give their children the opportunity to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>continue their Hebrew education. Aside from this, it is quite certain that the children who are imbued with the Jewish feeling and spirit, exert a beneficial influence upon the parents and arouse in them national pride.</p>
   <p>Such a Jewish kindergarten would encourage the children to sing the songs and tell the stories that they learned there, to their parents at home. This would restore the Shekhinah [the immanence of the spirit of God] to its original state of joy and song, and of true spiritual delight--the state which it loses when children become enstranged from their parents and parents from their children. It would rebuild the broken Jewish home. In later years the children will remember with great love the kindergarten which gave them the impetus for further Jewish education. And the parents will thank the founders of such an institution from the bottom of their hearts. But, as we have already said, such a Hebrew or Jewish kindergarten must be in the nature of an experiment, for its final structure we do not see as yet, but can merely surmise. This, however, should not lessen the vigor of such a movement. For we have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Had we at present an old system of teaching the children the main points of a Jewish education, then there would be room for argument. We do not have such a system. The field is free. The territory is virgin soil. The maturing child who should be receiving good impressions, is often influenced by evil or corrupt impressions.</p>
   <p>It is, therefore, the duty of every Northwest Side Jew to support, both financially and morally, this first experimental Hebrew kindergarten, and to exert every energy to see that it becomes a pride and joy. From such a kindergarten the children will emerge as true Jewish idealists. They will possess all the charm and grace of both ancient and modern Judaism. And all in all, they will be better children to their parents.</p>
