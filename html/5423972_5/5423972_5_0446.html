   <p>Over two thousand men and women appeared in a mass meeting at the Marks Nathan Orphans Home to see a Chanukah play produced by the orphans of the home.</p>
   <p>The play was very artistically performed for it seemed that the children were very much talented in the art of drama. Although the place was rather small, and crowded to capacity, the behavior of the audience was very orderly for the play had such an effect on the crowd that they were only too eager to keep quiet.</p>
   <p>The Chanukah drama was played in four acts and dealt with the time of Judas Maccabeeac. Abe Damon, who performed the role of the Jewish hero, was received with stormy applause, and when little Lena Cohen played the role of the sad unfortunate mother of seven sons, the audience could not hold back their tears.</p>
   
   <p>The Harris children who played the roles of Aritiuch and Apolonius, portrayed the ingratitude of these two characters in a most talented manner. Ethel Brown who played the role of Marian, the bride of the Jewish hero, was also greeted with applause.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago never before witnessed such great talent among such young children as they found in this holy institution, the Marks Nathan Orphans Home.</p>
