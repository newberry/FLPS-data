   <p>Mr. I. M. Wolfson's Chicago's Jewish Directory, for the Jewish Year 5675, is now ready for publication and distribution. It has been augmented, and now will contain names of many Jewish organizations, lodges, vereins, unions, synagogues, etc., of men and women in the Chicago suburbs, not listed in last year's directory. This directory is to be forwarded to the Daily Jewish Courier for its immediate publication.</p>
   <p>Even among those organizations mentioned in the older directories, there have been many changes in the names of officers, etc., and hence we are including each and every organization with names of the new officers and their addresses.</p>
