   <p>The proposal to suppress the newspapers of this country that are printed in foreign languages on the ground that no faith can be placed in their loyalty to America, brought forth many protests from prominent people and national leaders who are well acquainted with the foreign-language newspapers and are convinced of their loyalty.</p>
   <p>In Washington, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath represents a district that was virtually settled by foreigners. He knows how loyal these people, as well as their compatriots in other parts of the country, are to America, an attitude that is reflected in the newspapers that are printed in their tongue, and which they read. He therefore had a conference in Washington recently with the Honorable George Creel, chairman of the Committee on Public Information, to discuss this question. Mr. Creel requested the Congressman to submit in <span class="page-break">2</span>writing the reasons he had for asking that the newspapers in question should not be suppressed. Here is the contents of a letter that Mr. Sabath later sent in on this question:</p>
   <p>"My attention has been called to the attempt being made to suppress the newspapers, magazines, and books printed in foreign languages.</p>
   <p>"The number of foreigners who read only in their own language is, with certain reservations, approximately four or five millions of people. Unfortunately, the nature of their work is such that although they may, with great hardship, try to learn to speak English, they can never learn to read or write English. To clarify for them the purpose of this war which we are carrying on against a brutal enemy, to familiarize them with the democratic spirit of our government, and to teach them how highly important it is that everyone here should be patriotic, we not only dare not suppress their newspapers, but we must encourage them, since they are the only means of propagandizing among the foreigners.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The newspaper in the foreign language is the only means by which we can inform them of all the disastrous incidents which take place today. The people who do the great work in our mines, factories, mills, plants, and other similar establishments, could never give such wholehearted support to the government's preparations to win the war, if they did not read their newspapers which rouse them to their duty and obligation to the land in which they live; thus the workers work with greater diligence and we, directly and indirectly, benefit thereby.</p>
   <p>"Personally, I am able to read newspapers in the Bohemian, Polish, Slavic, Jewish, and German languages. And for the last six months, I have derived great pleasure from following the strong appeals that they print daily to help the government in all its undertakings.</p>
   <p>"I believe that it would be an unforgivable mistake to suppress any one of the foreign newspapers at this time. I believe that such a step would be directly in opposition to our present national needs, and would be a great <span class="page-break">4</span>loss to our best interests. I believe that the newspapers in the foreign languages prevented hostile groups from spreading hatred for government enterprises. I urge therefore, with all my heart, that, for the reasons enumerated above, the newspapers in question should be left alone.</p>
   <p>"Instead of being restricted, they should be encouraged and praised so that they may continue their patriotic instruction.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"A. J. Sabath."</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath is prepared to fight in Congress any bill that will be proposed for the suppression of foreign-language newspapers. He also knows that such a bill, if passed, will particularly harm the Jewish press in <span class="page-break">5</span>America, and the spiritual sustenance of the Jewish reader will be taken away.</p>
   <p>He expresses his hope, however, that such a thing will never happen. Nevertheless he is already busy winning other congressmen and senators to his side so that, if such a bill is proposed, it will be voted down.</p>
   <p>Ex-president Theodore Roosevelt and the head of the National Security League are among those who want the newspapers in foreign tongues to be suppressed. They want only English spoken and written in America.</p>
