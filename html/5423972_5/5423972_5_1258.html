   <p>It was reported at the annual meeting of the [United Jewish] Charities, which took place Sunday evening at the Hotel La Salle that eleven thousand Jewish children in Chicago receive a Jewish education. As far as I know, there are twenty Talmud Torahs in Chicago which have an attendance of three thousand five hundred children. Even if we assumed that another thousand children receive a Jewish education either in private Jewish schools or at home, the number is still far short of eleven thousand. The Charities, very likely, include in the eleven thousand the children who attend Sunday school or the services at the Reform temple, and you, yourself, know what kind of Jewish education the children who attend Sunday school get. Only four thousand Jewish children in Chicago out of fifty-one thousand receive a Jewish education; the remaining forty-seven thousand do not receive a Jewish education at all, whether they attend Sunday school or not.</p>
