   <p>In our land of national reawakening, Palestine, the common laborers, as well as the intellectuals, speak Hebrew at all times. In that country even the birds sing their prayers in Hebrew. This condition does not exist in our Hebrew-speaking group in Chicago. The group is obviously in a "coma"--not because of any financial difficulties but simply because our members do not attend the meetings. While the Hebrew language is gaining ground in Palestine, it is getting weaker and weaker here.</p>
   <p>Friends who have just arrived here from the old country! Americanized Jews! Students and workers and all who love the Hebrew language--help us reorganize our group. The Hebrew-speaking group must exist, and the work of the development of our Hebrew language and literature [must continue].</p>
   <p>Remember that the Hebrew language is being revived now, and that our Hebrew group must be revived along with it! Forget that you are living in Exile, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>think about our freedom and our national language! Come, help us revive the Hebrew-speaking group!</p>
   <p>With Hebrew greetings,</p>
   <p>Yehoshua Seligman, secretary.</p>
