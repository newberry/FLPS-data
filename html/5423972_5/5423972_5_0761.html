   <p>Last Sunday the Jewish People's Institute opened its Museum of Natural History, which was presented to the Institute by Samuel Bornstein, who was personally responsible for the gathering of the material contained in the exhibit, consisting of more than 3,000 pieces.</p>
   <p>It has been called a miniature Field Museum, for it contains sample exhibits in natural history and anthropology in a measure similar to that found in the Field Museum. This Museum will offer an excellent opportunity to nearly a quarter of a million people living within walking distance of the Institute to become acquainted with the wonders of nature.</p>
