   <p>Classes in the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary, one of the most important divisions of the Hebrew Theological College, open today. All interested in Hebrew national religious education entertain the hope that in due time, the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary will solve the most difficult and complicated problem, viz: to train American Hebrew Teachers for the American Jewish children--a type of teacher that apart from his secular knowledge should be well posted in Hebrew literature.</p>
   <p>The program of the Hebrew Teachers' Seminary, which was drawn up by the Jewish Board of Education, offers a five-year course in Talmud, a thorough and profound study of the Bible with all commentaries, Hebrew literature, history, pedagogy, and science created by the Jewish intellect of recent times.</p>
   <p>All subjects will be taught in Hebrew only.</p>
   
   <p>Thus far thirty students who received their elementary Hebrew education in the Chicago Hebrew schools have registered. Other students who wish to enroll in this school are required to speak Hebrew more or less fluently, have a satisfactory knowledge of the Torah and Rashi [commentator of the Talmud and Bible], Prophets, history, and grammar. No students will be accepted after this semester.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Officers of The Hebrew Theological College</p>
