   <p>Sunday, a committee of which I am a member, walked into the Congregation Bnai Jacob, one of the smaller synagogues, and made and seconded a motion that this synagogue should make a yearly contribution of two hundred dollars to the Hebrew Theological College. Our motion was immediately adopted and I believe that all the other synagogues will also accept this motion. What we need is visiting committees. If there are enough visiting committees, the Hebrew Theological College will not be short of funds. Now the question is: Where can we get visiting committees? We must remember that there are more than one hundred synagogues in Chicago.</p>
