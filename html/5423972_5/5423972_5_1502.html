   <p>The course for radio electricians, which has already been announced, will include training for telephone electricians. Registration is now in progress in the office of the Institute, and it is expected that the class will be organized the first week in November. The instructor in this class is Mr. E. E. Burns, the instructor in electricity at Medill High School. This course will prepare students for positions in the fields of wireless telegraphy and wireless telephony, as radio electricians and telephone electricians. We cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that, especially under such arrangements as the Institute is able to make, one will find here an unequalled opportunity to acquire a profitable and a rapidly growing trade. It takes two years to complete the course.</p>
