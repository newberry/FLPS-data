   <p>The Hebrew teachers claim that the reason they are never seen at a Jewish gathering and the reason they are never active in Jewish life is that many of them are university students, and that they are so busy with their studies that they have hardly any time left for other work. What does this mean? It means that we do not have a class of Hebrew teachers in Chicago who take their profession seriously and devote all their energies to it, but instead we have a group of young men to whom teaching is only a means to an end. Instead of doing physical work during the day, and attending night school at night, they work a few hours a day at the Talmud Torah so that they can study another profession, and as soon as they master that profession, they will give up teaching. I do not say that the individual has no right to do this but I do say that the teaching of Hebrew will not be productive if it is only a means to an end. The sooner Chicago has Hebrew teachers who love their profession and want to make it their lifework, the better it will be for Hebrew education in Chicago and for Chicago Jewry.</p>
