   <p>In every large Jewish community there is a Jewish city library that houses a collection of Hebrew books and of Jewish literature in all languages. At present, there is no such institution in Chicago, and if a Chicago Jew is in need of a Hebrew or Jewish book, he must go to the Chicago Public Library. The Chicago Public Library has Jewish books, but not enough to fulfill the needs of the many educated Jews who still evince an interest in Jewish literature. A city like Chicago ought to have a library of Hebrew and Jewish books, and thus encourage Jewish erudition and Jewish literature. If a Jewish educator in Chicago wants to do some research work, he simply cannot. It is impossible for one to purchase all the necessary books, and the Chicago Public Library does not have the books which are indispensable for research in Jewish studies. A city like Chicago, which has four hundred thousand Jews, ought to have a library in a special building. A Jewish library ought to have its own home in Chicago. The masses, however, are busy in their lodges with sick benefits and cemeteries, and the upper strata are busy with charity, and there is neither time nor money for educational work.</p>
