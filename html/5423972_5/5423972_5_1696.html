   <p>Is Jewish national education possible in America?</p>
   <p>When the Jewish child was reared in Europe, his surroundings were permeated with the study of the Torah and holy scriptures, which inspired him with great national sentiment that remained with him forever. But here in America where our Jewish children are educated in the public schools, where they spend the whole day in an environment which is rather strange to them, they will ultimately accept the good qualities of the environment in general. But the Jewish studies and the Talmud Torah, which the children receive two hours a day, is not enough material with which to implant the Jewish national spirit.</p>
   
   <p>What is Education? Education is the practical training of the child's mind; the influence of the teacher affects the very soul of the pupil and it is practiced in two different ways: first, through convictions and logical evidence; and second, through the conquering of the child's will-power.</p>
   <p>Upon these two ways, the teacher reaches his aim.....These are the training methods with which all modern nations are educating their children. In this regard, we Jews are partners with all civilized nations. However, in Russia our children are driven out of the government schools and they are compelled to get their education in the Hebrew schools and synagogues.</p>
   
   <p>The opinion of some of our Jews nevertheless is somewhat against all day studies of a Jewish national training. With our great American school system working together with our Jewish national educational facilities we feel that two hours a day is quite enough time in which our Jewish children can study Hebrew and Jewish history.</p>
