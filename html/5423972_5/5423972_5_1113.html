   <p>Chicago Jewry has an interesting and important history. This history is fifty or more years old. The time is ripe for a book to be written about it. This is being done.</p>
   <p>The Jewish community of Chicago is one of the greatest Jewish communities in the world. It is at the same time the youngest Jewish community in the world. The oldest Jewish community in Europe is Koeln am Rhein, which is mentioned in the Talmud under the name Kulnia. The Jewish community of Rome is two thousand years old. In Europe, especially in the Near East, there are many communities that are a thousand years old. Eleven years ago, the Jewish community of Theodosia, in the Crimea, celebrated its one thousandth anniversary.</p>
   <p>The Chicago-Jewish community is the youngest Jewish community in the world, <span class="page-break">2</span>although it is a great community. The future generations of Chicago will want to know about the early history of the Jews of Chicago. The present generation also wants to know it. Everybody's curiosity is to be satisfied, thanks to the work of the Jewish Historical Society of Illinois, whose guiding spirit is none other than Mr. H. L. Meites.</p>
   <p>For the last six years, Mr. Meites has been working to collect material for the history. He has collected important historical documents, facts, statistics, and pictures, which throw a brilliant light upon the life of the Jews in Chicago since the Jewish community was established here. This material is now classified and arranged in historical sequence. An organization has already been formed to publish this work soon, and we, of the present generation, as well as those of future generations, will possess a source of interesting and important historical data.</p>
   <p>This is the place to mention the names of the gentlemen who are at the head of the Historical Society and who will supervise the publication of this volume. They are S. J. Rosenblatt, president, Judge Harry M. Fisher, vice-president, H. L. Meites, secretary, and Meyer Rosengard, financial secretary. M. E. Greenebaum, the banker, is the treasurer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Because these gentlemen occupy positions of prominence in the local community, and because their undertaking is important, about one hundred and fifty of the most prominent Jewish men and women [of Chicago] gathered at a banquet at the Morrison Hotel last Thursday night. They resolved to carry out Mr. Meites' plan immediately:</p>
   <p>Mr. Meites had the assistance, in his research, of Mr. A. A. Friedlander, a man of Jewish as well as general education, an idealist, and a master of the English language. Mr. Meites is a very capable writer; he has a thorough knowledge of the printing technique and a fine taste for beautiful publications. We can rest assured that with their combined efforts the projected History of the Jews in Chicago will be a great work, and an ornament to anybody's library.</p>
   <p>No collections are being made to cover the cost of publication. This work is being published in a businesslike way. Subscriptions are being solicited. The price of a subscription is neither more nor less than fifty dollars. Anybody can get a copy of this book for fifty dollars. This price covers only the cost of publication. If one had to pay for the work done before publication, the book would cost more.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Thanks are due to Mr. H. L. Meites for the low cost of the book. For six years, Mr. Meites has sacrificed his money, time, energy, and family to see this thing through. Had he spent the energy and activity in some other field, he would have been [materially] richer. Spiritual wealth, however, means more to him and he has lived to see the day when the Jewish representatives in the city have become interested in his work. This also means that he has the good wishes of the entire community.</p>
   <p>We wish him good luck and congratulate all those who realize the importance of publishing this long-anticipated volume.</p>
