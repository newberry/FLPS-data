   <p>The seventh annual graduation exercises of the Devorah Sabbath School branch of the Bes Medrish Hagodol (the large school) took place Saturday evening October 25 in the Garfield Assembly Hall. Twenty-two children received their diplomas that day. Some were also presented with a "Tonach" while others were given honorary mention for excellence in their studies.</p>
   <p>Preparations for the evening were arranged by Miss Anna Coldberg and Celia Lavin, teachers of the school, who devote a good deal of their time to instilling all things Jewish into the hearts of the younger generations.</p>
   <p>Lawyer Israel Cohen spoke very impressively, praising the children for their accomplishments and appealing to the parents not to deny their children the education of the Torah, which brings the young people closer to their parents and to the Jewish nation. The second speaker, Mr. Tretchkie, superintendent of the Bes Medrish Hagodol, pointed to the importance of rearing Jewish children in the Jewish faith in a true Jewish manner.</p>

The graduates gave short addresses in both the Hebrew and the Jewish. Mabel Schulman, Minnie Sternberg, Rosie Wallborsht, and Florence Yavitz amused the audience with song and poetry.....The children presented Miss Goldberg with a beautiful lavalliere and Miss Tillie Levin with a fine silver toilet set, as a token of their esteem to their devoted teachers....</p>
