   <p>A chaste and comprehensive Jewish journal seems to be a necessity in this city. We have undertaken the task of publishing such a paper, and hope to meet with the encouragement of all classes of citizens. We have engaged in the editiorial management the best talent suited for the purpose. The following are the rules which are laid down for the conduct of The Jewish Advance:</p>
   <p>1. The news of the day, pertaining to social interest in general and to Jewish society in particular, shall be condensed in columns of The Jewish Advance in brief and comprehensive paragraphs. For this purpose we have ordered exchanges from Germany, France, England, Russia, and so forth, and we have opened a correspondence with many personal friends, both here and in Europe. We will thus be able to give our readers items of interest from the first sources, and earlier than any other journal of the kind.</p>
   <p>2. Domestic and local news we will also gather at the first source. No correspondence will be accepted unless we shall know the writer to be a responsible and fair-minded person. In religious and social matters, we will allow fair play to the opinions of our contributors; but we will reserve the privilege to reject or correct all such contributions, which might be displeasing to good taste.</p>
   <p>3. We shall endeavor to promote every good measure, which will be advanced either by our venerable contemporaries, or by any of our representative men for the welfare and elevation of our race.</p>
   <p>4. Our belletristic part will consist of original stories, sketches, essays, and so forth, either from our own pen or from that of our contributors. We will give all encouragement to domestic talent.</p>
   <p>5. In our editorial articles, the questions of the day will be treated; in "The Pulpit" department we will bring synopsis of sermons and lectures by our representative pulpit orators; in the "Students' Column" chips of learning and wisdom will be brought; and the German department, (embracing the 6th and 7th pages,) will also be varied with matters of good taste and useful information.</p>
   <p>6. The Jewish Advance will have a Calendar of Lodges, Congregations and important social meetings of the week, in which every movement of general interest will be noted down. We shall be thankful to lecturers, ministers and presidents of social organizations, if they will send us subjects of lectures or important debates to be announced beforehand.</p>
   <p>Besides these regulations we shall endeavor to introduce as many useful and agreeable features in The Jewish Advance, as time and experience may suggest. We shall strive to be pleasing and useful, and hope that the confidence and support of all fair-minded people will assist us to a successful career, which may be an honor to the Israelites of our city and a benefit to many......</p>
