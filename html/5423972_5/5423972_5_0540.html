   <p>Neighborhood Play Festival.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday's Play Festival scheduled at West Park No. 1, was put off until this Wednesday because of last Saturday's heavy rain. The program will be as originally scheduled. The Jewish part of the program is being conducted by the Northwestern University Settlement. The program promises to be highly interesting and everybody living on the Northwest Side is invited.</p>
