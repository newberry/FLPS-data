   <p>At the last meeting of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities a request was entered by a group of young Jewish people that the Federation should vote the sum of $60.00 to cover a deficit and to finance further the Jewish classes at the John Smith School.</p>
   <p>As the Jewish public knows, these nationalistic young people have recently organized themselves with the purpose of establishing Jewish schools, which will teach Jewish children the subjects of Jewish and Hebrew languages. They planned to use the public schools, and to that end interested a member of the Board of Education, Mr. Harry A. Lipsky. He is a strong agitator in favor of permitting the neighborhoods to use the large school buildings when it is free of classes. He succeeded in securing the permission of the Board of Education to allow this organization to conduct Jewish classes in the building at the close of each day's school session.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>With permission granted them, this young organization made its first attempt at the John Smith School. At first classes were held during the day in the summer vacation period. After the public schools opened in the fall, three classes were given in the afternoon from four to seven o'clock. Three teachers were employed for about one hundred and forty Jewish children studying Jewish, Hebrew, Jewish ethics, and Jewish history at the John Smith School.</p>
   <p>But the Board of Education said that these classes must be free to the public, since they were held in a public building. The Board furnished without cost the use of the building, the space, the electricity, a principal to supervise behavior, all writing materials, and even books. No money was permitted to be charged for learning.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In a public building that was fostering public education the spirit of free education had to be maintained.</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that these nationalistic young folks, who think of such folly as that of teaching Jewish children the Jewish studies proper, possess everything but money. When they opened these classes they arranged the very best Jewish teachers they could possibly get for any price. But they were unable to pay them.</p>
   <p>Soon they found a remedy for this. They did not charge any class fees, but when a father or mother enrolled his or her children for the Jewish classes, he or she was asked to become a member of this organization and pay a dollar or two every month. Most parents were more than willing to do this. Yet there were many who could not afford to pay even this sum.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The children, of course, were accepted in the school. Therein arouse the deficit. Then it was decided to enlist the aid of the Federation whose business it was to collect money for all needy charitable institutions. They asked that their deficit be paid and that the Federation should finance this institution as it does so many others.</p>
   <p>According to the regulations of the Federation, the question was first taken up by the Office Committee, which in turn appointed a committee to investigate these schools. The investigating committee became so enthusiastic concerning the good order, learning, and results which they witnessed, that they sent a highly favorable recommendation to the Office Committee to finance these classes and if possible to establish such classes in all schools in Jewish communities that may desire it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Office Committee then set about to find out how many communities desired these classes. It was disclosed that in all the various neighborhoods there were requests for the opening of twenty-five schools. This would cover the city of Chicago from South Chicago to the far North, from way out West to East. Everyone seemed to be in its favor.</p>
   <p>The next step, of course, was the figuring of expenses for the maintenance of so many school teachers. If each school should cost $200.00 a month, the sum for all the schools would be five thousand dollars a month or sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00) a year. This last mentioned sum is about one-half the total yearly income of the Federation. This large sum was too great a responsibility for the committee to decide upon. It was therefore reported at the meeting of the entire Board of Directors of the Federation. It was recommended that the deficit of sixty dollars be paid and that consideration be given future deficits or the financing of such undertakings.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>This was the beginning of many discussions. It is understood that the Board of Directors were in no hurry to undertake so immense a task. Again a special committee was appointed. Many meetings were held. After all the hardships and unpleasantness in collecting money for existing expenditures how could they plunge into something new knowing all the while the need of improvement in the present existing institutions. If they had the money it would certainly be a crime to reject such a plan. Even after careful consideration, should the Federation accept such a responsibility it would be done with reasoning and planning, gradually and with necessary changes so that everything may be in order. If on the contrary, the plan is rejected because of money or other reasons it will be done systematically, the pro's and con's will be equally recorded.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>From a practical standpoint the question is in the hands of the proper authorities. The question is, what does the large Jewish public think of this plan? It is necessary to get the peoples opinion.</p>
   <p>"Do the Chicago Jews wish to support free Jewish Schools?"</p>
   <p>Our Talmud Torahs are more or less of a religious nature regardless of the methods installed. How could a Jew be a Jew unless he is religious? But the proposed classes are not concerned with this. When a child will have finished these classes he may speak Hebrew well, know Jewish history and ethics, yet he will not know the prayers of Grace. Therefore, do we want this type of school?</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>It is also well to bear in mind, that the Federation accepts subscriptions from all people without inquiry as to whether they are religious or not, orthodox or reformed, conservative or radical, national or international. Since the Talmud Torah excludes children whose parents do not desire the religious teachings, are these free schools not only justified in their existence but also in their demand for the Federation finances and support?</p>
