   <p>The activities in the Workers Institute are proceeding energetically this season. The elementary classes, as well as the high school department, are already in full swing. The sound method of instruction, which is applied in both departments, has attracted a great many students and the result is that there are hardly enough seats for everybody.</p>
   <p>The Sunday School has become an important factor in the life of the Institute. The finest teachers have expressed their respect for the system which has been introduced in this school, and they claim that it is one of the best in the country.</p>
   <p>A musical department offering piano and violin lessons, has also been opened and is under the personal supervision of Professor von Libiech and Frank Lyon, well-known authorities in the musical world.</p>

   <p>Union of South Side Jews</p>
   <p>The mass meeting, which took place Sunday evening at Congregation Keser Israel, 4719 South Marshfield Avenue, under the auspices of the Union of South Side Jews of Chicago was a great success. A large crowd filled the small but beautiful synagogue. Charles Tiktin, chairman of the Union's committee on education, opened the meeting. He spoke of the purpose of the meeting, and then introduced Rabbi Saul Silber.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Silber demonstrated his powers of oratory by enumerating the maladies of the Jews and their cures. "I am not a doctor who can cure those who are physically ill," he said "but for those who are spiritually ill, a rabbi is a good doctor." He concluded by stating that he wished to see some results from his speech. Thereupon $315 was pledged as a fund for a Talmud Torah. A board of officers was elected for the Talmud Torah and a ladies auxiliary <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>was formed to assist the project.</p>
   <p>The Progressive Preparatory School</p>
   <p>William [E.] Rodriguez, the Socialist alderman, will be the principal speaker at the commencement exercises of the [Progressive] High School, which will take place in the auditorium of the Lawndale Hall, 3437 Ogden Avenue, Saturday, September 23, at 8 P. M. Mr. Isadore Berger, director of the Berger Studios, and Leon A. Blum, director of the Chicago Musical College, Independence Boulevard Branch, Mr. B. Shanen, and Miss J. Paul will participate in the musical program.</p>
   <p>An innovation which was introduced in the Progressive School this season is a class in psychology under the supervision of William Nathanson. This course will serve a double purpose: first, it will give the student an understanding of psychology, and second, it will give them the necessary credits for college.</p>
