   <p>We wonder what Meyer Weisgal has up his sleeve......</p>
   <p>We cannot imagine him retiring after such a tremendous job and such a successful climax. There must be something that he has in store for the local Jewish community and it must be immense in its proportions. Meyer Weisgal never could think or do small things. We hope sincerely that some new venture will offer itself for his talent, if he has not something in mind now, and that the Jewish community will back him to the limit. Chicago should indeed be proud to have a man of Weisgal's ability in its midst....and should give him every cooperation in his desire to do great things for the community.</p>

   <p>It may be truthfully said that Meyer Weisgal put the Jewish community in Chicago on the map during his short stay here.....First, the Chanukah Festival and now the Jewish Day. These should not go unrecognized and unappreciated.</p>
   <p>The second performance of "A Romance of a People" was much smoother and more symphonic than the first one. The result was that the ones who found it rather difficult to be properly impressed Monday night, went home more than satisfied Wednesday night.</p>
   <p>One of the most beautiful reactions we have ever witnessed was the one when most of the performers participating in the pageant refused to don their costumes until they were assured that Isaac Van Grove would be there to direct them. There was a rumor that he had gone to Cincinnati to direct a symphony there. But when he appeared they surrounded him and lifted him and carried him about.</p>

   <p>The same thing occurred after the performance and it was a sight never to be forgotten. How this man with his brilliant personality has endeared himself to that multitude of young men and women and even the small children whom he directed and worked with for weeks in preparation for the pageant.</p>
   <p>A job well done. Van Grove has, after so man years of wandering about, finally found himself and it was among his own. You should have seen him jump about like a young kid, singing and dancing the "Hora" with the young Zionists after the performance.</p>
   <p>One of the most impressive scenes at the pageant was the presence of several hundred orthodox rabbis who came to the pageant from all parts of the country and Canada as the guests of Rabbi Hirsch Manischewitz of Manischewitz Bros. It was a sight that did the heart good. Here were assembled some of the outstanding teachers and leaders of Israel......Patriarchs and young men alike who journeyed to this city to be present and participate in the greatest Jewish Day in the history of the Diaspora.</p>

   <p>The Manischewitz Foundation has in the past done many outstanding and noble deeds. But the gathering of the rabbis for which they were responsible was probably one of the most altrusitic and beneficent contributions ever made. A lot of credit is due to the ingenuity and the resourcefulness of both Ben Sachs and Mike "Manischewitz" Bluestone, who have been working like bees in the past few weeks.</p>
