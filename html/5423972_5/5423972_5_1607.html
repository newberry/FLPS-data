   <p>A group of young men interested in Jewish radical education held a meeting Wednesday, July 12, at Comrade Marcus' home. It was decided to open a school in the Lawndale district. A fund of $100 will be raised for that purpose. Organizations, societies, and individuals interested in this school should write to our secretary, I. L. Shaves, 1540 South Millard Avenue.</p>
