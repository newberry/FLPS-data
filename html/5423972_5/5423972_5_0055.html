   <p>A farewell party was given at the Hull House, Friday evening, in honor of S. B. Lender, the young Chicago artist who has won so much distinction during the last two years. He is leaving the city for a year's work in Europe.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lender received his early training in the studio at Hull House. Later he went to the Art Institute where he was awarded the traveling scholarship. While still a student, his portrait of Edward Timmons was accepted by the Chicago Society Exhibition and chosen for the continuous exhibition at the Art Institute.</p>
