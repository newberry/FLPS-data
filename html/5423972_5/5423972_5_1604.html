   <p>The Jewish teachers of New York are on strike. This is rather new in America and should be welcomed by friends of Jewish education.</p>
   <p>We are in sympathy with this strike because its purpose is,not only to improve the material condition of the teachers, but to wrest control of the education of Jewish children from ignoramuses and charlatans, who dictate to teachers what and how to teach.</p>
   
   <p>A union of teachers would eliminate incompetent teachers and prevent the Talmud Torah from employing a teacher unless he is recognized by his colleagues as an expert.</p>
   <p>The Jewish teachers of Chicago have not reached this stage as yet, but in time they will follow the example of their New York colleagues.</p>
