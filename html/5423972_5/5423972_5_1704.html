   <p>At a meeting of the Chicago Jewish teachers, it was determined to open two bureaus. (1) An Information Bureau where both teachers seeking positions or private lessons, and institutions or private people needing teachers can apply. (2) A Finance Bureau where any teacher shall be able to borrow a certain sum when in need thereof. Three members of the Hebrew Teachers' Association were elected for each bureau.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to establish a board of education, the program of which will be discussed at the next meeting, during which Mr. Abrams and Mr. Feinberg are scheduled to speak on the advisability of a Hebrew Board of Education.</p>
