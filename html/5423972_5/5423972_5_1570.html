   <p>Yesterday's rain somewhat hampered the celebration of the opening of the Talmud Torah at Winchester Avenue and Twelfth Street. Nevertheless, a larger crowd than was expected was present, and about $2,000 was collected through the sale of honors and donations.</p>
   <p>The march of the Talmud Torah children, led by the Marks Nathan Orphans [Home's] band, from the B'nai Moses Synagogue to the new Talmud Torah, was quite impressive although not many children participated because of the rain.</p>
   <p>The celebration of the dedication was opened by Mr. Jacob Cohn at the B'nai Moses Synagogue, where he also sold the honors of carrying the scrolls of the Torah at the head of the parade. Mr. Ben Zion Leiserowitch, president of the Talmud Torah, then delivered a short address, and presented Mr. Joseph Weil as chairman. Appropriate speeches then were made by Rabbi Azriel Epstein, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Rabbi Samuel Shach, Rabbi A. Cardon, Rabbi Nisan Budzinsky, Rabbi [E. R.] Muskin, Rabbi Rutenberg and Judge [Harry] Fisher.</p>
   <p>The first "key" was bought by Mr. A. Eisenstein, chairman of the building committee, and the rest of the "keys" were bought by the following: Benjamin Rikburg, Samuel Hirsch Cohen, Moses Neierman, H. Halper, Judge Fisher, Harris Hurwitz, and Mr Warshawer.</p>
   <p>The following paid $200 each for "rooms": Isaac Goldberg, president of [Congregation] Anshe Yabneh; the Lazar Brothers; the sons of the president of the Talmud Torah; Wolf Farber; B. Ginsburg; and B. Lazar.</p>
   <p>Mr. I. Schorr, who was the marshal of the parade, donated the glass bill, which amounted to $250.</p>
   <p>First to affix their signatures in the "golden book" were I. Schorr with a donation of $25, and Mrs. N. H. Bolotin with a donation of $15. Afterwards <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>other donations for the Talmud Torah were made by the following:</p>
   <p>Louis Sedow, $60; [Congregation] Anshe Sholom, $50; H. Krulew, $50; B. Hurwitz, $50; Joseph Weil, $50; [Congregation] Anshe Liebawitch, $25; Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Cohn, $25; Beth Hamedrash Hagodol, $25; and Mrs. J. Lilienthal, $25.</p>
