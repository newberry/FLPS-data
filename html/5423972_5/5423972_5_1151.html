   <p>By the end of this month there will be ready a new "Sabbath School Hymnal" arranged by Dr. Moses and published by Block and Co., Chicago. The Hymnal will prove a great help to superintendents and teachers of Sabbath schools. It contains, besides hymns for opening and closing school, a large number of beautiful songs of a devotional character, songs for festivals and seasons, songs of duty, six services and responsive readings, a flower service, a national service, harvest service and Chanukah service. In addition to all this, there is a fine selection of Hebrew responses that will be welcomed by many congregational choirs.</p>
