   <p>In the violin department of the Chicago Musical College, seven pupils were in the contest for the diamond medal, the judges being Dr. F. Ziegfeld, August Hyllested, and S. E. Jacobsohn. The Rev. Dr. H. W. Thomas' prize a diamond medal for the best violinist in the college, was awarded to Wilferd Woolett. The judges found it difficult to decide the awarding of the prize as Woolett and Leon Marx were so nearly equal. Dr. Ziegfeld decided that there should be a diamond medal for Leon Marx, and announced that he would donate the prize to Master Marx. The second prize, the college gold medal for the second best violinist, was awarded to Master Adolph Loeb, and the third prize, the silver medal, will go to Mr. Elijah Courlander. Those who took part in the contest besides the winners were Henry Beerman, Michael Lyons, and Miss Lenora Jackson.</p>
