   <p>It is not the Kehilath Jacob Talmud Torah, but the Talmud Torah of the Anshe Sholom Center that intends to deprive its girl students who have been attending that school for five years, of any further opportunity to continue their studies. I suggest that we handle this situation by picketing Rabbi [Saul] Silber's home because he is commander in chief of this Talmud Torah. If Rabbi Silber wishes to avoid trouble, he should repudiate this discrimination against the girl students of his Talmud Torah.</p>
