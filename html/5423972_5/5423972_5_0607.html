   <p>Within the last few weeks a Jewish Literary and Art Society has been founded in Chicago, which has undertaken the task of organizing and uniting all the Jewish national progressive elements willing to devote their time to developing and distributing Jewish literature, music and drama. It is hoped to enlist every one who has the revival of the Jewish national spirit at heart, and who would like to help strengthen and support the Jewish spirit.</p>
   <p>This society is divided into three divisions: a literary, a dramatic, and a musical, and each individual may render his or her support to any one or all of these dividions.</p>
   <p>The literary division will devote its efforts to the popularizing and support of Jewish literature; the dramatic section, to staging the best dramas.</p>
