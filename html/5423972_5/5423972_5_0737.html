   <p>Worthy Editor of the Courier:</p>
   <p>I would like to call your attention to a thing which - as it seems to me - is very important and perhaps very necessary. The thing is of great importance and yet it isn't here. I feel it and I think there are many who share the same opinion.</p>
   <p>Chicago has a beatiful Hebrew library containing modern literature, which was founded twenty-four years ago under the name, "Schocri Shefas Aver."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Everybody knows that this is a great asset. It has yielded good results. But unfortunately, there is no rabbinical literature. If one is in need of such literature, it can not be had.</p>
   <p>Knowing there are many books that are owned by individuals who make no use of them, it would be a timely suggestion to establish such a society. A large number of people will also know that we own invaluable treasuries of knowledge and science. In this way, we will stop throwing sacred literature unwittingly into garbage cans and alleys, which is not a novelty, and certainly is a tragedy.</p>
   <p>I believe that every individual will turn over his books, which are useless to him, to the library. I also believe that the Chicago Jewish community will be proud of such an institution.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Rabbi Eleziarr, Mushkin</p>
   <p>Rabbi of Congregation B'nai Joseph,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
