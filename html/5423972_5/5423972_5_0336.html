   <p>Tonight is the first performance at the new Metropolitan Theatre for the benefit of the Jewish Shelter. The theatre is located at Jefferson and O'Bryan streets.</p>
   <p>The well known masterpiece Ben-Hador will be played. All Jews of Chicago should do their utmost in order to get these tickets, so that Father Abraham's Hotel would profit the most, for they are in dire need of funds.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Shelter is the only Jewish institution which has at all times open doors for the hungry and homeless Jews. In order to exist they must have money. Their expenses are enormous, their income is insignificant.</p>
   <p>The perpetuation and maintenance of this shelter is greatly dependent upon tonight's and tomorrow's performances. Help us continue the noble work of the Home. Remember tonight is the benefit for the Jewish Shelter!</p>
