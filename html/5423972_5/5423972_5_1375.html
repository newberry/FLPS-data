   <p>Our brethren, the Jews of Chicago--may they live long and be happy--have learned how to make a promise but they have not yet learned how to keep one. It is, therefore, my painful duty to keep teaching them and to keep pounding into their heads the fact that when a Jew promises to give money for a Jewish cause, he has to keep his promise--otherwise he is a foolish braggart who arouses false hopes.</p>
   <p>Last Pentecost, many Jews, in their synagogues, pledged to give money for the Hebrew Theological College. Fifteen thousand dollars was pledged for this important institution, which was very nice. However, when you speak to Mr. Leizerowich, the president of the institution, you hear a different story: "Only three thousand dollars has come in up to now, out of all the pledges. We cannot go on with the work because the synagogues have not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>made good their pledges. We cannot build without money. The situation is desperate."</p>
   <p>I think that this is terrible. To promise in the synagogue to contribute for the Torah and not to pay--I cannot conceive of a greater moral crime! Every Chicago Jew who has pledged money for the Hebrew Theological College and does not make good his pledge, is sabotaging the building of the Hebrew Theological College. He is a striker against the Torah, and that is not a complimentary title for anyone.</p>
   <p>Jews of Chicago! Make good your pledges for the Hebrew Theological College! Do so at once!</p>
