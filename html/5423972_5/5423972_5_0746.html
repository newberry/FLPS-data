   <p>Last Sunday night, the yearly meeting of the Shuchrie Sfoss Aver was held in their library at 810 Ashland Blvd. The secretaries read their reports showing that in the year since they acquired their own building, they have attained tremendous success. The most interesting report was that given by the librarian, Mr. P. Dietch, who gave a complete account of the books and the kind of readers that frequent the library; which books are read the most, which the least, etc. This report is especially important to those Jews who are interested in the plight of the Hebrew language in America.</p>
   <p>There was also election of officers.</p>
