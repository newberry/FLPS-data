   <p>"To Jews, especially, this exhibition should be of great interest," Mr. Lipsky explained to a reporter of the Jewish Courier. "This should particularly be of interest to our newly immigrated brethren. The main purpose is to draw the attention of the public to the life and activities that go on in the far and wide regions of the West, and the opportunities one can get by going away from the large and densely populated American cities, and to look for a place to settle where the opportunities for betterment are much brighter."</p>
   <p>Mr. Lipsky thinks that this exhibition would do much good for the Jewish masses, and he hopes that it would be visited by all Jews in Chicago.</p>
