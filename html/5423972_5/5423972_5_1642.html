   <p>Dear Editor of the Courier:</p>
   <p>After reading in the Courier, Mr. J. Spivak's article on Mr. Maximan's program for Jewish education in Chicago, I remembered these words of our sages of the past: "If you grab at too much you grab nothing." It is surprising that Mr. Maximan should think that it is possible to "overturn the bowl," entirely emptying the amassed contents, and then immediately to refill it with fresh water.</p>
   <p>The Torah tells us how the Jewish people will obtain their own land in the following words: "The nations will be driven out for your sake. You will not be able to annihilate them easily because the beasts of the field will multiply." These words should serve as an example when you undertake to eject the old-fashioned, poor method of Jewish education and to replace it by a new, sound system. This can be achieved only in one way and that is the <span class="page-break">\2</span>following:</p>
   <p>In the Jewish school, children should be given interesting Hebrew books to read. For beginners Hebrew books should be like the English primers, containing stories of Puss and Boots and Cinderella, which will be easy to understand because the children are already acquainted with these stories from their English readers. These stories will draw their attention to reading and they will thereby acquire some knowledge of the Hebrew language. This will also enable then to master gradually the Hebrew language and then to read its literature. When we have an element of which we can feel proud, and who can exhibit their knowledge and love of Hebrew literature, then Mr. Maximan's program can be automatically carried out in a natural way.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours</p>
   <p>N. S. Fineberg.</p>
