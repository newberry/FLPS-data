   <p>Library.</p>
   <p>Our library still remains one of the smallest in the city from point of view of space. However in circulation and attendance it continues to hold its own. The total attendance and circulation for the year were 206,131 (108,140 and 97,911 respectively) as against 131,044 (57,380 and 79,664 respectively) last year. Mr. Lecler, librarian of the public library, as well as Mr. Phelan, superintendent of the public branch libraries, have appealed to our committee on education for larger quarters. Thus far, however, we were unable to comply with their request. However, it is hoped that when our present gymnasium is moved to the new building, we may find it possible to arrange for larger quarters. It will have to be at least two-thirds larger than the present room. The character of the literature circulated is very different from what is found in other branch libraries. It is, we are informed, of a much more serious character and embraces almost all branches of knowledge.</p>
