   <p>Of the many books (Biblical and secular) which are sent to the editorial office, we shall review the book entitled Children's Education Among Jews. We believe that the question of rearing children in America is the most vital problem today, and that it will remain a leading problem for a long time, until it is solved in some way.</p>
   <p>The environment by which we are limited is so unlike the environment in which our parents lived when we were children, that we have absolutely no previous example or precedent to follow [when we attempt to plan the education of our children].</p>
   <p>Jews, however, during the Exile period, have lived under all sorts of conditions and have met with all sorts of adversities. While we may be unable to find a precedent in the immediate past, we are bound to find a situation in the remoter past which will parallel that of today, and will serve as an example for our generation.</p>

   <p>We have, therefore, read with a great deal of satisfaction the book Children's Education Among Jews. This book is an historical work which attempts, according to the preface, to compile various excellent essays and sayings dealing with the education of Jewish children from the Babylonean Talmud, the Jerusalem Talmud, rabbinical commentaries and other Jewish source books. The author, Reverend Moses A. Levin, is a well-known educator; a former principal of a Talmud Torah in Montreal; and, at present, a principal of a Chicago Talmud Torah.</p>
   <p>The author candidly states in his Hebrew preface that he had purposely written his book in "Jargon" (Yiddish) so that the "masses" would be able to read it. "If only one out of a hundred, after reading my book, will regret his foolishness, devote himself, heart and soul, to the rearing of his children, and guide them in God's ways, I will consider myself amply rewarded," said the author in the Hebrew [preface].</p>
   <p>Mr. Levin is of the opinion that Jewish children should study "Torah" [usually means Pentateuch; here meant to include all of human knowledge]. " 'Torah' is <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>such a remarkable study," says Mr. Levin, "that the pursuit of it should never be interrupted. It should be taught from the cradle to the grave."</p>
   <p>After reading the book, one must come to the conclusion that a father is obligated to teach his child 'Torah'. The father is only obligated to "teach" his child; the acquisition of knowledge is another thing. For throughout the entire book there is no indication as to the methods employed in ancient times. Whenever the author does find it necessary to include an extract on educational methods used in the past, he quotes the statement in Hebrew--"in order that the 'masses' should not read it and draw any examples from it."</p>
   <p>Throughout the whole book, the emphasis is placed on "teaching the child 'Torah' "; but, after finishing the book we are still confronted with the initial question: what is 'Torah', and how shall it be taught? As an educator, Mr. Levin knows that every father wants his son to study 'Torah'; the difficulty lies in the fact that conditions have changed so markedly, that we can not find today one dozen Jews who have the same opinion as to what 'Torah' is. 'Torah' is being taught at the West Side Talmud Torah, the Shaarei Thora Talmud Torah, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Free Jewish School of the Home for the Aged, the National Radical School, the Beth Sefer Labanoth, etc. Should one pupil, however, transfer from one school to another, he will soon find out the differences in the kinds of 'Torah' that are being taught.....</p>
