   <p>Private individuals who have little or no interest in the education of the Jewish youth in Chicago, could hardly realize that in this city there is a whole army, from three to four hundred persons, who profess to teach.</p>
   <p>Most of these, in their old homes, were well-to-do or idlers, but, finding no suitable work or profitable business in this country, turned to the profession of teaching. Some had been "Helpers," but here their position had been elevated to that of a teacher.</p>
   <p>Not including the Hebrew High School, there are in Chicago some 20 or 25 more or less known Hebrew Schools that are open either from three in the afternoon or all day. Here the teachers are considered professional. Teaching is their profession and some are even specialists in their line, but they also are forced to tutor privately in well-to-do homes from six in the evening till late at night.</p>
   <p>Among these hundreds of teachers who "peddle" the Torah, there are worthy people, Jews of old school, who can teach more or less. They state the truth, inasmuch as they cannot accomplish anything, since the American <span class="page-break">\2</span>children do not want to learn and do not respect their Jewish teacher. The short time allotted for the lessons is also a hindrance or handicap in the instruction so that the children progress very little. Their special complaint is the hiring of the Rabbi by the mother in the presence of the child.</p>
   <p>But then many of these "peddler" teachers are really ignorant and know nothing of teaching the child. They know no Hebrew. It seems that it is just this type that makes good, earning more than the learned teacher.</p>
   <p>The father works in the shop all day till late at night and has no time to devote to the child's lessons or education. This task is then shifted to the mother. She, naturally, does not know who is or is not the scholar and, therefore, picks someone of a smooth tongue, ready smile, and boastful eminence.</p>
   <p>Nor are the various grades of study divided among the teachers. In Russia the order was one teacher for beginners, a second for the next grade, a third for a higher grade, etc, etc.</p>
   <p>Here one teaches everything. Nothing seems to be too great or too small <span class="page-break">\3</span>for him, just so he has his lessons.</p>
   <p>"Gommora" teachers are scarce among these private teachers. Most of them teach beginners till they are thirteen or fourteen years old. The prime factor being that the child says his lessons fast, like running water, so that the mother will be satisfied. Yet this is seldom the case. As soon as the pupil has learned his fundamentals, then the teacher's troubles begin. The child knows no Jewish, the teacher no English, therefore, the explanations mean nothing. The mother must intervene to translate. The teacher pronounces the Hebrew word, the child repeats. It is then explained in Jewish, the mother translating it for her boy into English. The boy repeats the Hebrew, Jewish, and English becoming confused and getting very little or nothing out of the lesson.</p>
   <p>The American child is quite an actor, a little devil, so it seems. If he discovers the teacher does not understand him, he begins by calling him sarcastic names and compliments in English. If the teacher asks for the meaning of these words, the mother turns red in the face for shame. Naturally the cause of the boy's bad behavior is the teacher, who loses that lesson.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Some of these teachers tell how the pupil runs out at the back door when he sees him coming in at the front door and visa versa. The teacher searches for him on the one side, the mother or hired girl from the other till the half hour is past and the teacher must keep his appointment for the next one.</p>
   <p>But this does not always succeed, since in some homes the child is locked in his room till the teacher comes, the mother remains to help in this old fashion method, a cat o' nine tails is applied whenever the child stumbles in the lesson. Mother hits, the teacher helps, the child cries, and grandmother weeps. Which is still no solution to the case at hand. The boy receives his share, but in the end gets his own way, the learning ceases.</p>
   <p>Some teachers do not even pretend to teach. They have the child repeat the childish sentences, thus whiling away the half-hour, then leave.</p>
   <p>One teacher of this sort showed me a book in which he had written the names and addresses of his pupils. Each name had a notation after it; as, butcher, grocery, meeting, pinocle. At my questioning he explained thus: This lesson he acquired when he met the mother in the butcher <span class="page-break">\5</span>shop, the second, in the grocery, third at a meeting, etc.</p>
   <p>He proceeded to relate this occurrence: "At one lesson I had to come early in the morning to say prayers with a child. One day, mother listening to them, remarked that one word should be pronounced with an Sh not an S, so her mother taught her and her grandmother before her. Explanations were of no avail. The more proof I offered in my favor the more she became enraged, until she called me "peasant, course person." Thus I lost a lesson. Now I am smarter. If a mother wants it pronounced Sh, so it is, just so she pays regularly for the lessons.</p>
   <p>Is it any wonder that though the children learn till their confirmation yet they know no Hebrew? That our youth grows up in ignorance with such bad ideas of Judaism? When there exists such a horrible condition in our Hebrew teaching?</p>
   <p>What kind of a Jewish generation can we expect from such a Jewish educational system? One can just about imagine. They will probably not be Christians but neither will they be Jews. They will be closer to Christendom than Judaism. Perhaps they may grow to be Jewish anti-Semites?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>I believe, the worthy Rabbi, the older Jews, and every thinking person who sees this horrible tragic future of our youth should take the time to hold a conference regarding this most important of all questions.</p>
   <p>Also our Zionist friends might spare a little time to this question. Opening a Zionist Hebrew School is perhaps more important than "to have the land," for, instructing one child, and bringing him into the Jewish fold is just like rearing an entire world.</p>
   <p>Yes, our brothers do not understand yet the huge disaster that hovers over our youth. If only they understood it! Then they too would look for better methods, of which there are many. For example: In the Lawndale district there is a small Hebrew School for thousands of children. In the Orphanage there are plenty of vacant rooms, and a public school where lessons are held after 4 P. M. It would be no more than right if the more well-to-do children were also sent to these Hebrew Schools.</p>
   <p>Another sign of unthinking and not understanding the immediate danger of our youth, may be seen wherein the Anshe Chenes Israel built a beautiful synagogue with a school for the older folks without thinking of building their <span class="page-break">\7</span>basement somewhat higher to be used for a children's school.</p>
   <p>Of the old folks, we know they will not leave us, but the youngsters? They do not come to us. With such Jews as result from a Jewish education such as our children now receive, full of so much neglect, we Jews, especially those of Chicago, will find ourselves, in the near future, in a very tragic condition.</p>
