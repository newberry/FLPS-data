   <p>There are four academic Jewish institutions in America: two in New York, one in Philadelphia, and one in Cincinnati. Three of these institutions have a common purpose--to educate students for the rabbinate; the fourth, the Dropsie College in Philadelphia, is a Jewish research institution for scholars.</p>
   <p>We do not derive much comfort from any one of these institutions. The Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati is rich in financial resources, but that institution has no soul. It is a rabbinical seminary in which very little is taught, and that little which is taught, is taught falsely and incorrectly. That is why up until now, Cincinnati has not produced a single Jewish scholar. Not only that, it has raised a generation of rabbis who are ignoramuses. The Hebrew Union College of Cincinnati is of small benefit to American Jewry spiritually, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but it is harmful politically because the students of Cincinnati grow up with a false historical and political understanding of Judaism, and when they are mature and influential, they become a negative and destructive force instead of a positive and constructive one. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the Hebrew Union College is an asset to American Jewry.</p>
   <p>We get more comfort out of the two institutions in New York, the Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Yeshivah and the Jewish Theological Seminary. Both institutions could accomplish wonders, were it not for the existing "politics" which prevent them from being fruitful. The Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Yeshivah should have brought up a generation of scholars, but it did not do so; the Jewish Theological Seminary should have educated a generation of learned and wise men, but it did not do so. We did not even get the results we expected from the Dropsie College. It did not become another college for the study of the science of Judaism, such as we have in Berlin, Germany; nor did it become a Jewish theological seminary like those in Breslav and Vienna. The institutions in those cities have produced great men in the field of Jewish education.</p>

   <p>It seems that the Torah is unlucky in America. These conditions have had, naturally, a bad effect upon the whole spiritual life of American Jewry.</p>
   <p>As long as Chicago was virtually a colony of New York, it could not do anything in the field of Jewish spiritual life. The awakening of Chicago Jewry during the last few years, the great philanthropic achievements of Chicago Jewry, the appearance of many important and influential Jewish leaders who are influencing the whole country--all this justifies the undertaking which the leaders of Chicago Orthodoxy want to realize--the founding of a Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah. This institution should not be a professional school like the one in Cincinnati nor an institute for scholars like Dropsie College, but a combination of both.</p>
   <p>Chicago is now morally, spiritually and philanthropically sufficiently self-reliant to have its own institution of the Torah, which should avoid the mistakes of the Jewish academic institutions of New York and Cincinnati. Chicago is entitled to have its own institution because Chicago is the second greatest Jewish community in the world, and is the focal point of all of midwestern <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Jewry, which numbers at least six hundred thousand people. Chicago is entitled to have its own Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah because such an institution is an absolute necessity. Chicago can and must educate its own rabbis and instructors. It also ought to have a spiritual center, which should spread some light over this great Jewish community [that is, give spiritual guidance].</p>
   <p>We do not want to prophesy that the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah, which they are now going to build in Chicago, will be a better, more beautiful, more productive institution than the academic institutions of the East, but we do say that it can become an important and influential institution. It can educate rabbis according to the theories of modern Orthodoxy; it can educate an adequate number of teachers for Chicago and the whole Middle West; it can create a place where young Jewish scholars may go on with the development of their talents and their creative work.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jews are sufficiently rich and they are willing to make some sacrifices in order to provide the institutions with everything they may need. We believe <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>that the Chicago Jews will fulfill their duty to the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah.</p>
   <p>The most important thing at the moment is the erection of a building for this institution. Eighty thousand dollars is needed to build a home for the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah, and this eighty thousand dollars must be raised within the next three months.</p>
   <p>No Chicago Jew who has in his soul a spark of local community pride, should miss giving his contribution to the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah and help to create in Chicago a spiritual center of the Torah and of learning. It is a noble undertaking, a needed undertaking, which deserves the sympathy and support of every Chicago Jew.</p>
