   <p>In additon to the cultural part that the Jewish theater plays in the life of the Jewish population, it is also an important factor in raising great sums for various philanthropic purposes.</p>
   <p>There is hardly an organization, beginning with the Workmen's Circle down to the smallest verein, that do not approach the Jewish theater, from time to time, as a relief measure in time of need.</p>
   <p>Upon a report, by the treasurer, that there is a deficit in the treasury, an affair is arranged in a Jewish theater and the deficit is covered. If an unfortunate incident occurs to a member of an organization, it is understook that the theater must come to his aid; if a verein wishes to enrich its treasury, there is no better method than to arrange a theatrical benefit affair; if the Denver Sanitarium for Consumptives is in need of money, <span class="page-break">2</span>a theatrical performance is presented and money is raised. This method, of raising money, is so popular among the organizations that three evenings during the week, throughout the winter season, devoted to various benefits performances. And very seldom does it occur that a benefit does not have succsssful results.</p>
   <p>It usually happens, when the affair is arranged by a small organization, that the entire house is not sold out; nevertheless, there remains a profit. Very small organizations engage only a small part of the theater. Where does the secret of the success lie, which the benefit performances constantly meet?</p>
   <p>That the Jewish race is a book has been known in the past. The written word was alway the basic foundation of the Jewish race. Willingly or unwillingly, the nation must agree that the Jew contributed a great deal to science and wisdom.</p>

   <p>Art, in the name of art,is yet a bit foreign to him. It matters not how artful, how literary a performance may be, if it does not contain a bit of substantiality, it will not interest the average Jew.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if a performance is announced for a specific philanthropic purpose, there remains no doubt the Jew as to whether he shall go. The performance may not even be successful, it matters little, however, the purpose is important. There is another reason for the financial success of the benefit performances.</p>
   <p>The theater is a panacea for charity purposes in a secretive way: They amuse themselves and at the same time help somebody. It happens, as if, one knew to whom the money is contributed. Who ever accepts the donations, does not feel lowered.</p>
   <p>There are the two secrets upon which the financial success of the theatrical benefit are based. Therefore the theater is doubly important to Jewish life.</p>
