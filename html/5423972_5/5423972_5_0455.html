   <p>A Chanukah Celebration will be given Wednesday evening, December 13, at the Civic Opera House, Max Shulman, president of the Zionist Organization of Chicago announced.</p>
   <p>"Our Chanukah Festival," Mr. Shulman stated, "will be as notable in its way as the great Stadium pageant we gave last Chanukah. An original dramatic and musical program presented by artists of the first rank, will comprise our offering. The event has become tradition in the Chicago Jewish community, and this year's observance will uphold the standard of last year's Stadium affair, which won the attention of the entire country."</p>
