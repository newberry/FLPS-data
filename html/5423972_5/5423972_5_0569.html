   <p>The Personal Service Society will give a dramatic performance and a strawberry festival within the next fortnight.</p>
   <p>Next Thursday night, the Johannah Lodge will give a strawberry festival and hop at the Kursaal, on 31st St. The entertainment is given for the benefit of the Women's Evening Class of The Jewish Training School, and the fact that it is in the hands of the ladies of Johannah Lodge is a guarantee of its success.</p>
   <p>No institution is more deserving or is more in need of aid than is the school, and there should be a generous our-pouring of the well-disposed at this festival.</p>
