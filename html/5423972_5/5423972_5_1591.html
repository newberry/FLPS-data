   <p>A short news article in the Courier a few days ago announced that the shelter home on Grenshaw Street, which is still under construction, will result in a modern Talmud Torah, kindergarten, and community center under the name, Keneseth Israel Hebrew school.</p>
   <p>This news item was read with joy by all who have strived to have a modern Jewish educational institution and orphan home for the Lawndale district, which district is rich and fat in luxuries.</p>
   <p>Complaints were often heard that the only ideals of the older residents of that district is a good poker game, and that the younger generation is-growing up without Jewish education and respect for elders, their only recreation place being the pool room. There they also play cards; and it is a known fact that card-playing often causes tragedies in the families who attain their climax in the pool rooms.</p>
   <p>What is the cause of that?</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>This was a question asked by many, and all were convinced that the Lawndale District lacked spiritual activities, especially modern Jewish educational institutions which will teach our children to be human and to be good Jews. Therefore it is very fortunate that the directors of the shelter home now being constructed have realized that it would be more advisable for the Chicago Jewry to complete the building as a Talmud Torah (school of religious lore) and community center, which will fill in the Jewish life in that community.</p>
   <p>Instead of our having two shelter homes, which would be an unnecessary burden to Chicago Jews, since we cannot expect any Jewish immigrants so long as the war continues, and very few even after the war, we will have one large Talmud Torah and orphan home, which will be under the auspices of the two worthy congregations of that community: the Anshe Keneseth Israel, and Sheri-Torah-Anshe-Meierev.</p>
   <p>This was the wish of every one who saw in Jewish education the greatest ideal, and who did not want their children and those of their neighbors to grow up like wild weeds, knowing everything else in the world but their own Jewish <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>A, B, C, and ignorant of the ethical teachings of our prophets and philosophers.</p>
   <p>This is a good idea for future activities, and a good example for other congregations and organizations; they may also start some substantial welfare work that will serve our noble Jewish ideals.</p>
   <p>Naturally it is too early to speak, too early to submit a plan for the organizing of all Jewish educational institutions of our city into one alliance, with one fund-but the time will lead to it. The fact remains that a Talmud Torah is not all.</p>
   <p>By merely teaching the children to recite prayers and preparing them for confirmation, our obligation to them is not completely fulfilled, as the real Jewish studies just begin when the child graduates the Talmud Torah. A child must have an idea of all the higher studies, because this is actually our spiritual treasure from which we draw power for our existence.</p>
   <p>In order that this be achieved, the Chicago Jewish educational institutions <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>should be divided, into a kindergarten, a Talmud Torah, a theological seminary, and academy for the study of Jewish rites, and a college of rabbinical studies.</p>
   <p>Some pessimists may say that America is not in favor of Jewish education, that the American children will not learn the Jewish studies, and that it is enough when you teach them just Hebrew reading.</p>
   <p>Those who think that way are greatly mistaken; America is no worse than Spain, where the Jews lived about four hundred years ago. The Jews were perfect Spaniards, both in their foreign appearance and language, yet that period of time in Jewish history is labelled as the "golden time," because Spain then produced the greatest Jewish poets and philosophers, who to this day remain our pride. The same can be true with the American Jewry if we can lead them on the right road and not become discouraged in our work.</p>
   <p>We must realize that not all children studying Jewish studies grow up to be teachers, and we need not lose our courage if only a small minority of them <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>prove to be outstanding. Even our philosophers are, in this respect, very conservative even though conditions in those days were much more favorable than at the present.</p>
   <p>Our thanks to Mr. Salk and Mr. Rozenberg for submitting this plan... Let us hope that this new institution will become a new chapter in the history of Jewish education and spiritual activities in our great city of Chicago.</p>
