   <p>Now that the storm which arose out of Rabbi [Judah Leb] Gordon's decision has calmed down, and the organizational work can be continued, it is worth while to reconsider the problem which provoked so much emotion, from a practical and objective point of view. We think it would be a good thing to recapitulate a few important points:</p>
   <p>1. The United Jewish Charities does not, cannot, must not, and will not interfere in [Jewish] education, as far as the curriculum is concerned.</p>
   <p>2. The majority of the Orthodox Jews of Chicago do not look upon Jewish education from the theological point of view. They think, as their parents <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>thought, that Jewish education is not only something theoretical,--the knowledge of certain dogmas--but it is also something practical. One can be a great scholar and at the same time, be an enemy of Israel. The Jewish people are interested primarily in their own survival. To assure the survival of the Jewish people, it is necessary to have Jews who live as Jews, to whom Judaism is not only a [matter of] theory, but is actually a part of their lives. A theological education cannot accomplish this.</p>
   <p>3. One cannot educate Jewish children in Chicago in the same way that they were educated in the small communities of the old country, communities like Shnipishok or Onishok. The system of education here must be entirely different. Education here must be intensive because we do not have the educational influence of the Jewish home and the Jewish atmosphere of the street.</p>
   <p>4. Most Orthodox Jewish parents are not interested in the details of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Jewish education of their children. They have no opinion about these problems. They leave them to the leaders of the city.</p>
   <p>5. Most Orthodox Jewish parents are not as pious here as they were in the old country. They simply want their children to remain Jews, and to know what Judaism is. The only thing that they know about the educational problem is that their children in America will not grow up to be holy men and great rabbinical scholars. That is why they have a minimum program for the Jewish education of their children.</p>
   <p>When one takes into consideration all these points, one can understand more clearly the educational work that is to be done here.</p>
   <p>Jewish education in America must not be one-sided; a little Hebrew, a little <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Pentateuch, in short, an old-fashioned Talmud Torah education mechanically pumped into the student. It must be systematic and methodical. The Jewish boy, after attending school for six years, must have a knowledge of Jewish life, of the Jewish past, of Jewish institutions, of Jewish duties, and of the condition of the Jewish people at present. The chief aim of Jewish education should be to encourage the Jewish child to grow up with Jewish interests at heart; he should be interested in everything that is Jewish.</p>
   <p>Can a theological education achieve this? Even the small group of people in this city who demand a purely theological education will not claim that it is possible to reach, via their educational methods, that which only a general and modern Jewish education can give. A theological education is, after all, a one-sided education, which gives a one-sided picture of Judaism. The theologically inclined Jew has no worldly Jewish interests; he is not interested in Jewish art, and so on. Why should American Jewry educate a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>generation of one-sided Jews, with sixteenth-century ideas?</p>
   <p>However, when one speaks of a worldly Jewish education, one must realize that such an education should not and must not be controlled by theologically inclined Jews. An educational council must be made up only of citizens who have a modern outlook on life. They must not only be inclined toward traditional Judaism, but they must also be educated men, who will see to it that the children under their supervision receive a general Jewish education, and that only children who show a great desire to study, or who possess specific religious and moral qualifications shall be prepared for the Hebrew Theological College. When one assumes, however, that the goal of every Talmud Torah should be the Hebrew Theological College, that is, that every child in the Talmud Torahs should receive an education that will enable him to enter the Hebrew Theological College upon reaching the age of fourteen years, then one can be sure that the next Jewish generation in Chicago will not be an ideal one from any point of view, neither from the point of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Jewish knowledge nor from the point of Jewish sincerity.</p>
   <p>We do not want to be misunderstood. We are not in favor of a Jewish education without religion, but we are in favor of a Jewish education without a catechism. Catechism belongs to the Catholics rather than the Jews. We are in favor of a Jewish education in which religion plays a big role, but not the only role. We part company with those Jews who demand that a Jewish education shall be exclusively religious. It is our sincere opinion that one can better implant religion in a Jewish child through a general education than through a purely religious one. The Jewish religion should be taught in such a way that the child should feel that it is a part of his general education, a part of his life. Religious education must not be tasteless and mechanical; it must be beautiful, it must distinguish itself by a certain "modesty," it must be indirect, it must be hardly noticeable. Only in such a way can one raise a generation of religious Jews in America.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>This should be the foundation of the educational council. We hope that the committee of five will select twenty men who have such ideas on education.</p>
