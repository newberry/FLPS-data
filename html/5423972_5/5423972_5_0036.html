   <p>Sculptor R. H. Parks of 1843 Michigan Avenue has just finished a Paris plaster model of a statue of Michael Reese, to be erected next spring on the walk leading to the Michael Reese Hospital on the lake front, near Twenty-nineth Street. Joseph Rosenberg, who lived in San Francisco, a son of Jacob Rosenberg of 1626 Michigan Avenue, was a nephew of Michael Reese and in his will provided that $10,000 of his money should be paid for a statue of his uncle, to be placed in the hospital grounds. The executors gave the commission to Mr. Parks, who has designed a standing figure of Michael Reese eight feet high. The statue is to be of bronze, cast in Chicago or in Rome. The simplicity of the life of Mr. Reese is copied in the plaster figure. The dress is simple, the folds of the frock coat being carelessly drawn back, the right hand resting on the hips and the left foot thrown forward. In making the model Mr. Parks was guided by a photograph of Mr. Reese taken about five years before his death. The bronze figure will rest on a pedestal of Bovano granite, from Italy, twelve feet high and sixteen feet square. The bronze statue will cost about $7,000.</p>
