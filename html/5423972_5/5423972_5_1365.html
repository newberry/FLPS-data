   <p>One of the most remarkable institutions in the Jewish district of Chicago is, without doubt, the Progressive Preparatory School. This school presents an opportunity so every immigrant to learn the English language in a short time.</p>
   <p>You can meet students there, who have not been long in this country, and who can already write a composition in good English. The intelligent students, who attended classes in Europe, are inspired by the teaching methods of this school.</p>
   <p>The faculty is one of rare ability. The principal of the school is very particular in engaging a teacher. A teacher in the Progressive Preparatory school must be a University Graduate and an able critic of what he teaches.</p>
   <p>The atmosphere of the school is very pleasant, and the teachers give a great deal of individual attention to the students. Very often, the teachers call meetings to discuss how it would be best to elucidate to certain students various problems of mathematics, grammar, arithmetic or history. This spirit and standard of study exists not only in the higher courses of the school, but also in grammar school and special classes in English for beginners.</p>

   <p>Under these conditions, it is understood that the success of the teachers is great. In, a period of only 5 months, many students completed the entire public school courses.</p>
   <p>Among those, who receive deplomas today at 2 P.M. are many, who began with the alphabet five months ago. This graduation is a sort of thanksgiving in honor of the great success of the school. The school has, therefore, prepared a magnificent program in the assembly hall of the Herzl School.</p>
