   <p>Our Workmen's Circle schools of Chicago are now in existence two years and the people are awaiting the results; but in order to be able to judge the results of the schools during the two years, we must first know what the Hebrew schools and the Talmud Torahs have accomplished for their students. We have here in Chicago, as in other cities in America, a generation of thirty to forty year-old men and women of foreign parentage who received their education in American Jewish schools and Talmud Torahs. These former students of the American Jewish schools and Talmud Torahs are far removed from Jewish life. They are estranged from the Jewish language; they are not interested in the Jewish past, present, or future; they do not read Jewish history, even in English, and know more about Chinese art and literature, than of their own Jewish people. Some, who claim to be religious, come riding in their automobiles, if they are business men, to the Conservative or half- or full-Reform temple on New Year and Atonement Day. Aside from this bit of Judaism, they have no connection with the Jewish masses. They are as far removed from Jewish interests as is the American gentile. In the English newspapers they read only <span class="page-break">\2</span>the sport news and the jokes; some read political news also. Should they read the account of a frame-up against Jews or a pogrom on Jews, they would feel as though they had nothing in common with it. They are members of sport clubs and card clubs and they contribute to the Salvation Army and similar charities; but they do not show the least bit of interest in Jewish affairs, unless they are politicians, and even then their method is not different from that of the Irish, Czechoslovakian or other politician who must appeal to his community for votes. When gentile politicians need the "Jewish vote", they give free mazoth to the poor Jewish people. The same is done in the Italian, Polish and other immigrant quarters. Would the children of these immigrant Jews not have been better off if their parents, because of radicalism, ignorance or indifference, would not have given them a Jewish education. There are still quite a few old Jewish radicals who regard the actions of their modern American children with displeasure. Many of these radical fathers and mothers are now self-converted, respectable liberals, and believe that if it were not for the peace disturbers, the Bolsheviks, the world would not be a paradise to live in.</p>
   <p>As we look upon the children of the Workmen's Circle schools we must first <span class="page-break">\3</span>realize that the school is scarely two years old, and that very few children have been in that school from the first day. Yet how great is the difference between the children of the Workmen's Circle school, and those who were educated in the Jewish Schools, Talmud Torahs or even in the English Socialist Sunday Schools.</p>
   <p>In the Workmen's Circle schools they do not teach the socialistic catechism, nor do they sing class-struggle songs with the older children. The Jewish folk school, founded by the Workmen's Circle, teaches the Jewish worker's children the language of the Jewish masses and their life, and struggle in every country at all times. The worker's child, there, becomes aware of the battle for freedom and justice by all nations, races, and sexes, from earlist times until this day. In order to raise in America progressive, self-sacrificing youth, as in our old home in Europe, we must rear the children in a different atmosphere and environment from that of the American capitalistic public school. We cannot expect the Jewish children in the American public school to grow up to be followers of the social-minded Jewish prophets, or of the heroes who battled against imperialistic Rome, or of the martyrs who died for their Jewish ideals <span class="page-break">\4</span>at the hands of the Spanish inquisition or on the gallows of the Czar. In the American public schools children are taught to despise such human weaknesses as ideals, martyrdom, and international solidarity. They fill the child's heart with respect and admiration for oppressors, murderers and tyrants. First of all, in the Workmen's Circle, the worker's child is in an atmosphere where a hero like King David is praised as a singer of psalms, as a poet of shattered hearts and distorted souls, and not as a war lord. These two years of the Workmen's Circle school represent only half the work, as the school term is four years. In addition, the school did not get the "right" children to start with. The parents hesitated in accepting the new enterprise. Children came and went. Ignorant mothers demanded that their boys should be taught the prayer for the dead. They were satisfied that the girls should be taught to write a few words of Yiddish. In the Workmen's Circle schools there are more boys than girls, which proves that the parents realize the difference between the method used in the new Jewish folk school and the old method. Some parents send two or three children to this school and pay the tuition fee with pleasure. The parents organized a society that is deeply interested in this school. Even high school children are continuing their studies here.</p>

   <p>The Workmen's Circle spent a great deal of money to build a foundation for these Jewish folk schools. The three schools in Chicago cost the workmen's Circle approximately $50,000 for almost two years. That is a large sum of money, but, it is still the best investment the Workmen's Circle has ever made. Gold and silver can be smelted, stone and bricks can turn to dust, but worthy ideals endure forever.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle created an example of an universal Jewish people's school. It is young but it is already the most liked institution among the Jewish workers. It also became an indirect, important recruiting station for developing new members of the Workmen's Circle. Naturally these schools are far from complete. There are many things still to be done and changes to be made for the better, as all the teachers, the administration, the educational committee of the Workmen's Circle and the members that pay taxes toward the support of these schools realize. The parents' organization and all the other branches that have helped these schools become what they are today, will now surely double their energy so that this beautiful tree which the Workmen's Circle has planted, will take root, grow and branch out for the good of the Jewish worker's child and for the glory of the Jewish working masses.</p>
