   <p>The history of modern Hebrew and Yiddish literature is also the history of modern Hebrew and Yiddish journalism. All our great writers of the present day started their careers as journalists. Even the great Anglo-Jewish writers, who have won world-wide reputations and fame, like Israel Zangwill, Lucien Wolf, and from among the younger generation, Leon Simon and Harry Sacher, started their brilliant careers as contributors to the London Jewish Chronicle. The greatest Hebrew writer living, who is at the same time our greatest diplomat, Mr. Nachum Sokolow, started <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>his career as a journalist and as a contributor to the Hebrew daily, Hazfirah. Even our great contemporary poets have started as contributors to the newspapers. Our press has proved to be the greatest literary educational agency. It has called into being and it has trained all our literary forces.</p>
   <p>The city of Chicago, with its Jewish population of 300,000, is a great philanthropic center and also a great Zionist center, but it is not a Jewish literary center. There are but a few Jewish writers or poets. But still, among 300,000 Jews there must be scores of men and women with literary ability and inclinations. We have reason to believe that there is much dormant literary and artistic Jewish talent in Chicago, and all that is needed to bring these talents to the fore and to make them productive is to give them an opportunity to acquire a literary technique, and to awaken their literary ambitions. We suppose that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>there is any amount of dormant Jewish talent among the younger generation. There must be young men and women in our midst who, acquiring a literary technique, would enrich our literature and prove to be a great spiritual asset in our community.</p>
   <p>Presuming that there are vast literary potentialities in Jewish Chicago, we have decided to do all we can to turn them into actualities, and to this end, the Daily Jewish Courier will inaugurate an extensive literary contest, with a certain number of prizes, so that all those with literary ability may have an opportunity to start a literary career. American Jewry has but few publicists of repute, and only a few novelists. Most of our literary forces in this country are imported from the other side. It is time that we produced our literary forces right here on the spot, and that we be no longer dependent on gifts from European Jewry.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>All our writers and poets who come here from the other side, able though they are, cannot possibly exercise a vast influence on the Americanized Jews, because they are still thinking in European terms. We ought to have American Jewish writers, American Jewish novelists, and American Jewish poets, that is to say, Jewish artists who are products of American civilization and American Jewish life, and who are connected with American Jewish life. The activities of such artists would enrich our life and would give it beautiful tone and color. We are anxious to see such forces arise. We are anxious to see American Jewry enriched spiritually and artistically, and we mean to do all we can to bring out these forces.</p>
   <p>The literary contest to be inaugurated by the Courier this week, will give every Jewish young man and woman in Chicago an opportunity to test his or her literary ability, and to acquire training....</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Within a few days we will publish a list of subjects and themes, together with the prizes fixed for the best essays, the best short stories and the best poems, to be published in the Courier, and we hope that those who have any literary ability will use this opportunity and will make an attempt to show what they can do in the literary field. The editor of the Courier does not undertake to be the sole judge of the literary and artistic contributions to be sent to him for publication. The contribution will be examined also by competent literary judges, and their verdict will be accepted by the editor of this paper. The winning of a literary prize may prove to be a good starting point for able young men and women in the community, and may awaken their ambition to continue their literary activities and to make literature their sole profession in life. Within a few days we will publish particulars about this contest.</p>
