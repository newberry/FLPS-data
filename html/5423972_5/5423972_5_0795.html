   <p>In the early eighties, Chicago Jewry was blessed with five publications in English, and one or two in German. Most of them were "weeklies," but "weaklings" in body and spirit. The only two which survived to the period where my story begins were the Occident and the Israelite and soon the Occident too, passed into oblivion.</p>
   <p>The Occident went out of existence quietly and no one felt its loss. No obituary was written and no lamentation was chanted. Thus the oldest Jewish publication in English, at the present time, is the Chicago Israelite. It was founded in 1884, and was the legitimate offspring of the American Israelite, founded by Dr. Isaac Mayer Wise and originally published in Cincinnati. For many years the publication was managed and edited by Leo Wise, who wrote under the pseudonym of "Nickerdom," and who was the son of Dr. Isaac Mayer Wise. About fifteen years ago, the capable Miss Mollie Osherman acquired ownership of the paper and since then has been in managing editor and publisher.</p>
