   <p>There are in Chicago only twenty-four Talmud Torahs to take care of forty-five thousand Jewish children. Only ten or twelve out of the twenty-four can be considered real educational institutions--the others are small cheders, which cannot accommodate more than one hundred students and quite often not even that many. Chicago needs, to take proper care of its forty-five thousand Jewish children, at least one hundred Talmud Torahs, each one capable of attending to three or five hundred children. You can readily see that Chicago is bringing up a generation of ignoramuses, because instead of one hundred good Talmud Torahs we have only ten good ones and the rest are of poor quality.</p>
