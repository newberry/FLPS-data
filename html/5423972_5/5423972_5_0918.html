   <p>It has been a year since a new department was installed in the Courier. We can truthfully say that our paper has accomplished much in the field of Jewish journalism in America.</p>
   <p>With its large staff of fine writers, the Courier stands on a par with other large newspapers in New York. It is the barometer of Jewish Life, of Jewish influence, and Jewish creativeness in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Courier has grown in circulation and significance. It has many more readers than it had a year ago. It also has done much in various fields for the Jewish and general community in this city. The Courier not only had the interests of the local Jews at heart, but also of those across the sea. Thanks to its efforts, many institutions have liquidated their debts while other [institutions] have been established. Thanks to its efforts, Jews across the sea received all possible aid. The movement to build a home for Jews was naturally not neglected. "Judaism and Americanism" is written across its flag, to which end it has devoted its entire force.</p>
   <p>The one in quest of good literature, enlightenment, or the latest news, the tradespeople of Chicago and other cities--all are grouped around the Courier. The worker possessing special interests also finds first-class information and a sympathetic voice therein.</p>
   <p>For every department of this newspaper, as can be seen from its index, we have specialists, experienced persons with responsible duties--persons who know what they want and understand well the needs of the reader as well as the advertiser.</p>
   
   <p>The new department and the prosperity in the business world has elevated the Courier to the position in which it now finds itself. The readers may expect more improvements--the advertisers even greater returns. There must be more business for the advertiser when the newspaper improves. And the newspaper is improved when its circulation increases.</p>
   <p>The Courier does not rest merely upon its laurels in this community which has given it a great clientele of Jewish readers and advertisers, but progresses, acquiring ever more writers, and improving its form.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Community and the Courier in Chicago are one. The interests of one are those of the other. The welfare and progress of one are those of the other. Chicago Jews influence and keep pace with the Courier in all phases of community life.</p>
