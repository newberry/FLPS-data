   <p>For the past few years, the Orthodox Jews of America have been busy organizing Yeshivoth [theological seminaries] to disseminate Talmudic knowledge. The Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Yeshivah of New York, of which Dr. Revel is the head, has made great progress in the last two years. It is now, without doubt, the center of Talmudic studies throughout the United States. The local Yeshivoth, however, in the smaller cities, have also made considerable progress, and today, there is more Talmud being taught in the United States than there has been for the past five or ten years. In Chicago, we have two (sic) Yeshivoth: the Yeshivah Etz Chaim and the Beth Midrash La-Rabbanim, where the students study diligently.</p>
   <p>While the local Yeshivoth are supported by the local Orthodox synagogues, the national Yeshivah in New York depends upon the support of all of American <span class="page-break">\2</span>Jewry. It is justified in demanding support from all American Jews because it accepts pupils from all parts of the United States. Among the three hundred students, are quite a number of young men from Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and many other cities. The Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Yeshivah gives its students a thorough Talmudic and general education, and also provides for their physical well-being.</p>
   <p>It is certainly, therefore, the duty of all those in the United States who love the Torah, to come to the assistance of this great center of Talmudic studies so that it may become the "Volozhin of America". [Translator's note: The Volozhiner Yeshivah is considered the greatest in the world. Volozhin is a city in Lithuania.]</p>
   <p>The Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Yeshivah has sent its representative, Rabbi Kapland, to Chicago. He is one of the teachers in that Yeshivah. Rabbi Kapland's mission in Chicago is to interest the Orthodox Jews of Chicago in the Rabbi Isaac Elchonon Yeshivah. We hope that Chicago Jews will welcome the <span class="page-break">\3</span>representative of the great New York Yeshivah with the respect due a representative of so great an institution, and that they will see to it that his mission is successful. Although Chicago has two (sic) Yeshivoth of its own, still it is traditionally obligated to support the national Yeshivah in New York.</p>
