   <p>The following letter from Mr. Carl Wolfsohn, the eminent pianist of Chicago, has given the Public Library of Chicago, the late Beethoven Society's valuable music scores of eminent authors, which has an intrinsic value of at least $2,500......</p>
   <p>Mr. Adolph Moses</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The Library of the Beethoven Society, which has been placed at my disposition by the Board of Directors of that society, I have held for several years, waiting for an opportunity to present it to a new musical society whose only and principal aim should be the Highest in Art. As no such opportunity presents itself and is even not visible in the near future, I beg you to request the Board of Directors of the Public Library to accept it as a gift on my part, to an institution fostering that, which through my whole life had had my deepest sympathy, - The advancement and culture of mind and soul.</p>

   <p>Should at any time the loan of the works of the Beethoven Library assist the new as well as now existing choral societies, it would fully meet my wishes, and an object attained I always had in view.</p>
   <p>Carl Wolfsohn</p>
   <p>March 9, 1888.</p>
   <p>Chicago.</p>
