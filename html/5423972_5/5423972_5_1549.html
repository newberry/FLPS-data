   <p>Until the Maccabee School was organized a few years ago to take the place of our day Hebrew school attendance had never been as satisfactory as it is now. At best a few years ago when we conducted our school, the attendance daily averaged 60, while now, we have an enrollment of 120 children and a daily attendance of 95. The work is very earnest and intense, and is interested in all modern Jewish development.</p>
   <p>This work is accomplished not through the medium of a class, but through the instrumentality of a club that has its own offices and arranges its own programs, all under the direction of volunteer leaders who are trained in a leaders training class likewise conducted by the Institute under young Judea supervision. This leaders class includes not only the leaders in the Institute, but leaders in the other branches of the city. Young Judea further conducts the Jewish Holiday Celebrations by fitting programs given to audiences in the Assembly Hall.</p>
