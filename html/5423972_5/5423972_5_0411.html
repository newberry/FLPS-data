   <p>The Dramatishe Gezelshaft (Jewish Art Players) have been successful in engaging the services of Mr. Abraham Morevsky for their dramatic director of this forth-coming season. Mr. Morevsky is one of the founders of the famous Wilner Troupe, an actor and director of note and a prominent journalist, besides. He expects the first performance to be given in the last part of December, just before the New Year. Some of the plays proposed by him for the repertoire this season are - Herod, by Alter Katzizne; Rags, by H. Leivick, and the Merchant of Venice.</p>
   <p>The work of the Dramatishe i is too well known in the Chicago Jewish community to need elaborate exploitation here. All who are interested in good literary and artistic production in Yiddish will be glad of the opportunity given them by the intensification of the good work of the Jewish Art Players under their new director.</p>
