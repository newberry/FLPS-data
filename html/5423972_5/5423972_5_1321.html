   <p>The Jewish People's Institute of Chicago announces the opening of a class in the Technique of the Scenario, or Writing for Motion Pictures, on February 5, 1923, under the instruction of Blanche Rowan, recently of the Irving Writers' School of New York, and of the George Washington and Robertson Universities of Washington, D.C. and a member of the Writers' League of that city.</p>
   <p>An unique opportunity is being offered in Chicago to learn the art of writing for Motion Pictures by direct class instruction, instead of by correspondence, which is good in itself, but not stimulating enough to inspire the average student to his best efforts. Under proper instruction, writing salable scenarios is far simpler than the average person thinks. It need not discourage anyone, however meager his education. Amateur writers, with practically no previous literary training, have been successful in this form of writing. Many an ambitious student has worked his way through college by <span class="page-break">\2</span>means of his earnings in this lucrative field. Because of the great profit found in it, and its high artistic development, writing for the screen has also engaged the attention of the best and most highly paid writers.</p>
   <p>The drama is the mother of all arts, because it embraces all the arts--music, sculpture, painting, poetry, and every art finds expression in the production of a good drama. It, therefore, makes a wide cultural appeal to every class, and since the scenario has become a highly developed form of the drama, without the limitations of the legitimate stage in time and space, it is expected that our class will arouse much interest in cosmopolitan and artistic Chicago.</p>
   <p>New writers are in great demand, because there is daily need for new material.</p>
   <p>The story is the thing and every normal human being is capable of producing stories. One's own life is made up of stories. Lists of the best markets will be made an important point in the course, and free criticism of scenarios <span class="page-break">\3</span>will be given students. An honest and sincere endeavor will be made in this serious course to make it as practical as possible, so that students will be enabled to write salable scenarios, and place them in the best markets.</p>
   <p>The class will meet every Monday and Wednesday evening at the Jewish People's Institute, 1258 W. Taylor Street at 7:30 o'clock. All the technical phases, as well as the marketing problems will be given thorough attention. As many model screen plays as possible will be discussed in class.</p>
   <p>Personal class instruction has many advantages over the correspondence courses, since it has the vivifying and stimulating influence of the instructor as well as the inspiring presence of other enthusiastic classmates of similar tastes. We feel that this course will render a distinct service in helping you to discover your talent and develop your writing ability.</p>
   <p>Lectures by Screen Stars will be featured from time to time.</p>
   <p>The fees are very moderate--only ten dollars for the entire course. First <span class="page-break">\4</span>session free.</p>
   <p>Registration now open at the office of the Institute, 1258 W. Taylor Street. Tele. Haymarket 6400. [Editor's note: This article is in English originally. It has not been edited in the usual manner.]</p>
