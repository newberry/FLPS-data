   <p>The Weekly Social Dance.</p>
   <p>Among the many noteworthy features at the Institute is the weekly social dance, in the large hall. It is not only one of the most popular activities of the Institute, but also one of the most wholesome and beneficial recreational interests there.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the dance brings the young people of the West Side together socially. And this is no mean benefit. The decent young people of this neighborhood are socially starved. For there is no other place where the youth who does not care to go to the cheap dance-hall can spend their evenings. They have no opportunity to mingle socially with those who regard them as their social equals.</p>
   <p>In most cases our immigrants, who constitute an important element at these dances, were brought here by industrial exigencies. People in the same factory, or living in the same house hail from different parts of the world, and, thus, strangers to one another, they look with distrust upon <span class="page-break">\2</span>their neighbors and are so looked upon. Here, then, there can be little chance for social intercourse. Where shall they turn for the satisfaction of their social instincts?</p>
   <p>Says Miss Jane Addams, in her Spirit of Youth and the City Streets:</p>
   <p>"One of the most pathetic sights in the public dance-halls of Chicago is the number of young men, obviously honest young fellows, who stand about vainly hoping to make the acquaintance of some nice girl. They look eagerly up and down the rows of girls, many of whom are drawn to the hall by the same keen desire for pleasure and social intercourse which the lonely young men themselves feel.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Institute, therefore, by getting up these social dances, is rendering a great service to the community. At these dances, he who cares can meet people, make friends, and acquire those small social amenities, the <span class="page-break">\3</span>value of which all of us appreciate. Thus, not only does the dance occasion afford instruction in the Rules of Etiquette and Good Behavior, but the chaperonage of several committees of the Institute, a paid person on the floor, and the surveillance every now and then of a detective to safeguard the young people, as it has never occurred to those who make profit out of this invincible love of pleasure to do this for our youth in their public dance halls. A visit to one of the Saturday evening dances will convince any visitor at once how definite a function this novel activity fulfills, and how it is possible by adequate care to safeguard it against the perils attendant upon it where it is run for private profit.</p>
