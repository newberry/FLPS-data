   <p>There has been organized in Chicago a Hebrew dramatic association called "Habimo," which aims to present, from time to time, literary dramas in Hebrew, since there is a demand for them. The first production will be given at the end of January, 1922. "Go And Relate," a play by Sholom Asch, will be presented. Participating in the play will be S. Sheinberg, Isaak Spector, Mrs. Spector, Friedman, and others. The Habimo was founded on the initiative of Dr. Agrant, Ben-Ami, Shomer, S. Lewad, and others.</p>
