   <p>The Jewish Courier moves convulsively in despair; it sees and feels that its reactionary doctrines, in the Jewish districts, comes to a quick ending. In the course of three days, the fact is affirmed that the readers of the Courier will cease reading it as soon as a new daily newspaper is published. The World has completely demonstrated it.</p>
   <p>Thousands of readers of the Courier of yesterday are readers of the World today. This hurts the owners of the Courier and they seek to terrorize the advertisers and the standkeepers. They have also attempted to write warnings to the printers' union, against the publishers of the World. The great success of the first two numbers of the World was surpassed by our third number and the burning wrath of the publishers of the Courier also ascended in proportion. They actually lost all patience; they threatened the standkeepers by saying that they would post news-boys at the stands and drive them out of business if they keep the World.</p>

   <p>The truth, however, is that the standkeepers cannot be involved; they are merely workers seeking a livelihood by selling papers that the public demands and the public now demands the World. The owners of the Courier are greatly mistaken if they think that by threats they can compel the readers to read their paper. The great masses of advanced men and women of Chicago do not recognize the Courier and longer; they have now their own "World."</p>
   <p>The publishers of the World, the labor organizations of Chicago, are highly pleased that the paper received such enthusiastic reception from all strata of the masses. The contrivances of the Courier will not help. Fate determined that the World shall replace the Courier for the Jewish masses of Chicago. The advanced laboring masses have now their own periodical.</p>
