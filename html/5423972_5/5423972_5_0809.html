   <p>In 1887, a few of the members of the Dorshe Sfath Ever were gathered in their library. A young man entered with the important news that Chicago was to have, at last, a Yiddish newspaper of its own.</p>
   <p>Peter Wiernick was to edit this daily paper, together with Leon Zolotkoff, Paris correspondent of the Russky Evrey (The Russian Jew), a Russian weekly. Mr. Zolotkoff arrived in Chicago a few days later, and shortly after his arrival, the Daily Jewish Courier was born.</p>
   <p>Leon Zolotkoff's presence in Chicago contributed much to the spiritual life of our Jewish population. His influence was great and he became the mouthpiece of the Ghetto Jews.</p>
