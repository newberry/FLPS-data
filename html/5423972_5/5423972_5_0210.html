   <p>The opening of the Jewish theatrical season in Chicago has been for many years an inspiration to many of our journalists who have used it as an opportunity to discuss topics of the day, as well as to make profound and wise observations about the Jewish theater. I hereupon declare that I have no intention of writing a polemic on the subject of our dramatic literature, because I do not wish to injure the Jewish theater which is a popular and highly beneficial public institution. Very few Jewish theaters can withstand objective criticism, and very few of them are institutions of art in the true sense of the word. The Jewish theater is not to be judged from an aesthetic standpoint but rather from a standpoint of socio-philanthropy, of usefulness, and of general mass education. Naturally, it is also an amusement center for the Jewish masses. This guarantees its popularity, and therefore, it can grow and prosper. The Jewish press in America shows no progress at the present time because of the decline in its circulation, as a result of the cessation of immigration for the past five years. While the Jewish press is largely dependent upon mass immigration, the Jewish theater has grown by leaps and bounds in the last five years. The number of Jewish theaters in America has doubled in the last five years, because the Jewish theater does not depend upon Jewish immigration. Americanized and American-born Jews also attend the Jewish theater regularly, and as our theater is in addition an important socio-philanthropic center, it is now the most significant institution of the Jewish masses in America. That explains why our theater occupies such a prominent place in our public life and why the masses are so greatly interested in it.</p>
   <p>The present theater season, which begins tomorrow throughout America, in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Chicago, and other cities with a large Jewish population, is attracting the special attention of the masses because a keen competition has developed everywhere in regard to the Jewish theater, and because a considerable number of new theaters have been opened this year. Quantity always has a certain attraction for the public and numbers always impress it. Naturally, it also expects a certain [amount of] improvement in the theater as a result of this competition because every manager will try his best to satisfy the public.</p>
   <p>The increasing number of Jewish theaters will certainly lead to specialization in Jewish theatrical art: one theater will devote itself to serious drama; a second, to operettas; a third, to psychological plays; a fourth, to comedies, etc. It is very likely that through this procedure the number of Jewish theatergoers will increase. Until now the number of Jewish theatergoers amounted to no more than fifteen per cent of the Jewish population, but as a result of this competition, it may rise to twenty per cent, or perhaps to twenty-five per cent.</p>
   <p>The general tendency of the Jewish theater today is to become more and more an amusement center, especially since a new company has been formed in New York, which will devote itself entirely to serious drama of literary value. Many of our readers will perhaps be unable to understand this tendency. They will say to themselves: the times are so deplorable, the lot of our people is so tragic that it is impossible to amuse oneself. But that is a wrong attitude. When a Jewish newspaper reader is unable to scan the news without running across items dealing with the murder of Jews and pogroms, he needs a place to which he can escape from this pogrom atmosphere. The more consistently the Jewish press prints the news of slaughter and pogrom, the more necessary an amusement center like the Jewish theater becomes.</p>
   <p>One can, therefore, well imagine that the managers of the Jewish theaters will concentrate on light and amusing plays for this coming season and that Boris Thomashevsky, king of the Jewish operetta stars, will reign not only on Second Avenue in New York, but in the provincial towns as well.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the present season will be an extraordinary one. Three Jewish theaters are opening here: the Empire Theater, Glickman's Palace Theater, and Gertner's Independence Theater. We can expect keen competition when the managers present their opening production. Then the real [entertainment] offensive will begin.</p>
