   <p>The Yehoash Literary Group, who undertook to have a part, or if possible, the complete works of Yehoash translated into English, elected officers. They are: Dr. David Blaustein, chairman; Leon Zolotkoff, vice-chairman; B. Hurwitz, secretary and treasurer. S. B. Komaiko, Harry Lipsky, Max Shulman, and Israel Reizburn, are in the active committee. The newly elected officers undertook to lead the campaign to a successful finish. A sum of money has been invested already for the translations of some of Yahoash's poetry. Some of his poetry will soon be published in different English magazines and newspapers. Those who are anxious to see Yehoash's works translated into English, have been highly elated by the announcement. They are confident that the great Jewish poet who is beloved amongst Jews, will also be acclaimed in English literary circles.</p>
