   <p>The Forward masquerade ball, which took place yesterday in the Ashland Auditorium, was a big success. Thousands of people came to the ball and there met their friends and acquaintances. And all the thousands of men and women formed a tremendous Forward family.</p>
   <p>As we go to press hundreds of couples still remain on the floor dancing to the music of S. Wagner and his orchestra.</p>
   <p>The large auditorium resounded with the happy laughter of the hundreds of men and women, who enjoyed the beautiful, colorful masks.</p>
