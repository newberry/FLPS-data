   <p>The best test as to how this war has affected immigration in this country and the general immigrant tone in so-called foreign neighborhoods are to be expressed in connection with our evening class teaching foreigners English. The year immediately prior to the war, we had a daily average attendance in our English classes of 500, with an active registration of 600 and a waiting list of an equal number. To come into the office and see 100 people waiting to register and hoping for an opportunity to be called when a vacancy presented itself, was not an extraordinary scene. Year by year since then, our usefulness along these lines has been curtailed, until this year, when we find that there are very few in our neighborhood who feel the need for mere elements of speaking English.</p>
   <p>Most of the people who come to us are able to make themselves understood. The few who apply for admission to classes are those who are zealous of acquiring more than merely a speaking knowledge of the language, but seem to feel the need for the writing of English much more so than has ever been the fact before.</p>
