   <p>We take this opportunity of making it known to our Jewish friends that we have organized a Dramatic club in Chicago. Any young man or young girl who possesses more or less talent in Drama, who wish to join our club, may do so at once. There will be no fee charges this month. Our club rooms are in the Palace Opera Building, Room 23. Open evening 7:30</p>
