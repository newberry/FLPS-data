   <p>In the name of all directors, of the Jewish Orphan's Home we extend many thanks to the Jewish public of Chicago for the interest they showed in attending the charity ball of the Marks Nathan Orphan's Home. We are convinced that a good many of you were not fortunate enough to take part in the pleasant entertainment program. It is all due to the unexpectedly large crowd which came to the ball. We did not expect the throng of people to be so tremendous. We realize that many were turned away. The Entertainment Committee was powerless, it could not possibly satisfy all the visitors, so we beg your pardon. This being the first ball of its kind, the committee was not fully prepared to cope with the occasion. But we hope that at the next ball, the committee may be better prepared to care for all visitors, that no one will be turned away. Nevertheless, we ought to be satisfied and proud of the success we had with this ball - it being the first venture of this kind.</p>
   <p>A full report of the expense and net profit of the ball will be published in the Jewish News department of the Daily Jewish Courier at an early date. Hoping that every Jewish person will be perfectly satisfied,</p>
   <p>I remain yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>Jacob Levy, Pres.</p>
