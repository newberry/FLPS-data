   <p>A meeting was held last night on the South Side to discuss the building of an Orthodox Jewish educational and social center on the South Side. The center is to have a Talmud Torah with enough space to accommodate two thousand children (in two shifts); it is to have ten or fifteen classrooms, recreation and vocational-training rooms.</p>
   <p>[At the meeting], it was decided to begin work immediately. A fund of two hundred thousand dollars will be raised for the building. The Talmud Torah will take over all the existing Talmud Torahs on the South Side; from now on, they will be managed as one institution.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the seven Orthodox synagogues on the South Side were present at the meeting. Various committees were elected, among them a committee to select a suitable place for the building. The following were <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>elected temporary officials: chairman, Mr. Nathan Jacobs; vice-chairman, Attorney D. Berkman; secretary, Miss Leah Levinson; treasurer, Mr. I. Lansky.</p>
