   <p>I read in the paper that they are going to publish a Hebrew magazine in Chicago, to be called Barkai (Morning Star), and that Mr. Spector, a well-known Hebrew teacher in Chicago, will be the editor-in-chief and the staff of the new magazine. And yet people say that there are no more optimistic and courageous men in this world!</p>
   <p>I, myself, am not a pessimist by nature, but I would be afraid to begin publishing a Hebrew magazine in Chicago, though I am somewhat known to the readers of Hebrew and I am not entirely unknown in this city. I estimate that there are about two thousand people in Chicago who understand Hebrew, and of these two thousand only about two hundred understand modern Hebrew, and out of these two hundred, there are perhaps seventy-five who would be willing to spend a few dollars a year for a Hebrew magazine. But even assuming that a thousand subscribers in Chicago and five hundred in the country can be found for the Hebrew magazine, I still fail to see how a Hebrew magazine can exist in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This does not mean, of course, that I want to discourage my Hebrew friends in Chicago. On the contrary, I want to assure them of my co-operation and sympathy. They all know my address in case they ever need "copy" and they know that I will not let them go away empty-handed, but I do wonder at their courage and ambition.</p>
