   <p>Sonin as a type is some thousand years old. We Jews, especially, are familar with Sonin's philosophy, which is also clearly and classically propounded in the Bible, viz., Eat and drink because it quickens our senses; eat and drink, for tomorrow we die anyway. Ludwig IV issued the parable, "After me the flood, brother; but in the meantime we must live."</p>
   <p>What Artsibashev did to make Sonin interesting was to place him in a new sphere. Sonin, the tired Russian Revolutionist, desires suddenly to live wild and fast, letting others dream of the constitution. The philosophy of living one's life he teaches to his mother and sister, the latter ruined by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a charlatan officer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anshel Shor, a clever theatrical personage from Philadelphia, dramatized this novel. Not bad, though the novel proper is only a narrative with a moral. In the drama, too, there are no developments of conflict, only episodes to characterize the personality of Sonin. Therefore, none of the actors have any great roles except the one who plays the lead, Mr. Samuel Goldenberg, a very versatile actor.</p>
   <p>As an actor, Mr. Goldenberg occupies first rank at present in the Jewish stage. Personally I do not know whether he is an engineer or an inventor, but he certainly is a great technician. He displays his talent not by great gestures or strong motions, but by small details that create a mosaic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>picture which influences less through its colorful tones than through its fine delicate construction. Besides Mr. Goldenberg has three outstanding merits, namely, temperament, a lovely means of expression, and a fine figure. If he does not attract as a lyric tragedian or a grand supple comedian, he enchants as a clever actor rich in extemporaneous humor. He sings beautifully and plays well on the clavier.</p>
   <p>I could adduce many reasons why it is worth your while to see Samuel Goldenberg in "Sonin." But since it is very hot and I am lazy to start so many themes, I beg that you believe me on my word. Children and girls under sixteen years not permitted, and model people should stay at home.</p>
   <p>Of the other members in the troupe who give very good performances, I wish <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to mention Mr. Nathanson, Mr. Ayerlbach, the gifted Becky Weintraub and Madame Weintraub. Mr. Shveid's role not only brings forth his talent, but also his temperament. May he long live and smoke short pipes, because long ones are smoked only by suffering personages. The good Izzie Kesier cuts a splendid officer's figure, and if Becky Frank played Madame German's role, it would have been better for all concerned.</p>
   <p>There is beautiful singing in the drama, especially by Ayerlbach and Goldenberg. Good fun is delivered by Mr. Shmukler in his role as Denshtzik. Thank you, Mr. Goldenberg. Would that the same could be said of all Jewish actors.</p>
