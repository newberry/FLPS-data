   <p>Today and tomorrow - two benefit performances at The Empire Theatre for the Denver Sanitarium for consumptives.</p>
   <p>The Denver Sanitarium has from its beginning been a great help to those unfortunates who suffer from that industrial disease consumption. It is an institution that well deserves the financial aid and assistance of the Jewish masses.</p>
   <p>The famous artist Mme. Sarah Adler will play for the first performance "Without A Home, and for the second, "True Power".</p>
