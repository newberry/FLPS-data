   <p>To the editor of the Courier: In your issue of December 30, there was a news item about a supper given to celebrate the paying off of the mortgages on the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah. [At this affair], some rabbis spoke of the great work that the Talmud Torah was doing for the Jewish children who came there to study, and that about five hundred pupils were studying at the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah under capable teachers and under the supervision of a good management. Many children who graduate from the Talmud Torah, enter the seminary, Etz Chaim, and prove themselves to be good scholars.</p>
   <p>As a frequent visitor of the above-mentioned Talmud Torah, and as an average Jew to whom the Torah and Judaism are dear, I feel that it is my duty to come before the public with a few significant remarks about this institution. Let me state right now that I do not aim to discredit the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah and similar institutions, but to point out their faults so that the work <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the institutions can be improved.</p>
   <p>1) Not a word of Hebrew, or Hebrew literature or history is taught at this institution. The only studies offered there are Jewish (which is chanted in a wild way), the Pentateuch, and the Book of Prophets. All this is taught in an old-fashioned way. The result of this is that the children of this institution have no understanding of Hebrew, do not know even a bit of our history, and have not the slightest knowledge of our literature, either old or new.</p>
   <p>2) Everything that is taught--the Pentateuch in the classes for small children--some comments of Rashi and the Book of Prophets in the classes for older children--is translated by the teacher into Jewish, a language which the children do not know because American children speak only English among themselves, as well as with their fathers and mothers. The teacher explains the Hebrew words in Jewish and the child repeats those Jewish words after him, <span class="page-break">\3</span>quite often without understanding what they mean. The writer of these lines once visited a class which was studying the Pentateuch at the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah. The teacher said in Hebrew, "and they went away from him in peace", and then he said it in Jewish. But the Jewish word for peace is Friden, which sounded to the pupil, a little boy, like the word "freedom", so the pupil repeated after the teacher, "and they went away from him in freedom". The teacher, who either did not hear, or did not know what the word "freedom" meant, did not call the child's attention to his mistake. After the lesson, I asked the child what the Hebrew word Sholem meant. At first he did not know what to answer, but when I told him the entire sentence, he exclaimed: "and they went away from him in freedom". I asked him what freedom meant, and he replied, "Don't you know? Washington fought England and won our freedom." This is only one illustration out of many which could be used against the practice of translating Hebrew words into Jewish to an American child. The child's memory does not retain anything of what he studied because he does not understand the translations of his teacher. His childish mind cannot even formulate a complete <span class="page-break">\4</span>picture of the Bible story which he has just studied.</p>
   <p>People will tell me that to translate Hebrew into English is still worse because it will cause the child to become more like a gentile than he already is. There is a great deal of truth in this contention. The teaching of Hebrew, by translating it into English, is the curse of our Hebrew schools. It will do to the teaching of Hebrew what Shechter Rabbinism [Translator's note: Reformed Rabbinism] has done to our synagogues.</p>
   <p>3) No attention at all is paid, at the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah, to education, in the broad sense of that term. This institution does not acquaint the child with Zionist tendencies, does not even attempt to inspire the young hearts with stories of the herioc deeds of our spiritual giants of history, with the enduring hunger of our nation for its land, for the resurrection of its language and its culture. I am a Zionist of Mizrachi tendencies, and I cannot understand at all how it is possible to implant Judaism in the hearts of young Jewish children merely by teaching them some Hebrew and some parts of the Pentateuch.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>4) I do not doubt the fact that a dozen or two of the "graduates" of the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah have entered the seminary Etz Chaim. What of it? What is the result? Are they taught Hebrew, history, literature, in the seminary? Are they taught the Prophets in a way that a child could understand and admire? Everyone who has visited the seminary knows very well that nothing is taught there except a bit of the Talmud and a bit of the Pentateuch. Even that which is taught, is taught in Jewish, which the American Jewish boy speaks as if he had his mouth full of water.</p>
   <p>5) The trouble with the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah, and other Talmud Torahs of the same type, is that they refuse to take the time and place into consideration. They refuse to see that even in Lithuania and Poland, [modern] times have wiped out and obliterated the old-fashioned school. This era, with its nationalistic demands and problems, has put its stamp upon the Jewish community, and upon the ruins of the old-fashioned school, modern schools, modern seminaries and high schools have arisen. If this is true of Lithuania and Poland, it stands to reason that it would be even more impossible and useless to keep up the <span class="page-break">\6</span>old-fashioned school in America where three million Jews are sunk into the morass of materialism, where there is no specific Jewish community and no specifically Jewish life, where the atmosphere is full of the poisonous gases of assimilation and indifference to Judaism, where the child is saturated in the American language and the American culture--in such a country how is it possible to maintain Judaism only with the aid of a little Hebrew and Pentateuch, a few comments of Rashi, all of them translated into Jewish which the child does not understand and does not respect?</p>
   <p>6) The modern era demands that the Prophets, Hebrew, Hebrew literature, Jewish history and legend should be taught in the Hebrew schools or Talmud Torahs. These studies will make the child a Jew; they will acquaint him with the past of his people and their ambitions for the future. They will instill respect for the Jewish people and for Judaism within him, and they will tear him away from the abyss of assimilation and self-contempt. These studies are the [fortresses which stand as a] barrier between the Jewish boy and the American convert (without the cross), and also between the Jewish boy and the socialists <span class="page-break">\7</span>(may the Lord save us from them).</p>
   <p>7) To enable the Jewish-American child to acquire all this knowledge, we must, once and for all, discard translation. No more translations! Away with translations! We must teach him to talk Hebrew in the Hebrew school and then we will not have to do any translating. In short, we should install the system of teaching Ivrith Be-Ivrith [Hebrew subject matter is explained in Hebrew].</p>
