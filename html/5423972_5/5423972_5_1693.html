   <p>The importance of milk stations in the Jewish neighborhoods can only be appreciated when visiting the milk station in the Chicago Hebrew Institute. Mr. Philip Seaman, superintendent of the institute, gave this a test, and the result is that approximately 1,500 glasses of milk are sold daily.</p>
   <p>The customers are small children who would otherwise spend their pennies on poisonous and disease-spreading ice cream and candies which are sold by the street peddlers.</p>
   
   <p>They are from the above mentioned neighborhood, and come there to spend their pennies on healthful cold, refreshing milk. At the same time they spend their day there, on the fresh grass, under the trees.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the milk station at the Hebrew Institute can only accommodate the children of the immediate neighborhood. It is impossible for a child to walk, let us say, ten blocks, to buy a glass of milk. And the Jewish neighborhood is so large that thousands of children can not benefit by this one milk station.</p>
   <p>It would certainly be desirable if Mr. Seaman, the originator of the penny milk stations, could materialize his plan, and establish more stations in different localities of the Jewish neighborhood.</p>
   
   <p>Everything that leads to the protection of the health and morals of our children is rather important to support.</p>
   <p>We look upon our children as future citizens, and hope for a brighter future.</p>
