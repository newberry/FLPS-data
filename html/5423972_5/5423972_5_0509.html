   <p>We have visited the Bezalel Art Exhibit in the Douglas Park Institute and scrutinized every piece of art displayed there, starting with the 500-dollar carpet down to the most trivial 25-cent toy, yet we were not enthused by the countless numbers of artistic articles which our eyes saw and our hands felt.</p>
   <p>Let those who believe that the Jewish race is extinct marvel upon seeing a carpet bearing an original Jewish design woven by the fingers of a Jewish weaver; let those who believe that Israel is dead marvel upon seeing a Jewish artistic design on gold, silver or copper; let the illiterates stare upon discovering artistic interwoven objects according to a model that is specifically Jewish, and let those who believe that Israel will cease to exist marvel upon seeing small and large articles, which can only be produced by youthful hands and sound minds.</p>

   <p>We who believe and know that the Jewish people live like other peoples, having their own originality, their own concepts, their own aesthetics, knew beforehand what we could see at a Jewish art exhibit. We understood, for example, that a design made by a Jewish artist for a carpet would not show Jupiter bringing thunder upon the world or Prometheus stealing sacred fire. We had a feeling, and so it was, that a Jewish carpet designed by a Jewish artist represents a Garden of Eden where the most beautiful trees yield on their branches the fruit with which the Jewish land is blessed and in whose shadows colorful peacocks promenade, proudly displaying the splendor of their rich feathers, with which God blessed them. Upon scrutinizing this pattern, one unconsciously feels the appeasing solemn spirit that flows from the roses of Palestine and from the lilies of Sharon.</p>
   <p>Here we hold in our hands a piece of art carved in silver, another design by a Jewish master of art. It is understood that on no model swords and guns can be found. On this there are no armed huntsmen who lie in wait for animals which are trapped with the aid of trumpets and drums by huntsmen to whom bloodshed is a pleasure. The Jewish artist portrays a rising sun whose <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>rays shine upon an aged but vigorous man who tills the soil that absorbs the seeds of nutrition for the world. It is wonderful how this old man stands before the sun, his aged eyes being strong enough to endure the powerful rays of a Palestine sun; that Jew does not fear sunshine.</p>
   <p>Then our eyes were arrested by a picture, not painted but woven. It differs little, however, for the thought is just as well conveyed through the different-colored threads as it would have been through paints. And what do you suppose does such a Jewish artist express? It is so originally Jewish that it is worth a great deal of meditation, because graves are not originally Jewish concepts, although they are plentiful in Palestine; the Jewish artist did not depict ruins, although the Jewish Land is full of them. Graves and ruins can find no niche in the mind of a Jewish artist who is full of hopes. An original model by a Jewish artist is a beautiful, prosperous city where life and enjoyment prevail; where the youth dance and the old folk play; where light and life, repose and contentment are in every corner.</p>

   <p>And just study a bedecked Jewish crown. One of them is at the art exhibit. How it differs from a non-Jewish one. First of all, it isn't large enough to fit a human head. The Jewish artist cannot even picture a crown being an object that a human head is entitled to wear. In accordance with the Jewish concept, a crown can only be placed upon a Sephar Torah [Scrolls of the Law] and the design of a Jewish crown does not symbolize the sword of justice, nor the cudgel of force. The Jewish crown is adorned with Stars of David, the six-pointed stars that irradiate and protect those who seek light and protection.</p>
   <p>And so are all the countless articles typically Jewish, and there is no reason why a Jew should become astonished upon visiting the exhibit. One can however be justified in marveling at the side remarks by the various attendants of all sorts of classes.</p>

   <p>A discussion, which took place among fiery Zionists, in which one attempted to out-argue another, was brought to our attention. One reasoned that the Bezalel School is the cradle of the Jewish people, who will in due time grow into a giant and become equal with all other nations of the world. Another one speaks his mind, proving that the Bezalel Exhibit is the resurrection of the Jewish people and it is veritable evidence that Jews will again come to power like the Bulgarians, Greeks, and others. Poor Zionists, how little they understand the Jewish race. They are unaware of the fact that Jews have never become extinct and therefore need not look forward to a resurrection; they know not that the children of Judah need no cradle nor are they in want of growth. They are gigantic enough as they are, and healthy enough physically and spiritually.</p>
   <p>This was the only surprise we encountered at the exhibit. But, we must say that we have noticed that something is missing at the exhibit and through its absence it renders the entire exhibit like a soul without a body.</p>

   <p>The great flaw that projected from the exhibit was that we have not in Chicago, nor probably in the whole of America,a Jew with Jewish inspiration, with a true Jewish conception. Nearly all of the attendants at the exhibit viewed the objects with non-Jewish eyes. Every article was compared with a similar article made in an American factory or by an American artist.</p>
   <p>Before us stood two women, wealthy Jewish women of Chicago, who apparently were critics of art. They have ample time to pay visits to Chicago's art camps, where artistic work of many peoples from all parts of the world, is sold. They were diligently examining one of the most valuable carpets produced by the Bezalel School. They spoke of the softness of the materials; of the harmonious mixture of colors; of the refined lustre that is reflected by the artistic weaving; of the tenderness of the erect edges; every particular is discussed as if by great critics, but about the essence, about the typically Jewish original model, not a word. The pattern which is the essence of the carpet, which casts forth its individual greatness, receives no one's attention. When someone decides to purchase a carpet, he or she <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>will then see if the design on the carpet, made by a Jewish artist, matches the wall paper, furniture, or other decorations which were designed and planned by a non-Jewish decorator.</p>
   <p>The exhibit was short of visitors with Jewish concepts, with Jewish aesthetics, with people whose homes are strictly Jewish, where Jewish designs on carpets should not interfere with harmony; where an ornament bearing a Jewish design should not look like an orphan.</p>
   <p>And this will always be missing at a Jewish exhibit, as long as there can be no Jewish environment, as can only exist in a Jewish Homeland.</p>
