   <p>Two undertakings that have in view the strengthening of Jewish spiritual environment in Chicago through rearing the youth, were recently organized.</p>
   <p>One is a new Talmud Torah on the Northwest Side, and the other is a training school for Hebrew teachers. There is nothing surprising about a new Talmud Torah in a city like Chicago, but the opening of the new North Side Talmud Torah deserves more attention, due to the new system of founding a Talmud Torah.</p>
   <p>How is a Talmud Torah established here in America? A Jew having a boy or two, complains to his neighbor or relative that his children are growing up to be regular gentiles; his neighbor agrees and suggests:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Well, let us establish a Talmud Torah." Then they get together with a few more neighbors and form a committee among themselves to go out and raise funds. They hire a collector to gather nickels from the public. In the meantime they rent or buy a house, and engage a teacher and the Talmud Torah is established.</p>
   <p>All other Talmud Torahs were founded according to this system. When such Talmud Torahs are opened, it is not so important, because they are not established and supported by the public, but only by a few Jews.</p>
   <p>The new Talmud Torah on the North Side is a great accomplishment. Here all the North Side Synagogues organized in one body, bought a house, engaged a superintendent, and started a Talmud Torah that is supported by the combined synagogues. The demand for Jewish education was so great <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that this Talmud Torah grew to an institution built on a sound foundation and not on the basis of gathering nickels from the public. This is something new in Chicago, such a phenomenon should be heartily greeted by every Jew.</p>
   <p>One more move is expected from this North Side body of congregations, to make this institution successful, and that is that the method of teaching shall be made as thorough and systematic as the material set-up. In an institution that is kept up from the nickels collected weekly, every giver has something to say as to what shall be taught the children. One mother demands that her child shall be taught to say Kadish, (a prayer in her memory after her death); a father demands that his son be taught to read the prayer book, and is not interested in whether or not his boy learns anything else; another father finds fault with what the teacher tells the children. From a school of that sort, results are very poor.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>If this body of synagogues wants to have a successful institution, they must leave the method ofteaching entirely in the hands of an expert, a reliable man, and not disturb him in his work.</p>
   <p>We have learned that for this purpose Mr. Maximan has been selected - a very good pick, because he is devoted, heart and soul, to Jewish education, and thoroughly understands his profession. His method of teaching Hebrew is such that the children thoroughly understand before Mr. Maximan further continues with the lessons. This method takes somewhat longer than the old system, before any results are shown, and when they do begin to show, they are fundamental. Learning through this method is not as easily forgotten as that from the old methods, that have produced very few learned students in the last quarter century.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The second undertaking we mentioned, the founding of a normal school for the education of Hebrew teachers, is not less important than the first, as it has not yet reached the degree of development as has the North Side Talmud Torah.</p>
   <p>Without proper teachers, no sacrifice nor efforts will help in establishing a proper educational system for Jewish children.</p>
   <p>In the old country where a boy would spend years of ten and twelve hours a day with his Jewish studies, it was immaterial what method the teachers used. There, very often, a bright student appeared in spite of the poor system. The one who taught, there, was a scholarly man. His ability to teach children was less important than his own achievements.</p>
   <p>Here in America, we must adopt modern methods to suit the conditions. We must engage teachers from the Jewish colleges. It is very important for these teachers to be able to instill what they have learned into the minds of the children....</p>
