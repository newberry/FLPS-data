   <p>When the news appeared that Rabbi Ephraim Epstein, Rabbi of the largest synagogue in Chicago, had testified at the Holy Altar that the editor of the Courier was given bribe, a great many asked the question, is it possible?

   <p>The answer to all questions concerning the money scandal in which the editor of the "Courier" is involved will clear the situation this Friday in the Forward.</p>
