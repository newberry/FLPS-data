   <p>The Workers' Culture League created a great deal of interest among all local circles by its great accomplishments last season. It is making many new preparations for the coming season, which will begin shortly.</p>
   <p>The league is now planning a program of great cultural significance. The league is broadening its activities. It will plan a wonderful program for the masses this season, among whom it found many sympathizers. Primarily, the league is determined that its undertakings should not be available only to West Side residents. Therefore, it will sponsor undertakings on the Northwest Side. The affairs will be given on the Northwest Side Friday evenings and in the Douglas Park District Sunday evenings.</p>
   <p>The league engaged the well-known artist and musician, Paul Lampkoff, the musical director of the Palace Theater. Mr. Lampkoff is a graduate of the Petrograd Conservatory. He became famous in Europe for his great musical ability. At the league he will have full charge of the choir and orchestra.</p>

   <p>L. Schaffner, chairman of the league, travelled to New York to complete the transactions with the above-mentioned artist. Schaffner will also arrange with the well-known painter, S. Astrowsky, to become the manager of the art and painting division of the league.</p>
