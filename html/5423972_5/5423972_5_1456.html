   <p>Now, when the foundation of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah is being laid, it is time for the leaders of that institution to formulate in their own minds a clear conception of what they want to accomplish. Of course, they are all united on the program of the Torah, and of course, they all want to educate a generation of scholars and fine Jews--but is that all that they desire, or do they want something else? Another and very important item is the question of how are they going to accomplish this.</p>
   <p>According to its program, the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah should have three (sic) departments; an elementary Talmudic school where the students shall receive training in all branches of Talmudic and rabbinical studies and a teachers' seminary where the teachers of Hebrew in the elementary and higher schools shall be taught.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>There is not much to say about the elementary Talmudic school. The heads of that school should find out whether the children have the necessary preliminary education before they can be accepted in an institution where the Talmud is taught. The children who begin to study the Talmud, must have a clear understanding of most of the Torah, and they should have some knowledge, even a superficial one, of grammar, Jewish history, Jewish institutions and Jewish customs. While they study the Talmud, they should also continue their study of other Jewish subjects.</p>
   <p>The program and the work of the elementary Talmudic school is not difficult or complicated. The case of the Talmudic high school is entirely different. There the program should have a more Orthodox and professional character.</p>
   <p>Any boy who has the necessary preliminary education, can be accepted as a student in the elementary Talmudic school, but not in the rabbinical seminary, because that department must educate not only scholars and rabbis, but also Jews of a certain type, who sometimes have to represent <span class="page-break">3</span>the community. Intellectual qualifications alone are not sufficient for one who wishes to enroll in the rabbinical seminary. A boy may have a brilliant mind, a good memory, a fair knowledge of some parts of the Talmud, and still not be qualified for admission to the Talmudic seminary because he may lack moral, and perhaps, physical qualifications. An individual who stammers or is hard of hearing cannot discharge his duties as a rabbi efficiently, because people expect a rabbi to be a good speaker just as they expect him to be a God-fearing, decent and honest man.</p>
   <p>If a young man doesn't have moral or physical qualities that a rabbi should have, he should not, under any circumstances, be admitted to the rabbinical seminary because presently he will become a burden and a useless expense to the institution, and later he will be a burden to himself. The representatives of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah should not let the entrance qualifications remain as easy as they have been up to now, and should be very careful in their choice of the men whom they are going to educate to become rabbis.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>It is quite possible that a young man may not have the qualifications that a rabbi should have, but has the qualifications that a teacher should have. It is also possible that he may not have any of the qualifications that a man in public life should have--either as a rabbi or as a teacher--then, under no circumstances, should he be admitted as a student in either the rabbinical or the teachers' seminary. It is also quite possible that many young men will appear who do not want any professional training at all, but desire only to acquire an education in Jewish ethics. Special courses with special programs should be conducted for these individuals.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah should know now whom to accept, and whom not to accept in the various schools of the institutions. They should also know what their program is going to be. They should know what kind of rabbis and what kind of teachers they are going to educate. They should clearly understand that while the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah aims to give its pupils a thorough education in the Talmud and law, it should also give them a general Jewish education. A modern Orthodox rabbi must <span class="page-break">5</span>be both an educated man and an educated Jew. It is not necessary for him to be a specialist in a certain branch of the sciences, but he must understand many things, such as literature, general history, philosophy, religious history and so on.</p>
   <p>He must, however, be a specialist, in the broadest meaning of the word, in Jewish education. He must know Jewish history thoroughly, he must know Hebrew literature thoroughly, he must have a good knowledge of the religious philosophy of the Jews, he must know something of research as it relates to the ancient world, and it is obvious that he must know a great deal of the Talmud.</p>
   <p>If the leaders of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah undertake to train such rabbis--and we believe that under the circumstances they should not, and must not think of educating a different type of rabbi--then they must begin now to make the necessary preparations to realize their program. The first thing they must do, is to elect a pedagogical council which should consist <span class="page-break">6</span>not only of well-known men, but also of educated Jews, who will understand what it is all about. It is true that we, in Chicago, do not have many educated Jews, but if we search hard enough, we will find a group of Jews who are fitted to become members of such a pedagogical council.</p>
   <p>The fitness of a Jew for a place on this council should not be judged by his social position in the world. A man must be educated and [Translator's note: Word or words are missing here] to be able to fulfill such a position, and we believe that ten or fifteen individuals can be found among Chicago Jews, who are capable of mapping out a correct and suitable program for the rabbinical seminary and for the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah.</p>
   <p>We repeat: If the leaders of the Beth Ha-Midrash La-Torah know what they want, they should not waste any time, but should go to work at once, to express in deeds what they have expressed in theory.</p>
