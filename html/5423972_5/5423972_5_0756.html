   <p>The intended contribution of Sinai Congregation to a fund for the establishment of a Semitic Library will be hailed with delight by all members of the University. Hitherto the students have been hampered in their investigations, owing to lack of books and without a well equipped library no scholarly research is possible. This action on the part of Sinai will insure the success of Semitic studies and make the University as it is intended, the center of such studies in this country.</p>
