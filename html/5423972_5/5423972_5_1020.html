   <p>The first Jewish paper published in Chicago in the English language was the "Occident". It was started in the beginning of the seventies by Hoffman and Silversmith. Mr. Hoffman soon retired and Mr. Silversmith became the sole owner. For a number of years he was the publisher and editor. Dr. E. Schreiber and Herman Eliassof have also been editors of the "Occident". This paper has been discontinued.</p>
   <p>About the same time the "Occident" was started, there appeared another Jewish paper in jargon, under the title of "Israelitsche Presse". It was published on South Clark street by a Mr. N.D. Ettelsohn. At intervals an article or two written in Biblical Hebrew would appear on the pages of this little weekly. This paper was also discontinued in a short time.</p>
