   <p>The graduation concert of the Workmen's Circle schools at the W.C. Lyceum, last night was a great success. Over twelve hundred parents and friends of the students filled the Auditorium and a few hundred people were refused admittance due to the overwhelming crowd and not sufficient room.</p>
   <p>The W. C. choir under the direction of their teacher, Asher Manushevitz were highly applauded. Their teacher was presented with a large beautiful bouquet of flowers and the children themselves, appeared on the stage like a garden of flowers.</p>
   <p>The famous writer, L. Peritz Hirschbein, greeted the children with a warm speech.</p>
