   <p>Dr. S. M. Melamed is busy putting the finishing touches to Spinoza and Buddha, the first of three volumes dealing with comparative philosophy, written by the doctor, and which is being published by the University of Chicago Press. It is a rare distinction for a scholar to have a university such as Chicago to publish a work of philosophy......And we trust that Chicagoans will take advantage of the opportunity to give recognition to one who has given of his best to this community.</p>
