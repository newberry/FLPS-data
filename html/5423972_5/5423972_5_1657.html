   <p>At the last meeting of the board of education of the Moses Montefiore Talmud Torah this question came up for discussion. "Shall we teach Jewish or English in this Talmud Torah?" This question aroused heated debates, and it was interesting to listen to the various arguments brought up for discussion at this meeting.</p>
   <p>The delegates discussed how to teach the children the Hebrew language in the easiest and best manner under such difficult conditions as obtain in the institutions at present.</p>
   <p>This is an old question, but a hard one to answer, and we are very much afraid that as long as we are subjected to foreign influences, we will never be able to find an adequate answer.</p>
   
   <p>The old teachers answered simply thus: When we were in our homeland, Palestine, the high priest, the prophet, and all the Jewish people spoke the Hebrew language, our mother tongue. Therefore it was as easy to teach Hebrew in the schools, as it is to teach English here in the public schools. But now that we are in exile and have ceased using Hebrew as our national language, we must translate the Hebrew into English as the only way to teach the Hebrew language.</p>
   <p>Dr. Gideman, the Vienna Rabbi, in his book, Knowledge of Life, says that in the middle ages there were children's schools, Talmud Torahs, where they translated the Hebrew language into the national language of the different countries....</p>
   
   <p>When our parents in the Ghetto spoke Jewish among themselves, they knew that the children understood Jewish much better than the national language; they thus translated Hebrew into Jewish, not because Jewish is sacred, but because the children understood it better, and it proved a better and easier method of teaching the children Hebrew.</p>
   <p>Now, we also face this problem: Into what language shall we translate Hebrew, for the Jewish-American children, here in America? Now it remains to be seen, which language the children understand best....</p>
   <p>The American child goes to school all day and learns English. At home he speaks English with the members of his family. On the streets with his playmates, he speaks English exclusively.</p>
   
   <p>Thus an American child understands and speaks English much better than Jewish. For that reason, to teach American children Hebrew, it is best to translate the Hebrew into the language the children understand best and that is English.....</p>
