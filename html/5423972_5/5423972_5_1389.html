   <p>Jewish Chicago yesterday had a great holiday; the cornerstone of the Hebrew Theological College, to be one of the most important institutions in Chicago, was laid at Douglas Boulevard and St. Louis Avenue.</p>
   <p>A large crowd of men and women gathered for the celebration in which all the rabbis of Chicago, all the synagogue presidents and representatives of various Jewish organizations, participated. The public expressed its enthusiasm for the new, great, and important institution by raising the sum of over fifteen thousand dollars for it, including the twelve thousand dollars in cash that was raised during the dedication ceremony.</p>
   <p>The ceremony began with a grand march by the children of the various Talmud Torahs, pupils of the Etz Haim Seminary, and students of the Beth Midrash La-Rabbonim (theological seminary). The band of the marks Nathan Orphan Home marched ahead playing music. The line of march was from the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah, via Roosevelt Road, Independence Boulevard, Douglas Boulevard to St. Louis Avenue, where the Hebrew Theological College is being built.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Leizerowich, the president of the College opened the ceremony. He introduced the chairman of the building committee, Mr. B. Eisenstein, who in a few words reviewed the history of the building. The chairman of the program, Mr. Samuel Ginsburg, was then introduced. Rabbi Ezriel Epstein greeted the assembly and pointed out the importance of such an institution as the Hebrew Theological College, which will become the center of Talmudic education in the Middle West.</p>
   <p>Speeches were made by Rabbi B. Margolin, Rabbi Olshwanger, Rabbi Saul Silber, Max Shulman, Joseph Weil, Abe Kaplan, M. Goodman, and others. Committees from various synagogues greeted the institution in the name of their synagogues and turned over their checks as a contribution from the synagogues to the institution.</p>
