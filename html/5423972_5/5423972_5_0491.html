   <p>The People's Relief Committee tendered a banquet in honor of its national chairman, Judge Perkin of New York, Saturday evening in the Morrison Hotel (Rose room) where hundreds of friends of the People's Relief Committee assembled to listen to various committee reports and to hear Judge Perkin on "The Work of the People's Relief Committee."</p>
   <p>Despite the presence of prominent labor leaders and other great personalities, such as Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers; Sam Levin, manager of the Joint Board of the Amalgamated; Benjamin Schlessinger, manager of Forward; Mrs. Diskin and Cacier from the Women's Auxiliary of the bazaar; D. Gustor, manager of the Actors' Union of New York; Leon Hanock, of the United Hebrew Trades; Mr. Lurie, chairman of the People's Relief Committee of Chicago; Levitas, representative of the Jewish Socialist Alliance; L. Berenson, representative of the Workmen's Circle, and many other men and women of various organizations, the audience was satisfied with a detailed speech by Judge Perkin and a business speech by the chairman of the bazaar, Abraham Minkus, who dealt <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with the question of the bazaar for the children of Poland and other countries, from a pure business standpoint.</p>
   <p>Mr. Minkus compared the work of the bazaar with the establishment of a corporation, and the directors as shareholders who must eliminate expenses and begin profiting as soon as the doors of the bazaar open. And in order to show that he means business, he announced that he and his partner, Mr. Katz, donate $500 as their contribution to the bazaar, and have already collected $3,000 in cash and $1,000 in merchandise.</p>
   <p>This speech made a great impression on those who were able to follow the noble example of the two partners, Mr. Minkus and Mr. Katz, and contributions of considerable sums were immediately made.</p>
   <p>The following have donated to the bazaar: Mr. Witz, $200; Mr. Lurie, chairman of the People's Relief Committee of Chicago, $200; Dr. Franklin, $200; Mr. Laskinski, $200; Peter Sussman, toastmaster of the banquet,$200;</p>
