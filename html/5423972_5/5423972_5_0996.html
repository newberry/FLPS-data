   <p>Dr. K. Forenberg, a well known Jewish writer and former editor of the Future, is back in Chicago to take charge of the editorship of the Jewish Workers World. We hope that Mr. Forenberg will have better luck than he had in his last editorship; that he will understand this undertaking to better advantage, and that he will have this published in a workers weekly. We mean not only a newspaper with Jewish letters, but a real Jewish workers newspaper. Success to you, Dr. Forenberg. Resp. "Sochet Ben Harav"</p>
