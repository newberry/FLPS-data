   <p>The "Bintel" [Editor's note: term of derision applied by Courier to Forward] newspaper continues to print the advertisements of Israel's enemy, Henry Ford, in spite of the criticism of the Jewish press, in spite of the protests of rabbis and community workers, in spite of public opinion. The "Ford-Ward" [Editor's note: Term applied by Courier to Forward because latter prints Henry Ford's ads] laughs at everybody. It has sold itself to the anti-Semite from Detroit and it serves him faithfully.</p>
   <p>The "Ford-Ward" says, to justify its scandalous conduct, that Israel Zangwill told its representative that "a Jewish paper may print Ford's advertisements". It adds, in Zangwill's name, that "the Forward should donate the income from Ford's advertisements to propaganda against Ford."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This is what Mr. Zangwill actually said to two Courier representatives who visited him at the home of Mr. Julius Rosenwald, where he is staying. In an interview with him, he said: "Many people have sought to bring me and Henry Ford together for a conversation, but I refused to see him because this enemy of Israel and his servants are capable of reporting that I have said, God knows what, something in their favor. I have refused to see Henry Ford out of respect for myself, out of respect for the Jews of America and the entire world, whom he has besmirched and against whom he has spread the worst calumnies."</p>
   <p>When the representative of the Courier asked Mr. Zangwill what he thought of the Forward which advertises Ford's products, the celebrated Jew and writer replied: "Its name should not be Forward but "Ford-Ward". When a newspaper prints on one page--which is a fact to be lamented--an advertisement of a product made by an enemy of Israel, and does not, on another page, fight the insinuations of the advertiser against our sisters and brothers, then that <span class="page-break">\3</span>paper is a renegade."</p>
   <p>However, it is no use to demand justice and fairness from the "Ford-Ward". When one spits in its face, it says that it is raining. One points to a disgraceful act it has committed, and it raises the cry, "they want to break the labor movement".</p>
   <p>The bosses of the "Ford-Ward" want money, and for money they have sold their columns to the enemy of Israel, who seeks to undermine the existence of all the Jews and who printed the following, among other things, in his Dearborn Independent:</p>
   <p>"The Jewish trade unions are exclusively Jewish because the trades are exclusively Jewish. This means that the Jewish trade unions cannot be considered American trade unions. Neither are they mixed trade unions. They are Jewish. The aim of those trade unions is, as in all other Jewish activities, to help <span class="page-break">\4</span>Jewish interests. Those unions are a part of a united Israel."</p>
   <p>The "Ford-Ward" works hand in glove with an enemy of Israel at the expense of the workers and the trades whom it claims to defend, and at the expense of the Jews whose language it speaks and from whom it derives its profits.</p>
   <p>This is the proper place to ask a few questions. If Henry Ford is not as bad as people think he is, why should not the "Ford-Ward" bosses, if they are what they claim to be--Jews--persuade their new bosom friend to stop spreading calumnies against our sisters and brothers? Why do not the "Ford-Ward" bosses, who claim that they are union men, try to influence Mr. Ford to unionize his shops and factories, where the word "union" must not be mentioned? Why are the bosses of the "Ford-Ward" profiteers?</p>
