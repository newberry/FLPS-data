   <p>The Ladies Auxiliary of Temple Sholom have established the Abram Hirschberg Reference Library in commemoration of the twentieth anniversary of Rabbi Hirschberg's occupancy of the pulpit. The library consists of reference books on all subjects of Jewish interest including the Bible, Biblical Science, Jewish problems, etc. It is hoped that in time, Temple Sholom will have the most comprehensive Jewish reference library in the city.</p>
