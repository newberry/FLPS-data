   <p>We wish to announce to the Chicago Jewish Public that the Hebrew Library, which was destroyed in the Institute, will again be opened in the very near future. A collection of one-thousand Hebrew books, the best Works of Hebrew authors, was donated by the well-known scholar, Mr. S. Rosen, from his personal library.</p>
   <p>This and other smaller donations will form the nucleus of the new library.</p>
   <p>The Hebrew Library Committee would appreciate any donations of books in Hebrew or any other language, so long as the books are of Jewish interest.</p>
   <p>Those who have always desired to do something for the Hebrew-language can now satisfy this yearning by purchasing or donating from their personal libraries, books of Jewish interest.</p>
   <p>We hope the Hebraists of Chicago will respond as generously as they can to this very worthwhile project.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Committee</p>
