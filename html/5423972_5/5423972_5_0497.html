   <p>The parade, yesterday, of the B'noth Zion Day Nursery to the Infant Home at California Ave. and Hirsch St. was a great success. Beside the thousands of female members of the Nursery, many invited organizations also marched in the parade.</p>
   <p>Two bands of music led the parade from Wicker Park to the grounds of the Infant Home.</p>
   <p>Thousands of people of the Jewish-vicinity of the Northwest Side came out of their homes to see the parade, then fell in line and marched along.</p>
   <p>A beautiful scene were the trucks decorated with flowers carrying the children of the present nursery.</p>
   <p>The children were cheered all the way by the thousands of people on the sidewalk on both sides of the street.</p>
   <p>On the grounds of the new infant home various speakers addressed the crowds, and a large fund was created towards the building of the institution.</p>
   
   <p>Seven thousand dollars were pledged. The Weil Brothers of the Weil Brothers Plumbing Company, paid $1,000. for laying the first stone.</p>
   <p>Joseph Rasniak of Milwaukee Avenue paid $800.00 for laying the second stone, and the balance came in various denominations.</p>
   <p>The most applause was received by Mrs. L. Riger, the founder of the nursery, who is doing so much of the work toward the building of the infant home.</p>
   <p>Mr. Louis Reingold was the marshal of the parade.</p>
