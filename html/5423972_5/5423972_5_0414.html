   <p>Next month will complete one year of existence for the Junior Sephardic League which was so successfully organized a year ago, and whose program since that time has been very active and intense one. Under the capable direction of Miss Brichke, its leader, the group has shown itself to great advantage in a series of dramatic productions, which were presented from time to time.</p>
   <p>As a culminating effort of its first year of existence, the group is preparing a play known as "Hot Air." The cast has already been selected and the rehearsals will begin this coming week. The work is a comedy, replete with numerous situations that tend to evoke much laughter from an audience. At its meeting on September 15, the group initiated several new members in a manner that was both novel and terrifying in its aspect. A delightful informal social with an appropriate entertainment accompanied the initiation.</p>
