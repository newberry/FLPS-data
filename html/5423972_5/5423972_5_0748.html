   <p>The Hebrew Literary Institute is an organization whose object is to maintain the Hebrew language and to propagate loyalty and love for Judaism. The Institute suffered a great loss in the destruction by fire of the Chicago Hebrew Institute. A library of 2,000 volumes in several languages, all on Jewish science and a collection of Jewish books on general subjects, vanished in the flames.</p>
   <p>A young man, Mr. Rosen, has donated 1,000 books and a beginning has thus been made to rebuild the only Jewish library in Chicago.</p>
