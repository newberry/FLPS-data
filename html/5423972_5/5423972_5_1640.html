   <p>Thursday evening, August 17, more than thirty students graduated from the elementary English class of the Hebrew Institute, fully prepared now to step into the high school which will be opened at the Institute after the high holidays. Realizing how unpleasant it is to live in a country in ignorance of the language of that country, other young men and women will envy these graduates of the Hebrew Institute. Young men and women will have the opportunity to enroll in the English classes next Monday, August 27.</p>
   <p>The citizenship bureau is open every evening from 7:30 to 9 P. M., and on Sunday mornings from 10 to 12. Those who seek information about their first and second papers should apply at the bureau during the above-mentioned hours.</p>

   <p>The students of the commercial school are also making splendid progress. Ten will graduate presently and positions as stenographers and typists have already been secured for them. With keen open eyes they see a bright future for themselves.</p>
