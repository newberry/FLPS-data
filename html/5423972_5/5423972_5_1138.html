   <p>A Chicago Jewish merchant, Mr. Benjamin J. Rosenthal, of the Central Realty and Investment Company, has written a book, which has stirred great interest in Chicago business circles. The name of the book is: The Need of the Hour - American Merchant Marine.</p>
   <p>In this book, which Mr. Rosenthal published at his own expense and is distributing free of charge, the author states he is convinced of the necessity for America to possess her own merchant marine, and especially so at the present time. While the European countries are busily engaged in war among themselves, now is the proper time for us to build ships.</p>

   <p>From the history of American Commerce, Mr. Rosenthal proves with facts, that prior to the time, when ships of steel replaced wooden ones, the United States Government transported its foreign and world commerce in her own ships. But when ships of steel became the preference of merchants, due to their greater security, Uncle Sam lost out. This situation became especially acute in 1856, when England began to build big steel ships. At that time the steel industry in the United States was in its infancy, and America, therefore, was unable to undertake the building of a merchant marine of steel. Due to this situation the business of American ships suffered greatly. During the time of the Civil War and in the early sixties, American trade and ships was reduced by over 27 per cent.</p>

   <p>Pointing out these facts, Mr. Rosenthal claims, that it is but natural for history to repeat itself that while Europe is engaged in war, America stands a chance to win back the big prize, which the foreign nations wrested from her, during Civil War days. If the American nation is not going to take advantage of the present situation, she may never have the opportunity to regain her lost commercial sea power, which she possessed sixty years ago.</p>
   <p>Our total tonnage at present is around one million, which does not include, according to the author, the 475,000 tons, added through the Registry Law, for the latter might be only temporary. England's tonnage is 20 million; Germany has five million, and Norway, with a population the same as that of Chicago, is proud to have twice the tonnage, that our great nation possesses.</p>

   <p>The book points out also, that from the time of Cleveland, to that of Wilson, every president has urged the nation to build her own merchant marine. Mr. Rosenthal claims, that in time of war, our navy will not amount to much without a merchant marine.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenthal believes, that the best method to enlarge America's merchant marine has been brought to the attention of Congress, through a bill introduced by Congressman Alexander. The bill suggests a bond issue of 30 million dollars, of which amount the United States government should buy 51 per cent and the rest to be subscribed by the citizens at large.</p>
   <p>The book is very interesting from the commercial standpoint and deserves to be read by everyone.</p>
