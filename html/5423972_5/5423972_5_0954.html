   <p>Wherever you may go on your vacation this summer--to the seashore, to the mountains, or to a quiet peaceful country place--see to it that your paper, the Courier, is delivered to you every day that you spend there. You will feel lonesome and cut off from your home without your paper.</p>
   <p>The Courier is sent out on the early morning trains, and is delivered in most of the summer resorts of Michigan and Wisconsin on the same day. We will send the Courier to you daily to any place you wish for only thirty cents a month, payable in advance.</p>
