   <p>On Sunday October 9, Chicago Day, the Jews of Chicago and particularly the members of the Jewish Historical Society of Illinois and their families will celebrate the dedication of a memorial tablet in Lincoln Park, marking the location of the first Jewish cemetery in Illinois and the entire Northwest in 1847. Eighty years ago a group of men brought from the city a tract of land, which is now Lincoln Park, for $40.00 and converted it into a Beth Hakvorath. It was the first corporate act of the Jews of Chicago, acting in unison for the entire Jewish community, small as it was.</p>
   <p>Through the courtesy of David H. Jackson, president of the Lincoln Park Commissioners, arrangements are now under way to make this historical event a most memorable one in the annals of the Jews of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Governor Len Small will be the guest of honor and Senator John Dailey of Peoria, an authority on Illinois' early history, will make the principal address.</p>
