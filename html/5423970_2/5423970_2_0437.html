   <p>On December 7, in Columbia Hall, Town of Lake, the Young Lithuanian Circle presented the comedy "Strange Feathers," by Mr. J. J. Zolpis. This was the second presentation of this drama. As always the scenery was very good, something for which the Young Lithuanian Circle is well known all over Chicago. The performance of the comedy was done very well and the hall was packed, but one thing is very curious; the Circle is from Town of Lake, but the majority of the audience was from Bridgeport.</p>
