   <p>Reverend P. Bucys has resigned as editor of the Lithuanian daily Draugas (Friend). According to reports a change in the editorship of the Draugas was decided upon at the recent convention of Lithuanian-American Roman Catholic priests at Niagara Falls, New York. There were two opposing groups at the convention--followers of Reverend Bucys and followers of Reverend F. Kemesis. The latter group gained the upper hand and as a result Reverend Bucys was forced to resign as editor of Draugas. It is now rumored that Reverend Bucys will become pastor of the Lithuanian parish at Sheboygan, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>All this serves to show that Reverend Kemesis is still the big boss of the clericalist faction.</p>
