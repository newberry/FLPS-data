   <p>On Saturday, September 13, 1902, at St. George's parish hall, 33rd and Auburn Avenue, there will be a moving picture show. It will start at 7:30 P. M. Admission 25 cents. Children from 7 to 15 years of age, 15 cents.</p>
   <p>This show will be given for the first time by the Lithuanian company and it will be shown by means of an electric stereoptical machine, which will show large moving pictures. You will see various comic pictures of live people, the trains running on the railroad, the city streets, people walking on the streets, moving street cars, wagons, etc. The pictures are so natural that when you look at them you will think that you are looking at a real life scene. Therefore, we are inviting all Lithuanians (men, women and children); you will <span class="page-break">\2</span>be astounded at such a marvelous spectacle.</p>
   <p>After the picture is shown there will be a banquet. Good music will be played so that the people will have a chance to dance.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours</p>
   <p>P. Dauksza &amp; A. Kuczinskas</p>
   <p>Members of the Company.</p>
