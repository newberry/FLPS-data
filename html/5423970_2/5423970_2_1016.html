   <p>In a recent issue of Lietuva, according to the other newspaper's announcement, we said that the Lithuanian anarchistic newspaper in Chicago, A Free Mankind, had ceased publication. Now Mr. A. Andrius, one of the directors of A Free Mankind, announces "that A Free Mankind has no such idea".</p>
   <p>The same announcement gives reasons why the publication of this newspaper has temporarily ceased. According to Mr. Andrius' statement, the chief reason for the cessation of publication was the local socialists' agitation against this newspaper. Furthermore, he describes how much trouble the socialists have made recently in the Lithuanian Alliance of America, and says that they were doing as much harm as they could to the delegates, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Dr. J. Basanavicius and Mr. M. Ycas, who came here to collect money for the National Museum of Vilnius [Vilna], while at the same time they denounced national (Lithuanian) institutions and Lithuanian national newspapers. Now, "especially the Chicago Lithuanian socialists were working with the same energy against A Free Mankind; they have even obstructed the selling of this newspaper."</p>
