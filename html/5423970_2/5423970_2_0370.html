   <p>On Sunday, April 30, the Keistutis Benefit Club sponsored a concert and the presentation of two comedies. The program was held in the Meldazis Hall, 2242 West 23rd Place.</p>
   <p>The comedies "Zile Galvon, Velnias Uodegon" (His Hair is Gray but He is Full of Devilment) and "Meska" (A Bear), by Cechov, were very entertaining. The cast performed very effectively.</p>
   <p>During the course of the program Mr. J. Uktveris delivered a monologue entitled "Nedrasus" (Not Brave); he received tremendous applause. The balance of the program consisted of songs by the Keistutis Chorus, which, although only recently organized, greatly pleased the audience with its singing.</p>
