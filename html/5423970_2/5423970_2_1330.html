   <p>Free English night schools have opened at several places. In Bridgeport, such a school was opened at Mark White Square Wall, and at Fellowship House, 33rd Place near Halsted Street. Besides the English language, citizenship will be taught. At Fellowship House, classes will start at 7:30 P. M. Besides these two schools, there is a Lithuanian school named Aurora, at 3149 South Halsted Street, and Mr. Leveskis' School of Commerce, 3108 South Halsted Street. We have heard both of these schools have good reputations. There are many other schools in various parts of the city: some are free, others charge small fees.</p>
   <p>Up to the present time our youth have paid very little attention to such schools and have not attended them, but instead have spent long winter evenings in pool rooms and saloons. We might say that the opportunity to become educated, to gain knowledge, to earn more, and to live more comfortably <span class="page-break">\2</span>is here; it sits on your nose. But, as we have stated, our John and Peter are too lazy, they prefer spending their time on foolishness.</p>
   <p>Well, brother, when misery presses on you, when you find it hard to get along, be sure to make no complaints, because you yourself are to blame--when you were young, you neglected your education. As you make your bed, so shall you sleep in it.</p>
