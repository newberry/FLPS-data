   <p>The Lithuanian youths of the Englewood district have been complaining for a long time that there are no opportunities for them to learn how to speak and write the English language. There are no public evening schools in the district. The nearest such school is located on 63rd Street; that is too far and inconvenient for the people of the Englewood district to attend. Furthermore, most Lithuanians complain that the English teachers in that school are incompetent and highly unsatisfactory.</p>
   <p>On October 16, this problem was discussed at the monthly meeting of the recently organized chapter 65 of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. After long and careful deliberation a decision was reached at the meeting to establish an evening school for the study of the English language, provided that the students who attend the school will assume full financial responsibility for the upkeep of the school. Accordingly, classes are now being held in Baukis Hall, 8430 Vincennes Avenue, three times per week, on Monday, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Wednesday, and Friday evenings. The school was opened on November 8.</p>
