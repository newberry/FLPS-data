   <p>Beginning with yesterday's edition, the Katalikas will henceforth be published as a weekly newspaper. On the front page, publisher S. P. Tananevicius announces that "the Luthuanian daily" has ceased publication; that a weekly newspaper will be published in its place. The Katalikas was a weekly until more than a year and a half ago, when it became a daily.</p>
   <p>In his announcement Mr. Tananevicius also explains the reasons which forced him to cease daily publication. One of the reasons he gives is the fact that the Lithuanians are scattered far and wide throughout America. According to him, there is not one Lithuanian colony in America large enough to support a daily. The daily must seek readers in distant cities, but it is not able to give those readers the news when it happens. The second reason contributing to the failure of the Katalikas as a daily was the competition and agitation provided by the priests. Here is what Mr. S. P. Tananevicius writes on this point:</p>
   
   <p>"Another cause is the confusion with which, it seems, all Lithuanians of America are doomed to be afflicted at some time. Sound reasoning demands that each person occupy himself with the work he has selected for himself. This should be especially true of the priests whose position is too important and responsible for them to shoulder tasks other than their own, provided they desire to perform their own duties well. The sphere of the priest is the parish and the church; publishing a newspaper is not part of his work.</p>
   <p>"However, a large group of Lithuanian priests apparently understand and look upon this matter otherwise. They are concerned not with church and religious matters, but with participation in cheap politics, the underlying cause of which is jealousy. Not satisfied with weeklies, they have decided to publish a daily. As is apparent, their aim is not so much to publish a daily as to kill the dailies now in existence. To publish a daily under the conditions on which they are prepared to proceed, is utterly impossible from a practical viewpoint. A daily published under such conditions cannot pay for itself. My long experience in publishing a daily enables me to assert this to be a fact.</p>
   
   <p>"Therefore, have they decided to publish a daily merely to injure somebody else? And will they close their own shop when no other dailies are left? I do not want to, and I will not, compete against such opposition. If our priests have so much money that they are able to throw some away every year, let them do so until they tire of it. Giving them a clear road and, at the same time, extending them the honor due to the despoilers of the Lithuanian press, I withdraw and relinquish my place to them."</p>
   <p>It is stated clearly that the priests killed the Katalikas as a daily. For what? Was it because it was "godless"? Was it because it attempted to destroy religion and the Roman Catholic Church?</p>
   <p>Nothing of the sort! The Katalikas did not promote godlessness; it did not campaign against religion or the church. In fact, it censured and bawled out those who dared to criticize these things. The priests fought it and defeated it merely because it refused to dance to the music of their politics!</p>
   
   <p>While defending Catholicism, the Katalikas refused to heed every command of the priests for several reasons. First, such compliance to the wishes of the priests would mean absolute surrender--absolute humility. Second, such compliance would have resulted in a severe material blow to the Katalikas. Being an experienced businessman, its publisher foresaw that the rise of clericalism at this moment of world chaos is not a healthy sign in public life, that it is merely a temporary boil which has appeared on the ailing body of society. When the skies clear and the suffocating fog rises, that boil will have to burst, leaving only its foul smell behind.</p>
   <p>Understanding all this, the publisher of the Katalikas could not surrender his newspaper into the hands of the blustering priests. He made many compromises, but when he saw that they were attempting to shackle him completely, he decided to cease publishing his daily rather than surrender it to them. Such an action does him honor.</p>
   <p>The story of the Katalikas is the confirmation of all that the progressive press has thus far written about the clericals. It proves they are not merely the defenders of religion and the church. Religion and the church mean less to them than the rectory. They will destroy him who does not heed their commands, even though he might be a faithful ally of Catholicism. Therefore, the people refer to them correctly when they call them "clericals" and not "Catholics"! However, if the clericals harbor the illusion that they will be able to "bomb" the working man's press in the same manner, they are badly mistaken. The workers' press, being the only true and successful opponent of clericalism, will win the support of the public in an ever-increasing measure as the "black army" increases its violence.</p>
   <p>It is quite instructive to recall that the two dailies which have ceased publication in Chicago were both submissive to the clericals. The Katalikas itself, if it had had the courage to oppose the clericals, undoubtedly would have been better able to fight them off. It was not opposition but submission that harmed the Katalikas.</p>
   
   <p>The Naujienos has never been submissive to the clericals. Therefore, while other dailies weakened and went, under, the Naujienos became stronger and grew larger. There can be no doubt that it will not bow to the clericals in the future. Not in the least! The Naujienos is already strong enough not only to hold its ground against the clericals, but also to burst the black bubble they are preparing to blow in Chicago.</p>
