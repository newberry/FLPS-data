   <p>Joseph Laukis, editor of the Darbininku Balsas (Voice of the Workers), which was recently banned by the Government, was arrested last Monday by federal agents and placed under a ten-thousand-dollar bond. The Darbininku Balsas was the official organ of the Luthuanian section of the Industrial Workers of the World; it was banned by the Government together with all other I. W. W. organs. The editors of all other I. W. W. publications had been arrested and placed in jail a long time ago. But Mr. Laukis was free until last Monday, although he previously had been advised by the Government to make an effort to raise a bail of ten thousand dollars. Thus far he has been unable to raise the bond, and unless someone puts up the money for him, he will be forced to remain in jail until his trial.</p>
