   <p>After the recent arrival in Chicago of the actor Mr. A. Vitkauskas, from Lithuania, great activity began among Lithuanian play lovers. Why Not! They must take advantage of the opportunity, which, up to the present time, they have not had. Much can be learned from this artist, who is a graduate of the drama school. Therefore, the most able Lithuanian artists formed a group, for the purpose of organizing one of the best and greatest Lithuanian dramatic centers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, there are many Lithuanian actors of great talent. By having such a leader as Mr. A. Vitkauskas, the art of the drama will reach its highest peak among us.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vitkauskas immediately plunged into the work. A troup was organized at once, and began to study the play "Genevieve." We have heard that Mr. Vitkauskas is very much satisfied with the Chicago Lithuanian theatrical group's talents.</p>
