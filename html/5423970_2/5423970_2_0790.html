   <p>There are many Lithuanians in this part of the city of Chicago. We have various societies. The Singers Dramatical Society was organized in 1905. The aim of this society is mutual enlightenment.</p>
   <p>Even though this society is financially weak, it has established a library; in the library are several scientific books and the following newspapers: Saltinis (The Spring), Lietuvas Ukininkas (The Lithuania's Farmer) Zvaigzde (The Star), Katalikas (The Catholic) and Lietuva (Lithuania).</p>
   <p>The society is unable, due to lack of money, to subscribe to all the Lithuanian newspapers published in America. We need financial help from the Lithuanian public. We are asking Lithuanians to contribute money or to send their old books, help us to enlarge our library; we prefer to get scientific books. This library is not only for the society members, but for all the public as well. The Library is open on Thursday, Saturday and Tuesday, from 7 to 10 in the evening. The library is in the hall of the St. Michael Archangel church.</p>
