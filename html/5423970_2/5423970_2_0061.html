   <p>In our dancing school young boys and girls can learn to dance in a very short time. You cannot have a pleasant time without knowing how to dance; you always feel like a dead one when others are dancing and having a good time. When you know how to dance, you feel happy and you are respected by others.</p>
   <p>The classes are held Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 8:00 P.M. to 10:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>Teacher: Miss B. T. [sic]</p>
   <p>Professor: F. L. Jankauskas,</p>
   <p>1732 South Union Avenue, Chicago.</p>
