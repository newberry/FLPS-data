   <p>The ladies of the Ninth Chapter of the Lithuanian Workers' Association have made a mistake by introducing the custom of bestowing undeserved honors upon individuals.</p>
   <p>At a recent meeting a long discussion was held on the important question of buying flowers for sick members. The debate started after a few dollars had been spent for flowers for some sick members. It was finally decided to purchase flowers for all sick members.</p>
   <p>I would not object to that practice if it would assist a patient in any way, to get well. However, if flowers do not help a sick person, why waste the money? It would be much better to pay personal visits to sick members instead of purchasing flowers with money from our treasury.</p>

   <p>Comrades, we have many more important matters to think about. For example, it is our duty to aid political prisoners and their families. Many other important causes are badly in need of our donations. Let us, therefore consider these more important matters, and support them with our donations, instead of wasting our money on flowers.</p>
