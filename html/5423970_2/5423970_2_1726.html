   <p>On January 1, the Mutual Benefit Society of St. Anna presented a theatrical spectacle at the J. Stancikas Hall, Kensington. The artists of the Birute [Society] presented a one-act comedy "Salaputris", written by Kaledu Kauke. [Translator's note: It is impossible to translate "Salaputris" into exact English. It would be a knave, impostor, cozener, etc.] Before the presentation of the comedy, several young girls and boys read poems. Miss Klimaviciute sang Schubert's "Serenade." She has a pleasing voice and was warmly applauded by the audience.</p>
   <p>The actors were: B. Vaitekunas as "Salaputris;" Mrs. Moskus--"Kunigunda;" Mr. J. Briedis--"Boliakin;" Miss St. Varasauskaite--"Elvyros."</p>
   <p>The comedy, "Salaputris," is humorous and instructive.</p>
   <p>After the performance, the church choir, under the direction of Mr. Pocius, sang <span class="page-break">\2</span>five national songs. The choir sang beautifully.</p>
   <p>Then there was dancing. The Birutes orchestra played the national dances such as "I want to Sleep," "The Circling," "The Puppy," and "Stumbling Feet."</p>
