   <p>The time to study has come. The long-awaited school for Lithuanian children where they may study the Lithuanian language has finally become a reality. The children attended the first class on November 16. Classes are held in Bessemer Park Hall in South Chicago--the same hall in which the local lodges of the Lithuanian Alliance of America hold their meetings. The children are taught by Miss Salome Staniulis, the prominent teacher of the Flower of the Future Chorus (a children's musical society). Classes are held every Saturday from 2:30 to 5:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>Fathers and mothers! Send your boys and girls to this Lithuanian school! Remember that by attending classes three hours each week for fifty-two weeks, the children can learn a great deal. If the parents make certain that the children prepare their homework, the pupils will really benefit by these classes.</p>
   <p>Such parents will not blush with shame when they hear their children speaking Lithuanian. By studying the language, the children will be able to speak it without dragging in such English words as "yes," "sure," "no siree," and similar expressions. This practice [of adulterating our language] lowers us in the esteem of others, and it also reveals our lack of training. The children [who attend the school] will be able to speak a pure and beautiful Lithuanian--a language that is regarded by philologists as one of the oldest and most beautiful in the world.</p>
   <p>This children's school is sponsored by Lodge 279 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. At a meeting held on November 14, Mrs. Mary Pietalis, Mrs. Mary Poska, and Joseph Trijonis were elected as the committee in charge of the classes.</p>
   <p>Parents who send their children to these classes are urged to submit their suggestions for improving the school to this committee, so that as many children as possible will take advantage of these classes. It is desired that older children, up to the ages of fifteen and sixteen, attend this school to learn Lithuanian songs, readings, etc.</p>
