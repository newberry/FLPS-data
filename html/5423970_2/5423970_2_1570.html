   <p>On October 20th at Valigovos Hall, corner North and Holt Avenues, there was held a public meeting. The speaker was K. Rutkus. He spoke for two hours on the Russian revolution and on the capitalist system in general; how the workers are oppressed and exploited for the profit of the few. The speaker said it is not enough to belong to the national societies - the workers must belong to the Socialist organizations, too.</p>
   <p>The Socialist lectures were arranged here in order to organize the Socialist branch - the branch was organized.</p>
   <p>Six dollars was collected for the revolutionary fund. Even though previously in this Lithuanian colony the Rev. Milukas denounced the Socialists, the people are laughing at the priest's speech.</p>
   <p>Anti-Clerical.</p>
