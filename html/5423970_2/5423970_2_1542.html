   <p>The Ausra (Aurora) Society sponsored a lecture on "The Poisonous Effects of Alchohol" on Sunday afternoon, January 9, at the Lithuanian Community Center. A pamphlet on the subject, written by Doctor Matulaitis, popular temperance leader in Lithuania, was read to the audience by a prominent member of the Society.</p>
   <p>Although the lecture was of great value to our people, nevertheless, only a small crowd attended. Apparently, our people are still unaccustomed to lectures, and still do not realize their great value.</p>
