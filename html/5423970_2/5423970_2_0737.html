   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians wanted to organize a new society under the name of Simonas Daukantas, for the purpose of establishing a Lithuanian library, so that the Chicago Lithuanians could get books to read free.</p>
   <p>Such a library is very essential to the Lithuanians of Chicago. Many Lithuanians waste their time in saloons drinking, gambling and fighting. When we have a Lithuanian library, many such Lithuanians no doubt will improve themselves by reading good books.</p>
   <p>There will be a meeting, October 22, 3301 Auburn avenue, Azukas' hall, at 1 o'clock afternoon.</p>
   <p>All Lithuanians ought to go to this important meeting. We must get at least thirty members to organize a literary society in order to establish a Lithuanian library.</p>
