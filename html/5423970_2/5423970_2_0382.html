   <p>On Sunday, January 23, at Pulaski Hall, 18th Street and Ashland Avenue, there will be a theatrical performance that we urge all Lithuanians to attend. There will be a presentation of the drama "Genevieve." It will be performed by the best Lithuanian artists of Chicago, including Mr. A. Vitkauskas who recently came from Lithuania.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that this performance will be one of the best ever presented in Chicago. The proceeds derived from this performance will be given to the Lithuanian war sufferers in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Everyone should come. You will not be disappointed.</p>
