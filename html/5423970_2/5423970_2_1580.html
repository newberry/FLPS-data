   <p>The American Medical Association teaches the public through lectures and pictures how to protect and cure itself of tuberculosis. This is very important to our compatriots. The admission is free to such lectures.</p>
   <p>The "Exhibit of Devices and Appliances for Treatment of Tuberculosis" will start on April 2nd, on the fifth floor of the Public Library Building, Michigan Avenue between Washington and Randolph streets. The exhibit will be open daily from April 2nd to 28. We urge all the Lithuanians who understand English to attend these lectures.</p>
   <p>During the month of May the same exhibit will be held in Milwaukee, Wis. We are asking Lithuanians of this city not to miss these important health instructions.</p>
