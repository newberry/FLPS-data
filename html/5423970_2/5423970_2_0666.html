   <p>The above named society was formerly called the Lithuanian Workers Literature Society. It was organized by the Lithuanian Socialists in the year of 1915.</p>
   <p>The first sponsor of this society was Theodore Kucinskas, who wrote an article in the Kova (Struggle), organ of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, about the necessity of such a literary society.</p>
   <p>For two years there were many discussions for and against such a society. Those against this project were the Lithuanian private Socialist publications, like Laisve (Liberty), which at that time was published in South Boston, Mass. Others said that such a society would be against the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, as this organization is also publishing books.</p>
   
   <p>When the separate branches of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance emphasized the necessity of such a society, L. Pruseika, who was editor of Laisve, and who was against such a literary society, with Miss J. M. Benes organized the first group in Brooklyn, N. Y., as the Lithuanian Workers Literature Society.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this society is to organize the Lithuanian workers, to organize branches in Lithuanian colonies, to publish books and to spread enlightenment and mutual understanding among the workers.</p>
   <p>The growth of this society was very rapid. In a short time it had one thousand members, and later the society had several thousand members. For a more successful organization, districts were organized.</p>
   <p>Whereas the Lithuanian Workers Literature Society was under the control of the Socialists, and after the split in 1920 of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance with the followers of Communism, this literary society was also split into two separate organizations. That part which came under the Communists' control was named the Lithuanian Workers Literature Society of America. After the split, the organization became weak, but started to grow and again became a large organization.</p>
   <p>For over 20 years the Lithuanian Workers Literature Society of America accomplished great deeds in the field of culture. This society spreads enlightenment not only through its published books and its tri-monthly Journal Sviesa (Light), but many cultural activities are performed by the branches of this organization, such as lectures, essays, concerts, theatrical performances, etc. They have supported many campaigns for the benefit of the workers. They have collected ten thousand dollars for the support of strikes, for the political prisoners and many other important affairs.</p>
   <p>As for the publishing of books there exists no equal publication. Several thousands of workers, Paying even small dues per year, make up large sums of money that make it possible to publish such books which otherwise would not have been published.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Workers Literature Society of America, during its existence has published over 40 different books.</p>
   <p>The society publishes the tri-monthly scientific, cultural and political journal Sviesa (Light).</p>
   <p>Branches of this organization exist in every Lithuanian colony of America, Canada, South America, France and U. S. S. R.</p>
   <p>The membership dues are $1.50 a year; initiation fee is ten cents. When a family belongs to the society, if they do take the published literature, they pay only ten cents per year. The members who pay $1.50 receive all literature published during that year by the society. The members who want to get only the journal, Sviesa, pay one dollar per year. The young people get books in English.</p>
   
   <p>The Lithuanian Workers Literature Society of America has about 6,000 members. In Chicago there are nine branches of this organization.</p>
