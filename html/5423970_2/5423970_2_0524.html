   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance presented two comedies, "Golden Idols" and "Do Not Resist," October 16. The program did not mention who wrote or translated these two plays. That is not good; the preparers of the programs should not forget such things. "Golden Idols," a comedy in three acts, is quite interesting though it is taken not from the life of the Lithuanians but from that of the Polish nobility. There is much action and many funny situations in the comedy.</p>
   <p>The comedy "Do Not Resist" is also good. Undoubtedly, the beauty of both these plays was made apparent by good acting. The Dramatic Circle acted them out very well. The performers played their roles so well that, while watching, you felt you were seeing a really funny incident.... It should not be forgotten that many already distinguished amateur actors of the stage participated, such as B. Vaitiekunas, M. Dunduliene, and Briedis. There were also several new ones. Of the new ones, K. Mikolaitis and A. Dunduliute can be added to our list of more talented stage artists without error......</p>
