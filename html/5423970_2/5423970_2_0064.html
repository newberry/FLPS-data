   <p>I am the best maker of new musical instruments, and I do the best repair work on old instruments. I do the work faithfully, because I have thirty-six years of practical experience. I have worked in the largest instrument factories in Russia, England, and America. I sell new instruments at lowest prices. I repair talking machines. I know all the mechanics of revolvers and bicycles.</p>
   <p>If you are in another city, send your instruments to me by parcel post or express.</p>
   <p>At my place, you can get instruments of any type cheaper than from any other agent or peddler, because I manufacture them myself. My factory is in the center of Bridgeport, near Lietuva. A large sign of a violin hangs on my door, you cannot miss it.</p>

   <p>All my work is guaranteed. Bring your broken instruments, and you will be satisfied with my work. This is the only Lithuanian factory in Chicago.</p>
