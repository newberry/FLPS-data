   <p>p...... The people's programs Tuesday evenings have a variety of musical talent, the best of which so far were the "Radio Granadiers," a trio of young male voices - although they do not harmonize most of their selections the right way. But even good things grow tiresome when they are presented week after week, so here's something listeners would appreciate - a more frequent change of talent. The progress programs Sunday mornings are useful in that they provide all the information on Sunday doings. For the musical portion - so so. J. Romanas sings and announces. Once in awhile the "Kaimieciai" quartet sings in its usual Fred Waring style - all fast.</p>
   <p>The Saltimieras program originated as the Evans Fur Co. program Monday nights. The new sponsor is an undertaker - of all people! I don't thing it is very cheerful for some patient to tune on the radio for some enjoyment and hear instead, about how cheaply and elegantly he can be buried. For the rest of the program, the musical portion is very good, but there are too many commercials.</p>

   <p>If you need an orchestra, call Saltimieras; if you desire to further your child's musical education, call Saltimieras for a teacher; if you want to place advertising, call Saltimieras, etc. The same goes for the Sunday evening programs. The dedications are liked only by those for whom they are meant, and a number of dedications for every musical number don't help the program any. Reminding you once more of the new series of programs to be relayed over WIND Sundays at 4:45 P.M., and daily at 7:00 P.M. by "Margutis" Station, we sign off till the next issue.</p>
