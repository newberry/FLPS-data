   <p>During these days we hear of nothing but the trial of the Rev. Krawczunas against the publisher and editor of Lietuva. This is the fifth case for $10,000 against Olszewski by Rev. Krawczunas. The trial will be in Circuit Court before Judge Baker. It may take all week to show the "rightness" of Rev. Krawczunas.</p>
