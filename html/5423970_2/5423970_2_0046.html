   <p>A Lithuanian name, Milda, has been given to this theater.</p>
   <p>Milda, as you know, is the goddess of love and art in Lithuanian mythology. Therefore, this is an appropriate name for a theater.</p>
   <p>The Milda Theater is the most beautiful in the southern part of Chicago. Built according to the newest regulations of the Chicago Building Code, it is constructed of steel and cement (absolutely fire-proof), with the best sanitary conveniences, ventilation, and a large, fully-equipped stage.</p>
   <p>It is as beautifully decorated as the large theaters downtown and it cost no less than the downtown theaters.</p>
   <p>In this building, besides the theater, there are also two beautiful halls suitable for parties, banquets, dances, and meetings. Beneath the theater there <span class="page-break">\3</span>are large rooms with billiard tables and bowling alleys. There is a Lithuanian buffet on the main floor, in front.</p>
   <p>This theater building is seventy-five feet wide and a hundred and thirty-five feet long. It takes up almost half a block. It is the biggest, most beautiful, and most expensive building in this part of the city. It is most conveniently located, and can easily be reached from all parts of the city because the Halsted Street cars run every minute.</p>
   <p>It was built by the A. Olszevskis Bank.</p>
   <p>If you wish to pass an hour of your free time gaily, come to the Milda Theater and you will not regret having spent five cents for a ticket. Here you will see a better show for five cents than you would downtown for fifty cents.</p>
   <p>It will open Christmas Day, December 25, 1914, at 2:15 p.m.</p>
