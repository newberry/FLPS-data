   <p>Following the example of Moksleivis (The Student), a monthly journal, Draugas (The Friend) in its last issue brought up the question, or rather the proposal, to establish a Lithuanian college. Such an institution would help amend the present "bad situation among our people". A group of intelligentsia would be sent forth from this college to teach the public morality.</p>
   <p>This "bad situation among our people" is explained by the existence of "many hypocrites, and unbelievers, who despise the higher spiritual life; and by the lack of those people, who care for real truth and real enlightenment, who possess strong characters, and who are moral, and true intellectuals."</p>
   <p>If this "bad situation among our people" were interpreted in a different and more intelligent sense, then every progressive nationalist would approve, in <span class="page-break">2</span>principle, the proposal to establish the college. Such a college is essential to the American Lithuanians. The question, however, is whether the proposal to establish a Lithuanian college is a timely one? Do we have, generally speaking, enough schools which prepare our youth for college? If we want to build something, then we should seek to establish it upon a good foundation. The foundations for a Lithuanian college should lay in the primary schools. We have none. Of course, we have several parochial schools, but can such schools prepare our youth for college? That is still an unanswered question.</p>
   <p>Would it not be better if we would concern ourselves with the establishment of good primary schools and several good high schools?</p>
