   <p>The Women's Enlightenment Society had a discussion at the Aurora Hall last Sunday. Dr. Aldona Rutkauskas and Mrs. M. Olsevskis explained many noteworthy and important matters concerning women's hygiene. Only girls and women over 16 years of age, attended the meeting. So many questions arose that it was impossible to answer them that day. Therefore, it was decided to have the same sort of discussion at the same place next Sunday. It will begin at 2 P. M. The admission is free.</p>
