   <p>There are at present quite a few Prussian Lithuanians in Chicago. They have their own mutual benefit society. Several men, who are great lovers of enlightenment, arranged a lecture last Sunday for the sole benefit of the Prussian Lithuanians. Even though they have their own society, they have shown no activity. This lecture and songs were given at the Henry Booth House Hall, 14th Street and Union Avenue. Dr. A. Rutkauskas delivered a lecture on alcohol and its bad effects on the human body. The Birute Choir sang several songs. The hall was crowded to capacity. Many people, unable to get in, went back home. This lecture was arranged for the Prussian Lithuanians, but very few of them were at the lecture. Nine dollars and ninety-two cents was collected for the Brooklyn, New York garment strikers.</p>
