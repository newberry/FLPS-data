   <p>The West Side Lithuanians are the most progressive of all Chicago Lithuanians. They have heartily supported and approved all Lithuanian national affairs. For example, take the Lithuanian Public Library. The Farmers of Lithuania Society suggested that this library be established, and the following societies joined this project: Lovers of the Motherland Society, Branch 28; Dr. V. Kudirka Society, and the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, Branch 22. The library was established and maintained at the expense of these societies. Later, after some misunderstanding, the Dr. V. Kudirka Society and the Socialist Alliance, Branch 22. refused to support this library. The burden then rested on the shoulders of the Farmers of Lithuania Society. Recently other societies joined, to support this library. The Aurora Gate Society (Male), has donated $10 for the library; the St. Rokas Society, $11; the Lithuanian Youth Song Lovers Society, $10; the Guards of the Grand Duke Gedeminas of Lithuania, the Keistutis, and other societies have promised to support this library. At present, the library is in good standing, and has about $150 in its treasury. During last year, 1370 men and 238 women visited the library, and read the books and the newspapers free of charge. The literature in this library is available to everyone. Books can be taken home if a small deposit is left for them. The librarian is very glad to aid in finding books and newspapers desired by the readers. West Side Lithuanians, do not miss your opportunity to visit this library!</p>
