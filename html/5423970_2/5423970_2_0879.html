   <p>Many requests have been received for more detailed information about the prospective daily newspaper for nationalists since a short item about it appeared in a recent issue of the Lietuva.</p>
   <p>The requests prove that the people are interested in this matter and desire to have a good newspaper in which they can find more truthful news and educational items and other interesting articles.</p>
   <p>Here we give you much information about the organizational work for this new daily; we inform you of how this work started, how it is progressing, etc.</p>
   <p>The Projection of the Daily</p>
   <p>For a long time the people of Chicago and other cities have been speaking of the fact that a good daily newspaper is very necessary. Articles have even appeared in the newspapers, declaiming the fact that the members of the middle faction(nationalists), of whom there are more than of any other faction of Lithuanians in America, have not, as yet, founded their own daily--a daily which would not indulge in slandering and arguing, but would perform the task of cultural enlightenment among our people.</p>
   <p>Finally, Chicagoans began to consider this matter more seriously in private and at meetings. Everybody who was questioned on this matter was in favor of the proposed daily and promised to support it,if it is started.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago a meeting was called, to which many in favor of this project were invited. The meeting was held at Milda Hall, in Chicago, and, after a long discussion, it was decided: (1) that a new daily was necessary; (2) that the organizational work for such a daily should be started at once; and (3) that the other colonies would have to help the Chicagoans as much as possible in this work.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, about two thousand dollars' worth of shares in the daily were purchased by those present.</p>
   
   <p>How The Organizational Work Is Progressing</p>
   <p>The question was raised, whether an entirely new corporation should be organized and new presses, etc., purchased, or whether the organizing body should take over one of the existing newspapers and change it from a weekly to a daily.</p>
   <p>After a long discussion the following opinion was subscribed to by all:</p>
   <p>It would cost many thousands of dollars to purchase machinery (linotypes, presses, etc.) for a new press. Besides this, a sufficient amount of money would have to be raised to guarantee the expenses of the daily for at least one year. Only after that period would the daily begin to realize a profit on subscriptions and advertisements. The expenses of publishing a daily for a year (figuring on a circulation of five thousand) would reach about thirty thousand dollars. If the cost of new equipment were added to this, an enormous sum of cash would have to be raised for the daily.</p>
   
   <p>It is much easier when an already existent newspaper, with complete equipment, and subscribers and advertisers, is converted to a daily. This lessens the amount of ready cash needed, for it is not necessary to purchase equipment.</p>
   <p>If we took over a newspaper which was already in existence, we would need to raise only sufficient money to guarantee the daily's expenses until it could do a large enough business to take care of expenses by itself.</p>
   <p>Therefore, having thoroughly weighed the matter, the group of originators of the plan for the daily began to negotiate with the Lietuva. (Neither the publishers nor the editors of the Lietuva were invited to the earlier meetings, for the originators of the plan wanted to discuss it among themselves, without the administrators of the Lietuva present.) The publishers of the Lietuva, when the plan was presented to them, agreed to support the plan with its press and to change the Lietuva into a daily, if enough money could be raised to purchase one more large press for printing the daily and to guarantee the expenses of such a daily for at least six months.</p>
   
   <p>The value of the press and other property of the Lietuva will be estimated by experts of the shareholders' committee of the organizational group. The owners of the Lietuva will not receive cash, but will be given shares in the new daily.</p>
   <p>Expect to Raise Money Quickly</p>
   <p>It was decided at the meeting that it would be necessary to collect at least twenty thousand dollars so that the daily would not have to be tormented by unpaid bills from the very beginning.</p>
   <p>The organizers expressed the opinion that it would not be too difficult to raise such a sum, and that the campaign should be started at once so that it would be possible to begin publishing the daily at about the end of summer. It was decided that the above-mentioned sum should be collected by August 1, 1918. The daily could be started soon after that date.</p>
   <p>The shares have been set at ten dollars each.</p>
   <p>The money invested by the shareholders is placed on deposit in the Universal State Bank, in Chicago. The bank provides receipts, or certificates, which will be replaced by shares on August 1.</p>
   <p>Until that time not one cent of the money deposited for the daily will be used for another purpose or allowed to be withdrawn from the bank. If, by August 1, the twenty thousand dollars has not been raised and it is impossible to publish the daily, the bank will return the deposited money. That is stated on the receipts issued by the bank to shareholders.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that there is no "monkey business" here, but that everything is so organized that people will be assured of safety and honesty, and will not be afraid that their money will be used for purposes other than the daily.</p>
   <p>The affairs of the daily will be directed by a board of directors elected by the shareholders themselves. Other matters concerning the administration of the daily will be decided later, when a larger number of members of the corporation will have the opportunity to cast their votes.</p>
   
   <p>Certain of Success</p>
   <p>The most important question at present is whether we can raise the necessary twenty thousand dollars during these few months.</p>
   <p>Most people feel certain of success. There is no shortage of experience or support from various sources. Many of the present shareholders in the Lietuva corporation, upon reading the announcement about the daily in the last issue, bought several shares each in the daily. Their only desire, they say, is to see the Lietuva become a daily.</p>
   <p>In towns outside of Chicago committees are being organized to sell shares in the new daily.</p>
   <p>The Chicagoans have already created various committees which will supervise the campaign.</p>
   
   <p>Let's Go!</p>
   <p>Not too much time is left, so we must work zealously in order to achieve our ends. All the people of the middle faction, especially the chapters of the Lithuanian Nationalist League of America and the other nationalistic societies, ought to make a good showing in this campaign.</p>
   <p>Our middle faction, swerving neither to one side nor to the other, is progressing on the broad highway toward the freedom of the Lithuanian nation and the welfare of the people. We have in our faction more enlightened and intelligent people than the extremists have. The larger part of the Lithuanian public is on our side, but it is not organized and, therefore, is outyelled by the blusterers. The majority of our businessmen and tradesmen and the Lithuanian workers, from whose hearts the healthy, dignified spirit of Lithuanianism cannot be uprooted by any effort, are members of our middle faction.</p>
   <p>We have the people and the power--so why cannot we have our own good, dignified, honest Lithuanian daily? Can we sit idle and be tolerant when we see our people being wronged and led on wrong paths?</p>
   <p>The welfare of the Lithuanian emigrants and the Lithuanian nation demands that we have our own good daily newspaper.</p>
   <p>Therefore we invite all of you nationalists and other serious men to participate in this work. Speak to your acquaintances about it. Buy shares without delay. Write immediately and state the amount you will invest.</p>
   <p>Further reports on the progress of this work will be published in the Lietuva and other newspapers.</p>
