   <p>Starting November 11, the Aurora Society will expand its school. To the existing day and evening classes for adults, there will be a separate branch opened for children who are attending public or parochial schools. Our maturing generation does not know its own language, is ignorant of Lithuanian history and geography. To plug up these holes in the education of our youth, the Aurora Society is establishing a children's branch. The Lithuanian language, history, and geography will be taught from 5 P.M. to 6 P.M. Registrations can be made daily at the Aurora Society's office, 3149 So. Halsted Street.</p>
