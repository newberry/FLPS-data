   <p>I think that there would be no harm in my writing something about the Chicago Lithuanian Evangelical Lutherans who number approximately 500. Up to the present time, we have not seen any educational or nationalist activity among them. Beer is their only pleasure. The men drink, the women drink; and of course, the girls do not refuse either. When they bring the pail of beer, they drink it straight from the pail; they never use a glass. When someone refuses to join their drinking party, does not want to be a drunkard, they laugh at him. They call the person who does not drink with them, who does not use bad language, a "smart guy".</p>
   <p>However, all of them do not act like this. There are a few dignified men among them. They are trying to raise the others from the lethargy into which so many of the Lithuanian Lutherans have fallen. They are willing to spend their time, money and energy for the uplifting of their fallen brothers. On <span class="page-break">\2</span>May 3, through the work of these men, "The Lithuanian Progressive Mutual Aid Society" was organized. The purpose of this society is not only to give sick and death benefit, but also to arrange lectures on scientific problems, to present theatrical productions, and other educational activities.</p>
   <p>At the beginning, twenty-five persons joined this society, now they have thirty-seven members. Both men and women belong to this society.</p>
   <p>After the summer season, this society will present some kind of a theatrical production. In general, the members of this society are trying their best to work in the field of culture. Of course it will be difficult for them to accomplish their aims. The first furrow is always hard, but the second and third furrows will be easier.</p>
