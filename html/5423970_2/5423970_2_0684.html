   <p>The members of the Lovers of the Motherland Society have not had time to rejoice over such a good work as the book, Heart, for now this literary society has published another good book, Mother and Her Anxiety, written by Dr. Antanas Garmus.</p>
   <p>The members of the society shall again have a very interesting and beneficial book to read. The Lovers of the Motherland Society, during the past year, has accomplished a great job. Even the Lithuanian people have not had time to appreciate its good work, for book after book has been coming off the press. The secretary of the Lovers of the Motherland Society announces that during the last two months,--November and December--eight hundred new members joined this society, and the treasury held $1,300.</p>
   <p>This year, this society has made arrangements to publish several more good books.</p>
