   <p>The Colonial Dames of Illinois has issued a booklet entitled Pilietybes Pradziamokslis (Fundamentals of Citizenship). The text of the booklet is in both Lithuanian and English. The booklet is especially valuable to those Lithuanians who are not familiar with the laws and governmental structure of the United States. It is written in clear and simple language.</p>
   <p>The second part of the booklet contains a brief but very interesting chronological history of the United States.</p>
   <p>The booklet is adapted for Chicagoans. Altogether twelve thousand copies have been printed for Lithuanians. It is just off the press and may be obtained free on request. Copies of the booklet will soon be available in the office of the Lietuva at 3252 South Halsted Street.</p>
