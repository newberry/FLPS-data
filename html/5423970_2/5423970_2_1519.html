   <p>The Rt. Rev. A. Petraitis has remodeled his observatory in So. Chicago. Rev. Petraitis is a student of astronomy. He does not regret any money spent on his observatory. He has bought many new instruments for measurement and for the movement of the telescope.</p>
   <p>Rev. Petraitis is almost unknown among Lithuanians. It is always like that, when a man devotes his time and energy to science, he remains unknown. The Chicago Lithuanians will have an opportunity to hear Rev. Petraitis lecture on astronomy, March 26, at the Aurora Hall, 3149 So. Halsted Street.</p>
