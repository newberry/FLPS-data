   <p>On Sunday, April 9, the Young Lithuanian-American National Club sponsored a lecture in Radavicius Hall on the subject, "The White Plague, or Tuberculosis". The lecture was delivered by A. J. Karalius, a medical student. The lecture was well delivered and pleased the audience. May the Club hold many more such useful lectures!</p>
