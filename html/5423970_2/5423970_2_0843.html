   <p>The distribution of the workers' press is the greatest problem of our organizations. The annual conference of the First District asked all its branches to push this move by all possible ways and means. For a successful distribution of Laisve, (Freedom: Vilnis, (The Surge); Darbininku Balsas, (Voice of Labor), the conference, after having used all known ways of distribution, recommended to take this new method. In every colony of our Lithuanian workers (in our border lines), to create stations for newspapers, which papers should be sent in bundles; from there the papers should be delivered to the homes. For this distribution could help us children from A. Z. V. D. (Ateities Ziedo Vaiku Draugija-Budding Flower of Youth Society). For their help they could be given a certain commission. The administration will have to take care of the organization of such stations and distributors. All particulars and information will be given by the General Committee of Distributions, which has started its work of distribution in this colony.</p>

   <p>The conference is asking all correspondents and newspapermen to write not only about our A. L. D. L. D. and its activity, but in general about the life of the workingmen, especially those employed in industries. Such news will help us a lot in the popularization of our newspapers.</p>
   <p>A. L. D. L. D. stands for Amerikos Lietuviu Literaturos Draugija, or American Lithuanian Literature Society.</p>
