   <p>The Birute concert, which was given on the second day of the Christmas holiday at St. George's Parish Hall, was liked so well by the audience that they demanded another such concert. The next concert, with the same program, will be given at the Mark White Square Park Hall, on the fourteenth of this month. It will start at eight o'clock; admission free. All lovers of good songs are invited.</p>
