   <p>The Birute Society presented a program last Sunday, December 30. The operetta, "The Return," was offered. The acting was good, but not all of the songs were rendered well. Adam Micevicia (in the role of "John Dickus") played his part well. The voice of R. Klaidonis (in the role of "Raulas," son of Dickus ) suited his role, but his acting was monotonous. B. Digris (in the role of "Kristupas Juodis") played his role excellently, especially in the last act. John Kulis (in the role of "Sliugeris", a villager) was too boyish in his part. A. Kvedaras (in the role of "Bakutis") and S. Kvietka (in the role of a priest) also gave excellent performances.</p>
