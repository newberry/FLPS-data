   <p>The play has many excellent scenes, especially toward the end. Two of the common faults of most of our actors, insufficient knowledge of the role and frequent pauses in the reading of lines, were evident in this presentation. The latter fault, practically destroying the sincerity of the acting, is altogether the fault of the prompter. This was especially noticeable in the more important scenes of the play. Considered individually, some of the actors played their roles well.</p>
   <p>Though the audience was small, it was reported that the Society will not suffer a loss. There was dancing until about 2:30 A. M., after the play.</p>
   <p>[Lietuva Editor's Note: Our regular correspondent, Mr. Aesculapius, had another opinion of the presentation of "The Mudhole". Pointing out that the presentation was made by members of the Drama Society, he called it successful and especially commended Miss A. Samolis, who, he said, acted her role in natural fashion. Her performance was held up as an example to our dramatic amateurs by Mr. Aesculapius.]</p>
