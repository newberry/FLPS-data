   <p>The Erelis (Eaglet), monthly magazine of satire, which is being published in Chicago by A. Simkus at 4543 S. Ashland Avenue, will become a weekly in October.</p>
   <p>It is planned to convert the magazine into a newspaper, and besides satirical and humorous matter, it will publish all kinds of news and educational articles. The subscription price will be increased from the present fifty cents to one dollar fifty cents per year.</p>
   <p>At present the satire and literary quality of the Erelis is slightly worse than that of the Saule (The Sun), which is published in Mahanoy City, Pa., <span class="page-break">2</span>but is slightly better than that of the Lietuviu Zinios (Lithuanian News), which is published in Chicago by Mr. Baronas. It does not seem probable that the contents of the publication will be improved.</p>
   <p>The circulation of the Erelis is probably the same as that of the Dilgeles (a prickly and irritating weed), which is being published in Pittsburgh, Pa., by Mr. Baltrusaitis.</p>
   <p>Therefore, Chicago will have four Lithuanian periodicals--three weeklies and one monthly.</p>
