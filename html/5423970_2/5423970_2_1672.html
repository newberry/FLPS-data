   <p>Last Sunday, the Farmers of Lithuania Society held its meeting. This society is growing rapidly. During the last two months, thirty-four new members have joined this society.</p>
   <p>This society not only takes care of its mutual aid affairs, but also looks deeply into public affairs. It has decided to unite all the Lithuanian societies on the West Side in order to act together for the collection of donations for the war-sufferers in Lithuania. It has donated fifty books to the Lithuanian Public Library in Cicero. It has arranged performances with good programs, the profit from which will be given to the Lithuanian war-sufferers. This society is very active in public affairs. It is a great honor to belong to such a society. The meetings are held on the third Sunday of each month.</p>
