   <p>An affair commemorating the tenth anniversary of the creation of the Farmers of Lithuania Society was held at the Meldazis Hall last Sunday.</p>
   <p>John I Bagdziunas made an interesting speech, in which he related the history of the Society. Attorney B. K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva, was to have been a speaker also, but he became ill and was not able to attend.</p>
   <p>The Farmiers of Lithuania Society was organized with only seven members. Today it has four hundred members and four thousand dollars in its treasury.</p>
   <p>Intelligent officers of the Society and the well-defined aims of the organization are credited with the impressive growth of the Society. This is one of the most serious societies in Chicago and is founded on purely nationalistic principles.</p>
   <p>This is attested to by the fact that, during its comparatively short existence, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Society has donated more than fourteen hundred dollars to various nationalistic causes.</p>
