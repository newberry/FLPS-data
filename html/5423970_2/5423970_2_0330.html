   <p>The Dr. V. Kudirka Singers Society is appealing to the Lithuanian youth to join this society. We have seen that people appreciate very much our singing. The demand for our chorus is increasing. In order to make it the best in Chicago, we are appealing to the Lithuanian youngmen and girls to join our choir.</p>
