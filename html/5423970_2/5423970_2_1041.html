   <p>This newspaper is the official organ of the organization Zinycia. In its first issue it states that its purpose is to uplift Lithuanians in science education, arts, and the other requirements belonging to civilized and cultured nations. The newspaper states further that the two present Lithuanian newspapers do not present the essential issues of Lithuania, etc.</p>
   <p>In its first issue, besides news about the Zinycia, there is nothing of value. The Lithuanian language is very bad, and yet the editor says that he wants to educate Lithuanians. He himself does not know the Lithuanian language. Such a newspaper will bring nothing good to Lithuanians.</p>
