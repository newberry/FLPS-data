   <p>The conduct of the Chicago Lithuanians is improving constantly.</p>
   <p>Now it is the most convenient time for us Lithuanians to understand our duties and to work together. The Poles of Chicago are very busy building a monument for Kosciuszko. While Kosciuszko was a Lithuanian, we Lithuanians must help the Poles. It is our duty to remember our great man of the past.</p>
   <p>The monument for Kosciuszko will be built in Humboldt Park. All over America Poles are having concerts, dances and all kinds of entertainments for the cause of raising money for that monument of our great man Kosciuszko. So we Lithuanians ought to take example from the Poles one way or the other, help to raise money for this great cause.</p>
   <p>President J. Dzialtiuvas of St. George the Knight Society tells us that the society has hundred and fifty members, that at the society's meeting they voted and decided that each member must contribute twenty-five cents for the monument of Kosciuszko.</p>
