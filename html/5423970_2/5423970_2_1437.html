   <p>Dr. Susanna Slakis (Miss Aldona Rutkauskas) delivered a lecture on the subject of health on March 14 at the Mark White Square field house, 29th and Halsted Streets. The lecture, which was for women and girls only, was sponsored by the Chicago Lithuanian Women's Educational Society.</p>
   <p>Dr. Slakis spoke on various contagious diseases, and explained how to avoid them. After the lecture, members of the audience were permitted to submit questions. Nearly all asked questions, which were answered by Dr. Slakis. An unusually small crowd attended. Apparently most of our sisters do not realize the great value that can be derived from such lectures.</p>
