   <p>p.6... The distinction of being the only Lithuanian Riding Club in Chicago is not the only honor this club has attained.</p>
   <p>The first Annual Dance was not only a financial success but an achievement of such magnitude that the club gained great social prestige within Lithuanian circles through that event alone.</p>
   <p>At the last regular meeting the members enjoyed themselves thoroughly both before and after the business session.</p>
   <p>Miss Julia Meyers was the Hostess. She served very delicious refreshments, and afterwards entertained by playing special games including Bingo and Bunco.</p>
   <p>The date for the next ride was fixed and a program for winter activities decided upon. A to began party, sleigh ride, and a splash party are some of the other activities for which dates will be decided upon at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>Having a social gathering after every meeting seems to appeal to the members and will be continued.</p>
