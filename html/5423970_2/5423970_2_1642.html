   <p>The Educational Club of Lithuanian Men and Women, a mutual aid society in Cicero, Illinois, held its preliminary meeting, December 27, at the Lithuanian Liberty Hall. An unusually large number of members attended.</p>
   <p>According to a report by the treasurer, there is about $2,500 in the treasury of the society at present. That is a large sum in view of the fact that this mutual aid society has already paid out large sums to members in sick and death benefits. That indicates that the members of the club are active and very industrious.</p>
   <p>This society derives its income not only from membership dues, but also from theatrical and musical program presentations.</p>
   <p>This year the society will present a theatrical play entitled "Because of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Love," on Sunday, February 21. The actors and actresses of the play will be composed of members of the famous "Kankliu Chorus." That will insure a capable presentation of the play.</p>
   <p>New Members are accepted into this society at an unusually low entrance fee. Those who desire to join are invited to come to any of the monthly meetings. Meetings are held on the afternoon of the last Sunday of each month, at the Lithuanian Liberty Hall.</p>
   <p>All officers of the society were re-elected for the coming year.</p>
