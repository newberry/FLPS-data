   <p>At last the long awaited operetta, "The Chimney Sweeper and the Miller," was presented by Mikas Petrauskas. The Chicago Lithuanians were eager to see this famous spectacle performed. They saw on the stage the Lithuanian girls and men dressed in national costumes. But when the audience heard the choir of ninety voices sing the national hymn, many in the audience wept when they heard that this beautiful Lithuanian melody came from the hearts of the sons and daughters of Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>The operetta was performed beautifully, better could not be expected from non-professional artists. Men such as Petrauskas are a great asset to Lithuanians. But how many Lithuanians realize that we have such a person? This performance of the operetta proves that we can perform even better and harder operettas. Having such an artistic leader in Chicago as Mr. Petrauskas, we Lithuanians must join his newly organized choir, and the general Lithuanian public must support him. In unity we will accomplish great cultural results.</p>
