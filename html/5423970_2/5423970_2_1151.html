   <p>Beginning with its next number, the Laisvoji Mintis will be published in Chicago. It will be printed by the Lietuva Press.

However, the Lithuanians should not forget that the publication of such a periodical is costly, therefore, its life and prosperity will depend not only on compliments but more on support.</p>
