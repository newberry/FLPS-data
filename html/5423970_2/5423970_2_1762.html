   <p>The St. Michael the Archangel Society was organized on November 22, 1903. The society's aim is to unite on the common basis of brotherly love of all those Lithuanian Catholics who are willing to always help one another, both materially and spiritually; that is if a member is sick to visit him and give him necessary help; if a member dies - a fitting Catholic funeral; orphans shall be given proper care also, to care for and support the parish and national needs to the best of their ability.</p>
   <p>The first meeting of the society was held in J.L.Albert Hall, 846 N. Paulina St. At this meeting the society elected a board consisting of the following: J. Antanavicius, president; J. Stankurcius, secretary; and D. Endjelis, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The society's income is derived from the members' dues, concerts, dances and picnics. The society has a church and an American flag, also the members have the national colors with St. Michael's picture. At all parades and festivities the members always <span class="page-break">\2</span>wear their badges. The members who have not been sick for ten years, get a gift of a gold ring. Already thirty-two members are wearing these gifts.</p>
