   <p>The Alliance of Dramatic Societies presented "The Enchanted Duke" at the new Lithuanian Milda Theater Saturday evening.</p>
   <p>The performance was somewhat weak.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the affair were to be donated for Lithuanian war relief. Because of this Mr. Olsezewskis, who owns the Milda Theater, made no charge for the use of the theater.</p>
   <p>The Sarpalius and Herman orchestras played during the performance. The musicians also donated their services.</p>
