   <p>November 26, at the Aurora Hall, a very important lecture was given. Mr. J. Laukis spoke on the Chinese revolution. The speaker used stereopticon pictures for the purpose of clarification. He spoke of the awakening of China where the people had worshiped their rulers and wealthy masters as gods for thousands of years. Now they have begun to educate themselves. They are destroying the old regime of despotism and exploitation; they are destroying the old traditions, and they are formulating, in their own country, a constitution similar to the United States Constitution. From now on, the people will elect their own representatives. Are you Lithuanians not astonished by such action? You have lived in the so-called civilized Russia where the people are slaves, and are more oppressed than in "uncivilized" China.</p>

   <p>The lecturer said, "Lithuanians! Study the life and actions of the Chinese! From such a people we can learn much--[we can learn] how to fight against bad conditions and how to obtain liberty."</p>
   <p>This lecture made so great an impression upon the audience that it was delivered again at St. George's Parish Hall on November 30.</p>
   <p>This lecture is so important that it ought to be given throughout the Chicago Lithuanian colony.</p>
