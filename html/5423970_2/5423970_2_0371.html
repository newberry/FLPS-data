   <p>Last Sunday at Hull House theater, A. Vitkauskas' theatrical group presented "The Wreath of Myrtle. This play was especially well presented. Unfortunately, as it always is with the Hull House theater, the attendance was rather small. It seems Lithuanians do not like this place, or that it is inconvenient to them. Even though this theater is small, it has never been filled by the Lithuanian public at previous concerts or theatrical performances.</p>
   <p>Notable in this presentation of "The Wreath of Myrtle" were the significant performances of A. Vitkauskas in the role of "Edward," and Miss. V. Zilviciute in the role of "Janina."</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Vitkauskas, as "Edward," of course, cannot be compared with the <span class="page-break">\2</span>other actors; it would not be fair, to him or to them. No matter what part Mr. Vitkauskas played--even a most minor role--he would capture for himself the admiration of all the spectators. Chicago Lithuanian actors at present have a great opportunity to learn much from him in the dramatic field.</p>
   <p>We ought to mention the "discovery" of Mr. A. Vitkauskas. Ever since the first time that he appeared in our midst, it must be admitted that he has proved his dramatic abilities. Miss Zilviciute, our well-known actress, recently has shown much improvement in acting. It ought to be mentioned that the management of Mr. Vitkauskas is bringing results.</p>
   <p>The other actors impressively acted their parts.</p>
