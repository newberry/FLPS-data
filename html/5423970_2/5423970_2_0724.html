   <p>July 7, Sunday. the Simonas Daukantas society held its meeting. Fourteen members joined our society. Every one knows that this society is better than any other society. Members of this society not only get sick benefit, but the most important for its members and for the Lithuanians, is the society's library, where everyone can get to read books on all subjects.</p>
   <p>On this meeting was Dr. Stupnickis, from Shenandoah, Pa. We knew the doctor's ability as a theatrieal performer, so the meeting decided to perform a play, "The Kraziai Masaacre." Dr. Stupnickis willingly agreed to coach the play.</p>
   <p>We are asking young men and girls, go to see Dr. Stupnickis and see what part you could take in the play. This is very important performance. Lithuanians do your best to produce this great spectacle.</p>
   <p>J. Aleksandrawiczius, president.</p>
