   <p>The Dr. Kudirka Society presented the Dramatic Circle of the L. S. S. in "Gods of Gold," a comedy in three acts, March 17. The players: M. M. Dunduliene, M. Dunduliute, M. M. Juska, J. Stasiunas, K. Siurniute, S. C. Juska, P. Samsonas, J. Uktveris and J. Buragas. Dunduliene, in the role of Keistutiene, was the best. Dunduliute also played quite well, while Buragas was fair, though he tried to imitate Vaitiekunas too much. This same group presented this same play much better last year. However, the audience in general was satisfied, for even with its shortcomings this comedy is good. At the end, Brusokas recited a monologue, "Little Stephen's Nose." The monologue itself is of poor contents but it was recited as only Brusokas can. The Meldazis Hall was packed.</p>
