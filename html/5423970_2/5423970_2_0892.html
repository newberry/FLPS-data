   <p>The newspaper Lietuva is now twenty-five years old. The first issue of the Lietuva appeared on December 10, 1892--the first Lithuanian newspaper in Chicago. At that time there were but few Lithuanian newspapers in America; in fact, there were only a few in the entire world. It is generally known that the cradle of Lithuanian journalism is in Minor Lithuania (East Prussia), where the first newspapers in the Lithuanian language were established. It is equally true, however, that Lithuanian journalism, together with Lithuanian national literature and culture, was developed here in America.</p>
   <p>In Greater Lithuania, as is well known, all publications in the Lithuanian language were banned and suppressed; in Prussian Lithuania, because of the Germanization of the Lithuanians, Lithuanian journalism was unable to take root properly and was unable to maintain the spirit of the Lithuanian national revival. It was only in America, where large groups of Lithuanians had immigrated, that Lithuanian newspapers began to appear, and strong and permanent foundations <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of Lithuanian journalism were laid. On these foundations the strong institution of Lithuanian journalism was built, and is still being built and developed.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva was among the early Lithuanian cultural workers. When the Lietuva was established in Chicago, there were only three other Lithuanian newspapers in America--the Vienybe Lietuvninku (Unity of the Lithuanians), Plymouth, Pennsylvania; the Saule (Sun), Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania; and the Garsas (Voice), Shenandoah, Pennsylvania. Besides these three Lithuanian newspapers, a monthly magazine entitled Apsvieta (Enlightenment) was published in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania by Dr. John Sliupas. This periodical is no longer published.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva, it may be said, was founded under unusual circumstances. First of all, it may be worthwhile to mention that the Lietuva was founded on the ruins or a Polish newspaper. There were not many Lithuanians in Chicago or even in all of America at that time. To tell the truth, however, there was a fairly large number of Lithuanians here, but very few of them were nationally conscious Lithuanians. Most or them were Polonized Lithuanians who associated themselves <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with the Poles. At that time, Stanley Rokos and Anthony Steponavicius, brother of Reverend Edward Steponavicius, were publishing in Chicago a weekly newspaper, known as the Reforma, in the Polish language. The newspaper was nonpartisan, and at first enjoyed much success. Later, however, when a new editor was appointed, the editorial policy of the paper suddenly changed from a nonpartisan stand to anarchism. This policy did not help the publication; the readers refused to support it, and the owners were forced to close the doors of their printing shop.</p>
   <p>Mr. Steponavicius thereupon resigned from the company and Mr. Rokos became sole owner of the printing shop, which remained closed and idle for six months. The owner made many unsuccessful attempts to sell. The shop and editorial office were housed in a basement at 567 West 18th Street, near Blue Island Avenue. Being unable to sell the bankrupt Reforma, and not knowing what to do with the printing shop, Mr. Rokos decided to make use of the shop by publishing a Lithuanian newspaper.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Thus it was that on December 10, 1892, upon the ruins of the Polish newspaper Reforma, there appeared the first number of the Lietuva, the first Lithuanian newspaper in Chicago. The paper was not large in size--four pages measuring 15 by 21 inches, and six columns per page. The first editor of the Lietuva was John Grinius, who later became a Protestant Lithuanian pastor.</p>
   <p>After a few issues of the Lietuva had appeared, the number of readers began to grow steadily. However, Mr. Rokos did not remain as the publisher for long. The editor could not get along with the publisher and began to agitate against the latter in the paper. The publisher became so enraged that, after seven issues of the Lietuva had appeared, he sold it to the first prospect. The new owner was Mr. A. V. Zaliauskas. Only six more issues of the Lietuva were published under the new owner, the ownership of the newspaper changing hands under unusual circusmstances.</p>
   <p>A. V. Zaliauskas had bought the Lietuva, together with the printing shop, from Rokos for five hundred dollars. Being unable to pay cash, he had made a down <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>payment of $150 and had issued a mortgage for the balance. Zaliauskas had retained the same editor, John Grinius, who continued his attacks in the Lietuva against the former owner. Mr. Rokos (whose Lithuanian name is Rokosas) was waiting for an opportunity to get revenge. He did not have to wait long. The new owner moved the printing shop from 18th Street to the Bridgeport district, at 3321 South Halsted Street, without giving any notice to Mr. Rokos, who held a mortgage on the printing shop. In the eyes of the law such removal of the printing shop is a criminal offense. Mr. Rokos took full advantage of this opportunity. He had Zaliauskas arrested and then sold the Lietuva and printing shop at public auction to Peter Zacharevicius and Simon Lelasius for $350, the value of the mortgage. Both Zacharevicius and Lelasius are now dead.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Lietuva had three different owners during the first three months of its existence. But after nine more issues, the ownership of the Lietuva changed again. Zacharevicius and Lelasius were unable to keep up the paper because of lack of funds. They sold the paper to Anthony Olsevskis <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>for $350, the same price they had paid. The Lietuva remained in the hands of Olsevskis for twenty-four years; he developed the newspaper into one of the largest and most influential Lithuanian publications in the world.</p>
   <p>Even now it is very difficult to establish a Lithuanian newspaper, but when the Lietuva was founded the task was much more difficult, because it was then necessary to develop an entirely new field. The successful development of that field now makes it much easier for new Lithuanian publications.</p>
   <p>When Olsevskis became the owner of the Lietuva, the editorial office and printing shop were housed in the front room of a very small, narrow building at 941 West 33rd Place. The rent was twelve dollars a month. The first issue of the Lietuva under the ownership of Olsevskis appeared on June 17, 1893. The newspaper then had a total of four hundred subscribers. Olsevskis edited the paper himself.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Hard Times</p>
   <p>Hard times prevailed in those years in the United States. The years 1893 and 1894 were known as "years of famine". Unemployment prevailed all over the country. In Chicago, only one out of every five or six homes were occupied; the rest bore "for rent" or "for sale" signs. There were more unemployed than employed workers. The city established so-called "soup kitchens" in various parts of the city, where starving people were given free soup.</p>
   <p>Therefore, after buying the Lietuva, with its circulation of four hundred, Olsevskis had to do all the writing for his paper, all the office work, receive guests who wished to see the editorial office of the first Lithuanian newspaper in Chicago, and in addition he had to assist in setting type. The job of setting type in those days was not as easy as it might appear today to some people. At that time there were no Lithuanian typesetters, and it was impossible to get any from other cities. For that reason, the Lietuva was set by Polish typesetters who did not know or understand even one word of the Lithuanian language. One can imagine, therefore, what a woeful job it was to issue <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the Lietuva under such conditions. When the Polish typesetters had set the newspaper, the proofs contained so many errors that they could be read either from top to bottom or from bottom to top with the same results. The proofs had to be read and corrected as much as five or six times.</p>
   <p>Evidently, it was worse than slavery to get out the Lietuva under such terrible conditions. Something had to be done about it. So Olsevskis placed a few Lithuanians in the printing shop to teach them the printing trade. Working hours in those days were much longer than they are today. The Lietuva printers worked from six in the morning to six in the evening. Olsevskis himself, according to his own statement, worked from sixteen to eighteen hours every day, including Sundays--from six o'clock in the morning to ten or twelve o'clock at night. This is not at all surprising when we remember that besides publishing a newspaper Olsevskis also conducted a steamship agency and a money-forwarding business. He did all the work himself because at that time he could not afford to hire help. Therefore, the early road of the Lietuva and its publisher was not strewn with flowers. This was all the more true because in this work, as in all other kinds of work, many enemies began to harass Mr. Olsevskis. The <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>friends of the paper tried to help,....but the enemies tried to harm the newspaper and even predicted that the Lietuva would go bankrupt within three months. They probably had good reasons for making such a prediction, because, as was already stated, the first year of the Lietuva was a very hard year.</p>
   <p>However, their prediction did not come true. The new owner of the Lietuva was a man of unusual energy, and he was very industrious. He succeeded in carrying the Lietuva through hard times, and he placed it on a sound business foundation. From then on, the history of the Lietuva is a happier story. The newspaper began to gain more friends and more readers, and it grew in both size and quality; in other words, the newspaper enjoyed a steady and healthy growth in every respect. On October 7, 1893, the Lietuva was moved to larger and more convenient quarters at 954 West 33rd Street, where the rent was thirty-five dollars per month.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>First Permanent Editor</p>
   <p>The popularity of the Lietuva increased, and business improved so much that Mr. Olsevskis was now able to consider hiring help. He was no longer able to handle all the work himself; so he decided to hire someone to assume the duties of editor, while he himself took care of the administrative duties. On December 14, 1895, L. Sernas (Joseph Adomaitis) came to America from Lithuania. He became the editor of the Lietuva beginning with the fiftieth issue of 1895. He remained editor for twenty-two years, until 1917. Incidentally, he is probably the only Lithuanian who has devoted his whole life to the field of journalism.</p>
   <p>Year after year the Lietuva made steady progress. In rapid strides it soon caught up with all other Lithuanian-American newspapers, and eventually became the leading public Lithuanian institution in America. Until August 29, 1896, the Lietuva was housed in a rented building, but on that date it was moved into its own building, which had been built for that purpose by Mr. Olsevskis. The Lietuva Building, 924 West 33rd Street, was erected at a cost of seven thousand dollars. Besides the printing shop and editorial <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>office, Olsevskis established in this building a private bank and the largest Lithuanian book store in America. Many office workers were now hired by Mr. Olsevskis; in the printing shop all the printers, who hitherto were Poles, were now replaced by newly trained Lithuanian printers. The Lietuva remained at this location for eleven years, during which time business improved to such an extent that the building proved to be much too small. Plans were then made for the construction of a more spacious building to be located on the important business corner of 33rd and Halsted Streets. The building was completed on March 1, 1907 at a cost of one hundred thousand dollars; it was then the largest Lithuanian-owned building in Chicago. The Lietuva moved into the building on that date and is there at present.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva building is three stories high and the ground plot is 83 by 135 feet. The basement is occupied by the book store, stocked largely with books printed by the Lietuva. The front corner of the building is occupied by the private bank of Mr. Olsevskis. The rest of the first floor and all of the second floor on the 33rd Street side are occupied by the printing shop and <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>editorial offices; the rest of the building is rented out for stores, offices, and living quarters.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva Is Enlarged</p>
   <p>The foregoing describes the external or material progress of the Lietuva. However, it is evident that there were good reasons for such splendid progress. The circulation of the newspaper increased very rapidly from the time it was established. It soon became necessary to enlarge the newspaper. After January, 1897, the size of the Lietuva pages was enlarged from six to seven columns a page. Three years later, on November 23, 1900, the newspaper was again enlarged; eight columns appeared on each page, and each page was enlarged to 20 by 26 inches. It was published in this size for six years. On January 5, 1906, the Lietuva was enlarged to twice its former size; from a four-page newspaper, it was enlarged to eight pages, seven columns per page, and is still being published in that size. When the Lietuva was enlarged to eight pages, it became the largest Lithuanian newspaper in the world. All the printing at that time <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>was done by hand, a difficult and highly complicated job. But on May 10, 1907, the Lietuva purchased its first linotype machine. From then on, the Lietuva and all books were set by the linotype machine.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva Press was the first Lithuanian printing shop that dared to purchase a linotype machine. We say "dared" because it was a great and difficult step: It was a great step because the cost of purchasing and installing such a machine was great; it was a difficult step because at that time there was not even one Lithuanian who knew how to operate such a machine. Therefore, it was again necessary to hire Lithuanians and teach them a trade that was hitherto unknown to them. Only after a few years did other Lithuanian printing shops follow the example of the Lietuva, profit by its experience, and install linotype machines.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is true, as is generally acknowledged, that the Lietuva blazed the trail for modern Lithuanian printing methods and is the mother of the new Lithuanian press. In a comparatively short time, the Lietuva acquired three linotype machines, which cost over ten thousand dollars. In addition, the <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>Lietuva bought a large book-printing machine which was operated by an electric motor and which cost three thousand dollars. Three other smaller machines, known as Gordon Presses, which are driven by electric motors and which cost over one thousand dollars, do the smaller printing jobs. There are now seven permanent employees in the printing shop; besides these, many extra, part-time workers are hired during the rush periods.</p>
   <p>It will not be out of place to mention here that the Lietuva is now the largest Lithuanian book-publishing house in America. It has published a very large number of big volumes and books, and in that way has established the largest Lithuanian book store in America.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva Press is distinguished for its quality workmanship, and at the Paris Exposition of 1900, the Lietuva was awarded a large gold medal, the "Grand Prix". No other Lithuanian publishing house has thus far been similarly honored.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>Those Responsible for the Success of the Lietuva</p>
   <p>Two persons are mainly responsible for the success and growth of the Lietuva. They are Anthony Olsevskis, the publisher, who has successfully developed his business into the largest Lithuanian enterprise in America, and L. Sernas, a very able and competent journalist, who edited' the Lietuva for many years.</p>
   <p>In 1909, things began to change somewhat. Up to that time, Sernas was a young and very energetic man, and was able to handle all the editorial work himself. But when the paper was doubled in size and Sernas became advanced in years, the work proved to be too much for one man. It became necessary to hire assistant editors. However, much difficulty was experienced with the latter; it was hard for the old editor to get along with some of his assistants. As a result, the editorial policy and the nature of the paper's contents oscillated from one partisan viewpoint to another. Such sudden and repeated changes in the editorial policy have never benefited any newspaper. The policy of the Lietuva changed often; one day it adhered to a socialist viewpoint, the next day it suddenly changed to a nationalist viewpoint, and then again its policy would be <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>noncommittal, neither this nor that. Finally, when Bruno K. Balutis became editor of the Lietuva, the editorial policy of the paper settled down to a progressive, Lithuanian nationalist viewpoint, as it had once been.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the financial success of Olsevskis aided the growth of the Lietuva in its early days, but later, as his various business enterprises began to expand and enjoy still greater success, he was unable to devote as much time to the business affairs of the Lietuva as he formerly did. As a result, the growth of the Lietuva was somewhat retarded. In the beginning, the chief business of Olsevskis was journalism and book publishing; later, his banking business grew to such an extent that it occupied first place in his mind. The newspaper business became a kind of stepson to him. The administrative end of the Lietuva was considerably neglected, and the readers became dissatisfied.</p>
   <p>In 1916, an epidemic of failures struck the so-called private banks, to which group the bank of Olsevskis belonged. One private bank after another went bankrupt. The bank of Olsevskis, which held out longer than others, was finally forced either to reorganize into a state bank or to close its doors.</p>
   <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>
   <p>After much time and effort, Olsevskis finally succeeded in reorganizing his bank into a state bank under the name "Universal State Bank".</p>
   <p>After Olsevskis reorganized his bank, he decided to liquidate all his other business enterprises. For that reason, early this year, the ownership of the Lietuva passed into the hands of Joseph J. Baciunas and John P. Pajauskas. The former is president and the latter secretary and business manager of the Lithuanian Publishing Company, which was formed by the present publishers of the Lietuva. The Company is incorporated for twenty thousand dollars. Thirty people are now members of the firm. Experience has shown that it is better for both the newspaper and public when the newspaper is in the hands of a company rather than in the hands of one or two individuals. When more people belong to a company the newspaper has more supporters; it enjoys greater confidence and the readers and company derive greater benefits.</p>
   <p>We often receive inquiries and advice from our people in regard to the establishment of a daily nationalist newspaper. Many of our people are not content with <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>the narrow, partisan Lithuanian daily newspapers that now exist in America. Today there is no Lithuanian in America wealthy enough to publish a daily newspaper. However, a company, with many members, can do it. For that reason, now that the firm of the Lietuva has increased in membership, it will be possible in the near future to convert the Lietuva into a daily newspaper; that will be done if the shareholders desire it and agree to it.</p>
   <p>At present, both the rightist and leftist factions have daily newspapers, but the middle faction, the Nationalists, do not. For this reason, the life of the Lithuanian-Americans is not fully or properly covered by the Lithuanian-American press. The political and public activities of Lithuanian-Americans is off balance and disorganized, and for that reason the general interests of the Lithuanian nationality are suffering and are being neglected.</p>
   <p>The middle Lithuanian faction, the Nationalist group, is as old as the Lithuanian national revival movement. Nevertheless, this group has not as yet been organized. Our Nationalist leaders, until comparatively recently, have been active in <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>the circles of one or another of the various partisan groups. The Nationalists began to organize only about two years ago, when the extreme political elements, the Clericalists [Catholics] on one end and the Socialists on the other, began to campaign against the Nationalists.</p>
   <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that the organization of the middle Nationalist faction is behind that of the Socialists and Clericalists, each of which has a daily newspaper. The Nationalists, it is true, have strong and more intelligent Lithuanian weekly newspapers, but the Lithuanian-American public has developed to such an extent that weekly newspapers cannot satisfy their wants. A good, unprejudiced daily newspaper with a middle-of-the-road Nationalist policy is very necessary, and, as we hear from the Lithuanian public, is very desirable and in demand.</p>
   <p>After the Lietuva company becomes more strongly organized, it will probably in the near future supply the need for such a daily newspaper. However, that will depend on how soon the Nationalists will become organized, and finally upon the <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>decision of the shareholders of the Lithuanian Publishing Company.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In connection with this article photographs of the following persons appear in this issue of the Lietuva: A. Olsevskis, L. Sernas, B. K. Balutis, Joseph J. Baciunas, and John P. Pajauskas. In addition there are photos of two Lithuanian men who have been readers of Lietuva since the first number was issued: K. S. Jokubaitis and B. Andresunas.]</p>
