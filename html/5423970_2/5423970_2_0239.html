   <p>The Brighton Park and Town-of-Lake chapters of the A.Z.V.D. (Children's Little Society of the Blossom of Hope) gave a concert on Jan. 16, at the Mc Kinley Park hall. It was probably the most impressive children's concert of the season. All numbers were well executed and enthusiastically received by the audience, which filled the hall to capacity.</p>
   <p>The combined choruses of both colonies, consisting of about forty children, created a deep impression upon the audience, when they sang the Internationale, the anthem of the working class of the world, and a song entitled "The Fatherland of Orphans." Two talented Lithuanian girls also moved the audience with a song entitled "Sister, Why Are You Sad?" Anthony Nauseda successfully depicted the life of a prisoner in his jail cell, singing working class songs for comfort and to while away the time.</p>
   <p>The balance of the program consisted of a long string of numbers on the piano, individual and group dancing, declamations, and short theatrical scenes.</p>
   <p>Credit for this highly successful musical and theatrical program must be given to Veronica Bigelis, who spent much time and patient effort to train the children of both colonies. In appreciation of her efforts she was presented with a beautiful bouquet of flowers towards the end of the concert.</p>
   <p>Miss Bigelis has been training the choruses of the above children's society for the past seven years. In ability, talent and results, she occupies the foremost position among the Lithuanian music and art teachers in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>The entire program was assisted by the Lithuanian Workers String Orchestra.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the children's society presents a wonderful opportunity for the development of musical and artistic talent in children, it is advisable for Lithuanian parents to enroll their children in the society.</p>
