   <p>A. Vitkauskas' theatrical company presented "The Duke of Pilenai", a tragedy in five acts, at the West Side Auditorium last Sunday night.</p>
   <p>This play occupies an important place in the theatrical literature of the Lithuanians, and because it is a heavy and beautiful tragedy it demands skilful presentation.</p>
   <p>The tragedy was first presented in 1905. It was written possibly long before that--at a time when the Lithuanian language and literature were not at all developed. However, its author, M. Sauleniskis, succeeded in writing his play in very rich and unusually beautiful language which is worthy of study.</p>
   <p>The plot of the play is taken from the novel, "The Priest", written by the Polish writer, Krasewski. The action takes place on the Lithuanian-Prussian border, during the times of the fierce battles between the Lithuanians and the <span class="page-break">\2</span>German Knights of the Cross. [Teutonic Knights]</p>
   <p>The plot of the play is somewhat as follows:</p>
   <p>In the first scene of the first act knights are seen coming out of a church, speaking about matters concerning their organization.</p>
   <p>The most influential of them, especially knights Bernard, Klebonas and Komturas, are dissatisfied with the "too Christian" discipline imposed upon them by their new grand master. It appears that the grand master wants to reform the knights. To the treasurer's report that there is no money in the treasury, the grand master replies:</p>
   <p>"No money? Then we do not need any! The honorable defenders of our holy religion must defend themselves not only with strong forts and walls, not only with their swords, but, I will say to you, most of all with the Cross which is the emblem of our order. That is, they must defend themselves against the <span class="page-break">\3</span>pagans with the examples of virtuous actions, of brotherly love.....They told me in Rome, and I can see now, that the German order has overstepped its bounds! Do not attack the pagans; do not seize the wealth from their fields and their homes; do not slaughter them to the last man. If you conduct yourselves properly, I firmly believe they will not attempt to attack you, and will even accept Holy Baptism! While I have the authority here, conditions will not be what they have been in the past!"</p>
   <p>Such plans did not please Bernard, and with his friends he was now plotting to get rid of such an exacting superior.</p>
   <p>On meeting Klebonas, Bernard complains that his adopted boy, Jurgis, (whom the knights kidnapped from Lithuania while he was an infant) is beginning to fail in health, and is sad and restless. They decide to send him to a small village where they believe he will be able to return to normalcy.</p>
   <p>In the second scene Jurgis is in a hospital, waiting for the regular visit of <span class="page-break">\4</span>Rymas, a Lithuanian in the service of the German Knights of the Cross, who tells him much about Lithuania, and announces that he, Jurgis, is also a Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>Jurgis listens attentively to Rymas' stories about the land of his birth, and his curiosity seems endless. Rymas describes Lithuania and her beauties in beautiful, impressive speeches. Through the influence of Rymas and his stories a feeling of hate toward the Teutonic Knights is born and rises in the young man.</p>
   <p>In the second act Jurgis is already in the village. Rymas follows him there. In his monologue he speaks with abhorrence of the dissoluteness of the knights.</p>
   <p>He meets another victim of the knights' attacks on Lithuania, the beautiful Laimute. She is exploited in all manners by the knights, who strive unsuccessfully to gain her favor. Rymas strives to defend her everywhere. She becomes acquainted with Jurgis.</p>
   <p>Her simple but impressive Lithuanian songs make a deep impression on the young <span class="page-break">\5</span>Jurgis. A song from the lips of Laimute is a mighty weapon. With its assistance she is able to convert back to Lithuanianism the Lithuanian traitor, Sventasis, who is a Knight of the Cross and assigned to watching Jurgis.</p>
   <p>In this same act Jurgis discovers that he is not a common Lithuanian, but the son of the mighty Duchess Reda, whose castle is situated on the boundary between the lands of the Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights. Jurgis, Rymas, Laimute and the converted Sventasis decide to escape from the knights.</p>
   <p>The action of the third act takes place in the divine forest on the banks of the Nemunas River, not far from Pilenai. There the refugees are seized by native Lithuanians who think they are German spies. They are brought before the pagan priest, Merunas, who, upon seeing the young and beautiful Laimute, wants to keep her for himself. With this in mind, he attempts to rid himself of Rymas, Sventasis, and especially Margis (which is Jurgis' real name). He almost succeeds in these plans.</p>
   <p>The high priest, Krive Krivaitis [the official title of the Lithuanian pagan <span class="page-break">\6</span>high priests], sentences Margis to be burnt at the stake as a sacrifice to the gods.</p>
   <p>Sventasis admonishes Krive and announces that Margis is the son of Duchess Reda. However, the crowd holds this statement to be an invention and Margis is being led to the stake. In desperation Laimute springs forward to defend Margis with a knife.</p>
   <p>At that critical moment the Duchess of Pilenai arrives with her guards. The furious Duchess decides she herself will slay the masquerading German, Margis.</p>
   <p>She duels with Margis, who jumps into the battle furiously and is almost victorious at the very beginning. But later he weakens and she is preparing to drive the sword into his throat.</p>
   <p>Suddenly the sword falls from her hand. She recognizes her son's mole on Margis' neck.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>In this great moment of joy Margis forgives even the priest, Merunas, who had wanted to take his life. Everybody is happy except the aged Krive Krivaitis, who utters prophesies of a great misfortune for Lithuania for withholding a promised sacrifice to the gods and for degrading the priest, Merunas.</p>
   <p>In the first scene of the fourth act Bernard and his supporters are in the Marienburg Fort, plotting intrigues to draw the German Order into a war with the Lithuanians. Since the grand master is opposed to such a move, Bernard decides to get rid of him with the aid of poison.</p>
   <p>"We will poison that rat!" he shouts, laughing.</p>
   <p>He fulfills his threat in the second scene, when during a banquet he slyly pours poison into the grand master's drinking cup. The grand master drinks and dies.</p>
   <p>A breathless guard rushes in at that same moment and informs those assembled of a daring and successful attack upon the fort by the Lithuanians. Some time later <span class="page-break">\8</span>Sventasis is carried onto the stage after having purposely allowed himself to be captured in order to learn the plans of the Teutonic Knights. During the commotion the guards, believing Sventasis to be wounded, do not watch him carefully. Seeing an opportunity to do so, Sventasis escapes and hurries to warn the Lithuanians of the impending danger.</p>
   <p>In the fifth act the Lithuanian soldiers are attending a banquet in a hall of the Castle of Pilenai. The older men among them realize what danger threatens them. However, they have no thought of surrender.</p>
   <p>During the banquet Sventasis arrives with Bernard, whom he captured during his flight from the Teutonic Knights. Bernard, overcome by great fear, begs forgiveness from Margis.</p>
   <p>Before the scene ends, messengers arrive from the Teutonic Knights and promise Margis the throne of the Duchy of Pilenai if he will become an ally of the Germans. Margis, angered by such treachery, almost throws the messengers out.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>The Lithuanian soldiers commend Margis' stand.</p>
   <p>In the second scene the Castle of Pilenai is already besieged. The soldiers and civilians are preparing for death. The Knights of the Cross force their way in. In another moment the scene becomes a battlefield. The Lithuanians defend themselves bravely. Some fall under the blows of the German swords. None want to be captured alive by the knights.</p>
   <p>The conquerors find only a pile of corpses, among them Margis, Laimute, Reda, the high priest, other priests, officers and common soldiers. The curtain falls, hiding the victors and the corpses.</p>
   <p>Naujienos, Mar. 1, 1916.</p>
   <p>As you can see, it is a beautiful and impressive tragedy. It can leave a deep impression on the audience when it is presented correctly. However, the actors <span class="page-break">\10</span>did not attain the required degree of perfection. They can be criticized for much: inexcusably long intermissions and an absolute lack of harmony in the acting. A cold, unheated hall, and gaps in the scenery through which the audience was forced to witness scenes which had nothing to do with the play added to the discontent of the audience. These both amused and angered the public.</p>
   <p>Most of the actors did not fit the roles they attempted to portray. For example, the important roles of the grand master, Reda and the priests were given to weak actors. The grand master, who was supposed to portray the character of the most humane, most idealistic person among the Teutonic Knights, acted all the while like a madcap villager. Permit me barely to mention Reda's acting here, for it was too much even for me, an experienced sufferer. I will make only this observation: in the fifth act, why did the director permit this unfortunate woman to dress, not as would befit a Duchess of Pilenai, but as a cabaret heroine? And those common soldiers, both of the Lithuanians and of the German Order, who were supposed to create the effect of completion to a scene, milled about the <span class="page-break">\11</span>stage like uninvited guests.</p>
   <p>What scenes we poor onlookers were forced to witness! We saw clownish sword duels, all kinds of pushings about, and unhappy confusion among the actors. We will most likely never forget that banquet in the hall of the Pilenai Castle. We saw how the honorable defenders of Pilenai groveled on the floor. A tragic scene--one can say no more! True, there were beautiful scenes also.</p>
   <p>Well, what should be said now about the individual artists? Miss Vera Zilvitis, though a novice on the Lithuanian stage, was able to portray successfully the difficult role assigned to her. Her sincere manner of expression, almost childlike naivete, and conscientious knowledge of her lines won for her the respect and admiration of most of those attending. However, the young lady still needs much, much training.</p>
   <p>B. Vaitekunas, as Bernard, was in a different role than usual, but was as good as usual. That man didn't stop acting for a moment. Good mimicry and continual <span class="page-break">\12</span>motions (always well placed) interested the public immensely.</p>
   <p>The part of Rymas was fulfilled satisfactorily, though I must say his make-up was not very appropriate.</p>
   <p>Mr. Briedis, in the role of Sventasis, pleased me most of all. At ease, strong in voice and actions, surprisingly well made up, he created a good impression. Only, Uncle Sventasis, isn't it dangerous to be without a sword so often during such a time of war?</p>
   <p>It is not my place to criticize the acting of the artist, A. Vitkauskas, though it seems to me that even he made a few mistakes. However, when watching him on the stage, one could feel that a professional artist was acting.</p>
   <p>To tell the truth, I had expected much more of this presentation. I cannot say what was the real reason for the failure. I was told that complete rehearsals were not held because of the lack of time for them. Therefore, the director <span class="page-break">\13</span>did not have the time to create more harmony in the play. It was said that many things helped to ruin the mood of the players; for example, lack of adequate sets, impolite workers backstage, filthy holes which the actors were forced to use for dressing rooms, etc.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that we Lithuanians are not yet accustomed to presenting good historical tragedies, and Vitkauskas alone cannot help us much in this matter.</p>
   <p>However, no matter what the situation is, I feel sad that I cannot end this article as the play ends--that I cannot shout "Honor to you, heroes of Lithuania!"</p>
   <p>Instead, I will end with the words of the high priest: "Forgive us, O gods!"</p>
