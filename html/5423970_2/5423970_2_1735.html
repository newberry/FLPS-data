   <p>The Blessed Lithuania Society, a mutual-aid society, has lowered the initiation fee to all applicants who are thirty years of age or under to $1.00 during the next six months; the initiation fee for applicants above that age will be the same as before, according to the age of the applicant. This is an excellent opportunity for young Lithuanian men who desire to belong to a mutual-aid society.</p>
   <p>All members of the society are entitled to a sick benefit of five dollars per week, and a death benefit of fifty dollars; the proceeds of a collection of one dollar from each member are added to the above-mentioned death benefit.</p>
