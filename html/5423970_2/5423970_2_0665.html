   <p>p.4....After a recent announcement in Jaunimas concerning the organization of a club for all the young literary minded Lithuanians, we received a number of letters asking us to go ahead and start such an organization at once.</p>
   <p>Writers of these letters suggest there is much interesting work for a club of this nature. Meetings, with literary discussions, lectures, essay contests, study of Lithuanian literature publishing year books of American-Lithuanian youth literature are only few of the suggestions.</p>
   <p>We are happy to announce that plans have been just completed and that a meeting will be called in the very near future. Information as to the date and place will be sent only to those who request it by writing to Jaunimas.</p>
