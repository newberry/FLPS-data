   <p>When our composer presented the operetta named above the first time, the Chicago Lithuanian demand was great for a second presentation. In order to fulfill the wishes of the people, our composer, Mr. Petrauskas, will present a second time, "The Chimney Sweeper and the Miller", Apr. 22nd, at the West Side Auditorium, corner Taylor St. and Center Ave., where the first performance has also taken place.</p>
   <p>This presentation should be a still greater success, as the chorus has been increased to 150 members. The chorus requires more girls. Therefore, young girls, join the chorus and help it to improve its cultural aims.</p>
   <p>The rehearsals are held Saturday evenings at 869 - 33rd Place.</p>
   <p>After the performance of the operetta, there will be a ball.</p>
