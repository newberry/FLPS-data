   <p>The West Side (Twenty-Eighth) Branch of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society sponsored a Lithuanian war relief entertainment on March 11, at Meldazis Hall. The arrangements committee, after spending much time and energy in preparation for the affair, was rewarded with success.</p>
   <p>The most interesting part of the program was the staging of the three-act play "Ant Bedugnes Krasto" (On the Brink of an abyss), which was performed by members of the Branch's dramatic group.</p>
   <p>In addition to the play there were songs, recitations, an oration, and dancing on the program. Mrs. M. Vilkas sang a solo. Two sisters, Casimira and Catherine Zauris, sang beautifully the song "Meile Tevynes Nemari" (Love For <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Fatherland is Immortal). Two little girls, P. Rokis and Eliz. Gasilis, greatly impressed the audience with poetry recitations. There were several monologues, which were highly appreciated by the audience. The oration was delivered by Dr. A. J. Zimontas, president of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. The program ended with the singing of the Lithuanian National Anthem, "Lietuva Tevyne Musu" (Lithuania Our Fatherland), by the Zauris sisters and the audience.</p>
   <p>A capacity crowd attended. During an intermission period a collection was made among the audience for Lithuanian war relief. The collection netted a total of $36.06. Therefore, the total proceeds from the affair should amount to a fairly large sum.</p>
