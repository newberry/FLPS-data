   <p>The Biruta Music and Dramatic Society staged "Adomas ir Jieva" (Adam and Eve), a two-act operetta, on December 26, at the Hull House theatre. The Play was written by Mikas Petrauskas. Although the weather was bad, a fairly large crowd attended.</p>
   <p>Besides the drama, the audience was entertained with Lithuanian folk songs by the famous Biruta chorus, led by Mikas Petrauskas. Mr. Strumskis played several selections on the organ. The most successful songs were: "Liuosybes Daina" (Song of Liberty), and "Eina Garsas Nuo Rubeziaus" (I Hear a Voice From the Border), which is an ancient Lithuanian military song.</p>
   <p>The Play, which is more or less comical, provoked much laughter in the audience. It is a story of modern Adam and Eve. The synopsis of the Play is as follows:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>A young married couple is employed as servants by a count. The couple had to work very hard, and blamed all their troubles on the first parents, Adam and Eve; the husband placed all the blame on Eve, while the wife blamed Adam. One day the count overheard their arguments. He promised to provide the couple with a real eden for the remaining days of their lives if they could prove that they were less curious than Adam and Eve. He gave the couple a large room in his home, supplied them with all the necessities of life, and granted them complete liberty, but forbade them to remove the lid from a certain vase in the room. The two were very well satisfied with their new life, but the wife began to worry more and more about the contents of the vase, and on a number of occasions asked her husband for permission to look into the vase in order to satisfy her growing curiosity. But the husband the requested permission, and asked his wife to forget the vase. Finally, the wife became ill, and was dying from curiosity. The husband did not wish to become a widower, so he opened the vase, from which a dove flew out. The wife immediately recovered, and severely censured her husband for opening the vase. The count then restored the couple to their former positions, and advised them not to blame Adam and Eve any more for <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>their miserable plight, because they lost eden in the very same manner as did the first parents.</p>
   <p>The cast of players were as follows: "Adomas"--J. Uktveris, "Jieva"--Mrs. M. Damijonaitis, "Grafas,"--J. Ilgaudas.</p>
   <p>The most important event of the season will be the staging of the first Lithuanian opera, "Sienapiute" (Hay Harvest), by the Biruta Society on January 2, 1910 at the Garrick Theatre.</p>
