   <p>On Sunday, February 13, the Simonas Daukantas Young People's Theatrical Club presented a comedy entitled "Unexpected" in the Providence of God Parish Hall. The acting itself was weak. Miss Klesnavicius was outstanding among the actors.</p>
   <p>However, the sponsors should not be ridiculed. They did do something, which is better than nothing! Everybody makes mistakes at the beginning! As time passes the Simonas Daukantas Club will learn to avoid them. They have only to apply themselves.</p>
   <p>There were several excellent vocal solos and recitations after the performance. The hall was crowded, and the sponsors are expected to realize a profit.</p>
