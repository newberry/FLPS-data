   <p>An important matter, generally neglected by Lithuanians, is the physical development of the body. The men do not exercise enough; very few of them belong to any kind of gymnastic society. And even less can be said for the women. One seldom hears, among the Lithuanians, that exercise is necessary for women as well as for men.</p>
   <p>A deplorable attitude toward women has become rooted in the minds of most of our people. A girl, they believe, should be concerned only with getting married; and, once she has married, her sole duty is housekeeping.</p>
   <p>Tradition places the life of a woman in this narrow a frame. Only during the last few years has there been a change in this trend of thought. Women are now finally regarded as citizens, with rights equal to those of men. Progressive women are beginning to participate in public life. The women <span class="page-break">\2</span>in general are beginning to concern themselves with public matters.</p>
   <p>However, one fundamental deficiency can be observed in the development of this trend; and this deficiency is found not only among the Lithuanian women, but among the men as well. If anybody were to compare the Americans and the Lithuanians, one difference would be outstanding. The Americans are strong, confident, full of life and energy, always in an even and friendly mood. This is so not only among the youth but also among mature and even aged people, men and women alike. Among the Lithuanians, however, that nimbleness, speed, and self-confidence is either lacking entirely or is present in but a small degree.</p>
   <p>One of the causes of this difference undoubtedly is the training is youth. It would be difficult to find more enthusiastic sportsmen than the Americans. The Americans learn to love various types of sports in their youth. Sports which have much to do with exercising the body (baseball, football, etc.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>are expecially popular among them. From their early childhood they receive training in gymnastics in their schools. The American boys and girls become used to activity, and that activity develops alertness and self-confidence in them.</p>
   <p>There is nothing of the kind among the Lithuanians. Almost from birth, the Lithuanian becomes accustomed to a sedentary life, unless his work demands otherwise. In connection with this a very strange conception of "seriousness" flourishes. Inactivity, frailty, and quietness are regarded as signs of "seriousness." Imitate the aged men--that is, sit still as though you were frozen--and you will be regarded as a "serious" person. The Lithuanian approves of such a life, though in reality it destroys a person, lessening his energy and making him a coward. Just as stagnant water becomes polluted, so a man, in such a life, becomes sour, shrivelled, capable of few accomplishments. Such a life not only destroys the strength of the body but harms the spirit to an even greater degree.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>So it is with the men. However, they do have the opportunity to go out now and then. To some, their work is exercise. But what is to be said of our women and girls? Sitting eternally at home, without fresh air, without activity, or working in factories at tasks which do not require great activity, they are truly in even worse circumstances than the men.</p>
   <p>Nothing will come of their public "activities" if they are not supported by a foundation of health. Nothing permanent and strong can be built if the builders' hands are not healthy and strong and if the builders themselves are not of a strong and healthy spirit. Such a spirit can be had only when the body is strong and healthy.</p>
   <p>Such is the importance of exercising the body. The sufficiency or shortage of gymnastics becomes evident in spheres with which, at first glance, it has no connection.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Gymnastic clubs and societies are necessary for the men, but they are even more necessary for the fair sex. Therefore the first Lithuanian Women's Gymnastic Club, organized in Chicago last month, is to be heartily congratulated. It is the first sign that our Lithuanian women realize that, on entering public life, they must first concern themselves with the foundation of their activity--a healthy body.</p>
   <p>Besides pure gymnastics, the Club also aims to teach its members dances which include more action. The dancing, too, comes under the heading of gymnastics, although it is of a different type. Naturally there is no room for politics or partisanship in the Club.</p>
   <p>The Club, it is apparent, is meeting with success, and more of the same kind are needed. They are the wells from which the women and girls draw their health. If all our Lithuanian girls and women belonged to such clubs many of the illnesses which are such frequent visitors in Lithuanian homes at <span class="page-break">\6</span>present would disappear. There would be no pale faces and premature aging, and all our activities would be even more successful than at present.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Women's Gymnastic Club does not restrict its membership in any manner. There are no initiation fees or monthly dues to be paid by members. The sole duty of the members is to devote one hour each week to gymnastics, this to be done at meetings under the supervision of an expert.</p>
   <p>More such clubs should be organized at the first opportunity. Good health is the road to a happy life!</p>
