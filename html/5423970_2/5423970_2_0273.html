   <p>P.4.... The 174th chapter of the Lithuanian Socialist League presented a concert and entertainment on Sunday, Jan. 17, in the Brighton Park Lithuanian colony.</p>
   <p>Owing to the fact that there are no halls separate from saloons in this community, the concert had to be held in a hall in connection with a saloon.</p>
   <p>A large crowd from all parts of the city assembled. However, because the hall was connected with a saloon the people soon became slaves of the saloon. Even those who were to participate in the program failed to refrain from an over-indulgence in drinks.</p>
   <p>Members of the North Side Choir, while seated in the audience awaiting their turn to go on the stage, started singing while the program was going on. Then a large part of the audience joined in the singing, thus disrupting the program.</p>
   
   <p>When the program director appealed for order in the audience then the bedlam increased, forcing the discontinuation of the program.</p>
   <p>By holding concerts in saloons we are disgracing our nationality and doing great harm to ourselves. The practice should be discontinued at once.</p>
