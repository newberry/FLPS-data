   <p>The editor has received complaints from out of town sections that the Vilnis English Section is limited to news of activities of the Chicago L. D. S. (Lithuanian Workers Alliance) branches and choruses. Such a situation, while it is not to be desired by us, at least indicates that our youth organizations in Chicago are active. We do not imply that out of town sections are not active, but surely if they are, they should write about their experiences and their activities. This would not only remedy the fault of the English Section's being confined to youth activities of Chicago, but would also enable the out of town sections to popularize their L. D. S. branches and their choruses and bring other youth into their ranks.</p>
   <p>What is necessary now is that our out-of-towners in Cleveland, Detroit, Rockford, Kenosha, Grand Rapids, Springfield and Waukegan, who have contributed every little correspondence of late, write more for the V. E. S. This is your paper and an instrument through which you can build your organizations. But unless you write us of your experiences and activities, it will not fulfill its purpose. The Vilnis English Section is one of the best medium through which we can build our L. D. S. branches and choruses. Correspondents, let us make it a still better instrument.</p>
