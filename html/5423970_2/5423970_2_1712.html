   <p>Last Sunday, branch 36 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America held its meeting at Aurora Hall, 3149 South Halsted Street. At this meeting, seven new members joined the organization. The total of their subscribed insurance policy is $4,700. This proves that the Lithuanians are beginning to understand that the Lithuanian Alliance of America is much better than the so-called insurance companies where the members have no voice in the company's affairs.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America pays six dollars a week to sick persons. This organization is good to those who are sometimes forced to move from city to city because the Lithuanian Alliance has its branches in almost every city where Lithuanians live.</p>
   <p>Branch 36 has become very active. It elected Mr. K. Jurgelionis as organizer of this district.</p>
