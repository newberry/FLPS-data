   <p>While Lietuva was being organized as a daily, many of our friends--and some who were not our friends--asked us to state the type of program and platform which the new daily would support.</p>
   <p>Numerous suggestions were received. We have been asked to publish some beautiful songs in the first edition so that everyone will be able to memorize them.</p>
   <p>In response to these requests, we have published below our platform and a song. Every Lithuanian should make it his duty to memorize this song.</p>
   <p>"Lithuania, our fatherland,</p>
   <p>Band of heroes,</p>
   <p>May thy sons draw</p>
   <p>Strength from thy past.</p>
   
   <p>"May thy children travel</p>
   <p>Only the paths of virtue;</p>
   <p>May they work for thy benefit</p>
   <p>And the welfare of the people.</p>
   <p>"May the sun of Lithuania</p>
   <p>Remove the darkness,</p>
   <p>And may light and truth</p>
   <p>Guide our steps.</p>
   <p>"May the love of Lithuania</p>
   <p>Burn within our hearts.</p>
   <p>For the sake of Lithuania</p>
   <p>May unity bloom."</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This song is the Lithuanian Anthem. Vincas Kudirka wrote both the music and the lyrics.]</p>
   
   <p>Lithuanians will benefit themselves by supporting the platform of our paper. All humanity will be enriched when nations regulate their activities according to these immortal words of Kudirka.</p>
