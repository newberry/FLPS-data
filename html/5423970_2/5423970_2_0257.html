   <p>In spite of the very cold weather a large crowd attended the concert which was given by the Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies at Pulaski Hall, Ashland Avenue near 18th Street, last Sunday evening February 11. The weather was so cold that several Lithuanians remarked that only a dog who had been chased out of the house would have remained out-of-doors.</p>
   <p>Those who braved the extreme cold were not disappointed because the concert was excellent. The arrangement committee was successful in engaging the best Chicago Lithuanian singers, musicians, and orators to participate in the program. Every number of the long musical program was excellently rendered. However, because we must conserve space we can only give a general description of the program.</p>
   <p>First of all we commend the Peter Sarpalius Orchestra which really deserves praise. This Orchestra devoted much time and energy to preparing for this concert. We can say without hesitation that this is probably the first time we have had the opportunity of hearing a real Lithuanian orchestra which is worthy of its name. The Orchestra successfully played a difficult classical number, "Rigoletto," from the opera by Verdi; it also accompanied all the other musical numbers on the program.</p>
   <p>Such an aggregation may proudly play anywhere. The honor for the success of this orchestra belongs to Peter Sarpalius who has devoted his time and his energy to the training and the perfecting of the orchestra.</p>
   <p>The song program was full, well selected, and well rendered, which should have been expected in view of the fact that the songs were delivered by such artists as Karolis Sarpalius, Frank Jakutis, J. J. Zolpis, and Miss M. Rakauskas.</p>
   <p>The more Miss Rakauskas appears on the stage the better she is liked by the audiences. Her increasing popularity is due to her mellow voice and the lively and passionate manner in which she sings. She is always one of the most interesting personalities of any program on which she appears.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Jakutis has been singing to Lithuanian audiences for many years and is well known to the public. During this concert he almost started a "revolution" in the audience. After he had sung two songs the audience would not permit him to leave the stage until he had complied with two of their requests for encores.</p>
   <p>Karolis Sarpalius, the talented youngest son of the Sarpalius family of Chicago, possesses an unusually beautiful baritone voice. Mr. K. Sarpalius is still a young man and, if he continues to train his voice properly, he may anticipate a great future. His voice is undoubtedly rich and of a high quality.</p>
   <p>It would be a real omission if Mr. J. J. Zolpis and the Harmony Chorus which he directs were not mentioned. He sang the song "Meile" (Love) by Aleksan-dravicius, which is one of the most beautiful Lithuanian songs. Mr. Zolpis, who has a rich voice gave a beautiful and emotional rendition of that song. His Harmony Chorus, which sang a few songs, also made a deep impression on the audience. The Harmony Chorus is composed entirely of young Lithuanian men. The writer has never heard a better chorus, either in Chicago or in other Lithuanian-American colonies. If there is a better chorus the writer would like to hear it. It is being rumored that Mr. Zolpis, although busy training his own voice, gives his time and energy to the training of voices of his young chorus members. With such unselfish enthusiasm there can be no doubt that the Harmony Chorus will reach still greater heights in the future.</p>
   <p>Vincent Sarpalius, the third Sarpalius brother, rendered on the piano the very soul-stirring "Prelude" by Rachmaninov.</p>
   <p>The program opened with the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," the American National Anthem, and ended with the singing of "Lietuva Tevyne Musu" (Lithuania Our Fatherland), National Anthem of Lithuania.</p>
   <p>During an intermission period of the program Mr. Bruno K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva, delivered an oration. The theme of his talk was the words of Abraham Lincoln, "Let us believe that honesty creates strength, and in so believing let us dare to fulfill our duties as we understand them--until the end."</p>
   <p>The speaker reminded the audience that the following day, February 12, was Lincoln's birthday. He explained the duties of Lithuanian-Americans, as citizens of the United States and as sons of our fatherland, Lithuania.</p>
   <p>After the program dancing was enjoyed. Although the attendance would have been much larger if the weather had been more favorable a fairly large profit is expected from the affair.</p>
   <p>This concert was sponsored by more than fifty Chicago Lithuanian organizations, all members of the Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, which was formed the latter part of last year for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania. The proceeds from this affair will go for Lithuanian war relief.</p>
   <p>All participants in the program donated their time and their talents. Many Chicago merchants, in support of the humanitarian purpose of the concert, donated one or two dollars so that their names might appear on the printed program of the concert.</p>
