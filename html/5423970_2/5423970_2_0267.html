   <p>The Birute Society will give its second performance of this season on February 6. For the first time in Chicago the humorous operetta, "The Bewitched Duke," will be presented.</p>
   <p>Chicago Lithuanians have not yet forgotten the first Birute concert of this season, one of the best that they have ever heard. Now this second performance, the operetta, as much as we can judge from the preparations being made for it by the Birute artists, will be a great surprise to the public. At this performance entirely new decorative scenery and new songs will be used, and the artists have received first class training from Mr. A. Vitkauskas.</p>
   <p>The performance will be given at St. George's Hall, Bridgeport, at 7 P. M. After the operetta, there will be dancing.</p>
