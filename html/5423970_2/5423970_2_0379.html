   <p>Last Sunday at Pulaski Hall, the Lithuanian actors under direction of A. Vitkauskas, presented the drama "Genevieve," already well known to the Lithuanian public.</p>
   <p>This spectacle is well known to many Lithuanians, but when they saw its presentation that evening, they were hardly able to recognize it. Not only the scenery, but also the spirit of the drama was entirely changed when these excellent actors were selected to perform it under the supervision and the stage management of A. Vitkauskas.</p>
   <p>There is no need to go into a criticism of the individual actors. They have been very well known to us for the past several years, and we have spent several pleasant evenings watching their presentation of spectacles. But at this time, it is necessary to mention the new theatrical star which we had opportunity of witnessing for the first time. I am speaking about Mr. A. Vitkauskas, who not only was the stage manager, but also played the important role of Gol.</p>

   <p>The theatrical ability of professional actors can be criticized only by an actor. Therefore, as to "criticism," we have nothing to say. The only thing we can say, however, is what impression we received in seeing this play. On that point we can say very briefly that Chicago Lithuanians for the first time have seen an artist in the full sense of the word. Mr. Vitkauskas right at the start took the audience with him, and throughout the play, he kept them with him to the very end. The audience forgot about itself and re-lived the lives of the personages of the drama. It was noticed that in the impressive parts of the play the public was moved to tears.</p>
   <p>The attendance was so great that--as the saying goes--even the walls bulged, and there was not a single vacant seat. How satisfied was the audience? We heard nothing but: "Well, brother, this a real theater!", "I would not be sorry to throw in five dollars for that," and "When will this play be presented again? I will bring everybody from my house."</p>
   <p>Bravo, Vitkauskas! Bravo, Chicago Lithuanian actors! Give us more of such performances!</p>
