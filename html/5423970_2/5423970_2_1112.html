   <p>Honorable Editor:</p>
   <p>Please mail your newspaper Lietuva to all enclosed addresses of my friends. Up to this time I did not care to read your paper because there was nothing to read. But when I noticed in number 11 of your paper an article exposing the long-skirted priest, all of us were glad that we have a paper that does not fear to tell the truth. Up to this time we had no paper that would tell the truth about the priests.</p>
   <p>If you need financial help to publish your paper let us know. We will gladly help you.</p>
   <p>We are asking you, will you keep on fighting the swindlers and priests.Will you not turn against us. If you will go on with your fight, you will do a great work, you will uplift Lithuanians not only in Chicago but in all America, and with such a paper you will help our mother country Lithuania. We are promising to you that we will get a few hundred new readers for your paper.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>W. Simanaviezia</p>
