   <p>The first meeting of Chicago Lithuanian newspaper correspondents was held, Feb. 14, at the Vilnis Hall, 3116 So. Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>Long discussions took place at the meeting on how to gather news, and how to prepare it properly for publication. Rules for the proper preparation of news articles were adopted at the meeting. It was decided that correspondents should write more often, write briefly, and cover all news.</p>
   <p>This conference of the Chicago Lithuanian news correspondents is a wonderful idea. Similar conferences should be held in all other Lithuanian colonies in America.</p>
