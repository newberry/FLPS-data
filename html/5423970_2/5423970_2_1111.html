   <p>At the beginning this paper was very weak because the first publishers were unable to agree on the motives of this paper. The paper was on the verge of death.</p>
   <p>So we decided to resurrect this paper, to put the paper on a new basis. This paper will uphold the Catholic principles. We will break the horns of layman and of priest if they go wrong. We will not be afraid to tell the truth.</p>
   <p>If anybody will have big horns, we will break them and give canes in the place of horns, so that they can walk better.</p>
   <p>We are asking all of the Chicago Lithuanians to help us to go on with our newspaper.</p>
