   <p>The twentieth anniversary of the Simanas Daukantas Society was held last Sunday at St. George's parish hall, Bridgeport. The anniversary was held jointly with the Birute and the Drama Societies. The Drama Society's artists performed very well the three-act comedy "The Living Corpse". The Birute Choir, directed by Mr. Anthony Pocius, sang many beautiful songs, and the public was very much pleased with the excellent singing. As to the musical program, by the Lietuva Band under direction of Mr. Sarpalius, we can say that it was excellent.</p>
   <p>The culminating part of this anniversary program was the awarding to merit members of gold rings with the picture of Simonas Daukantas in the matrix. To the stage were called the veteran members of the society: A. Olszewski, publisher of Lietuva; P. Jonaitis, J. Palinionis, J. Baukus, J. Bacevicia, J. Zymantis and M. J. Damijonaitis; and each one of them gave a short talk. The anniversary made a pleasant impression on the public, and we hope that this society will reach its silver jubilee.</p>
