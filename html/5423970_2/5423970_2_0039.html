   <p>The bank of John Tananevicius was closed last Tuesday. Judge Landis ordered the bank closed, and appointed the Central Trust Company as receivers. The bank's security was threatened about two weeks ago, when some enemies of Mr. Tananevicius distributed unfavorable leaflets in the neighborhood as an act of revenge. A run on the bank that followed brought about its closing.</p>
   <p>Formerly, the English language press advertised that the assets of the bank are greater than the deposits. Now the press writes that the assets are less than the deposits. Some now say that when the assets (buildings and lots) of the bank are converted into cash, the depositors will be paid in full or nearly in full. However, some speak differently. The exact standing and true picture of the bank will be revealed later by the receivers.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The bank of John Tananevicius was located in the Katalikas building, where the newspaper Katalikas (The Catholic) was published, at 33rd and Morgan Streets].</p>
