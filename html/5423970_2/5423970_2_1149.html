   <p>The first number of the new monthly magazine Lietuviu Zurnalas has made its appearance. P. M. Kaitis is the publisher. The introductory article, "To the Reader", stresses why the magazine is being published:</p>
   <p>"We devote our periodical not to the intelligentsia, but to the workers--that class of society which does not have the opportunity to enlighten itself by any other means than by newspapers and books. Our readers will be mostly workers; therefore, workers' problems, the workers' welfare will always find a place with us."</p>
