   <p>A new mutual aid society has just been organized; it is to be known as the Chicago Lithuanian Mutual Benefit Association. Every Lithuanian, who speaks Lithuanian, who is healthy in body and mind, between 16 and 40 years of age, is eligible for membership.</p>
   <p>The membership body of the new society will be divided into two classes: Those who pay 50 cents per month will receive a weekly sick benefit of $10.00; those who pay 25 cents per month will receive a weekly sick benefit of $5.00. The society will be affiliated with the Lithuanian Alliance of America in order that the members may receive a death benefit. Members who will travel or move to other cities in the United States will receive permits and will be entitled to both sick and death benefits.</p>
   <p>Besides the sick and death benefits to members the Association will <span class="page-break">\2</span>assist in promoting the educational uplift of the Lithuanian people; a Lithuanian-American public library will be established and maintained by the Association.</p>
   <p>All those who wish to join this society are invited to come to the next meeting of the A sociation, which will take place on Saturday evening, March 20, at P. Balkis Hall, 823 N. Marshfield Avenue. During this meeting the initiation fee for all new members will be only $1.00.</p>
   <p>Address all communications to the Association to the secretary, Julius Mickevicius, 18 Ellen Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This Association is now known as the Chicago Lithuanian Society, and is the largest Lithuanian mutual aid society in Chicago; it has close to 6,000 members.]</p>
