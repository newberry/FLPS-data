   <p>Citizenship classes for Lithuanians, designed to aid them in obtaining citizenship papers, will soon be started at Fellowship House, 831 W. 33rd Place. There will be English language classes besides the citizenship classes. The language classes are free, but a small fee will be charged for the citizenship course. The classes will be divided into two groups: those who want their second papers and those who do not yet have their first papers.</p>
