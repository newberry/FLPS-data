   <p>Last Sunday Dr. Szliupas came to Chicago from Scranton, Pa. At a few meetings he delivered short lectures on Lithuanian history, explained the hardships and causes of it. He urged us to have unity, brotherly love, and the importance of getting enlightened by reading good books and newspapers.</p>
   <p>Almost all the Lithuanians in America are working people, so Dr. Szliupas urged them, in order to improve their living conditions, to join labor organizations. In unity there is strength. Organized labor can overthrow capitalism and take control of the government. The doctor said that not only the capitalists are against the improvement of labor's living conditions, but the clergy, who controlling the peoples' mind are forbidding the people to get enlightenment. Dr. Szliupas is advertised as an infidel, and that he wants to destroy the present form of government.</p>

   <p>Nevertheless, many people came to hear his lectures, and the doctor never advocated the overthrow of the government. All the Lithuanians at the meetings were in good order, there were no disturbances. Honor to Lithuanians for such good conduct.</p>
