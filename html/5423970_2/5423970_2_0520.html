   <p>The Lithuanian Youth Circle from Town of Lake presented Schiller's "Maid of Orleans" at the St. George Parish Hall in Bridgeport, November 6. This play was being presented on the Lithuanian stage for the first time. It is a long play, difficult to be acted out. The acting, for amateurs, was not bad, though of course artistry was not reached by far. It was apparent that the Youth Circle had put much work into the presentation and had prepared for it as well as it could. The order on the stage was not bad: the actors knew their roles well and had managed to obtain suitable costumes.</p>
   <p>The presentation did not appear bad, especially since much had not been expected of it in view of a recent, unsuccessfully presented, easier play.</p>
   <p>The more important actors were suitably chosen and were not badly trained. They were: Dunduliene, "Maid of Orleans"; Stryneckis, the French King; Zolp, "Dunois"; H. Mockus, "Chatillon"; Cestautas, "Phillip the Good," and others. Dunduliene, in the heaviest role, was the best. Good performances <span class="page-break">\2</span>were given by Stryneckis, Gestautas, Zolp, Mockus, Dobilas, Berzinskaite, and several others. Ragauskas, Dauksa, and a few others in minor roles were poor as actors. Laurinaiciuke was also quite weak in her acting. Some of them used very poor Lithuanian, which should be strictly avoided on the stage because it makes a bad impression. The actors must use the purest Lithuanian language. It is not necessary to sift the play in detail.....</p>
