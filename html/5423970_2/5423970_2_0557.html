   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Lithuanian Socialist League successfully staged the drama, "Alkani Zmones" (Hungry People), on Sunday November 7, at the Hull House Theater, Polk and Halsted Streets. A capacity crowd attended.</p>
   <p>This is a very good drama, and it may be boldly stated that it is one of the best plays written in the Lithuanian language. It very competently depicts hungry people and the reasons for their hunger. The scene of the play is a small town in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The most important characters of the play are as follows: "Ambrozas" (B. Vaitekunas), a cobbler; "Marcele" (Miss M. Pakas), the cobbler's wife; "Agnieska" (Miss K. Makas), the cobbler's daughter; and "Birutis" (J. Briedis), a roomer in the cobbler's home.</p>
   
   <p>Ambrozas is a confirmed drunkard, and drunkenness is one reason why some people go hungry. Birutis is a mental and physical wreck, a victim of the existing social order, which he despises. "He cannot find employment, because he cannot stand having a boss over him." Agnieska is employed in a laundry at five rubles per month; she is frail, weak, and hungry. Later, she is forced to become a prostitute in order to make ends meet. In this connection Birutis states that "prostitution will exist as long as the present social order exists."</p>
   <p>In one scene, the landlord snatches an overcoat from Ambrozas as payment for back rent. Later, the whole family, together with all its belongings, is driven out into the snow for failure to pay the rent.</p>
   <p>The abuses of the existing social order finally induce Birutis and Agnieska to commit suicide, while Marcele is driven insane.</p>
