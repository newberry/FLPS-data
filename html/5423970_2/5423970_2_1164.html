   <p>p.2....Aldona was one of the most tragic figures of Lithuanian medieval history. As a young princess Aldona, the daughter of the Grand Duke Gediminas, was married off to the Polish king "Casimir the Great and Saint" surnamed "King of the Peasants." The union had presumably a political purpose, but remained without any political consequences.</p>
   <p>Although Aldona was converted to the Christian faith and assumed the title, Queen of Poland, becoming known as Anna Aldona, she was never able to feel at home in Poland. To the last day of her life she clung to Lithuanian customs, music, songs and sports. Always surrounding herself with beloved compatriots. She loved horse-back riding and hunting, but church ceremonies and the pomp of the court were distasteful to her. The Polish clergy doubted her Christianity, and, doubting, they hated her. There was probably no <span class="page-break">\2</span>Lithuanian princess who was more Lithuanian minded, and who adhered to Lithuanian customs as much as Anna Aldona. To add to the misery of her lot, the king proved to be a most licentious person. The king, besides enjoying the affections of his beautiful Jewish mistress, Esterka, through whose influence many privileges were granted to the Jews, had many other affairs, one of which stands out above the rest, due to its tragedy.</p>
   <p>Accompanied by beautiful Aldona, Casimir, on one of his visits to his sister, Queen Elizabeth, of Hungary, seduced, with the aid of Elizabeth, an innocent maiden, Clara Von Zach, the daughter of a court official. The father, incensed at this treatment of his daughter, sought to avenge her and broke into the chamber wounding the king and Aldona. Von Zach was slain and upon all members of his family, a terrible judgment was passed. Clara the misued girl, was further mutilated and hounded to her death as a beast. King Casimir the Great, in regard to vices, actually surpassed King Henry VIII of England, and caused suffering to other women <span class="page-break">\3</span>who happened to catch his fancy. Others who shared a similar fate, some even more unfortunate than that of Aldona, were Margereth of Bavaria, Adelheid Von Hesse, Christina Roszan, and Hedwig, Duchess of Sagan.</p>
   <p>Having to suffer a life with a man like Casimer for a spouse, coupled with her great love and longing for her dear Lithuania, were the causes of Anna Aldona's untimely death.</p>
   <p>At our present time, many Lithuanian girls are named Aldona, and everyone bearing that name should be proud. Our hearts, like hers, should be filled with that great love for Lithuanian love, song, the land itself and its people.</p>
   <p>We Lithuanians, must make every effort to publish the History of the Lithuanian nation in the English language.</p>
   <p>The history of the Lithuanian nation in the English language is indispensible to the cultural progress of our children. It is our duty to acquaint our children with our famous history and its glory. We must show to our children <span class="page-break">\4</span>the difference between Poles and Lithuanians, we must show them that the Lithuanians are peace loving people, that the Poles are war-like people and tyrants.</p>
   <p>We cannot forget the persecution of our people by the Poles, and our children should know these true historical facts. Our children should know that we do not desire any union with Poland and will not enter any such union as long as the nation exists. We do not want to be called Polacks, because we are not Polacks. We are not a Slavic race, we are members of Inda European race - and two races cannot unite under no circumstances.</p>
   <p>We love our liberty and independence and we desire peace with the rest of the world.</p>
