   <p>The following were elected as officers of the conference: J. M. Tananevičius, president; J. Viskoska, and K. Jurgelionis, secretaries.</p>
   <p>The question of discussing by-laws, a project which had been put off until this meeting, was postponed to the end of the conference. A discussion of various problems followed, in the following sequence:</p>
   <p>1. It was decided that, to put our scientific and technical terminology in order, the newspapers would use the international terminology, after making it suitable to the Lithuanian language. To put in order the American-Lithuanian terminology (names of institutions, officials, and the political field) a special committee was elected, including Dr. J. Šliupas, L. Šernas, and K. Jurgelionis (with Šliupas acting as the responsible committee chairman)....</p>

   <p>2. The matter of miraculous doctors and misleading advertising. The thought was expressed that the most successful way of abolishing these advertisements would be: a) to have the government forbid the printing of such advertisements, and b) to strive as much as possible to explain to the people, more often, that they should not believe such advertisements. Since the National American Medical Association is at present working on both these suggestions and since the Lithuanian doctors have already made a beginning in organizing a branch of that Association with their Lithuanian Doctors Alliance, this matter was relegated to our doctors' organization. The newspapers promise to aid them and print their articles in reference to this matter.</p>
   <p>3. The desire that all newspapers and publishing houses would exchange copies of their publications was expressed.</p>
   <p>4. Problems regarding enlightenment.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>5. Statistical matters.</p>
   <p>The members of the Statistics Committee, K. V. Račkauskas, with a written report, and J. O. Širvydas, verbally, announced that they had collected much material from various sources in their effort to put in order the statistics regarding Lithuanians and their activities in America but that it is insufficient as yet and, therefore, too early to be compiled. K. Jurgelionis also announced that he had collected much statistical material for the proposed encyclopedia, which could be used in compiling the statistical reports.....</p>
   <p>6. The centralization of various organizations.</p>
   <p>7. It was decided that the officers of the Press Society continue their efforts to draw to this newspapermen's organization those newspapers which, up to the present time, have not belonged to it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>8. Problems of the theater.</p>
   <p>Since the presentation of theatrical plays is a large influence in educating the people, it is desirable that our newspapers turn as much attention as they can to theatrical matters. It is advisable that the lovers of the stage associate themselves with the Teatras, a periodical devoted to theatrical matters, in which better theatrical plays could appear. In the meantime, a special committee was elected to make up a list of all the better plays which it would be advisable to present on the stage and to publish that list in the newspapers. J. D. Širvydas and K. Jurgelionis were elected to the committee.</p>
   <p>9. The establishment of evening schools.</p>
   <p>The meeting advises the newspapers to explain to the people from time to time, and especially in the fall, how they can secure such schools from the city government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>10. On the matter of temperance.</p>
   <p>The newspapers are in accord with the propagation of temperance and express the desire that the Lithuanian doctors help the newspapers in this matter by the preparation of suitable articles.</p>
   <p>11. The conference is in accord with the movement that Lithuanians settling here concern themselves with procuring citizenship papers and that they participate in the political activity of this country.</p>
   <p>12. The question being raised as to how much the Lithuanian newspapers should concern themselves with this country's politics, it was decided that the newspapers, each according to its convictions, should concern themselves with politics as much as space permits.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>13. The opinion was expressed that it is desirable to support Lithuanian commerce and industry and to urge and accustom Lithuanians to them as much as possible.</p>
   <p>14. It is advisable to support the learning of trades and to explain their benefits to the people.</p>
   <p>15. For elevating and caring for our literature and authors, it is desirable that Lithuanian writers would join into one organization, which would be similar to a section of the Press Society.</p>
   <p>16. The meeting expressed the general opinion that it is advisable to support a Lithuanian colonization movement if such a colonization plan is conducted honestly by conscientious individuals.....</p>
   <p>17. The conference happily observed that the desire expressed at the last newspapermen's conference in regard to organizing Lithuanian students is <span class="page-break">9</span>being at least partially fulfilled.....</p>
   <p>20. The question of a Central Library.</p>
   <p>It is desirable that a place be found where there could be stored all the newspapers, writings, books, and publications--not only in the Lithuanian but also in other languages--which in one way or another concern the Lithuanian nation and life. In other words, to found a Lituanica Library which could be used by Lithuanian-American writers, researchers, etc. The founding of a Lituanica in Lithuania is inaccessible to Lithuanian-Americans.....</p>
