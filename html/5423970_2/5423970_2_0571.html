   <p>Theatrical activities among Chicago Lithuanians have become so popular that every week there is at least one or two stage presentations. However, criticisms of the plays, actors, and actresses seldom appear in our newspapers. We have quite a number of able critics and writers. Apparently they depend too much upon one another to write to our newspapers; they appear to possess the spirit of that old proverb: "Let George do it."</p>
   <p>The local and only recently organized Birute Music and Dramatic Society presented for the Chicago Lithuanian colony a very interesting theatrical and musical program on February 21 at the University Settlement Hall, in the Town of Lake. The society staged two plays: "Daktaro Kabinete" (In the Doctor's Cabinet), a one-act comedy; and "He Sau Emones" (Unselfish People), which is a one-act drama taken from "Vidunas' Prabociu Seseliai" (Shadows of Ancestors).</p>
   <p>The musical program consisted of a duet on the piano and violin, and songs <span class="page-break">2</span>by the Birute choral group. However, the entire program was not as successful as expected and promised.</p>
   <p>The first play to be staged was "Daktaro Kabinete." This is a highly entertaining comedy and not very difficult to present. However, the voice of J. Sutkus, who acted the important role of the doctor, was too weak. M. Cinikas and Miss P. Mazaris, who acted the roles of the peasant and his wife, played their parts in a lively and natural manner. However, their voices were also a little too weak. The performances of B. Vaitekunas, who played the role of the baron, and A. Eacharas, who played the role of the patient, were very satisfactory.</p>
   <p>The drama "He Sau Emones" is a play of deep thoughts. Like all dramas, it can be successfully staged only by full-fledged dramatic artists. It is very difficult for amateur artists to make the audience feel and understand the full significance of a drama. It was very evident that the artists of "Ne Sau Emones" lacked the required ability to successfully present the play.</p>

   <p>During the progress of the play the audience laughed where it should have wept. There is nothing comical about the play. because it is a presentation of the sorrows and misery of Prussian Lithuanians during the eighteenth century. The actors and actresses not only lacked ability, but their voices were too weak. It was impossible to hear the dialogue beyond the fifth row. Even shouts of "louder" were made several times by the people in the audience. "Mykolas," the young feudal slave, spoke more clearly than the others. However, he failed to incorporate into his words the required intense feeling when, while his mother lay dying in bed, the feudal lord arrived to entice his fiancee "Aliuta." During this moment "Mykolas" expressed his anger only by pulling his own hair and by biting his own fingers. Such action appeared to be out of place and created laughter among the audience. Mr. Ilgaudas, who played the part of "Nykolas," does not possess the required ability to be a good actor.</p>
