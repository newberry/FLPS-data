   <p>A number of predictions were made in our press to the effect that the Pazvalga (The Review), which was established two months ago to replace the Laisvoji Mintis (Free Thought), will not be continued. So far, only one number of the Pazvalga has appeared.</p>
   <p>We have conducted an inquiry and learned from reliable sources that the above-mentioned predictions are true; the Pazvalga will not be continued. It appears that there is discord among the members of the Lithuanian Publishing Company which was organized to issue the Pazvalga.</p>
   <p>Details about this matter were published in the July 16 issue of the Lietuva.</p>
