   <p>The Simonas Daukantas Society will hold a celebration of the birthday of Simonas Daukantas and the 10th anniversary of the existence of the society, on Sunday, Oct. 25, at Freiheit Hall, 3417 S. Halsted St.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we are asking all the other societies not to have their banquets nor theatrical performances on that day. The Simonas Society invites all good Lithuanians to join this society. By belonging to it you have a double benefit. This society pays the same sick benefit as other societies, but it has its library. The members can get free books to read, while all other societies have no such library.</p>
