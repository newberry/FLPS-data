   <p>Last Sunday evening, at the International Theatre, the Birute Singing and Dramatic Society, which was organized. last year by Mikas Petrauskas, successfully staged "Birute," a two-act melodrama dealing with Lithuanian life in the fourteenth century. The play was written by A. Zemkalnis, and the music by Mikas Petrauskas.</p>
   <p>We will not write about the story and plot of "Birute" (the name of a Lithuanian duchess in the foureenth century), because it is familiar to all Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>The leading roles of the drama were played by the following Lithuanian artists: Birute, by Miss M. Odeikis; Grand Duke Keistutis, by Mr. Vitkus; Lizdeika, the high priest, by Mr. Zacharas.</p>
   
   <p>We can say without reservations that our young theatrical artists, many of whom were acting for the first time, rendered a very satisfactory performance. The audience appeared to be highly pleased with the entire performance, especially with the Lithuanian songs. The song "Oi Tu Jieva" received three encores.</p>
   <p>There is room for improvement in our theatrical presentations, of course, but that is sure to come after a little more experience. We should make theatrical efforts more frequently and on a larger scale. Judging by the way our latest presentation was received, it appears that our future efforts are assured of favorable reception by the Lithuanian public of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The "Birute" performance attracted a capacity crowd. A number of non-Lithuanians, Germans, French, and Americans, also attended. They showed great interest in Lithuanian melodies.</p>
