   <p>We Lithuanians should disregard lowbred enemies among us and without exception support cultural institutions and the honored delegates, Dr. J. Basanavicius and M. Ycas, who came to this country to collect money for the Lithuanian Science building of Vilnius [Vilna]. Since some of the Lithuanian socialist newspapers have poured out their insinuating propaganda against the honored delegates, we, the Lithuanian Lovers of the Motherland Society, branch 28, of Chicago, at our meeting have drawn up a resolution of protest against the newspapers Laisve (Liberty) and Kova (Struggle) and their groundless insinuations upon these two honored delegates of the Lithuanan Science Society of Vilna.</p>
   <p>J. Biezis, president</p>
   <p>Miss K. Kaupaite, secretary</p>
   <p>R. Zaura, treasurer.</p>
