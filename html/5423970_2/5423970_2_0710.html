   <p>The Simonas Daukantas Society held its meeting on January 6, 1901, and decided to have Lietuva as the organ of the society for the coming year. Therefore, all the members must pay the yearly subscription to the organ before the next meeting, which will be held on March 3.</p>
   <p>The society also decided to buy more books for the library. At the library are held the meetings of the society (3301 S. Morgan St.) Every member of the society obtains free permission to read books; non-members pay 5 cents weekly for reading the books of our library.</p>
