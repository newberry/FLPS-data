   <p>April 27, at the West Pullman Turner Hall, the Lithuanian Scenic and Musical Circle, for the benefit of the Aurora library, presented a one-act drama, "The Thief" by Upton Sinclair, translated into Lithuanian by K. Valys. The players were good. The production was beautiful.</p>
   <p>After the performance there were declamations and songs. The "Aidas" (Echo) Choir, directed by Mr. J. Jakaitis, sang several beautiful songs.</p>
   <p>The audience crowded the hall.</p>
   <p>The profit from this evening will be given to the Aurora School and Library in Roseland. The Lithuanian public of West Pullman is sympathetic to enlightenment and cultural activity. A few enemies of culture worked against this cultural evening, but the majority of Lithuanians support our aims.</p>
