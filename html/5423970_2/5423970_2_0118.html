   <p>On October 25 the second meeting of the newly organized Lithuanian Arts Club was held at the residence of Vytautas Beliajus, the organizer. The purposes of the organization have been defined, and they are: 1) To keep Lithuanian artists united as a Lithuanian group; 2) To encourage the artistic talent of young Lithuanians; 3) To make Lithuanians in general art-conscious so that they shall be able to appreciate the fine arts; 4) To have well-known speakers and lecturers deliver discourses on great artists or criticisms of various famous or notorious works of art; 5) To attend current art exhibits and discuss their merits; 6) To offer occasionally a constructive art class for the members, with living models; 7) To give constructive criticism to members on their work; and 8) To sponsor annual art exhibits.</p>
   <p>Temporary officers were elected as follows. Vytautas Beliajus, president; John Maurius, vice-president; Bernice Balickas, secretary; and A. Mosgeris, treasurer. The other charter members are: Anthony Skupas, an art instructor and a graduate of the Chicago Art Institute, who studied abroad after winning <span class="page-break">2</span>a money award for the excellence of his work; Mikas Sileikis, Art Institute graduate and well-known Lithuanian-American professional artist; and Edward Smotelis, a youthful and talented artist. These three were awarded prizes at the art exhibit sponsored by the Lithuanian Youth Society last summer at Mandel Brothers' department store; Oscar Gross, prominent art critic, [acted as judge]. Mr. Skupas received a prize for the best group of pictures, Mr. Sileikis received the award for the best individual picture among the professionals, and Mr. Smotelis received second prize for his water colors. Other members are Anthony Yuknis, a well-known cartoonist for a current comic magazine and the creator of Jack Doolittle; Alex Gerches, a commercial artist of note; Anthony Gedroic, whose unusual wood carvings at the above-mentioned exhibit created a stir of admiration for his type of work; and Mr. Liutkevicius, whose works depicting scenes in Lithuania are reminiscent of the handiwork of the great masters. The next meeting will be held on November 8 at the residence of Vytautas Beliajus, 5657 South Sangamon Street, at 1:30 P. M. A fitting name for the organization will be selected. The selection will be in the form of a contest. The name selected among those <span class="page-break">3</span>submitted will earn for the submitter free initiation into the organization; that means a dollar saved, and he will be the kumas (godfather) of the Club.</p>
