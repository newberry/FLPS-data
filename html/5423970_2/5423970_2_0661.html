   <p>We, Lithuanians in America, in the past, had had many propositions, but not one of them was fulfilled. Now we are talking and writing about the coming exhibition in Paris. We Lithuanians should have our own Lithuanian section, where we could exhibit our publications. We ought to print a small book in either English, French or the German language. In that book we should expose the horrible oppression and the persecution of Lithuanians in Lithuania by the Russian government for reading Lithuanian newspapers and books.</p>
   <p>It would be best if Lithuanians in every city in America would elect a committee to collect money to cover the expenses of shipping newspapers, books, etc., to the Paris exhibition. A group of Lithuanian students from Switzerland appealed to the American Lithuanians for help in establishing the Lithuanian exhibition in Paris.</p>
