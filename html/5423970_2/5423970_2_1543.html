   <p>The 4th chapter of the Students' Loan Circle gave a lecture on the history of slavery on December 5 in the University Settlement hall, Noble Street and Augusta Boulevard. The lecture was delivered by Mr. J. P. Varkala.</p>
   <p>The lecturer described how our forefathers suffered during the period of slavery. He stated that today we live on that very same ground which is stained with the blood of slaves. He explained in detail the various forms of slavery that had existed in all parts of the world, and where it exists to this day. He declared that former political slavery has now changed to industrial slavery.</p>
   <p>The public was well pleased with this interesting lecture. It would be a good idea if the Students' Loan Circle would sponsor such lectures more often.</p>
