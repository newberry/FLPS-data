   <p>Last Sunday our rector cursed and denounced the annual celebration given by the Simonas Daukantas Society in honor of its great patron and Lithuanian patriot. The priest said that the celebration is for the purpose of spreading infidelity. To say that a national festival is for the sake of infidelism absurd and the Rev. Krawczunas has no grounds to prove his statement. When no one wants to fight against the priest, then the priest takes up a fight against those who are working for the benefit of their nation. The saying is that "Not all the voices are going to God," so the Rev. Krawczunas' cursing will not reach God's ear.</p>
