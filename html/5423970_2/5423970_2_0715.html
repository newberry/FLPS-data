   <p>Last Monday there was a trial of Simonas Daukantas Society with Rev. Krawczunas, who seized the society's library, for which the priest now demands from the society $200. It was proved in the court that the society gave financial help to improve the hall, and that the priest approved the rights for the society to keep its library in the hall, and to hold meetings free of charge. The court found that the society should demand the money from the priest, but not the priest from the society, because the society gave money to improve the hall. The court decided that the priest had no rights to seize the society's property, and ordered the Rev. Krawczunas to return the library back to society. If the priest should refuse to return the books, then they must pay for the books and the court cost. We think that our priest was born under the wrong planet, because he has no success with his trials against us, Lietuva, and even against the society, and with such trials, the priest is losing his honor among the people and his parishioners.</p>
