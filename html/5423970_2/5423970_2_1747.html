   <p>The membership list of the largest Lithuanian organization in America, the Lithuanian Alliance of America, is rapidly increasing. Now that the winter months are here again, attendance at the various lodge meetings will rise sharply. This growing unity of our people will afford greater opportunities for intellectual and cultural development.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, very gratifying results can be achieved by making a special effort to popularize the books that have been published by the Lithuanian Alliance of America. A special effort should be made at all lodge meetings to sell these books. We must also take advantage of the fact that all members of the Alliance possess the privilege to purchase, at a fifty per cent discount, all books published by the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. The evenings are now much longer, the weather is getting colder and most of our people love to read.</p>
   <p>We must bear in mind that a fairly good education can be secured by reading good books. Our people are badly in need of intellectual development. We are paying a very high price for our backwardness; an ignorant person is highly susceptible to bad habits, such as drunkedness, and is an easy victim of all kinds of exploitation. It is our duty to work for the uplift of our nationality. If a conscientious effort is made, it should be an easy matter to sell some books to every member of the Alliance.</p>
