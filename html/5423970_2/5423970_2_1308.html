   <p>There was talk for a long time among our people in Cicero, Illinois, about the need for a school to teach our people how to read and write in the Lithuanian language. This was even suggested in newspaper articles from our colony. At last, such a school has been established. It was opened on September 30, in the local Lithuanian-American library. All those who are interested in attending this school are invited to come to the Cicero Lithuanian Public Library, 1500 South 48th Court.</p>
