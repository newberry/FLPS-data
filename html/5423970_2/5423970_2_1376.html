   <p>At last the Lithuanians of Chicago will have their own well organized evening school. Plans have been completed to open the school on Sept. 7, in St. George's Lithuanian Roman Catholic parochial school, which is located on the corner of 32nd Place and Auburn Avenue. It is believed that the school will remain open throughout the winter months. The school will be conducted by two talented and energetic Lithuanians, who are already well-known in the life of local Lithuanians: Casimir Gugis, a student at the Armour Institute of Technology, and J. Leveskis, who graduated with the highest degree from the School of Commerce at Valparaiso University.</p>
   <p>The following subjects will be taught in the school: Writing; the English language (reading, spelling, and grammar); arithmetic (elementary and advanced); geography; history; bookkeeping; commercial drawing; and other branches of learning. Classes will be held every evening, except Saturdays <span class="page-break">\2</span>and Sundays, from 7:30 to 9:30. The first evening, Sept. 7, will be devoted only to the enrollment of students. Therefore, every Lithuanian who desires to attend this school is advised to call at the school on the first evening to enroll and select a curriculum. Arrangements have also been made to accept students after the opening date.</p>
   <p>We believe that the establishment of this school will contribute a great deal to the educational and cultural uplift of the Lithuanians in the Bridgeport colony. We sincerely hope that the school will be attended by hundreds of Lithuanians of both sexes, because knowledge promotes tolerance, increases the earning power, and makes life more happy. We are sure that every Lithuanian will want to acquire the above mentioned fruits of an education.</p>
