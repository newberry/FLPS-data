   <p>A public stenographer's bureau has been opened in the office of the newspaper Lietuva. Many of our Lithuanians cannot write; some of them can write very little. Many Lithuanians come daily to our office demanding that letters be written for them, etc. In order to help those who cannot write, or those who want to write a neat letter, we have established such an office. This office will be open every Thursday evening from seven until nine o'clock. We have experienced stenographers and typists for that purpose. Each letter will be considered confidential.</p>
