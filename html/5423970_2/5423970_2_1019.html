   <p>In a recent issue (No. 43) of Draugas (Friend), [Translator's note: Draugas is a Catholic weekly newspaper in Chicago.], the "Health Section" was begun, which is being conducted by Dr. A. L. Graiciunas. This section consists of questions submitted by readers, and answers by Dr. Graiciunas. These questions and answers deal with everyday health problems. We must admit that such problems on health arise frequently among our people, yet they do not have proper answers for them. Answers and suggestions on such questions are proper, beneficial, and appropriate.</p>
   <p>Dr. Graiciunas says in his health column: "I shall be very happy to answer inquiries on problems of hygiene and sanitation, and also how to prevent illness, in this section of Draugas. But I will not make diagnoses, nor will I write prescriptions....."</p>
   
   <p>It is clear from that statement where the section of health will lead. Without doubt, because of health problems, we have felt the need for such a column to answer inquiries on this subject, for a long time. It appears to us that such a section of questions and answers on health problems, conducted every week in the newspaper by Dr. Graiciunas, is very essential to our people. Everything depends upon the doctor's ability. We believe that Dr. Graiciunas will succeed.</p>
