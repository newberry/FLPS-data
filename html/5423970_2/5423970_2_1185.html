   <p>The dramatic circle [of the Lithuanian Socialist League] has decided to publish some of the theatrical works of "Vargsas" (Brunius Laucevicius), who, at present, is very ill. His latest play is "The Cross". The story of this play is laid in the present European war situation. This theatrical work will be published by subscription; the price of this book will be fifty cents. For this reason this society has published an appeal, asking people to subscribe to this book. But one of their bad features is that they are inciting class warfare, "proletariat against intelligentsia". There are peculiar people among us, who cannot be without "class war," but by their fanaticism they obstruct their work for this good cause.</p>
   <p>Mail subscriptions for the above-stated literary work to Mr. P. Cereska, 1840 So. Halsted Street; money orders should be in the name of V. Paskauskas. Mr. B. Vargsas, we have learned, has had three operations, and his health is not improving. Therefore, help for him is very essential.</p>
