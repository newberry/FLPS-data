   <p>The Farmers of Lithuania Society, of the West Side colony, is planning to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Society next Sunday at Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and South Oakley Avenue. The program of the commemoration will consist mainly of musical numbers.</p>
   <p>The Society, which is a sick and death benefit society, has decided at a meeting held last Sunday to add a higher sick benefit table for the benefit of its members.</p>
   <p>The Farmers of Lithuania has shown that it is one of the most cultured Lithuanian-American societies in Chicago. It not only aided many Lithuanians in the hour of their greatest need, but has been very active in various Lithuanian activities in Chicago since its inception ten years ago. It is doubtful if any other Lithuanian society in Chicago has accomplished so much in the field of Lithuanian nationalism as did the Farmers of Lithuania Society.</p>
