   <p>Chicago Lithuanians have not forgotten Bruno Vargsas (Laucevicius), whose long illness, which started six months ago, has made his family destitute. Through the efforts of the Biruta Society a total of seventy-five dollars was collected for the relief of the family. Mr. B. Vaitekunas and Dr. K. Drangelis composed the committee which collected the money. The money has been given to Mr. Vargsas.</p>
   <p>The state of Mr. Vargsas' health is now very bad. He has had two operations, but without any favorable results. On Wednesday of this week he was removed from his home to St. Bernard Hospital for a third operation. His life depends upon the result of this operation.
