   <p>The Lithuanian Women's Handiwork Exhibit, sponsored by the Women's Enlightenment Society, began December 4 and ended December 10. It was an outstanding and interesting exhibit. So much handiwork had been sent in that there was not sufficient room for all. There were many works from Lithuania: towels, bedspreads, carpets, aprons, belts, and even a woven dress made by Mrs. Golabovske. There were also many sewed, knitted, and other articles made by the Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
