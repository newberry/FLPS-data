   <p>On June 28, Anthony Pocius and his wife, Ona, conducted a concert by the students of their school, the Beethoven Conservatory of Music. The concert was held at St. George's parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue. Both children and grownups participated in the program; there were about eight children, mostly girls, and sixteen adults.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of simple piano, violin, and vocal selections. All participants in the program gave excellent performances. The pianists and singers received bouquets.</p>
   <p>Of the children, Vytautas Briedis, a ten-year-old Lithuanian boy, made the best impression; he distinguished himself not so much by good technical delivery as by his courage and self-reliance. He gave the impression that he felt entirely at home, like an old trouper, as he played a number on the piano...He did not receive any flowers, but the great applause of the audience brought him out on the stage a second time; this is really worth more to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>him than any bouquet of flowers.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with a number of songs by a mixed chorus of sixteen singers under the direction of Mrs. Ona Pocius. The chorus sang Mikas Petrauskas' composition "Dega Ugnis" (The Fire Is Burning) and Rossini's aria "Inflammatus"; Miss Ona Rudauskas, a soprano, sang the solo. The chorus made a fine impression on the audience.</p>
   <p>After the program, Mr. Pocius, director of the Conservatory, distributed medals of distinction among the younger pupils of his school, which is located at 3259 South Halsted Street.</p>
