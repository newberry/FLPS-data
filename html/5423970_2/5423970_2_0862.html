   <p>The Lietuva has been published weekly for more than twenty-five years. During all that time the Lietuva has conscientiously and devotedly served the Lithuanians of America and has protected their interests. It has therefore earned the reputation of being one of the best Lithuanian newspapers.</p>
   <p>In a short time--no later than September of this year--the Lietuva daily is expected to be published. Then it will be able to serve the Lithuanian public six times more effectively than it has been able to do up to the present.</p>
   <p>The readers of the Lietuva have always been and are now satisfied with the newspaper. This newspaper always strives to give its readers honest news and to promote enlightenment among our people and protect them from exploitation.</p>
   
   <p>Let us take, as an example, the action of banning advertisements of quack doctors from the Lithuanian press. The Lietuva deserves the most gratitude today if these quacks are no longer skinning our people. The Lietuva was the first to ban their misleading advertisements and it continued to fight until the other Lithuanian newspapers banned them also.</p>
   <p>Only One Complaint</p>
   <p>The only complaint of the Lietuva's readers has been that this newspaper is published only once a week. Today the people want news daily because of the kind of period in which we are living. There are more changes in one day today than there used to be in several years.</p>
   <p>The war, revolutions, new inventions, political changes--all these are matters which interest the public every day. The future of Lithuania, the fight of the Lithuanians for Lithuania's independence, the freeing of Lithuania from foreign yokes, the peace conference, are all matters with which the Lithuanians are concerned and about which our people want as much news as they can get, as soon as they can get it. Only a good daily newspaper can give all this to the people.</p>
   <p>We Must Organize</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians themselves must become well-organized in order to attain all their aims. They must organize quickly. In times like these the Lithuanians must do more in one day then formerly they had to do in a whole year. In this work, one daily can do as much as six weeklies put together.</p>
   <p>We must catch up with other nations in progress; otherwise, even Lithuania's liberty will be too difficult a task for us to accomplish. Can we catch up with other nations when their progress is speeding along in automobiles (dailies), and ours is moving along slowly in wagons (weeklies)?</p>
   <p>There are thousands of reasons why we need to have good dailies, for a good daily is the best weapon with which to fight for any cause. Every more enlightened person realizes this; therefore we shall dwell no longer on this point. We shall explain how we plan to create this new daily.</p>
   <p>Why In Chicago?</p>
   <p>We have decided to publish the new daily in Chicago because Chicago has more Lithuanians than any other city--about seventy-five thousand in the city proper and that many more in the vicinity. This figure does not include the more distant colonies which the newspaper can reach within one day.</p>
   
   <p>Chicago is also the largest industrial and business center, Lithuanian as well as American. This is very important, for the newspaper can get more advertisements in Chicago than anywhere else, and advertisements not only help to cover the paper's expenses, but also bring it a profit.</p>
   <p>It is true that there are already two Lithuanian daily newspapers in Chicago, but this will not hinder us. We do not wish to criticize them, but we hear people saying almost daily that they prefer another kind of paper to the two they already have. We shall strive to make the Lietuva another kind of daily.</p>
   <p>Costs and Profit</p>
   <p>The expenses of publishing a daily are much larger than those of publishing a weekly. That is why the present Lietuva concern cannot hope to publish a daily by itself. More money is needed to cover the expenses.</p>
   <p>The organizational committee has estimated that it will cost about thirty thousand dollars a year, figuring on four thousand subscribers.</p>
   <p>These costs must be guaranteed. That is, there should be sufficient money to cover expenses for at least six months, so that the daily will not be forced to go out of business before it can start to make a profit.</p>
   <p>The committee has also estimated that four thousand subscriptions and enough advertisements will cover all the expenses. If there are more subscriptions and more advertisements, the daily will realize a profit. This will be distributed to the stockholders according to the number of shares of stock they hold.</p>
   
   <p>Twenty Thousand Is Necessary</p>
   <p>In order to start publishing the daily, it is necessary to have enough money to pay salaries to workers, to buy paper, etc., for at least six months. It is also necessary to buy a large press, without which it will be impossible to publish the daily. Therefore it has been decided that we must have twenty thousand dollars before we can start to publish the daily.</p>
   <p>Some people may point out that the other dailies began with only a few thousand dollars. This is true. But whoever starts in this manner must continue to go into debt, until it is impossible to repay creditors. The workers do not receive their wages on time, and the stockholders dare not even dream of receiving a profit from the money they invest. Even if there is a profit, it must be used in paying off debts and interest on debts.</p>
   
   <p>We do not plan to start such a business. We want to have everything clear and guaranteed. That will be better both for the workers and for the stockholders, who can expect dividends, or profits, from their investments.</p>
   <p>When it Will Be Published</p>
   <p>Publication of the daily will begin the first of September. All of the twenty thousand dollars must be raised by September 1, 1918. However, we shall strive to have that sum by August 1, 1918, in order that we can have enough time to prepare for the publication, to reorganize the editorial offices, to find more help, to set up the large press, etc.</p>
   <p>Therefore it is important that we strive to have all of the required sum by August 1, 1918. We are advertising this fact and are planning accordingly.</p>
   
   <p>Where the Funds Are Kept</p>
   <p>All of the money which is coming in for the daily is being put on deposit in the Universal State Bank, in Chicago. Neither the officials of the Lietuva nor anybody else can touch a cent of that money.</p>
   <p>This is being done so that the people will know that their money will not disappear and will not be used for any other purpose if, for some reason, we are not able to raise a sufficient sum of money before the date which has been set, and the daily cannot be published.</p>
   <p>The following agreement has been made with the bank in writing:</p>
   <p>1. The bank will issue a certificate to every person who buys shares, showing that he has bought so many shares from so-and-so, in such and such a newspaper.</p>
   
   <p>2. If twenty thousand dollars is thus placed on deposit before August 1, 1918, the bank will turn over the money to the corporation of the daily, and will send out stock certificates to all those who bought shares.</p>
   <p>3. If the whole sum is not placed on deposit by August 1, the bank will repay stockholders, upon demand, all the money for which they hold receipts.</p>
   <p>In this manner, as you can see, not one cent can be lost for used for any purpose but the daily.</p>
   <p>Beginning the Daily</p>
   <p>When all of the twenty thousand dollars has been raised, the new stockholders, through their committee, and the present owners of the Lietuva will hire</p>
   
   <p>experts again to estimate the value of the Lietuva property. The Lietuva will then turn over its property to the new daily.</p>
   <p>A meeting of the stockholders will decide how many directors there will be in the corporation, and will elect them. At the same meeting all other details, such as the price of subscriptions, the payment of dividends, etc., will be decided.</p>
   <p>The price of the stock is ten dollars a share. There is no limitation to the number of shares one person may buy.</p>
   <p>How You Can Help</p>
   <p>You can help in the preparations for the daily in the following ways:</p>
   
   <p>1. Buy shares yourself.</p>
   <p>2. Advise your friends and acquaintances to buy shares.</p>
   <p>3. At the meetings of your societies, tell about this daily and urge the members to buy shares.</p>
   <p>4. Organize a boosters' unit in your neighborhood to promote this work.</p>
   <p>5. Write to your friends about the daily and urge them to buy shares.</p>
   <p>Until the daily is organized, this organizational work will be carried on by a temporary committee of Chicagoans. It is called the "Organizational Committee for the Daily."</p>
   
   <p>If something still is not clear to you, you can receive further explanations by writing to the Committee.</p>
   <p>Send money and all letters pertaining to the matters of the daily to Lietuva Daily, 814 West 33rd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Publishing Company (publishers of the Lietuva) is now incorporated for twenty thousand dollars, according to the laws of the State of Illinois, but the basic capital of the corporation is being increased to forty thousand dollars.</p>
