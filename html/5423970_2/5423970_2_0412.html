   <p>Last Sunday the Birute Society opened its new season with the presentation of the four-act drama, "The Lithuanians," at Meldazis Hall. The selection of performers was a happy one, and, according to the verdict of the public, the play was well acted. As one old veteran of the stage expressed it, Birute could not have had a more successful opening. Several songs were added to the play and were sung by the Birute Chorus directed by A. Pocius. Two compositions by C. Sosnauskas, "Lek, Sakaleli" and "Karveleli Melynasis," were among the songs rendered.</p>
