   <p>This is the last edition of the weekly Lietuva; the next edition will be the first of the daily Lietuva.</p>
   <p>After the publication of this edition, the Lietuva press, editorial, and administrative offices will be moved. The new location is the former Tananevicius Bank Building, at the corner of 33rd and Morgan Streets. This is only two blocks from the present location.</p>
   <p>Effective today, all correspondence should be addressed to Lietuva Daily, 3253 South Morgan Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The moving and installation will take at least a week. Therefore, Lietuva will not be published next week. The first edition of the daily will be <span class="page-break">2</span>published on Monday, November 11.</p>
   <p>This interruption occurs at a very inconvenient time since there is important news every day. However, we are confident that the readers will understand the situation and will wait patiently a week to greet their new daily.</p>
