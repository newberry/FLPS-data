   <p>Respected Countrymen:</p>
   <p>We see what oppression endure our countrymen from strange nationalists, we see the literary darkness of our brothers, especially in places where the Lithuanians are living. It would be a great benefit to Lithuanians to ask them to subscribe to our weekly paper Lietuva, which is sponsoring the spiritual and educational idea among Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>We are asking those who are active among our countrymen to help us by writing on Lithuanian activities in your colony.</p>
   <p>For the payment of your written contributions to our paper, we will mail to your our weekly paper Lietuva free of charge.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Editor.</p>
