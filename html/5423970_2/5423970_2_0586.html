   <p>On August 30 the Chicago Dr. V. Kudirka Theatrical Society held its monthly meeting, at which it was decided to present a play entitled, "The Uncle Arrived." Although the society's membership is small, it accomplishes more than societies with larger memberships and larger capital.</p>
   <p>This is the second society (the Young American Pleasure Club being first) that donates money for national affairs. At this meeting it was decided to donate $2 to the Martyrs' Fund; $2 to the Aurora Society's Students' Fund; and $1 to the Writers' Fund (being collected for Vistalis, who is now sick in Brazil, South America). These are small donations, but as the society is not rich, it donates what it can.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Kudirka Society is to present theatrical performances and donate part of the profits to national institutions. Even though (I say it unwillingly) the number of Lithuanians in Chicago working for national welfare is very small, they have accomplished little outside of a few churches and palaces for the priests. We lack good workers. With some of the men it is possible to get somewhere, but women do not cooperate as it should be expected. Hardly can we find five Lithuanian women out of many thousands living in Chicago, who can understand anything about national matters.</p>
   <p>Dear women, it would be much better if you would free yourselves from superstition and awkwardness. You should begin reading books and enlightening your minds, and getting acquainted with the fact that you are human. It is desirable that young Lithuanian boys and girls with ability to play in theatrical roles, join the Kudirka Theatrical Society. Through an increased membership we can accomplish more in the field of national affairs, and be able to present better plays, such as comedies and dramas never before presented in Chicago.</p>
