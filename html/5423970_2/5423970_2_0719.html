   <p>In Chicago there is the so called scientific society under the name of Simonas Daukantas, and every year it holds a celebration with music and lectures in the memory of Simonas Daukantas. As in the past years, this year too, the society decided to have its annual celebration, but Rev. Krawczunas got scared that at such a meeting the parishioners might start to discuss the condition of the parish budget and the affairs of school. When the society's committee went to the priest to get his permission to use the parish hall for this annual celebration, the priest at once demanded to be shown the program and wanted to know who the speakers were going to be and that he would permit to have only such speakers as he wanted, while other speakers would be chased out. Then the society held its extra meeting, in order to elect the speakers by the majority vote. But on this meeting Rev. Krawczunas came with his followers. They started the clamor, cursing, shrieking, spitting, and set at variance against each other, shut off the lights, then the priest's servants started the fight, and the meeting was broken. Such was the end of the scientific society's annual celebration meeting. This is the fine moral propagator, that priest. In the next issue of our paper we will tell more about this meeting.</p>
