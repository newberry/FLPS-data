   <p>The Farmers of Lithuania Society gave a performance September 27, at Meldazis Hall. They presented a humorous one-act comedy "The Dearest Kiss." A little girl, K. Burduliute, gave a declamation. What the first actors were not able to succeed in doing, the Stepukas vaudeville (Mr. V. Brusokas) accomplished. At this time Stepukas tried to show himself as a magician, and he actually succeeded. The audience was satisfied with the program. After the program there was dancing and other amusements, such as the flying post office, Lithuanian amusement plays, etc.</p>
   <p>The attendance was large; the performance was successful.</p>
