   <p>Recently, it has not been clear to us--nor, undoubtedly, to many Lithuanian-Americans--just why the newspaper Draugas (The Friend) is being published. Until recently we believed that the Lithuanian priests established the Draugas for the purpose of answering criticism against them and their religion, and for the purpose of promoting Catholicism among Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, the Catholic religion forbids anyone to make assaults upon people, to break into their homes, and to destroy the tranquillity of a family. Such acts are forbidden not only by the Catholic religion, but also by the laws of all civilized countries and by common moral sense. A person who violates any of these laws by breaking into another person's home is called a burglar, a criminal, a hooligan, or some similar term.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>All violators of these laws are punished by governmental statues and denounced by the public.</p>
   <p>The most vicious kind of hooligan is the one who openly breaks into another person's home via the press by dragging the private life of a family before the public eye with the intent to ridicule, smear with mud, and defame an innocent housewife. All persons who indulge in such a practice must be placed in a class with criminals and other vicious characters that are strongly denounced by the intelligent public.</p>
   <p>The Draugas, which is said to be published by sixty-one Lithuanian Roman Catholic priests and several laymen, recently began to indulge in the above-mentioned practice. As far as we have been able to learn, the first effort of the Draugas in that direction was the publication of the article, "Auksine Plunksna" (Gold Fountain Pen). In that article many loathsome insinuations are made against Mr. S. P. Tananevicius, business manager of the newspaper Katalikas (The Catholic), because he, being a Catholic, publicly donated a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>gold fountain pen to Mr. Karolis Rackauskas, who is a non-Catholic but one of the best Lithuanian poets in the world. Although that article contained several painful insults of a private and personal nature, the author nevertheless adhered to at least some more or less sound logic.</p>
   <p>Encouraged by the apparent success of their first effort in the art of making personal attacks against individuals, the editors of the Draugas continued this nefarious practice in a more brazen manner. About two weeks ago the Draugas published an article entitled "Amerikos Jurgis Spurgis" (America's Jurgis Spurgis). [Translator's note: Jurgis Spurgis is the pen name of Mr. Bruno K. Balutis, who conducted column entitled "Kibirkstis" (Flashes) in the Lietuva under his pen name.] That article contains many lies and is a tirade against Mr. Jurgis Spurgis. In it the private family life--even the wife--of Mr. Jurgis Spurgis is dragged before the public eye for ridicule. However, the editors of the Draugas still lacked sufficient courage to mention the real name of the person they have slandered, and contented themselves merely with insinuations.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Last week, in another similar article, the editors of the Draugas went still further. This time they openly used the names of Karclis Rackauskas and Pius Grigaitis, editors of Lithuanian-American newspapers, and spilled a fairly large bucketful of dirty water on their heads. The comments made in that article are very absurd; no decent person would indulge in such nonsense, and no more or less respectable newspaper would publish such an article. Not only are the two above-mentioned persons ridiculed, but their wives are also dragged into the picture and ridiculed as much as possible. With amazing impudence and bestiality, the wife of Mr. Grigaitis is called a "Zydelka", given the name of "Bereleibka" and it is insinuated that "Anti-Christ" will probably be born from this "Zydelka". [Translator's note: The term "Zydelka" is an impolite way of referring to a Jewess in Lithuanian. Mr. Grigaitis' wife, however, is not a Jewess. I have been informed that the term "Bereleibke" is a combination of two popular Jewish first names, Bere and Leibke, and is employed when referring to a Jew with ridicule.] In our opinion, only a drunkard or insane person can indulge in such nonsense.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grigaitis is a member of a faction which is opposed to our ideals.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Nevertheless, we believe that he has as much right as any other person to insist that matters pertaining to his private family life must not be dragged before the public eye for the purpose of ridicule, and that such bestial jokes about his wife as we have noticed in the Draugas must not be made.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grigaitis is not the only person who was attacked in such a bestial manner by the editors of the Draugas. A number of other persons, all members of various Lithuanian-American factions, have also been attacked in this manner. However, none of these persons is a member of the camp of clericalism. [Translator's note: Clericals are priests and laymen who mix religion with worldly affairs.]</p>
   <p>Now that the editors of the Draugas have started to employ hooligan methods in their war against those who disagree with them, then every Lithuanian-American who does not profess the Kemesian [Translator's note: The doctrine of Reverend F. Kemesis, one of the leading Lithuanian Roman Catholic priests in America] religion is in danger of being defamed and slandered in the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>above-mentioned vicious manner. Now that the Draugas has adopted such a vicious policy, not even one person can be sure that in the next issue of the Draugas he, his wife, daughter, or any other person dear to him will not be defamed, slandered, and ridiculed. By observing how the Draugas has thus far "progressed," we can expect it to continue on the same road unless it is stopped in some way.</p>
   <p>In view of the above facts we hereby ask those sixty-one priests who are publishing the Draugas to explain the purpose for which the Draugas is being published: Is it being published for the purpose of defending and promoting Catholicism; is it being published in the interests of and in defense of priesthood; or is it being published for purpose of promoting hooliganism among Lithuanian-Americans? It would be very interesting to know with whom we are dealing. If that newspaper is being published to promote hooliganism among our people, then let the editors of the Draugas tell us so.</p>
