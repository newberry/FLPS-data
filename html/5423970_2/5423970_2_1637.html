   <p>The Dr. V. Kudirka Society held its annual meeting on Jan. 9, at Meldazis hall, to which an unusually large number of members attended. With Comrade J. Mikenas, the newly elected president, at the head of this meeting, the arrangement committee was the first to start by giving a report on the results of the annual New Year's entertainment of the society, the main feature of which was a comic operetta entitled "Maluninkas ir Kaminkretis" (The Wind-Mill Worker and the Chimney Sweeper), presented by members of the Kankliu Choras (Lithuanian Guitar Chorus). The committee reported that the play was well executed and pleased the audience immensely, and that since the hall had been filled to capacity, the society had made a large profit.</p>
   <p>As usual a membership campaign was conducted at the entertainment, where applicants were accepted without the usual initiation fee. The sixteen new members who had joined the society at the entertainment passed the necessary entrance requirements at the annual meeting.</p>

   <p>A decision was made at the meeting to give an informal banquet in the near future for members and friends of the society. This banquet not only will afford an opportunity for the members to get acquainted among themselves, but will also furnish entertainment and the enjoyment of an appetizing Lithuanian dinner. In addition to the arrangement committee, a culinary committee was also elected for the banquet. Members of the latter committee are famous for their "Blynai" (Lithuanian potato pancakes) and other Lithuanian dishes, so that all guests will surely enjoy the banquet.</p>
   <p>At this meeting a suggestion was made to increase the social activities of the society so as to increase its membership. Immigration from Lithuania being now practically at a standstill, it is very important to increase social activities in order to draw the younger generation of Lithuanian-Americans into the society. We must not forget that social activities are the best means for attracting our young people to our organization.</p>
