   <p>There is a sharp increase in Chicago in the practice of giving dinners and banquets which is obvious even among the progressive element. Every Saturday and Sunday, many of our comrades invite a group of friends to their homes for a dinner or banquet. Then in order to return the favor, the guests also give dinners and banquets. In such a manner the banquets continue to increase like a chain letter.</p>
   <p>The trouble with these banquets is, that our comrades forget everything else, even the most important labor meetings and functions.</p>
   
   <p>It is true that it is not a sin to give banquets. However, when they cause our comrades to forget everything else, then it is time to put a stop to it. We are having too many banquets.</p>
   <p>It is true that at some of these affairs our comrades remember to take up a collection for some good cause. However, this is not being done at all banquets. Many comrades are content with merely feasting and drinking.</p>
   <p>In my opinion, such banquets are entirely unnecessary for our progressive element. If all the money that is now being used for social affairs were donated to aid the labor movement, it would be spent in a much more intelligent manner, and would be of greater benefit to the working masses.</p>
