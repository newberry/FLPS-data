   <p>Chicago Lithuanians have been complaining for a long time that our theatrical performances are of inferior quality. The cause of our low theatrical standing can be easily explained by the fact that our theatrical artists are amateurs, who are engaged in other lines of work for a livelihood because they do not receive any remuneration for their theatrical efforts. Another reason for this situation is that we do not have a permanent and continuous theater of our own.</p>
   <p>Now is an opportune time to establish a daily Lithuanian vaudeville theater, with continuous Lithuanian theatrical performances. In order to realize this aim the co-operation of all theatrical artists and patrons is necessary.</p>
   <p>A meeting for the purpose of establishing a permanent Lithuanian theater in Chicago will take place on Saturday evening, May 8, at the Lithuania Theater, 3214 South Halsted Street. Members of all Lithuanian theatrical groups or clubs and other interested individuals are invited to attend.</p>
   <p>Ways and means for establishing a continuous Lithuanian vaudeville theater and matters pertaining to the interests of Lithuanian theatrical artists will be discussed at the meeting. Those who are unable to attend the meeting personally are invited to write letters, to be addressed to the Lithuanian Vaudeville Theater, 3252 South Halsted Street.</p>
