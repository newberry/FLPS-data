   <p>p.2. Recently three Lithuanians, J. Krause, P. Krause and Vaickus played on the winning LaSalle of Chicago Team in the Loyola University Basket-ball Tournament.</p>
   <p>Both of the Krause boys distinguished themselves in their play. Edward Krause made six baskets and forthwith became the hero of the evening.</p>
   <p>This victory carried with it several trophies.</p>
   <p>We are happy to congratulate these three Lithuanian boys and hope to hear of their further activities in the field of sport.</p>
   <p>The Krause boys' father is a member of American Lithuanian National Organization "Harmony," and therefore we hope these splendid athletes will soon join our young peoples group.</p>
