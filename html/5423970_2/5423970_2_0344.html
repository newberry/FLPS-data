   <p>The oil paintings of our artist Joseph Sileika are now on exhibition in the students' section of the art gallery in the Chicago Art Institute. Two of his paintings have received special commendation. Ten of his paintings are on exhibition, all of which are of the realistic school. His paintings are of medium grade. However, it is pleasant to note that even Lithuanian-Americans are entering the distinguished field of art. Mr. Sileika deserves praise for completing a course in the Chicago Art Institute without outside financial assistance; he managed to meet his expenses and tuition fees with his own earnings.</p>
