   <p>Last Sunday the Aurora Society sponsored lectures on emigration. The Aurora Society had received Attorney Leonas' report from Lithuania which concluded that emigration is detrimental to Lithuania, taking away her greatest resources thus diminishing the population.</p>
   <p>That was also the opinion, as we recall, of the Reverend Tumas and the artist, Zmuidzinavicius. Generally, the intelligentsia of Lithuania is striving as hard as it can to frighten Lithuanians from emigrating so that Lithuania's resources, especially in regards to the intelligentsia, could be strengthened. The local Lithuanians, it seems, do not altogether agree with this opinion of the European Lithuanians. The Aurora Society provided a suitable opponent for Mr. Leonas in the person of K. Jurgelionis. Mr. Jurgelionis pointed out with statistics that emigration is not harming Lithuania. The population of Lithuania, according to Mr. Jurgelionis, increases each year by 1.2 per cent (not including the emigrants), which is comparatively the same as in other countries.</p>
   <p>There was a large audience.</p>
