   <p>p.4...........Our announcement in the last issue of the Jaunimas about the Chicago Lithuanian Basket-Ball League met with unexpected interest on the part of leading Lithuanian teams from all over the city. The interest shown in this league proves that the young Lithuanians are willing and ready to make themselves known, but have had no one to champion their cause. Jaunimas is taking upon themselves this great responsibility of furthering the cause of our Lithuanians American youth in the field of sports. What response we will get from the older Lithuanians in the way of support remains to be seen. Whether the present existing Lithuanian American Sports Committee, Lithuanian radio hours, and the daily Lithuanian press will go along with the Lithuanian-American youth or continue to ignore the urgent need of Lithuanian sponsorship remains to be seen.</p>
   <p>All entries for the basket-ball league definitely close on Wednesday, Dec. 23, 1936. On this date a managers meeting will take place at the home of Jaunimas sports <span class="page-break">\2</span>editor, Jack L. Juozaitis, 6822 South Rockwell Street.
