   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America, Branch 139, had several lectures. The meeting was held at Verdi Hall, 247 Kensington Avenue. The speaker was Mr. Jancauskas. He spoke about national affairs; how Lithuania had suffered under the Russian government's yoke. The speaker said that as Lithuania is struggling for freedom, we must help our brothers in that struggle. A collection was made for the revolutionary cause, amounting to $6.65. The money was sent to the central revolutionary fund, to the central office of the Lithuanian Socialist Labor Party of America.</p>
