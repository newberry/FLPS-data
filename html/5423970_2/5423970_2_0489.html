   <p>A select group of Chicago artists arranged a program for the benefit of the Aurora Society on March 24, at the Meldazis Hall on the West Side. The program included the drama, "First Steps," by B. Vargsas, well known to Chicagoans, and monologues of Mr. Brusokas.</p>
   <p>Portraying the most important roles were such artists as B. Vaitiekunas, Briedis, Mrs. M. J. Damijonaitiene and J. Sankunas. It is apparent that the Chicago Public is of the opinion that these names always guarantee a good program.</p>
