   <p>Roselandietis (The Roselander) is the name of another Lithuanian newspaper born in Chicago. The Roselandietis differs from other Lithuanian newspapers in that it is purely a neighborhood paper. Its policy will be concerned with only the interests of Lithuanians living in Roseland. It will be published once every month.</p>
   <p>The first issue of the paper contains advertisements of local merchants, notices of society meetings, and local news. It is similar in all respects to the weekly community newspapers that are being published in the English language in various sections of Chicago; the only difference is that the Roselandietis is published in the Lithuanian language.</p>
