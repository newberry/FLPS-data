   <p>On December 31 The Lovers of Motherland Society, Branch 65, of Englewood, held its social evening at Baukus Hall. We enjoyed ourselves dancing and waiting for the happy New Year of 1916. When the hour of midnight struck, the young boys and girls shook hands with each other while expressing best wishes for the coming year and hopes of becoming members of the Lovers of Motherland Society. From what I have learned, five new members joined the society that evening.</p>
   <p>During the evening books were distributed to the members of this literary society, the Lovers of Motherland Society. The books were The Heart, and the Literary works of Reverend A. Strazdelis. Those who received them were very glad to receive such presents. At the same time, a small watch was raffled off. It was donated by Mr. A. Gausa. He deserves many thanks from Branch 65, At present, the Lovers of Motherland Society, Branch 65, has about fifty members. The attendance was not so large, but Branch 65, it seems, will have a fair profit from the evening.</p>
