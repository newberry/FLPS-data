   <p>Naujienos (News), according to the statements made by Catholic newspapers, made a real revolution in Chicago. The situation became hot for some political factions who made a good business by exploiting the people. Yet, while acting thus, these politicians never worried about the affairs and the welfare of the people in the community.</p>
   <p>All priests, editors of the older newspapers and their partisans were roused against Naujienos for telling the truth to the people. Last Sunday one of the priests at the Providence of God church, which is located near the Naujienos Corporation at 18th and Halsted, devoted a whole hour to criticizing and knocking Naujienos instead of preaching his Sunday Gospel to the people. He cursed Naujienos from the pulpit and warned the parents whose children were selling Naujienos and reading that godless paper, that they will be punished by God and their souls will be sent to hell for eternity. There is no salvation for those who are reading and <span class="page-break">2</span>selling godless literature and poisoning the minds of innocent people. He concluded his talk by saying, "remember that all sinners will be punished after death and nobody will escape God's punishment. Now is the time for those sinners to reform and remain loyal to our Supreme Being, and God will forgive all past sins."</p>
   <p>The editors of the older Lithuanian newspapers have organized a campaign of hatred against the Naujienos. These editors also have instructed their friends to persuade the people not to buy Naujienos at all because the paper is too dangerous to the people and it will lower their morals.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to mention that our enemies have enough courage to spread false propaganda against Naujienos and its corporation. They want to degrade Naujienos in the eyes of the people by saying that Naujienos is a disgraceful paper and it will lower the standards of morals. In other words, they like to knock others and praise themselves for being the only people of high morals and good nationalists.</p>

   <p>Notwithstanding these knocks, disparagements and false propaganda, the Naujienos will grow into a more influential and larger paper in the future. They will not hurt our paper, but they will hurt themselves more than they will hurt us. There is a good proverb: "One who digs a hole for others will himself fall into the same hole." If they were real men, they would cease fighting and spreading false propaganda against us and our paper Naujienos. If you are men, you should stop acting foolishly like young children. Nobody can hurt Naujienos, because this newspaper is too strong to be hurt and you people are incapable of hurting it. You may as well give up your fight against us, because you will lose the fight in the end anyway. This fight against our corporation is futile. In the first place, you people have no grounds for fighting us. If somebody wants to have a real fight, we will give it to them and we will make them jump the rope like monkeys.</p>
