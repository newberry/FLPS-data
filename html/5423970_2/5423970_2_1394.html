   <p>In Chicago there are many handsome girls and young men among the Lithuanians who want to dress well, to have good times at dances and weddings.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, our girls and boys at such recreation places have been <span class="gap">[gap]</span> at for not knowing the dances of this country.</p>
   <p>I, as a Lithuanian who seeks good for our nation, in order to show to other nations that we are a cultured people, am opening a dancing school, where in a short time you will learn American dances.</p>
   <p>Such dances will be once a week at P. CZESLWASKI'S HALL, 32nd and Lowell Avenue.</p>
   <p>I believe that all will agree with my proposition.</p>
   <p>L. J. ZACHAREWICZIUS</p>
   <p>The editor highly prizes such a school and urges young Lithuanians to learn American dances.</p>
