   <p>Our newspaper is small, but contains in it lot of truth and justice. We are not praising ourselves, our readers themselves are the judges of the newspaper, what benefit they are getting from it.</p>
   <p>Our purpose is to spread light among our illiterate brothers. We cannot find anything better for our brothers than spreading education among them. Therefore brothers, while you are reading our newspaper, ask your brothers to subscribe to our paper. We believe that you will join us to help our brothers to get education. Old, young, educated and freethinkers will find that education is the source of knowledge.</p>
   <p>Our newspaper is as necessary as the sun's beams to crops. We can compare our newspaper with the rising sun, which gives light and energy to life; in the same way our newspaper is awakening our illiterate brothers from the sleep of darkness.</p>
