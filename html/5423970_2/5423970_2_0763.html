   <p>p. 2.... A Lithuanian Library Club is being organized by the Lithuanians in Cicero, Ill. The movement started slowly but is now steadily increasing in momentum. The first organizational meeting was attended by only five people, but now we have over fifty active members.</p>
   <p>We are anxious to interest all Cicero Lithuanians in this important work. We plan to secure a modern collection of books, magazines and newspapers, and rent suitable quarters where our people can profitably spend their spare moments.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the club will be held Jan. 7 at Brazauskas Hall, 1410 So. 49th Ave. All Lithuanians are invited to attend this meeting and work together for the educational uplift of our people.</p>
