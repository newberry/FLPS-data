   <p>The Chicago district chorus of the Knights of Lithuania, a nation-wide Lithuanian Catholic youth organization, gave a concert last Sunday at St. George's Parish Hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue. Mr. Anthony Pocius, president of the Beethoven Conservatory of Music, directs the chorus.</p>
   <p>Generally speaking, the concert was a success. Some of the numbers were excellently rendered, but others were rather weakly performed, probably because the chorus is comparatively young. The membership is quite large, and it is believed that the chorus will develop into an excellent singing group after a few more years of activity.</p>
   <p>The concert attracted a capacity crowd that seemed to be well pleased with the program.</p>
