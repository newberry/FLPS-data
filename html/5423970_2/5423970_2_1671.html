   <p>The Young Lithuanian Club is situated in Bridgeport, and is one of the strongest in this vicinity. At the last meeting, the club decided to make the initiation fee only one dollar. This low admission fee to this club will be in effect for only six months, for persons of from eighteen to thirty years of age. This club, besides paying sick and death benefits, has a gymnasium club offering various gymnastic exercises. The meetings are held at St. George's Parish Hall the first Friday evening of every month.</p>
