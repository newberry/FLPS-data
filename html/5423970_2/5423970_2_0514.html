   <p>On January 8, the Lithuanian Youth Circle, at the Hull House Theatre, presented a three-act comedy, "The Bewitched Duke." The play is humorous but it does not seem to stem from Lithuanian life.</p>
   <p>This play was performed for the benefit of the Aurora (Ausra) Society.</p>
   <p>The attendance was so small that it will not cover the expenses. The loss will be about ten dollars.</p>
