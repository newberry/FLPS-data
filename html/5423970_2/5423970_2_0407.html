   <p>Chapter 28 of the Lovers of the Motherland Society sponsored a dramatic presentation at the Meldazis Hall last Sunday. This chapter of the organization is the largest in Chicago.</p>
   <p>B. Vargsas' five-act drama, "John's Heart," was presented. The fundamental theme of the play is revenge--an overwhelming revenge born of a disappointing love affair. A deep love, deeper than life itself, flames in the heart of John, a young man who is shunned and derided by all.</p>
   <p>Agnes is John's world. Agnes' love is the sublime canopy of the heavens in which John yearns to envelop his narrow--but to him, full--world. For that love, John leaves everything and travels to distant America. For that love John goes into the hell of a steel foundry and, witholding the very food from his own mouth, saves his money which is intended for the foundation of his future happiness. Through the thunder of the machines he can hear Agnes' voice. The star of his future happiness shines in a smoky sky. His deep love makes the poor and deserted orphan a mighty potentate who smashes all the barriers in the path of his happiness.</p>
   <p>John returns to Lithuania, wealthy and with an assurance of the greatest happiness in his heart. He hurries to the home of his beloved, to the happiness he had expected. But, in the house where John had expected to meet happiness, he learns that Agnes is already engaged and is to marry his only and best friend, Vincas.</p>
   <p>The overwhelming love in John's heart becomes an overwhelming desire for revenge, without measure and without mercy. John vows to avenge the deceit. From this moment on John's heart feels only his trampled love, the broken word, shouting for revenge. John is as big in his desire for revenge as he was in his love. His only thought is to repay those who had wounded his heart and had stolen his happiness. Sometimes the love smothered by the hate attempts to rise and threatens to shatter the awful revenge. But John's iron heart quickly chases it out and again flames only with revenge.</p>
   
   <p>John achieves his aim. Thanks to him, Vincas, Agnes, and her mother lose their home and experience hardships. Agnes dies in the midst of miserable poverty. John learns of this. His iron heart, revengeful but still loving, cannot withstand this blow, and the unhappy giant that is John kills himself. Thus ends the terrible drama of John's heart.</p>
   <p>This is not the place to make a detailed study of the play. "John" was played by P. Stuogis. One could not completely see in him the "John" painted by the author, but he acted his role well just the same. In the second act the actor entered the role fully, and here that awful drama which boiled in John's heart was clearly evident. Mr. Stuogis' acting should be called first-class.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Valionis presented a good and natural characterization of a Lithuanian village matron in the role of "Petrone," Agnes' mother. Of the others, D. Slapelis and V. Brusokas should be mentioned.</p>
   
   <p>The makeup and costuming was also praiseworthy, especially the makeup. He who applied the makeup must be ackowledged an expert in his line.</p>
   <p>There are also some new decorations in the hall. Now it will not be necessary to gaze upon the same scene forever.</p>
   <p>Two young misses, K. Burdulis and J. Vaurinskas, gave beautiful recitations during intermissions. It is unfortunate, however, that they did not reveal the titles of the poems and the names of the authors. During one of the intermissions, Dr. K. Drangelis spoke about the Lovers of the Motherland Society.</p>
   <p>The affair ended with dancing. The attendance was not very large. Many unforeseen circumstances were the cause of this, it was explained by the president of the chapter. We learned, from the same source, that the chapter is getting along very well.</p>
