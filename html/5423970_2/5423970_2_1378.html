   <p>We are told that in Chicago there are over 20,000 Lithuanians, and of this number, I think, there are at least 10,000 young men and girls. The present youth is different from the youth of the past. At present every young man or girl knows how to read and write. Of course, many of them read only the prayer books. They are not to be blamed for not knowing any better because they have been educated that way.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians ought to have their own school, to teach Lithuanian, English, arithmetic, history, geography, etc.</p>
   <p>Especially the American-born Lithuanian children ought to be taught the Lithuanian language. Those who want to have such a Lithuanian school should write to me. If a sufficient number wants to have such a school, I will open one. Call or write to Balevice, 295 Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Ill.</p>
