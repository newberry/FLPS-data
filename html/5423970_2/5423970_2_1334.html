   <p>There is no shame [attached] to study; learning is beneficial and is an essential need of everyone. Therefore, the Aurora Society is inviting everybody, old and young, girls and young men, to start to study now, without delay. When you begin to study, stick hard to it, seek for the highest degree of accomplishment, use yourself as example, and encourage your friends who are doubtful and hesitant about going to school. In order to help all of you to learn, the Aurora has established a day and evening school at 3149 South Halsted Street, which has been in existence for the last four years. We beg you to start to attend the school on September 2--for your own benefit and for the good of the school.</p>
   <p>The following subjects will be taught: English, Lithuanian, arithmetic. We will teach other subjects if there is a demand for them. The teachers are reliable; the tuition is small. The Aurora Society's Enlightenment Committee invites you.</p>
