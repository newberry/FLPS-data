   <p>The general public has recently raised a new and important cultural question--the founding of a trade school. This question is, as a matter of fact, so important that putting it off until better times would come would mean a great loss to Lithuanian workers. Therefore, the branch of the Aurora Society in Chicago, hearing the voice of the public, has decided to found the first Lithuanian trade school.</p>
   <p>To get better acquainted with the problems and demands of such a school, the branch of the Aurora Society has elected a special committee from its membership. The elected committee has worked out a plan according to which such a school can be established. The committee has also found that at the present time it would be best to establish a school of carpentry for Lithuanians, because the carpenter trade is well paid here and the demand for <span class="page-break">\2</span>good craftsmen is not small. Besides this, carpentry can be very useful also to those returning to the Motherland. Therefore the Aurora Society has decided to first of all establish a carpentry trade school and add other trades to it later.</p>
   <p>According to the accepted plan of the committee and the decision of the membership of the Aurora, the school will have to be established this year, during the end of September. The classes of the school will be in the evenings, three evenings a week, two and one-half hours each evening. In order that more students may attend the classes, the students will be divided into two groups. One group will study, let us say, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings; the other group, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings. Classes will be taught throughout nine months. The fees for the course will be as follows: thirty dollars for nine months, paid either in advance or in payments of ten dollars. This fee is smaller than is <span class="page-break">\3</span>charged in similar English schools. The teacher will be one of the best of the Lithuanian carpenters, who knows teaching and his trade thoroughly. Those who cannot attend evenings will be able to attend day classes. The fee for the same length of time will be the same. Those wishing to study through the whole day will also be able to do so and they will receive a special remuneration for overtime. There will be no other expenses for the students. The school and the school committee will strive to place the more talented students with good firms. The school will be provided with all tools and necessary machinery. The students will be trained in all the branches of carpentry. Special attention will be given to the better and more expensive carpentry work which is better paid. Lithuanians usually are very handy, so it is expected that many artistic works will come out of that school. Those wishing to study will please contact J. Ilgaudas, 1630 So. Halsted Street, a member of the committee, at once, and he will gladly give the details.</p>
   <p>But right here we must also touch upon another very important problem: How <span class="page-break">\4</span>will we get the money to start the school? According to a thorough appraisal by the committee, the school will pay for itself in a year's time and, possibly, will bring a profit which will be used for the improvement of the school and the establishment of other trade branches. True, there already have been found several young men who donated $25 to the school, while one has even donated all of his tools, worth $30. However, these donations are by far insufficient for the start. Not a small sum of money, roughly figuring, about $2,000 is necessary to purchase working tables, tools, motors, and machines and the hiring of a teacher and a building. But, since the public itself has raised this important question, the Aurora Society, especially the committee, firmly believes that the public realized what it was demanding and therefore, in fulfilling the demands of the public, the Aurora is confident that the public will not decline to generously and immediately support this first Lithuanian trade school with its donations. This practice has become common among the Lithuanians: when donations are needed for important matters the public does not begrudge them. Therefore the Aurora believes <span class="page-break">\5</span>that the public fully understands the need for the establishment of such a trade school and will not only help in founding it, but will also strive to support it morally and with work. Please send the donations to the treasurer of the Aurora Society's Chicago branch, Dr. A. J. Zimont, 3252 So. Halsted Street, Chicago.</p>
