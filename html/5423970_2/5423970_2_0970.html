   <p>The publishers of the Lithuanian weekly Draugas (The Friend) report that Reverend F. Kemesis has resigned as editor of the Draugas and the Pazanga (Progress). The Pazanga will now be edited by Julius Kaupas, and the Draugas will be edited by Frank Sivickas. However, we have learned that Mr. Sivickas left for the University of Missouri last Wednesday. Therefore, the Draugas is without an editor, at least for the time being.</p>
   <p>There were rumors for a long time to the effect that Reverend Kemesis would resign as editor of the Draugas. It is said that he resigned in order to devote more time to his plans to establish Lithuanian Catholic newspapers in the eastern states. It was announced that in the near future three new Lithuanian newspapers will be established.</p>
