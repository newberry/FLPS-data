   <p>The following Lithuanian colonies are located in the South Side of Chicago: Roseland, Kensington, Pullman, West Pullman, and Burnside. Only a small number of Lithuanians live in the Burnside and Pullman colonies.</p>
   <p>In the combined areas, Roseland and Kensington, there is a total of seven Lithuanian societies. Their names are as follows: Building Association Company, a newly organized building and loan association; Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania Society, a non-Catholic mutual aid society; St. Vincent Society, a Catholic mutual aid society, which was established nine years ago, and which now has over $2000 in its treasury; St. Michael's Society; Holy Cross Society; and St. Anna's Women's Society. The latter three societies are also Catholic mutual aid societies.</p>

   <p>In Burnside, there is only one Lithuanian business establishment, a saloon.</p>
   <p>The approximate number of Lithuanians living in all these South Side colonies is between eight and nine thousand.</p>
   <p>The earnings of workers in this locality are not bad. In Roseland and Burnside, the Lithuanian workers are employed in the Pullman car factory, and in the Burnside car repair shop. Their earnings range from $1.50 to $4 <span class="page-break">\4</span>for a nine hour day; they work five and one-half days per week.</p>
   <p>A large hardware factory is now being erected alongside of the above mentioned car shop. It will cost about half a million dollars, and will employ about nineteen thousand workers.</p>
   <p>In West Pullman, the Lithuanian workers are employed in a car factory, farm machine works, hardware factory, brick yard, etc. The average daily earnings are about $1.60; the earnings of skill workers range from $2.50 to $4 per day. The largest factory, a farm machine works, is located in the western part of west Pullman.</p>
   <p>The Burnside, Roseland, and West Pullman colonies can be reached by street cars from 63rd Street and White City.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Roseland, which is alongside of Kensington, is ten miles away from the loop in Chicago. Kensington begins at 115th Street, and runs south. The most important street is Michigan Avenue. West Pullman begins at 119th Street and Wentworth Avenue, and runs west and south.</p>
   <p>In Kensington, the Lithuanians live on 115th, 116th and 117th Streets, east of Michigan Avenue, this being the poorest section of Kensington. Besides Lithuanians, other nationalities such as Italians and Jews live there. It is enough to say that Italians and Jews live there in order to form an opinion of the general appearance of the locality. Nevertheless, the appearance of this neighborhood is comparatively better than that of the Lithuanian colony at 18th and Canal Streets. The western section of Kensington appears to be very beautiful, like an orchard; everywhere there are gardens, trees, clean streets, and the air is very pure and healthful.</p>
   <p>In Roseland, the Lithuanians live on 108th and 107th Streets. A Lithuanian <span class="page-break">\6</span>Roman Catholic church is located here on Wabash Avenue. Reverend Serafinas is the pastor. The membership of this parish is composed of Lithuanians from all the South Side Lithuanian colonies. There are from four to five thousand parishioners. This parish also has a parochial school, in which children are being taught by two women and one man.</p>
   <p>There are a number of wealthy Lithuanians living in these colonies. The fortune of Charles Stromill, of Roseland, amounts to about $40,000, Mr. Nazelskis, also of Roseland, is worth about $8,000, Mr. Klimavicius and Mr. Ulbikas, both of Kensington, are worth about $30,000 each; Mr. Sedvilas, also of Kensington, is worth about $10,000; A large number of other Lithuanians possess smaller, but comfortable fortunes.</p>
   <p>The number of Lithuanian property owners is also quite large. In Roseland, <span class="page-break">\7</span>the Lithuanians own twenty homes and about fifty vacant lots; in West Pullman there are about forty Lithuanian property owners. The values of the lots vary according to location; residential lots range in value from $150 to 300, while the values of business lots are from $1000 to $10,000.</p>
   <p>This locality is very suitable for residential homes. All the land is level and clear. In no other Chicago Lithuanian colony is the air so pure, healthful, and suitable for dwelling purposes. At present, the prices of lots are not very high, but they are expect to rise in the near future. Ten years ago, there were barely ten homes in Roseland, but today it is a good-sized town. More and more land is being sub-divided into lots, and new streets are being laid out.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians first came to this locality to live fifteen years ago. Ten years ago, there was only one Lithuanian business establishment, a saloon, <span class="page-break">\8</span>in this entire area. Roseland is the best place for residential purposes, because there are more vacant lots there than in any of the other Lithuanian colonies.</p>
   <p>There are no large Lithuanian business establishments in this locality. There is a special need here for a good clothing store, with an additional line of other necessary goods. Anyone who cares to establish such a store here, is advised to communicate with Mr. Casimir Klimavicius, of Kensington. He owns a lot on the corner of 108th Street and Michigan Avenue, where he is willing to erect a suitable building for any Lithuanian who desires to establish a store there such as the one described above.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Roman Catholic parish of Roseland is aiding in the establishment of a convent for Lithuanian nuns, sisters of St. Casimir. The convent will be erected on the corner of 101st Street and Wentworth Avenue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>More and greater activities, such as mass meetings, etc., are needed among the Lithuanians of these South Side colonies. There are many prosperous Lithuanian organizations there. They should increase their scope of activities and responsibilities and not remain satisfied with merely the dispensation of sick and death benefits to members.</p>
