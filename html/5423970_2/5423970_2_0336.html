   <p>The singers' society of Dr. V. Kudirka will hold its meeting on Sunday, July 1st, at 2 P. M., Meldazis Hall, 68 W. 25th St. We are inviting boys and girls who have good voices to join our society. This society is growing fast. Many men come to practice but we lack girls' voices in order to make a complete choir.</p>
