   <p>The second meeting of the founders of the Sernas Music Fund, music aid society, was held on November 26, at the home of the chairman, Dr. A. L. Graicunas, 3312 S. Halsted Street. This meeting was a continuation of the first meeting on November 1, which was called by the secretary J. Laukis to oppose the efforts of Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas, former treasurer, to liquidate the fund. Dr. Rutkauskas had announced in the October 30 issue of the Lietuva that he liquidated the fund and merged it with the Ausra (Aurora) Society, a student aid society, on the grounds that both societies have a common purpose.</p>
   <p>Many important matters were discussed at the meeting. It was announced that attorney F. P. Bradchulis, newly elected treasurer, refuses to accept any money in the treasury until the Sernas Fund is incorporated and has received a charter. Some of the founders of the fund argued that a charter was not necessary. However, the majority agreed that without a charter the <span class="page-break">2</span>the fund is without a foundation and for that reason can be easily destroyed at any time. A decision was reached to incorporate the fund and obtain a charter. A committee was elected to carry out this decision. The members of the committee are : K. Gugis, M. Damijonaitis, J. Hertmanauicius, and J. Laukis. The committee was urged to complete all necessary work by January 15, 1909, when the next meeting of the fund is scheduled to take place.</p>
   <p>Some of the founders expressed the desire that the Sernas Fund should be merged with, or be made a branch of, the Ausra (Aurora) Society, believing that both societies have a common purpose. However, it was explained at the meeting that there is a vast difference between the aims of both societies. The purpose of the Ausra Society is to assist students only; whereas the purpose of the Sernas Music Fund is to promote music, to assist only those students who possess unquestionable musical talent, such as <span class="page-break">3</span>Kelpsa, and to publish the musical and theatrical works of our artists who cannot afford to do so themselves. For example, Mikas Petrauskas, a former Chicagoan who is now in Lithuania, has written quite a number of musical compositions and theatrical plays. However, he cannot afford to publish and popularize them; this tends to discourage him in producing more songs and plays. That is the main reason why we Lithuanian-Americans are making such slow progress in the fields of music and drama. A financial aid society, such as the Sernas Music Fund, is absolutely necessary in order to raise the musical and theatrical level of Lithuanian-Americans to a higher plane. The vast difference between the Ausra Society and the Sernas Music Fund is self-evident.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians are asked to continue their generous support of the fund, and not to wait until the charter is received; the fund is now functioning normally and is badly in need of contributions from the Lithuanian public. The purpose of the fund, to promote music, will not be changed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>A campaign to raise $10,000 is now under way. We can easily raise this amount within six months if we make up our minds to do so. A dollar or a half-dollar means very little to an individual. However, a large number of these small contributions create a large sum with which we can accomplish gigantic deeds. If our goal of $10,000 is reached, then the future of music among Lithuanian-Americans will be guaranteed.</p>
   <p>We can accomplish great deeds with the aid of music. It can make our lives more pleasant, strengthen our ties of unity, and make us realize that we are children of one family.</p>
   <p>All Lithuanians are cordially invited to contribute to the Sernas Music Fund according to their means. Let us show that we know how to support our national requirements.</p>
