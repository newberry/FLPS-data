   <p>After the announcement in Lietuva that Rev. Krawczunas had lost his last case against the publisher and the editor, someone started to break the windows of the office of Lietuva. We will give $50 to this man to tell us who is asking him to break the windows of our office. We sustain no losses from broken windows because they are insured.</p>
   <p>We (would) like to know very much who is instructing others to break the windows.</p>
