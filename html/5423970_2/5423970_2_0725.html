   <p>Up to the present time we had no sick benefit for the members of our society. The monthly dues were 15 cents. Even some of our own members objected to paying monthly dues, because our society had no sick benefit fund. In order to satisfy everybody we will now have a sick benefit, too. The initiation fees will be one dollar and the monthly dues fifty cents.</p>
   <p>We will keep our library because we believe that to abolish the library would be a suicide. We are sorry to say that our other societies do not contribute anything to our library. It is very easy forsocieties to donate a few dollars for such a great and important cause as a library. We like to make our library one of the greatest in the country.</p>
