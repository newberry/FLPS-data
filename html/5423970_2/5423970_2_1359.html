   <p>Why do our people, having come to a foreign land, live in want and continue to suffer hardships? Why are they paid so poorly? Why does everybody laugh at them?</p>
   <p>The Enlightenment Committee of the First Chapter of the Aurora Society tried to give the answers to these and many other questions. It strove to find a way to better the life of Lithuanians in America. It was determined to make the lives of our nationals brighter, happier, and more promising. The fruit of its meditation is--the Evening School.</p>
   <p>It is already known to everybody that a school has been opened in the Lithuanian Club, 3149 So. Halsted Street. It is the first of its kind in America. It is the first because it has what no other Lithuanian school in America has ever had: systematically taught courses. Up to now none of the schools known to us were bound to any kind of system. And what came of that?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Nothing more resulted than discontent on the part of the students and the founders.</p>
   <p>The Enlightenment Committee of the First Chapter of the Aurora Society realized that the introduction of a system, above all was necessary.</p>
   <p>After the introduction of a system, another no less important problem arose: good, talented instructors. Here also no small amount of meditation was needed, for it was understood how important it is for every school to have suitable teachers. The Enlightenment Committee appointed only those who have the necessary preparation, sufficient talent, and the inclination to teach in a new, promising school. The Arithmetic Class will be instructed by J. Jonikis, who has completed studies in a teacher's seminary; Algebra and Geometry will be taught by K. Mikolainis, B. S.; English, Mr. Sliakis, a law student at the Northwestern University; Lithuanian, K. Jurgelionis, the well-known literatus; Drafting, K. Gugis, who is attending the Armour Institute.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The full school course continues through five days each week, namely, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday--from 7:30 P.M. to 9:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>Those who cannot attend all the courses can register for separate courses and in that manner receive the opportunity to train themselves in some suitable branch at a low cost.</p>
   <p>Therefore, fellow-nationals, if you desire to attain something loftier, if you want to receive the enlightenment which was inaccessible to you before, and if, finally, you crave to raise yourselves out of want and a life of hardships, then do not delay but come to register in this new and important institution. You will be fully satisfied with this school because it is systematically ordered, the teachers are experts in their branches and in the requirements of teaching and, finally, from a financial viewpoint, the school is accessible to all.</p>

   <p>Registrations can be made any evening, except Tuesday, from 7:30 P.M. to 9:00 P.M., at the Lithuania Hall.</p>
