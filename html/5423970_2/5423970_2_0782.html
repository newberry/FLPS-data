   <p>Thanks to the splendid support of many good people, the Aurora library is growing. Mrs. M. Jurgelionis sends the Russian daily newspaper, Riec (The Language), Dr. Graiciunas, the Daily Socialist and Nowe Zycie (The New Life), and in English, "The Literary Digest," "Review of Reviews," and "The Independent."</p>
   <p>We also ask the European Lithuanian publishers to send their publications to our Aurora library.</p>
