   <p>A new Lithuanian periodical entitled Pazanga (Progress) appeared in Chicago this week. It is to be published once every month.</p>
   <p>An editorial appearing in the new publication states that it will be a "journal of literature, learning, and politics, for the Lithuanian masses of America".</p>
   <p>Reverend F. Kemesis is the editor of the Pazanga. It is published by the Mariavite Fathers, a Lithuanian Roman Catholic religious order, which also publishes the Chicago weekly Draugas.</p>
   <p>The first number of the Pazanga consists of forty-eight large pages. It contains a variety of features. The new periodical will undoubtedly foster the ideals of the Lithuanian right wing faction (the Catholics), which supports the weekly Draugas.</p>
