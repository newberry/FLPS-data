   <p>With the beginning of this new year, we have made changes in our newspaper.....Beginning with this issue, there will be a new and regular section called "The Political Week"....In this section we will write about political events in the United States. It seems to us that such a section is very important for our people (Lithuanians), because although they are citizens of America, their knowledge of the political affairs and the life of this country is very limited. American politics is very much neglected in all of our newspapers.</p>
   <p>This should not be. There are many Lithuanian citizens and also a large number of prospective citizens. By being well-informed citizens, they can defend their rights, and they will be respected by honorable American <span class="page-break">2</span>citizens as, for instance, the Czechs are. In this section, "The Political Week," the reader will find all the important political news of America.</p>
