   <p>The Alliance of Dramatic Societies presented "Mindaugis" at the new Lithuanian Milda Theater last Sunday night.</p>
   <p>The various actors revealed their best talents in this performance, despite the fact that "Mindaugis" is a heavy historical play and has many difficult roles.</p>
   <p>The proceeds of the affair were to be donated for Lithuanian war relief. Because of this, Mr. Olszewskis, who owns the Milda Theater, made no charge for the use of the theater.</p>
   <p>The Sarpalius and Herman orchestras played during the performance. The musicians also donated their services.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that about a hundred dollars profit was made.</p>
