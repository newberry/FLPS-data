   <p>On 18th Street, at the Providence of God Parish Hall, Dr. A. L. Graicivnas gave an illustrated lecture on health and tuberculosis last Sunday afternoon. The introduction was made by the local pastor Reverend Stefanavicius himself, who offered to arrange for more such popular and instructive lectures every Sunday, if the public would be interested. There were several hundred people present.</p>
