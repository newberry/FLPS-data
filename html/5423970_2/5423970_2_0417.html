   <p>Lodges 3 and 4 of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Women's Alliance sponsored a meeting with a varied program at St. George Parish Hall last Sunday. Among other things, the comedy, "The Gordian Knot" ("Neatmez-gamas Mazgas"), was presented. The presentation of the play was considered a success. The second part of the program was devoted to a concert, which proceeded very smoothly. Mrs. O. Mikalauskas opened the program with a piano solo which pleased the audience very much. Mrs. M. Janusauskas sang "Kur Bakuze Samanota" and "Fior Di Margherita". Mrs. Janusauskas drew forth a storm of applause with her singing and was forced to sing a third song not on the program. A young girl of about thirteen, Miss J. Urbius, met with the same sort of success when she recited "My Cross". She was also forced by applause to offer an extra number. The Kankliu Male Quartet was also good. The program was brought to a close by the Kankliu Chorus, directed by Mr. B. Janusauskas. The chorus also earned much applause and had to sing an encore. The chorus brought the program to an end by singing the Lithuanian national anthem. [Translator's note: The Kankliu Chorus mentioned here was a local organization in the St. George Parish and should not be confused with the Kankliu Chorus which was organized by Lithuanian Communists in 1919.]</p>
