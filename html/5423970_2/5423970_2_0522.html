   <p>The Theatrical Group of the Birute Society presented "The Lithuanians," by Two Women, at the Hull House Theater, October 29. This play was presented by the sane Society, so it is known to Chicagoans. The same persons, except for a couple of new ones, acted in it. Nodziunas, in the role of a student, played his role much worse than last year. Nodziunas played his role badly. His actions and impersonation were not fitting to the role..... Astrauskas, a prison guard, also did not appear as he should have. The others who acted were the same as last year: Damijonaitiene, Drangelis, Kalvaiciute, Moskiene, Vitkevicius, Margevicius, Stogis, Monkunas, and Montviliute. They acted well and no criticisms can be made about them.....</p>
   <p>After the second act Bigelis played Schumann's "Traumerei and Romance" and Wieniawsky's "Kujawiak" on the violin. After the third act Kriksciokiute sang Moniuszka's "The Day Is Darkening" and Petrauskas' "Heat, Bright Sun." After the fourth act the Birute chorus sang Petrauskas' "Red Sun," "Comes an Echo," and "Where Is Our Home?"</p>
