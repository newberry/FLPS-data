   <p>The Lithuanian Youth Circle presented "Ingomaras", a five-act drama, "Lithuanianized" by J. J. Zolpis, for the first time at St. Georges Parish Hall, Sunday, September 8. It was well acted. Among the important women's roles, Zofija Laurinaviciute played her part best. Among the men, J. J. Zolp, Z. Jankunas, K. Rekasius, S. Ragauskis and P. Sirvinskas played their parts well. M. Mikulskaite and N. Ringailaite also did well. All the others were not as good. The scenery was very suited to the play.....</p>
