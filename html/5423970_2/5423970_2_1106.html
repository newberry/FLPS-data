   <p>For the last three years we printed free all the announcements and advertisements of all the Lithuanian societies. I offered for one dollar a year subscription of Lietuva to society members. Some societies voted that its members ought to subscribe to Lietuva but would not enforce it.</p>
   <p>We cannot work for nothing for the Lithuanian societies in Chicago. From now on we will charge five cents per line for every society's advertisement. We tried to help the Lithuanian societies, but we get no benefit from them except denunciations. It will be best to pay us for every advertisement.</p>
   <p>We tried to encourage the activities of the Lithuanian societies to enlighten its members, but the society members did not realize what good work the newspaper was doing for them; instead of paying one dollar yearly subscription of Lietuva they said that it was too much - better to spend the dollar in a saloon.</p>
