   <p>Brothers, Lithuanians, readers of the newspaper Lietuva.</p>
   <p>We are notifying all of you that the newspaper Lietuva was bought by P. Zakarewiczius and S. Leliaszius and the paper will be published under its former name Lietuva.</p>
   <p>The former editors-publishers wrote what you Lithuanians must believe, wrote against priests, etc., so the good Lithuanian Catholics quit reading such paper. With such writings they brought misunderstanding among Lithuanians because the editors did not care to write about Lithuanians, and about the good duties of the church they did not care to write either.</p>
