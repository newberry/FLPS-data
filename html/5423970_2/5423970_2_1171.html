   <p>Wallace Nelson, The Trial of Christ and Its Legality, (Chicago: 1918). Translated by Attorney F. P. Bradchulis. Thirty pages. Price fifty cents.</p>
   <p>In this booklet the trial of Christ is examined from a purely legal viewpoint. The question of whether the sentence imposed on Christ was technically correct according to the laws of that time is answered here. In other words, this book reveals whether the sentence imposed on Christ was just in view of the laws of the time, in view of the procedure demanded by the laws and, finally, in view of the charges against Christ and the testimony at the trial.</p>
   <p>In order to answer such a question it is necessary to acquaint oneself with the Jewish and Roman laws and trial procedure of the time; it is necessary to study critically the circumstances of the trial and the testimony.</p>
   <p>All of this is given in brief in this booklet. The book is especially interesting to lawyers and others who are acquainted with law. It will be interesting to other people also, even though much concentration and attention is necessary in reading the book.</p>
   <p>The book is of good paper stock. The price, compared to the size of the book, is rather high.</p>
