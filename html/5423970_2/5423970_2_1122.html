   <p>A new Lithuanian periodical, Laime (Good Fortune), recently made its appearance in Chicago. It is published by A. M. Matthews (Matulaitis), who is an agent of the Kingman Zinc Mines.</p>
   <p>In an editorial in the first issue of Laime, it is stated that the periodical will be strictly a journal of commerce. However, the whole issue from beginning to end appears to be an advertisement of the mines which Mr. Matthews represents. This periodical is similar to the periodical Progresas (Progress), which was published some time ago in Philadelphia by the famous "Duke" Jocius.</p>
