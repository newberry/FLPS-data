   <p>On September 21, Branch 129 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America gave a performance at Meldazis Hall, on the West Side. The program was a varied one, of an agitational character. There was no dramatic presentation, but there were lectures, monologues, declamations, essays, and Mr. Stepukas with his jokes. Dr. A. Drangelis delivered a lecture on the subject of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, and J. S. Vitkus read an essay on the same theme. The attendance was small, and from a financial point of view, Branch 129 was not very successful.</p>
