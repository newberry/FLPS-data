   <p>Mikas Petrauskas, former Chicago Lithuanian composer and vocal artist, sent a letter to the Lietuva (Lithuania ) from Paris, France. He plans to return to America at the end of this year to give musical concerts until the end of spring. He will return to Paris early in March of next year and study in a conservatory for about four months.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petrauskas plans to stage about two theatrical plays while here in America. He will probably stage "Sienapute" (Harvest Time), for which he wrote the music. He plans to give concerts in Brooklyn, New York, Waterbury, Scranton, Philadelphia, and Chicago.</p>
   <p>Our people have learned to appreciate his worth and importance only since he left America. Therefore, it is hoped that when he returns he will be received with greater respect and support so that his concerts will meet with greater financial success than before.</p>
