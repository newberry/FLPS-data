   <p>The Biruta Music and Dramatic Society successfully presented the first Lithuanian opera, "Sienapiute" (Hay Harvest), on Sunday afternoon, January 2, at the Garrick Theatre, which is located in the downtown section of Chicago. Besides the opera, a comedy entitled "Be Sumenes" (Without Patience), was also staged. This comedy, which was the first Lithuanian play to be staged in America (on Dec. 31, 1889, at Plymouth, Pa.) was presented to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of that event. The entire program was under the personal direction of Mikas Petrauskas, world-famous Lithuanian composer and director of the Biruta Society.</p>
   <p>The whole affair was successful in every way, except from a financial standpoint. It is estimated that of the fifty thousand Lithuanians in the Chicago area only about one per cent came to witness the first presentation of the first Lithuanian opera. Expenses were over $400, but the total receipts were only $380. As a result, the affair resulted in a deficit of more than twenty dollars.</p>

   <p>The reason for the small attendance is the low level of intelligence of our people, and the apparent fact that they are still more interested in saloons than anything else. Financially, an ordinary workingman enjoys a better life than our writers, musicians, and artists.</p>
   <p>The program began with the presentation of the second act of the melo-drama "Birute" (the name of the fourteenth century Lithuanian duchess). This act was very impressive, like a prayer to the Lithuanian gods. The leading part, "Birute", was played by Miss M. Horodeikis, who rendered a very satisfactory performance. Others who played well were: "Old Priest"--A. Zacharas, and "High Priest"--J. Ilgaudas.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program was the presentation of the two-act comedy, "Be Sumenes" (Without Patience). It was very successfully presented. The following players gave a good account of their performances: "Jurgis"--Mr. M. Dudas, "Kotryna"--Mrs. M. Damijonaitis, "Ona"--Miss P. Atkociunas, and "Ickus"--J. Uktveris.</p>

   <p>The third and main event was the presentation of "Sienapiute" (Hay Harvest), which was the first presentation of the first Lithuanian opera. This performance cannot be praised nor censured, but compares favorably with the usual American presentations. It created the impression that it is only the first act of a long drama, and not a complete Play. The libretto is not a drama, tragedy, or a comedy. Two or three more acts could easily have been added to this operetta, then it would really be a grand opera. From the standpoint of art and music, that is, orchestral music, the opera was very exhilarating. The performance was very effective and highly successful. The chorus became slightly confused while singing the most difficult part of the opera. However, this fact should be overlooked when all the unfavorable conditions under which the opera was presented are taken into consideration.</p>
   <p>The scene of the opera is laid in a field in Lithuania just before sunset. A group of women, who gather the hay after it is mowed by the men, persuade the men to cease work for the day. The sun sets; the toilers stop working and rest in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the field. One of the workers, "Aldona", longs to see "Masulis", a peasant, with whom she is in love. In the meantime, a young farmhand entertains the reapers with songs. "Gotautas." the landlord, arrives and begs "Aldona" to become his house-servant. Later, he makes love to her, and asks her to become his wife. "Aldona", being a poor peasant girl, declines the offer of marriage, saying that "Gotautas", who is a rich landowner, would not love her after their marriage. "Gotautas" becomes enraged, and vows to seek revenge. Later, "Masulis" arrives on the scene. "Gotautas", after seeing the couple make love to each other, swears revenge against "Masulis", and leaves the scene. Presently, a young lad arrives and informs "Masulis" that his mother was dispossessed by "Gotautas", who threw all her belongings into the road in a reckless manner. The Play ends with an impressive song by the entire Biruta chorus, as the reapers prepare to go home.</p>
   <p>The history of "Sienapiute", the first Lithuanian opera, is as follows: After successfully presenting his melodrama, "Birute", in the city of Vilna, Lithuania, during the Fall of 1906, the composer, Mikas Petrauskas, decided to write a Lithuanian opera. He disclosed his plan to K. Josukaitis, who agreed to write <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the libretto for "Sienapiute" in accordance with a plan submitted by Mr. Petrauskas. He wrote the libretto within three days. Mrs. Petrauskas composed the music for "Sienapiute" within eight months while in Switzerland during 1906 and 1907. The orchestration of the opera took a longer time, because Mr. Petrauskas toured America with concerts. He wrote the orchestration during 1908 and 1909 while attending a Conservatory of Music in Paris, France.</p>
   <p>The following artists participated in the presentation of "Sienapiute": "Masulis"--Mr. K. Kasputis, "Aldona"--Miss M. Jaksevicius, "Gotautas"--Kre. V. Brusokas, and Juska", a servant--Mr. F. Zacharas. Mr. K. Drangelis also played the part of a servant; Miss M. Horodeikis played the part of a peasant girl; Mr. J. Ilgaudas and Mr. K. Strumskis acted as peasants. The most important roles were that of "Mesulis", tenor, and "Aldona", soprano. Some of the characters, as that of "Gotautas, did not do any singing.</p>
   <p>Gabriel Katzenberger, a German, who is the most distinguished music critic in <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Chicago, made the following criticism of "Sienapiute" in the January 3 issue of the Illinois Staats Zeitung: "The music is original, the theme is well developed and embellished with amour and melody. Although the participants in the opera are all theatrical amateurs, nevertheless, they rendered splendid performances; their voices were clear and pleasing. The Biruta chorus was really great. Mr. Petrauskas is a very talented musical artist, and much good can be expected from him as a musical composer."</p>
   <p>Mr. Petrauskas is now writing another Lithuanian opera, "Egle, Zalciu Karaliene" (The Evergreen Tree, Queen of Non-Poisonous Snakes), which deals with Lithuanian mythology. The libretto is taken from "Guzutis", a well-known drama composed by A. Fromo.</p>
