   <p>At the annual meeting of the Birute Kanklers, before the election of new officers was held, the members discussed various means of achieving the aims of the group. [Translator's note: The Kankle is the ancient Lithuanian folk instrument. The Kanklers were an organization of Lithuanian string instrument players.]</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by Mr. Butkus, president of the Birute Society, who had previously spoken to the Kanklers about organizing a musical branch in the Birute Society. After he had disclosed the conditions offered by the Society, the Kanklers unanimously voted to become active members of the Birute Society. Therefore, as you see, the Birute Society is now founding a third branch: the first is the singers', the second is the dramatic group, the third is the instrumental. In this manner an opportunity is offered to every Lithuanian young man and woman to participate and to find a suitable <span class="page-break">2</span>place in the field of music for himself or herself.</p>
   <p>The following instruments are at present included in the instrumental group: mandolins, balalaikas, and guitars. If others desire to join, more instruments will be added.</p>
   <p>The following were elected officers: J. Kazanauskas, president; Mr. Elzbergass, secretary; Mr. Radvilavicia, treasurer; Mr. Jodis, director.</p>
   <p>The Birute Kanklers hold their meetings every Thursday at 8 P. M., in the small hall of the Meldazis Building. Those wishing to join are invited to attend.</p>
