   <p>Mr. Olszewski devised a very educational article entitled "Spiritual Hypocrites," which he published in his paper Lietuva. In this article he reveals his true character and intelligence to our people. An intelligent man who has read this article will not think much of it. Anybody can see that we cannot expect much from such intellectualist who has no logic at all. Now they are willing to compromise and also exculpate themselves for attacking our rector and the members of our parish.</p>
   <p>One of the members, who belongs to the so-called intelligentsia, is laying a smoke screen in front of the people by spreading false propaganda against the members of the church. Mr. Olszewski calls himself an intelligent and educated man, but he cannot even write intelligently in his own language and cannot express himself clearly.</p>
   <p>Those people who read the letter written by A. Olszewski, which as published in Katalikas, can easily see this viewpoint. Now Olszewski is putting all his efforts in trying to vindicate himself by using meaningless words and saying that he is not a godless man. Yes, he calls himself a good Christian, but at the same time he abuses our church and its members. It is hard to understand a man like him. He says one thing and thinks another. Mr. Olszewski and his henchmen may talk all they want until their tongues get tired; they they will stop talking and writing in their paper Lietuva against our parish. They are trying to prove that their statements are always based upon the facts and cannot be disputed. This expression is a little too strong, and not a bit logical. We doubt if Mr. Olszewski could be able to use his facts, which are not in existence, in court, if he had a chance. You cannot change the truth, as you cannot change black into white.</p>
   <p>Those people go to saloons to drink, gossip and abuse God and its teachings, and yet they call themselves good Catholics. It is an incredible thing to hear such bad slandering against the church and parish, especially from those people who have a nerve to call themselves members of our parish. A few individuals in our parish are going around and telling the people that there is no God and no punishment after death. We believe their source of knowledge is Lietuva, which is published by A. Olszewski.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Olszewski denied the fact that he wrote an article which was published in Lietuva, that there is no God. It is not so bad when a man admits or does not deny; but when a man makes a statement and then denies it, he is the worse kind of hypocrite who ever walked on two feet. People of that type are nothing but wolves that parade under sheep skin. Moreover, these people cannot be trusted in anything they do or say, and at the same time they are dangerous to the present day society.</p>
   <p>The hypocrites, under a cloak of religion, are doing their business among the members of our parish and, in addition, in their private letters are provoking the people and scorning the dogmas of the Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>Remember your words, Mr. Olszewski, what you said: "Some crazy priests who have no education and no intelligence will permit a man to many a second time in the Catholic Church if he is divorced in the civil court. That it is not a sin to marry a second time in the Catholic Church, if the man is divorced in the civil court, and that the man will not be punished after death."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Olszewski, as you consider yourself a good Catholic, how do you understand the doctrines of our church and what changes do you expect to bring about? We have our facts about our religion, but we want your answer, which should be based upon the facts only, for we don't want any gossip and meaningless words. We are tired already of loose tongues and silly arguments of yours. We want facts from your side and no gossip. Some time ago Mr. Olszewski put in an article in Lietuva stating that the editor of Rev. Kraucunas does not understand Catholicism. We never heard that Rev. Kraucunas had an editor. This is something new to us that Rev. Kraucunas had an editor of his own. These fantastic ideas were originated by Mr. Olszewski. We often wonder if Mr. Olszewski knows what he is talking about himself or others.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that an editor must belong to some newspaper, but Mr. Olszewski does not understand that.</p>
   <p>The editor of Katalikas answered briefly and shortly Olszewski's accusation that he is not competent to judge Catholic's editor's Catholicism. Mr. Olszewski has a lot of courage to stick his nose where he does not belong.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Olszewski and his henchmen became regular monkeys, and the only thing they lack is tails. Now they want to see us all become monkeys like them. It is strange to hear them call themselves 19th century intelligentsia. It is a well known fact that Mr. Olszewski made every effort to invite Dr. Szliupas; that he gave him a very nice reception and praised him as a great man in the field of literature, knowing that Dr. Szliupas is an enemy of the Catholic Church and its doctrines.</p>
   <p>Now we want the answer from Mr. Olszewski. The loyalty of a member to his church is determined by his associates. Mr. Olszewski calls himself a good Catholic and at the same time he associates with a man like Szliupas, who does not believe in the Supreme Being at all. However, he is still trying to bluff us about Catholicism. We don't understand what do you want from Catholics and what right have you to intrude in our affairs. The Catholics don't want any trouble with you nor discuss your principles and your aspect on the life of mankind. We have no desire whatever to discuss or debate on any subject at all. We want to be left alone and not be disturbed by anybody. The people of that type are like wolves who, covering themselves with a sheep's skin so that other people cannot recognize them, parade like innocent sheep. These people like to gossip about other people's affairs; they like to see other people suffer; they want to ruin other people's reputation by calling them thieves. It is disgraceful to our nation to call priests and bishops thieves. A man with common sense would never call the members of the Catholic Church thieves. Now we want to call Mr. Olszewski's attention again to the article which appeared in Lietuva not long ago. In this article he made the statement that our rector stole money from our church and divided this money with the bishop. But he denied the fact that he abused God in articles which were published some time ago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olszewski does not understand that by scorning the priests he is scorning God indirectly. Our Lord Jesus Christ said to the Apostles and their heirs, the bishops, "Those who scorn me, scorn you also."</p>
   <p>Mr. Olszewski and his clique may tell the truth and admit that Christ told the truth to his Apostles; yet he denies that he scorned God in his paper Lietuva.</p>
   
   <p>We want to see what will be the outcome, especially in Mr. Olszewski's case; where he stands and in what he believes. So far we know that he does not believe in Jesus Christ our Lord. If he tells that he believes in God, we are certain that he does not believe in the Christian god. In his case it must be another god whom Mr. Olszewski is worshiping, but it is not a Christian god. As a matter of fact he does not believe in anything as far as we know about Mr. Olszewski. He cannot fool the public and the members of our church saying that he is a Catholic. The people are too intelligent to be fooled by his propaganda and hypocrisy. In the first place Mr. Olszewski never was a Catholic at all; he only plays the game of "monkey sees, monkey does."</p>
   <p>He has never been sincere in his statements as long as he lived in our community. He is the type of a man whom nobody can trust, especially good Catholics.</p>
   <p>We will not answer any more of his lies and accusations. If we will continue to answer it, there won't be any end to it, because he is wading deeper and deeper and will never reach the end of the argument. This is about time to end arguments, for it does not pay to dispute with a man of his caliber. The people are becoming disgusted by reading the same lies, accusations and explanations over and over. We have maintained our silence before and we will continue to maintain our silence in our paper Katalikas. We made every effort to warn our readers from reading their propaganda against Catholic faith. This kind of propaganda is dangerous to the soul of mankind.</p>
