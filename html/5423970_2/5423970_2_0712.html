   <p>September 3, the Scientific Society of Simonas Daukantas held its monthly meeting at K. Liandanskas Hall; there it was decided to protest against the immoral conduct of Rev. Krawczunas, who seized the society's library, by-laws, and all the other belongings, shamelessly wronged the society, stopped the enlightenment and confidence of the new members of the society. Now the society does not have one copy of its by-laws, because the greedy priest gulped them up, and for this the society must bear resentment of its members who gave the money to make a new constitution. The society had about 500 volumes in the library, about 200 copies of the constitution, all the uniforms of ten marshalls and theatrical costumes. While the society belonged to the church, then as a matter of course, the library of the society was in the church hall, under the supposed supervision of Rev. Krawczunas. As long as the society held its celebrations in order to boost Rev. Krawczunas, everything was all right, but when the society stopped praising the priest, then the Rev. Krawczunas expelled the society from the hall and seized its books and all its belongings. For seizing of the society's property, the society sued Rev. Krawczunas, and the court ordered the priest to pay the society the sum of $181.75. But the Rev. Krawczunas refused to pay, and he appealed the case to the higher court, in order to weaken and stop the society from spreading the truth.</p>
   <p>This above mentioned damage to the society is not enough for the priest. In 1897, when the floor of the church hall was rotten, the priest begged all the societies to help him to put the new floor in the hall. That in return for helping to repair the floor, the societies will be permitted to hold meetings free of charge, and for banquets and theatrical performances, $15. But the societies that will not help remodel the floor, will be charged $25 for concerts, banquets, etc.</p>
   <p>The Simonas Daukantas society accepted the priest's proposition and donated $50 for repairing of the floors, because we believed that our spiritual leader would stand by his word. Now you see how the priest keeps his given word. Not only does the priest does not permit us to hold the meeting, but he seized all the belongings of the society.</p>
   
   <p>Where is the justice of such a spiritual leader? The damage he is doing to Lithuanians, even the Russian gendarmes could not do. He sunk the church property into secret debts; he is doing his best to Polanize the Lithuanian children; he seized the scientific society's library and its by-laws; he wants to destroy the society, to stop the enlightenment of Lithuanians; he uses his confessional box to forbid the Lithuanians to read books in order to stop the enlightenment among them. For such a doggish work the priest is unworthy of a good man's name; he is the horror, and the enemy of Lithuanians.</p>
