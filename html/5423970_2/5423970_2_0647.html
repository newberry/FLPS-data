   <p>Chicagoans will have an opportunity of seeing one of K. Jasiukaitis' plays, "Hungry People", this coming Saturday.</p>
   <p>Investigation reveals that the play will be well performed. Rehearsals are being held almost every night. The Dramatic Circle hopes to make this its most successful presentation. We shall not be wrong when we say that the performance will be just that.</p>
   <p>The name of Konstantinas Jasiukaitis attests to the excellence of the play. In addition, the new director of the Dramatic Circle, Mr. J. Briedis, assures us that the amateur artists selected by him will faithfully portray what the dramatist has intended in his play.</p>
   <p>Finally, the occasion for the performance will itself, it is expected, attract the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Lithuanians of Chicago and the suburbs. The program is sponsored, not for profit or as a business venture, but for a charitable purpose. All the proceeds are to be given to the ailing writer and former director of the Dramatic Circle, Bruno Vargsas. As you probably know, Bruno Vargsas has been ill for fourteen months. His illness has occasioned a loss to the Chicago Lithuanians. They have missed this talented theatrical director and dramatist.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we expect that Chicagoans will remember all this, and will gladly attend the performance being given for his benefit.</p>
