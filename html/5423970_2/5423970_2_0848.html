   <p>p.4....There is a rumor afoot that the Lithuanian Catholic priests in Chicago are making plans to convert their weekly "Draugas" (The Friend) into a daily newspaper, "in order that the Lithuanian Catholics also may have at least one daily newspaper." Apparently the priests do not consider the Chicago Lithuanian daily "Katalikas" (The Catholic) as a Catholic newspaper.</p>
   <p>It is said that hurried preparations are being made to launch the Catholic daily as soon as possible.</p>
