   <p>The West Pullman Lithuanian Benefit Society presented a program on February 12. A one-act play, "The Thief," was performed by members of the Lithuanian Women's Circle of Roseland. The acting was splendid, and pleased the audience. The play itself is short but unusually interesting.</p>
   <p>There were several declamations and monologues after the presentation of the play. A woman who recently arrived from Riga delivered an especially good declamation that caused many to cry, and brought demands for an encore. Two monologues, "The Old Maid", recited by Miss L. Dauksas, of Chicago, and "The Bachelor", recited by K. Sirvinskas, were very well presented. Many others, too numerous to mention, participated in the program.</p>
   <p>The program was followed by dancing, one of the features being "The Flying Mail". Two prizes, a bracelet and a box of candy, were offered. The first was won by Miss P. Likas, the second by Miss L. Dauksas. The audience was by no means small, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and the sponsors apparently made a profit.</p>
