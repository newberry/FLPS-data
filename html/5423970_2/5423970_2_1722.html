   <p>In the local Lithuanian newspapers, very seldom can one see mention of the Lithuanian Salesmen's Association, although it was organized in 1907, and at present has fifty members.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this organization is to unite all the Lithuanian salesmen--to assist them in times of sickness--to help them find better jobs. The Lithuanians can speak several languages. Why should they work in the Stock Yards, etc., when they can get better jobs in places where people who speak several languages are always in demand. Join our organization; we will help you find a better job, one with better pay than you are receiving in a factory.</p>
   <p>This organization participates in cultural activity. It has supported the publication of the books of Dr. V. Kuditka. This organization has joined the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association for the purpose of building a Lithuanian hall in Chicago.</p>
