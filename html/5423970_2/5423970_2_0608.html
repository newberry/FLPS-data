   <p>Short Sketch.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Drama Lovers Circle was organized in the year of 1911. During the last 26 years it has been working in the theatrical field. For a long time the Circle was the greatest drama power in Roseland, and this cultural work was done with great devotion.</p>
   <p>Only in recent years, when the depression came, has the Circle suffered and its activities stopped. The members of the Circle have worked in other societies, even though the circumstances were unfavorable.</p>
   <p>During its existence, the Scene Circle (sic) performed sixty-nine plays. For various societies it performed thirty-seven plays, for which it received about $1,000. For the Circle itself there were performed twenty-eight plays; seventeen of the performances gave a profit of $800, while seven performances gave a deficit of $200. From all the Circle's performances the profit was $600. Several</p>
   <span class="page-break">\22</span>
   <p>plays were performed free (of charge) for the benefit of the Aurora Library.</p>
   <p>This year the idea was brought forth of liquidating the Drama Lovers Circle, but after discussion it was decided to leave it as it is and try to renew its activities.</p>
   <p>Many of the organizers still are active in the Circle. If any of them quit the Scene Lovers Circle (sic), they were forced to do so by the living conditions. The old members that still belong to the Circle are B. Liudkevicius, A. Narbutas, A. Jocius, J. Grybas, Mr. and Mrs. Dambrauskas, the singer Mrs. Pazarskiene, Griskenas, K. Baronas, Vitkus, Andrijauskas, S. Diluis, and others.</p>
