   <p>A gigantic international choral contest is being planned in Chicago. It is scheduled to take place sometime during the middle of the month of June. The proceeds from the contest will be used for the relief of Polish war victims in Poland.</p>
   <p>Choral groups of eighteen or twenty different nationalities will participate in the contest. The winning group will receive a prize of five hundred dollars. The judge of the contest will probably be Paderewski, world famous pianist.</p>
   <p>The Biruta Chorus received an invitation to participate in the contest. The invitation was sent to Mr. Anthony Pocius, director of the Chorus.</p>
   <p>At first it was believed that the contest was being planned only by the Poles and that only Polish choral groups would participate. For that reason Mr. Pocius <span class="page-break">2</span>and other members of the Biruta Chorus declined to accept an invitation to participate in such a contest. However, further inquiry revealed that all national groups in Chicago have been invited to participate in the contest.</p>
   <p>Mr. Butkus, who is president of the Biruta Society, was appointed to contact the arrangements committee of the contest. He explained to the committee that Lithuanian war victims are also in need of relief and requested that a part of the proceeds from the contest go toward the relief of war victims in Lithuania. It was agreed that sixty per cent of the price of every ticket sold by the Lithuanians shall go toward the relief of Lithuanian war victims. Mr. Butkus recommended that this money be equally apportioned among the three Lithuanian war relief funds that have been set up by the three different Lithuanian factions in Chicago.</p>
   <p>However, it has not yet been definitely decided whether the Biruta Chorus will participate in the contest.</p>
