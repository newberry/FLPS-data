   <p>Dr. A. L. Graiciunas has just published a pamphlet entitled Liaudies Universitetas (Peoples' University) in which the suggestion is made that a long series of lectures on subjects from all branches of knowledge be prepared and delivered before Lithuanian-American audiences. The successful realization of this idea requires organization along two distinct lines: (1), the organization of intellectuals who can prepare and deliver intelligent lectures; and (2), the organization of societies, lodges, and the general public, so that a sufficient number of people would attend the lecture forums.</p>
   <p>Dr. Graiciunas believes that his proposed Peoples' University can be successfully established only if it is organized on a businesslike basis. In his opinion the persons who prepare and deliver the lectures must be paid for their work, because that is the only way to attract the most capable people into this work. In other words, Dr. Graiciunas is attempting to introduce among Lithuanian-Americans something similar to the work that for many years has been carried on by the Chautauqua Society and the Russian Narodovoi Universitet (Peoples' University).</p>
   <p>It seems that Dr. Graiciunas has spent much time and energy in preparing and perfecting the plan. The matter deserves our sincere attention, and if properly directed, the plan should be a success. But whether or not it will be a success will largely depend on how it will be received by the Lithuanian-American public. Details of this project, together with the above-mentioned pamphlet, can be obtained by writing to or calling at the home of Dr. A. L. Graiciunas, 3310 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
