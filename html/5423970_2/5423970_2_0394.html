   <p>p. 8..... A workingman spends most of his life in providing for the material needs of life. He finds very little time to acquaint himself with the imperfections of life thru newspapers and books where he might gleam many valuable lessons of life.</p>
   <p>To most of our people a dramatical play is the most accessible and pleasant means of gaining an education. Lessons on desirable living may be learned from the drama, which depicts the story of human life and character in all its aspects. In a drama a small group of individuals depict in a concentrated form the evils and imperfections in the characters of thousands of different people.</p>

Maciulis, at 1126 W.18th St. This is a very impressive and educational play, dealing with temperance. It contains a moral for thousands of people. All Lithuanians are invited.</p>
