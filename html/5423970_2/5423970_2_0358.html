   <p>"The Chimney-Sweep and the Miller", a two-act operetta with songs and dances, will be presented by the Birute Society, under the direction of Stasys Simkus, on Saturday, November 23, 1918, at the M. Meldazis Hall, 2242-44 West 23rd Place, beginning at 7:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>Though this play has been presented by Birute several times, it will be repeated once more at the request of the public. And, it must be stated, the Birute Society will strive to present it this time as never before, for it is being directed by our honored composer, Stasys Simkus, and will be performed by selected artists. The operetta itself has been improved and brought up to date.</p>
   <p>After the presentation, the Birute Chorus will sing several very beautiful, <span class="page-break">2</span>new songs, under the direction of Mr. Stasys Simkus.</p>
   <p>There will be dancing to the music of the large and good Sarpalius Orchestra.</p>
   <p>Everybody is invited!</p>
