   <p>In the month of February a new newspaper was started in Chicago under the name Kurejas, (The Creator). It will be a weekly paper. As it seems from the first issue, the newspaper will be for the working class people, a liberal view, will stand for equality, will defend the working class in order to free the workers from the exploitation of capitalism. The writings will be based on criticism, will avoid personal attacks and slandering words; everyone will have an equal chance to express his views. We are wishing the best success for this new newspaper. The free thought newspapers are very few.</p>
