   <p>A new nonsectarian and nonpartisan Lithuanian mutual aid society has been organized recently in Chicago. The name of the new society will be "Vytis". [Translator's note: Vytis means "knight,"the national emblem of Lithuania.]</p>
   <p>Thanks to the untiring efforts of the organizers, the Society already has about thirty members. Other Lithuanians are urged to join now, because the entrance fee, which is at present very small, will be increased later on.</p>
   <p>At the first regular meeting of the Society, the following officers were elected: Constantine Pajauskas, president; William Vabalas, vice-president; Peter A. Zaleskas, recording secretary; Frank Bagdziunas, financial secretary;and L. Azukas, treasurer.</p>
   <p>Regular meetings of the Society will be held on the first Saturday evening of each month in Azukas Hall, 3301 South Auburn [now Lithuanica] Avenue.</p>
   <p>In order to give other Lithuanians an early opportunity to join this Society, a special meeting will be held in Azukas Hall on Saturday evening, October 28, at 7:30 P. M. All Lithuanians are invited to attend this meeting, get acquainted with the members, and join the Society.</p>
