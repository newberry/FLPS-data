   <p>On October 5 the Drama Society presented a good program at Meldazis Hall. At the beginning, Mr. P. Sarpalius played several violin solos and the public was very much pleased with his playing. Mr. K. Jurgelionis then recited Pushkin's monologue "The Miser Knight," and did it excellently. I must say that every actor could have learned much from Mr. Jurgelionis' presentation of this monologue. The one-act comedy "The Deaf Son-in-Law" was also performed. After the program there was dancing. Several scores of people attended this program.</p>
