   <p>January 28 the Women's Enlightenment Society presented "Beautiful Magdalene and Soldier Peter," a four-act melodrama dramatized by M. Dunduliene. There is not much to say about the play itself, since the story of "Beautiful Magdalene" is well known to Lithuanians--it was merely dramatized by Mrs. Dunduliene. After its presentation one wants to ask: for what reason was the play written, and why did the Enlightenment Society present it? Was it that Mrs. Dunduliene dramatized that story to become known as one of the literati? And did the Enlightenment Society use it in order to make money? One cannot find any other explanation.</p>
   <p>True, the Society profited more or less, but Mrs. Dunduliene hardly earns even small laurels for her literary pretensions, for the dramatization proved to be utterly poor! That is all that one can say about that play.</p>
   <p>As for presenting it, some may offer the excuse that other nationalities present <span class="page-break">2</span>similar fairy tales on the stage. They do, but other kinds and in a different way! They present opera stories for their elegance; they even present dramatized folk-stories, but written differently, acted differently, and with different sceneries.</p>
   <p>That was already the second poor program by the Women's Enlightenment society. Something better had been expected from the Enlightenment Society, but the expectations were not fulfilled. It seems the purpose of the Enlightenment Society [members] was to enlighten themselves and other women. Can that be expected by such presentations as "Magdalene"? Something better is needed for that.</p>
