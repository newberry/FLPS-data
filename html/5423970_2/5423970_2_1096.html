   <p>A new newspaper has appeared in Chicago under the name Katalikas, (The Catholic), published by the Rev. Krawczunas. The newspaper in its first issue states that its efforts will be to enlighten and to educate the Lithuanians in the Catholic spirit. Further, it gives an explanation of the holiday of the Three Kings, then the news from Lithuania, the news of the world and the news from America. Then the article, "The Maidens Mountain," (Panu Kalnas) and the story of the debtor. Instruction to the priests on how to preach sermons and about Lithuanian orthography.</p>
   <p>In the last instructive article it seems that they have taken the old material about the Lithuanian philology. Whereas the majority of the philologists of today state that the Lithuanian language is distinct, not related to the Slavonic languages, and they are holding that the Lithuanian language is older than the German and the Roman languages; that the Lithuanians in Europe lived on the Baltic Sea before the coming of the Germans and Slavs. This is recognized by many scientists. The Slavic philologists say that the Lithuanian language is not related to the Slavonic languages; also the German philologists admit that the Lithuanian language is not related to the German language.</p>
   <p>Even though this new newspaper is issued to fight against us, yet we are cordially greeting it without any envy. If the editor of this newspaper succeeds in bringing the people who are not reading any newspaper nor books to read his newspaper, this will be a great accomplishment. We are heartily wishing the paper success. Besides this we believe that Rev. Krawczunas, by having his own newspaper, will at last give an account of the condition of the parish budget, and will do away with all the scandal. In like manner he may explain why he is supporting with Lithuanian money the Polish school, where for instruction of the Lithuanian language, as we have heard, he gives only one hour per day to the teaching of Lithuanian by those who do not understand it.</p>
   <p>For whose benefit is he supporting the school? It is known very well that even in the province of Suvalki in Lithuania, the Russian government gave a better place for the Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>(R. Tr.: At that time in Lithuania, the Russian government prohibited the publishing of newspapers and books in the Lithuanian language).</p>
