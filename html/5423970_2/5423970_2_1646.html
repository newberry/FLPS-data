   <p>The Lithuanian Improvement and Benefit Lodge held its meeting on June 2nd at the Aurora Hall, Roseland, Ill. The recording secretary read the minutes and gave his report on the affairs of the lodge and its activities at this meeting. He also reported that the patient who was sick for a long time is well now, and that he will be able to attend the next meeting. This lodge will pay out a sick benefit to any member who is sick at the next semi-annual meeting, which will be held in the future.</p>
   <p>The committee which was elected to consolidate the small benefit societies into one lodge failed to accomplish its task. The members of the committee worked hard, attended local benefit society meetings, and made every effort to persuade the local societies to join in one lodge. The committee decided to postpone its work until a semi-annual meeting. The committee will then have more power to accomplish its purpose. Each member of the committee will have to contact the committee members of the local benefit societies, and explain to them the advantage of having one large lodge instead of having many small benefit societies.</p>
   <p>The same committee will examine the books of our lodge and will make a report at the semi-annual meeting, which will be held soon. It was decided by the members of the lodge to call a semi-annual meeting and to notify the members of the lodge by postal cards.</p>
   <p>At the meeting that evening there were a lot of people. We did not expect to have such a nice crowd at our ordinary meeting. Probably it was due to the warm weather we had that evening, and at the same time there might have been another reason for attending this meeting. The members of the lodge discussed the problems of the organization very seriously and came to agreements without the slightest opposition or argument. This lodge set a very good example by conducting meetings properly and maintaining good order during discussions. As many meetings as this lodge has had, there never had been any trouble at all. The members are proud of their lodge and its reputation as one of the best lodges in the Chicago vicinity. The people who belong to this lodge have demonstrated their loyalty to it. There are times when some of the members cannot attend all the meetings, but they send other people to take their places. There are no enemies among our members in this lodge because we have the same aim in life, and that is, to help our fellow workers in their struggle for existence.</p>
   <p>The membership drive of this lodge will end July 1, 1925. During this drive people will be able to join this lodge by paying only one dollar initiation fee and hereafter the initiation fee will be raised much higher. The age limit is 35 years and no more for new members who will be accepted in this lodge.</p>
   <p>The meeting dates of our lodge have been changed from the first Sunday of each month to the first Tuesday of each month, at the Aurora Hall, Roseland, Ill. The announcements of our meetings will be published in Vilnis and Naujienos. If you forget the date of our meetings, you will always be able to find the announcement in Vilnis and Naujienos.</p>
