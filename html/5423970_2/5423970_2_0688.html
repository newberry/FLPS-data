   <p>Last Sunday evening, November 14, there was a meeting of Lithuanian folklore collectors in Fellowship House, 831 West 33rd Place. The meeting was attended not only by Lithuanians but also by several non-Lithuanians who are interested in Lithuanian folklore.</p>
   <p>At this meeting an organization of Lithuanian folklore collectors was founded. Such a society had been planned for quite some time, as there is a fairly large number of Lithuanian folklore collectors in Chicago and vicinity. A number of non-Lithuanians have showered much praise upon the richness and beauty of Lithuanian folklore.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. Kasputis was elected secretary of the Lithuanian Folklore Society. The purpose of the Society is to collect Lithuanian folklore and acquaint foreigners (non-Lithuanians) with its richness and beauty.</p>
