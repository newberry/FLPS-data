   <p>Last Sunday, at Strumila Hall, the Birute Musical Society presented the melodrama "Birute." In comparison with its previous presentation of this melodrama, this performance was weak. It is true that the role of "Birute," by Miss Horodockaite, was excellent, but, in general, the performance was poor....The local artists were dissatisfied with the Birute's performance in this colony, because they gave their own presentation on the same day. For this reason the public was split; neither one had a large audience at its performance. The Birute Society must have suffered a loss, because such a spectacle costs much money to produce. The melodrama "Birute" is one of our most beautiful plays, and no other dramatic society can present it as well as the Birute Society. Another reason for the small audience was that they did not advertise enough.</p>
   <p>Dancing followed the play, and everyone had a pleasant time up to midnight.</p>
