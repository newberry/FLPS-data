   <p>In Chicago, December 19, 1897, there was organized a band of the best Lithuanian military musicians. The president is Mr. Czeslowas Zilewiczia.</p>
   <p>The new band plays on trumpets, clarinets, violins and other instruments. Societies which want to get good musicians at their balls, call on us.</p>
