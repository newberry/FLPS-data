   <p>Not long ago Miss Mary Radzeviciute came to Chicago from Brooklyn, New York, and opened a women's garment factory at 7759 South Halsted Street. It is very commendable that our competent Lithuanian women are going into business for themselves. From what we have heard, Miss Radzeviciute has experience in this line of business; therefore, we urge our Lithuanian women to go to a person of their own nationality when in need of goods in her line.</p>
