   <p>Sunday, November 5, 1899, in the memory of the honorable Lithuanian writer Simonas Daukantas yearly festival, the Simonas Daukantas Society will have its yearly celebration at the Freiheit Turner Hall, 3417 S. Halsted St.</p>
   <p>The celebration will be in the following manner: All the societies participating in this celebration will come to the Liandanskas Hall, 3301 S. Morgan St., from there at 3 P. M., will start in full parade and will march to the said hall. When all the public will be in the hall, the prominent speakers will deliver speeches, and after the speeches declamations and songs with music. After the program there will be a banquet. Three societies promised to participate in the celebration. They are: "The Truth Seekers," "The Liberty," and "The Grand Duke Gedeminas of Lithuania." They sent their delegates and promised to take part in this national festival. We believe that all the other Lithuanian societies will not refuse to participate in this national festival and will take part in this worthy national holiday, and will show that the Lithuanians in Chicago are still living. We are cordially inviting all Lithuanians to take part.</p>
