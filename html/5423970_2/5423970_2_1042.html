   <p>p.3.....Seeing such an unappeasable call for a Lithuanian socialist newspaper, the newly organized Lithuanian Socialist Party of America has decided to establish a weekly Lithuanian Socialist Newspaper under the title Kova (The Struggle). For that purpose all necessary preparations are being made: A printing shop has been purchased, literary material for the newspaper is being prepared, subscriptions and advertisements are being solicited. The newspaper will be published with the assistance of the Party and from the dues paid by subscribers.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian immigration in the United States is increasing noticeably. Year by year it is increasing not by hundreds but by thousands. Today there are 400,000 Lithuanians in the United States. It is very obvious that the number of our immigrants has considerably increased in our colonies <span class="page-break">\2</span>during the fast twenty years. Although their number has increased considerably, spiritual and cultural progress is not apparent. Comparing the Lithuanian population with other nationalities living in the United States, we are not publishing enough books and newspapers for our people. At the present time we have about ten (10) newspapers for 400,000 people or one newspaper to every 40,000 people. This includes two periodicals an is inadequate for our population in this country. Other nationalities in this country have more newspapers and other periodicals for the same number of people. We are not comparing favorably with other nationalities in our cultural development. I am very certain that we will not find any other nationality as far behind in cultural development, as we are today. So far we have hardly made any progress in education.</p>
   <p>We are standing where we stood one hundred years ago. We have not made enough effort to enlighten our people and so other nationalities in the United States have advanced far ahead of us in education..</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Up until now all our newspapers are making an effort to serve all the Lithuanians in a general way in a non-partisan capacity, that is, they do not adhere to the principles of any particular group.</p>
   <p>To give all Lithuanians their influence for the promotion of cultural and political consciousness is the goal of all newspapers, including the Vienybe Lietuviu (Unity of Lithuanians), Lietuva (Lithuania), and even Saule (The Sun). However, they are not to point out, on the other hand, great factors and instruments of educational progress within our circles. They do not properly aid in developing our people to attain the height of educational standard enjoyed by other nationality groups.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we need at least one socialist newspaper that will follow principles of socialism and defend the needs of working people. The people sell their physical power to the capitalists, who exhaust their last ounce of energy, finally they lose their health and become weaklings during the rest of their <span class="page-break">\4</span>lives. This is the result of the capitalistic system. Not only do the people become maimed; but their children become weaklings as the result of the capitalistic system.</p>
   <p>So far we have not had any socialistic newspaper in the United States, but all other nationalities have them. It is very important for us Lithuanians to have at least one socialistic newspaper wherein our workers can express themselves and discuss the affairs of the labor movement. No worker can exist without a socialistic paper if he wants to know about the labor movement in present society. Since all the Lithuanians are workers, they must have a socialistic newspaper if they want to learn something about the labor movement in the United States. The aims and needs of all Lithuanian workers are the same as the aims and needs of all Lithuanian workers of the world. There isnno justice under capitalism.</p>
   <p>All the workers are compelled to unite against capitalistic injustice to labor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It is a well known fact that we still have capitalistic servants or their sympathizers, especially, the Catholic priests. These priests are not only the capitalistic sympathizers, but the enemies of labor. They want to keep the masses opened as much as possible. These priests use every means they can to thwart the educational progress of the masses. They realize the fact that ignorant masses can be exploited much easier than educated masses. But when the workers reach a greater level of class consciousness, the influence of the priests over them will disappear.</p>
   <p>Now is an opportune time for Lithuanians to have a socialistic newspaper, not only for agitating purposes; but for awaking the spirit of the proletariat, which has been in a state of slumber for many generations.</p>
   <p>At present the treasury fund of the newspaper is very small. It will be difficult to start a paper with such a small sum. Therefore, we invite all sympathizers of the labor movement to help us by subscribing and getting subscribers to the socialist newspaper, Kova (The Struggle) from anyone else in sympathy with the labor movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>We are confident that no worker will ignore our plea for help, and we hope that every Lithuanian worker will contribute something to that newspaper fund. This newspaper is very important, not to one individual, but to all workers in the United States. Let us all work for the benefit of the workers. We are inviting all the socialistic intelligentsia to cooperate with us in publishing a new socialistic newspaper.</p>
   <p>Subscriptions, contributions and the articles should be sent to the following address: Kova (The Struggle) Editor's office, 412 Siegel Street, Philadelphia, Penn., Central Committee.</p>
