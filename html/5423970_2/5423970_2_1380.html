   <p>A school was opened last Wednesday at 3329 Auburn Avenue, on the first floor. The rooms are large, clean and light. We are teaching three evenings in the week. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7:30 to 10 o'clock in the evening. Those who were attending this school are very pleased with the teaching.</p>
   <p>We are teaching how to write and read English, Lithuanian and German; also arithmetic, history, geography, grammar, and other useful things. Most of the time is devoted to English, since this language is the most essential to Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians, now you have an opportunity to learn English. Therefore, do not waste your time, devote it to study. Education does not ask for meals, does not occupy space. He who has an education has the greater wealth of all. Those who wish to attend our school come to the above address in the evening, or to John Bagdziunas, 931 33rd St.</p>
