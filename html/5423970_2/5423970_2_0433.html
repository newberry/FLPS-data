   <p>Recently, various new theatrical groups, circles, societies, etc., have been organized among us. Every group is trying to present some spectacle or other, so that at present we often have in Chicago as many as seven Lithuanian spectacles on the same day.</p>
   <p>In looking at it, it seems that we ought to be proud that we have such a tendency towards this art. But when we look at it closer, it seems to be time to do something about it, in order to bring about order in Lithuanian dramatic activity in Chicago.</p>
   <p>True enough that in Chicago there is not a small number of Lithuanians. Even so, we have not enough lovers of the theater to support seven or more spectacles presented on the same day at different places. With such a distribution of the audience, many a time it happens that none of the theatrical groups is able to cover its expenses because of the lack of attendance at each one. Therefore, many of these theatrical groups are very badly handicapped by financial losses. If such a condition prevails, we can easily guess that in time many of these theatrical groups will disappear; or that if they continue to exist, their existence will be miserable.</p>
   <p>Thus, from a financial point of view, the condition of our theatrical organizations is not so favorable.</p>
   <p>Looking at them from the point of view of art, we can see nothing delightful in them. Each of the theatrical organizations is striving to beat the other in presenting a given spectacle at a date earlier than the other group. The consequence of such competition is that the spectacles are presented in a hurry, without proper preparation; therefore, from the point of view of art, such a performance of any spectacle is a complete fiasco. They have no time to learn the lines accurately, and have no money to arrange for proper scenery. At the same time, our audiences are not as they were four or five years ago; they will not be satisfied with any kind of performance. Now, the audiences demand better presentation, correct scenery, and better costumes. To present any ordinary spectacle in Chicago today will cost over one hundred dollars. It is good luck if the attendance is large; if not, then look at the deficit. A deficit kills the energy of the artists, and of those who have made the arrangements. Everything, then--as the saying is--is going to the devil.....</p>
   <p>In discussing this matter, I want to attract the attention of the theatrical organizations to this point, that their affairs should be placed in order. It is quite clear that we do not want to have seven or nine spectacles presented in the same evening; rather we desire to have one good performance; also, we want to have, instead of several weak theatrical groups, one strong Lithuanian theatrical organization in Chicago, and that the branches of such an organization should do it no harm, but instead support it.</p>
   <p>In brief, whoever believes that he has theatrical affairs close to his heart should start with the idea of organizing all the theatrical groups into one Lithuanian theatrical association of Chicago. Sooner or later we will be forced to do that, because the art of theater, the public, and we ourselves--are demanding it. The sooner we accomplish it, the better it will be for us.</p>
