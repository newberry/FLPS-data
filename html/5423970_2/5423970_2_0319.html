   <p>The Birute Music and Dramatic Society has just received a gift of three new songs from our famous vocal artist and composer Mikas Petrauskas, former Chicagoan and founder of the Birute Society, who is now living in Lithuania. The names of the songs are: "Oi Graziai Zydi" (Budding Beautifully); "Sia Nedelia" (This Week); and "Dega Ugni" (Burning Fire).</p>
   <p>The society also received a number of beautiful Lithuanian songs from Mr. Ciurlionis, world-famous Lithuanian musician, composer, and painter. These songs were delivered to the society in person by Mr. Zmuidinavicius (Zemaitis), famous Lithuanian sculptor and painter, who is in Chicago on a visit from Lithuania.</p>
   <p>These songs will aid greatly in the uplift of music among the Lithuanians of Chicago. Mr. J. Ilgaudas, president of the Birute Society, thanks <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>our artists most heartily for their valuable gifts.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ilgaudas also thanks the Rev. Ambrozaitis, pastor of the Our Lady of Vilna Lithuanian Roman Catholic Parish, for his cooperation and generosity in permitting the society to use the church hall every Saturday evening without charge. If other Lithuanian priests of Chicago would follow the fine example of the Rev. Ambrozaitis in supporting the musical and dramatic efforts of our people then we would be able to make more rapid strides forward, We should not permit our differences in political affiliations or religious beliefs to stand in our way, because they have nothing to do with art.</p>
   <p>Let us take a greater interest in music. Surely every Lithuanian can afford to spend. At least two hours every week to learn how to sing beautiful songs. We all know that songs sweeten our lives and fill us with energy to work. Let us take full advantage of the opportunities that are afforded by the Birute Society to develop our musical and dramatic talents.</p>

Place, and every Saturday evening at the Our Lady of Vilna church hall, which is located on West 23rd, Place near Western Avenue.
