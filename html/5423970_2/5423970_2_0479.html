   <p>The Drama Society presented T. Rutkovskis' three-act farce, "Fair Weather Storm," at the Hull House Theater last Sunday.....</p>
   <p>Speaking of the acting, it must be admitted that the actors played their roles well, though several were lacking in action and, as is commonly said, had not "entered into" their roles. Among these I would place Mrs. Slikiene and Mr. J. Sankunas. The voice and gestures of the former, especially in sad scenes, were too similar and monotonous, though she can otherwise act quite well. J. Sankunas, in his role of a lawyer, was less impressive than he has been in his usual servant roles.....</p>
   <p>Miss Stravinskaite made her first stage appearance in the role of "Katherine".....The other actors, J. Briedis, B. Vaitiekunas, Moskiene, M. Montviliute, Stravinskas and A. Vizbaras played their roles very well.</p>
