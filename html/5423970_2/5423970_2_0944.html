   <p>The Naujienos first appeared in Chicago two years ago yesterday, March 19. Initially published as a weekly, it later became the first and largest Lithuanian daily. Now it is the only daily.</p>
   <p>A grand program was arranged in the Pilsen Auditorium yesterday to observe in a fitting manner the newspaper's second anniversary. The large hall was filled before the program began.....The people came from everywhere to celebrate the completion of two years of fighting and hard work which made their Naujienos what it is today. They came to rejoice in the fruits of their efforts. And they all rejoiced, for there was reason to do so. Other dailies had been published and had gone out of existence, but their Naujienos continued to grow and become stronger. Today it is so strong, so widely circulated, that according to P. Grigaitis [the paper's editor], an earthquake would be required to destroy it.</p>
   
   <p>The program opened with the playing of the "Marseille"....by the Progressive Musician's Federation of America. Then the president of the Naujienos Publishing Company delivered a short speech. Briefly he stressed the importance of the daily to Lithuanian workers, and he invited the friends of the Naujienos to increase their support and to help the paper to attain a wider circulation. The program continued with songs by the Aidas Chorus from Kensington, songs by F. Jakutis, recitations by J. Briedis, and violin selections by little Filipavicius.</p>
   <p>The master of ceremonies, A. Petratis, then introduced P. Grigaitis, editor of the Naujienos, who was greeted with thunderous applause. And why not? Upon his shoulders had been placed the greatest and heaviest burden--that of conducting the Naujienos in such a manner that it would be not merely a newspaper, but a mirror of the lives of the Lithuanian workers, pointing the way to and disseminating enlightenment and understanding. And he has successfully accomplished his task. Most of the credit for the success of the Naujienos belongs to him. It was for this reason that the public greeted P. Grigaitis so warmly.</p>
   <p>The hall was quiet as Mr. Grigaitis began his speech; the expectant audience wished to hear every word. The speaker explained why the Naujienos was established, and discussed the policy of the publication. The Naujienos was established, because some of the Lithuanian newspapers in Chicago were dragging their readers to Rome and the others were preparing to follow them. The Lithuanian workers' movement was either ignored or derided. The Naujienos did not adopt this policy. It was and still is with the workers, and continues to conquer new fields.</p>
   <p>The Naujienos had, at the very beginning, more readers than the older newspapers have even now. This was a result of the fact that the Naujienos is not the property of one individual, but of the people themselves, the Lithuanian workers. When the war--the awful slaughter--began in Europe, it was necessary to give the people the latest news in its true light. That is why the publishers decided to make the Naujienos a daily. Although the treasury was empty, the workers knew that they could accomplish anything they really wanted to. And they succeeded. Today the Naujienos is the largest Lithuanian newspaper and the only Lithuanian have never had such a large daily. The Naujienos has become influential among the people, and has even compelled its enemies to pay it homage.</p>
   <p>When other newspapers attempted to swim under water where they hoped to encounter but little resistance, they became waterlogged and finally succumbed. The Naujienos, however, bowed to nothing; it overcame many obstacles because it is published not for profit but for an ideal. The Naujienos is a progressive and revolutionary newspaper. It does not classify Lithuanians by religious creeds, but distinguishes them as workers or capitalists. And since practically all Lithuanians are workers, the Naujienos has the largest field in which to thrive.</p>
   <p>The Naujienos will have to grow and thrive until it reaches and wins over all the Lithuanian workers. The Naujienos, like the workers, has nothing to lose but its chains, and it can win the whole world. Today, when the most awful slaughter is in progress in Europe, the people permit themselves to be overcome by sorrow and apathy, and for this reason the present is the best time for the reactionaries to strengthen themselves. And they are not asleep at the switch. One of the worst and most hypocritical forms of reaction is clericalism. Clericalism is the greatest enemy of the workers because it keeps them in ignorance and shatters their unity. Taking advantage of the chaos in Europe, our clericals have become active and are getting stronger. Hitherto they have spoken only of the love of one's neighbors. Now that they have become more powerful, they are calling everybody to battle, and they plan to crush all those who do not serve them. The Naujienos accepts this challenge and is determined to fight clericalism until the latter is completely crushed. The audience greeted this expression with enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>In concluding his address, P. Grigaitis invited everyone to do even more for the newspaper. He urged the audience to become members of the Naujienos Company in order that the Naujienos have a wider circulation, and be able to attain its aims more quickly. He expressed the hope that next year, when the third anniversary will be observed, an eight-page Naujienos will be published, not three but six times a week, for the aim of the Naujienos is not to make a profit but to give the readers a better and larger newspaper, so that new hosts of readers can be won. It is necessary for everyone to do just a little more work!</p>
   <p>Sustained applause followed Mr. Grigaitis' speech, which pleased everyone. Everyone was happy, and everyone pledged himself to greater support for their Naujienos. Those who were not members [i. e. shareholders in the publishing company] hastened to buy shares right on the spot.</p>
   <p>A male chorus then sang, and a souvenir photograph of the assembly was taken. After a period of dancing, the crowd dispersed. All were happy on their way home, and rejoiced in the beautiful results of their efforts. Observing all this, one wants to shout with P. Grigaitis: "Let us keep busy, and the Lithuanian world will be ours!"</p>
