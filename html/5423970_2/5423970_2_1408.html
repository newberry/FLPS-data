   <p>p. 8- Blood was spilled on the streets of Kaunas, Lithuania, on Jan. 19, 1925, when the Kaunas street employees appealed to Mayor Vileisis not to cut their wages. Mayor Vileisis summoned the police and answered the request for bread by the city employees with hot lead, while the mounted police trampled over the bodies of the hungry workers.</p>
   <p>That happened in the city of Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania!</p>
   <p>As a commemoration of that unhappy incident, a mass meeting with orations will be held on Jan. 19, at the Milda Hall, 3142 S. Halsted Street. The meeting will start promptly at 8:00 P. M. The main speakers will be comrades J. Gasiunas and H. Jagminas.</p>
   
   <p>It is the duty of all Lithuanian workers to come to this meeting and honor those comrades who have lost their lives in the class-war struggles. The meeting will be held under the auspices of the Lithuanian Section of the International Labor Defense.</p>
