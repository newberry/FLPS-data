   <p>The Chicago Lithuanian community is young. During the last two years they have shown real activity among themselves. We must say, that the Chicago Lithuanians accomplished more than the Lithuanians of any other city, where they had been living for the last few scores of years.</p>
   <p>We have eleven Lithuanian societies, nine societies of men, two societies of women, and a cluster of the Lithuanian Catholic Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>Of those mentioned societies, we have among them three best societies: one is the Simonas Daukantas society which has its own library; society of the Grand Army of the Duke Vytantas, has uniforms and can participate in any parade; and the society of musicians can go on parades, play on concerts and festivals.</p>
   <p>We have eight Lithuanian political clubs organized into the league as a <span class="page-break">2</span>result of political activity a few Lithuanians have the city jobs.</p>
   <p>On Bridgeport we have a church and fourteen lots. Now, north side Lithuanians have decided to buy a church for $10,000</p>
   <p>But now in the last few days Lithuanians began to talk about one of the most important organization that should be established among us, the Lithuanian Building and Loan Association. Rev. Kranczunas called a meeting of a few Lithuanians and now they are working on the constitution. When the plans are ready for such organization, the meeting will be called for the final organization of this society.</p>
   <p>Such financial organization is one of the best for Lithuanians. We are living in this country. Why then should we give our money to others? They are making profits and building up their business with our money. Why then cannot we make our money work for us. We are buying buildings, lots, looking for leans. Why then must we pay interest to others, when we can pay it to our-selves?</p>

   <p>Many Lithuanians lost their money in Jewish banks, but the money cannot be lost in a building and loan association.</p>
   <p>This coming Sunday a meeting of this new financing organization will be held. If our Lithuanians want to protect their own money they should come to this meeting, hear the plans and discussions, Join this organization, and help to build the Lithuanian business.</p>
