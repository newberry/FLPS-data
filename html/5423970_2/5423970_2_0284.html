   <p>On Saturday, May 23, eight choirs of Chicago held a conference. At this conference there were twenty delegates. The main topic discussed was whether the choirs should form a non-partisan organization or one that would adopt some definite attitude in regard to politics. This question was submitted to the delegates to decide for themselves by voting. After counting the votes, we found that fifteen votes were in favor of being connected with a political party and five votes favored a non-partisan attitude. At this conference two different parties were represented, the Socialist Party and the Progressive Party. The majority of delegates at this conference favored the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party delegates voted unanimously and showed their strength by an overwhelming vote. Now there is another question. What name are we going to give this alliance? This question created many arguments among delegates, for they could not agree on the new name for this alliance. One suggestion was made to name the alliance the Lithuanian Alliance of America Socialist Choirs. Some <span class="page-break">2</span>of the members opposed the word Socialist and requested its rejection, but the majority voted for retaining the name without making any change. Ten votes were cast in favor of accepting the name as it is, and nine votes were against it. But the majority won and the name will remain as "Lithuanian Alliance of America Socialist Choirs." A suggestion was made to elect one delegate from each choir for making the constitution for this new organization. Two temporary organizers were elected, J. Uktueris (Kuzmickis) and secretary J. Jankauskas. Mr. J. Katilius was elected as a member of the executive board, whose duties are to contact the composers and provide this organization with the latest Lithuanian songs.</p>
   <p>At this conference a great advance has been made by uniting all choirs into one organization. The delegates who were sent to this conference have accomplished a very important task which was entrusted to them. We hope this organization will continue to exist for a good many years.</p>
