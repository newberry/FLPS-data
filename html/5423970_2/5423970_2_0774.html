   <p>The Lithuanian Public Library on the West Side is meeting with the increasing support of the Lithuanian residents of that section because it is well supervised. Last Sunday the White Star Benefit Club decided to become a supporter of the Library and donated ten dollars from its treasury. The Women's Our Lady of Vilna Society did the same that evening, donating fifteen dollars from its treasury.</p>
   <p>At present the library is supported by nine societies.....</p>
