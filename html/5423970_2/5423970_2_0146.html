   <p>On December 13, at M. Meldazis Hall, West Side, and on December 14, at Freiheit Turner Hall, Bridgeport, concerts were given by the Lietuva Band. At both concerts the program was the same. The band consisted of eleven persons directed by Mr. J. Jakaitis.</p>
   <p>At both concerts, the audience was small; especially at the first one, for only several people were present. At the second concert, in Freiheit Turner Hall, the behavior of some of the people in the audience was very bad. They disturbed the people who came to hear the concert. After the concert, there were dances. During the dances, several European pieces were played.</p>
   <p>Taking these two concerts into consideration, the Lietuva Band will certainly have to dig deep in its pockets to cover expenses.</p>
