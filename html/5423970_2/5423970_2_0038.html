   <p>The bank of Anthony Olsevskis (Olszewski), the oldest and largest Lithuanian bank in Chicago, is more successful and prosperous than the bank of his neighbor [John Tananevicius]. Olsevskis' bank will soon become a state bank. According to reliable information, all the necessary preparations have been completed; the requisite pacers have been sent to Springfield, Illinois, where permits for state banks are issued.</p>
   <p>When the present bank of Olsevskis becomes a state bank, it will be known as the State Reserve Bank of Illinois.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The bank of Olsevskis was located in the Lietuva Building, where the newspaper Lietuva (Lithuania) was published, at 3252 South Halsted Street.]</p>
