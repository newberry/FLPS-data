   <p>Branch 22 of the Lithuanian Socialist League is sponsoring something unusual--a debate and discussion--on Friday, April 14, at Meldazis Hall, 2242 West 23rd Place. P. Grigaitis, editor of the Naujienos, has been invited to be one of the principals in the debate. He will speak on the subject, "Is Private Property Necessary?" The subject is very interesting and highly instructive to every worker. For that reason, it is believed that Lithuanians not only from the West Side, but also from other Chicago Lithuanian districts will attend. The debate will start at 8 P. M. Admission is free to all! Everyone should be on time, since it is intended to begin the debate promptly at the announced hour. At the conclusion of the debate, the audience will be permitted to ask questions and express opinions.</p>
