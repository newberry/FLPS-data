   <p>p.4.... Today this club is known as the Lithuanian University Club, and as several years ago, its aims are those embodied in its constitution. It is composed of young men and women who have fifteen or more semester hours of college credit. They are all Lithuanians or Lithuanian descent, and only such are allowed to join the club, with the exception of any individual who"has rendered a distinguished service to the Lithuanian Nationality." In brief, the Lithuanian University Club exists to "unite American university students of Lithuanian descent" and to "render possible aid to American Lithuanian students" - "to promote and encourage cultural activities" and to "sponsor, promulgate and take part in any movement intended to benefit the Lithuanian people and their descendants" and to be "nonpartisan to questions of religious and political origin."</p>
