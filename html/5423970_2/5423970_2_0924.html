   <p>In the last issue of the Lietuva, we warned our people to beware of all agitators who in any way whatever urge opposition to government laws pertaining to army service. We had good reasons for warning our people; agitation against war registration was carried on by some orators and certain newspapers, and now many misled young men who failed to register are sitting in jails.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that these agitators will not publicly make such direct statements as "Do not register!" or, "Do not support the Government!" If they would say these things openly, they would soon be grabbed by their necks and thrown into jail. However, agitators guard their own (but not others') necks very carefully. Instead of making such open statements, they spread discontent among the people with "criticism," regardless of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>whether that "criticism" is honest or not.</p>
   <p>We are not concerned about who makes such criticism, whether the editors of the Naujienos (News) or anyone else. Our concern is to prevent our people from being misled by this criticism and from getting into trouble, as has happened to many in connection with the war registration.</p>
   <p>Those who labor only for the welfare of the people do not take advantage of certain situations to promote the selfish interests of their political groups. But [Mr. P. Grigaitis,] the president of the Lithuanian Workers' Council and editor of the newspaper Naujienos, is really attempting to take advantage of the present war situation to promote that shady creation of his, the Lithuanian Workers' Council. In addition, we know that the Naujienos has been supporting and is still supporting the war resolution of the Socialist Party. Among other things, that resolution endorsed the organization of the masses against war registration. Our readers can obtain detailed and authentic information on this point by reading the article entitled "A <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Socialist on Socialists and War", written by Upton Sinclair and published in this issue of the Lietuva.</p>
   <p>We do not desire to criticize the motives of the editors of the Naujienos. They probably believe in what they advocate, and they will answer for their own deeds. But we consider it to be our duty to explain to the people the fate that awaits them if they listen to agitators of every description. The Naujienos calls our warning to the people a "petty denunciation". That is nonsense! What the Naujienos writes or does is known not only to us but to all people. And to state what everyone already knows cannot be called a denunciation. Therefore, the editors of the Naujienos are quite unnecessarily placing a martyr's crown upon their heads. In addition, the editors of the Naujienos attempt to extenuate their conduct by saying that they submit news to the people "impartially," so that people may know how to act.</p>
   <p>Enough of all this! Enough! The news in the Naujienos is just as impartial as the "news" about quack doctors that appears in the advertising section of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>that paper. (The Lietuva stopped accepting advertisements from quack doctors a long time ago!) Everyone who reads the Naujienos is very well acquainted with its brand of impartiality and knows how the newspaper supplies the people with news "so they may know how they should act".</p>
   <p>You masters of the Naujienos, read in the "Views on Many Topics", in this issue of the Lietuva, the complaint of one person whose pockets were emptied, and who was driven into a serious disease, by quack doctors with whom he became acquainted through advertisements in the Naujienos. You know that those doctors are fraudulent, and you know that they are sucking the blood of the workers like parasites! In accepting their advertisements, are you assisting the people to "know how they should act"? Where is that impartiality you speak of? You are selling your readers to fraudulent doctors for the filthy dollars which you receive for their advertisements, and yet you dare to speak about "morality"!</p>
   <p>In view of these facts, how can we trust that your motives are good? Cleanse <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>yourselves at least of some of the dirt! And until you do that, and as long as you continue to "sell" disease to workers for the filthy dollars of fraudulent doctors, keep your mouths shut and don't talk about "morality"! Those who are not concerned with the welfare of the workers in one respect can hardly be concerned with the welfare of the workers in other respects. From your acts, we can see that you are solely interested in making money and in promoting your narrow politics. These very same accusations are also made against you by your own friends--the Socialists.</p>
