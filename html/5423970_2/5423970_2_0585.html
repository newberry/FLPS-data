   <p>Last Sunday, at the Turner Hall, the Kudirka Theatrical Society presented a comedy, "The Uncle Arrived."</p>
   <p>Since the priest denounced from the pulpit this theatrical performance and told the people not to go to see it, not many people were present.</p>
   <p>It looks as if the society will cover its expenses, even though there were not many people at the theater.</p>
