   <p>The Chicago Lithuanian societies are stepping forward, as usual, to support a worthy cause. Many societies have already donated money, and more societies are coming forth with donations each month, to cover the costs of publishing L. Sernas' written works. Each of the societies is donating twenty-five dollars.</p>
   <p>On February 3 the Sacred Heart of Jesus Society donated twenty-five dollars from its treasury. A letter from the supreme secretary of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, regarding this matter, was read at the Society's meeting and the members readily agreed to the donation.</p>
   <p>On February 23 another organization, the St. Matthew the Apostle Society, which always supports Lithuanian causes, did the same thing, donated twenty-five dollars.</p>
   <p>In February the St. Joseph Society also discussed briefly the question of a <span class="page-break">2</span>donation. Not wishing to lag behind the other societies, it donated twenty-five dollars to the publication fund.</p>
   <p>A great many Lithuanian patriots belong to these societies. They are interested in worthy deeds, no matter who is doing them. If they see that a certain project will benefit the Lithuanians, they support it sincerely, as much as they can.</p>
