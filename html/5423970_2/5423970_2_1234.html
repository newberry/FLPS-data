   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society reports that the publication of the literary works of Vincas Kudirka (1858-1899), famous Lithuanian patriot and author of the Lithuanian national anthem, will be completed early in January of next year. The works will comprise six or seven volumes. The first two volumes have already been printed. The total cost will be about $3,500.</p>
   <p>The necessary funds for the publication of the books have been raised by the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, which is headed by B. K. Balutis. Donations to the fund have been made by various Lithuanian organizations and individuals in the United States. Collections toward the fund have also been made at various Lithuanian gatherings in America. The names of all organizations and individuals who have contributed $10 or more to the fund will appear in the published volumes. The Society has a contract with the printing firm of Otto Von Mauderode, located in Tilsit, Minor Lithuania, for the publication of the books. All material for the volumes has been collected by Juozas Gabrys, famous Lithuanian patriot, who was the first to make the suggestion for their publication.</p>
   <p>Every member of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society will receive a complete set of the books free of charge. Every organization and individual who contributed a substantial sum to the publication fund will also receive a free set.</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society is a non-partisan, non-sectarian, and patriotic Lithuanian organization, with many branches and thousands of members all over the United States. The largest branch of the Society is the 22nd branch in Chicago, in the Bridgeport colony, with a membership of more than one hundred Lithuanians. The membership dues of the Society are sixty cents per year. In return for these dues every member receives a free copy of every book that is published by the Society.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society (Tevynes Myletoju Draugija) is to promote the intellectual uplift of the Lithuanian people by publishing and distributing education books in the Lithuanian language. It was organized several years ago as a not-for-profit organization. All publications of the Society are sold to non-members at cost. Some books have been distributed free to worthy non-members who could not afford to pay for them. The Society has already published and distributed many good educational books.</p>
