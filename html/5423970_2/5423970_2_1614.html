   <p>In the month of December, 1916, a meeting was held by N. Vilimaitis, J. Palinlionis, T. Lapenas, A. Janulevicius, K. Katelis, J. Zubivicinits and others. They organized the Lithuanian Janitors' Benefit Club. In order to get more members to join this organization, in 1926 the club changed its name to the present Garfield Park Benefit Club of Lithuanian Men and Women.</p>
