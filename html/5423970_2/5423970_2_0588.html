   <p>Even though the dialogues were long and wearisome, the actors performed their roles very well. Five hundred people attended this play. The audience was well satisfied and they often applauded long and heartily. I believe that the Dr. Kudirka Theatrical Society will not sleep in the future. I have heard that the society, after Easter, will present the as yet unknown comedy in Chicago, "The Devil in the Trap." I understand that the presentation of theatrical plays not only gives pleasure to the spectators, but furnishes education also.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is essential that theatrical presentations of more importance ought to be part of the life of the people, and such plays and spectacles should be given more often.</p>
