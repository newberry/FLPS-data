   <p>Every deed brings fruit. If the work is done for the wrong cause, the result is bad; if the work is done for a good cause, the results are good. So it is with the Aurora's lectures, they have brought wonderful results. The two last lectures which were delivered by Dr. Rutkauskas were great. The people have learned the action of their bodies, how disease comes into our bodies, how a strong and healthy body repels disease. Such lectures are of great value; a man knows the agencies of his body and how to protect himself from various sicknesses.</p>
   <p>On November 24th there will be given a third lecture by S. Safranauskas, a student from Valparaiso University. The subject will be, "The Air and its Elemental Agencies." This lecture will be given at the Fellowship House, 869 33rd Place, 3:30 P. M., admission 10 cents.</p>
   <p>It is important to everyone of us what the air consists of, what the elements are, and its effect on man's organism. It is essential <span class="page-break">\2</span>for us to get acquainted with the air, because our life and existence depend on it. Air is more essential to us than bread. Without bread and water we can live for some time, but without air we could not live even one half hour.</p>
   <p>The propagation of enlightenment and education of the people is the aim of the Aurora Society through arranging scientific lectures for the benefit of Lithuanians.</p>
