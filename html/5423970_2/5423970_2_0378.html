   <p>On January 30 the Knights (Vytis), Branch 14, presented a play, "St. Elizabeth," at St. Anthony Parish Hall, Cicero. The hall was packed with people.</p>
   <p>Miss Antanina Jekaviciute called the audience to order and explained the purpose of this spectacle. She stated that the proceeds from this play were to be used for the erection of a monument to the late Miss Petronele Raudonaiciute.</p>
   <p>The play was performed fairly well. Some of the players proved themselves real artists. The proceeds from this performance amounted to one hundred dollars. The public was satisfied with the program. We need more performances like this.</p>
