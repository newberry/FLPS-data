   <p>The Lithuanian West Side Public Library gave a benefit performance on January 23 at Meldazis Hall. Mr. S. Biezis, a student of medicine, made a speech on libraries and the benefits of enlightenment. After the speech, The Lovers of Motherland Society, Branch 28, presented two plays: "One of Us Must Get Married," and "The Knave".</p>
   <p>Local Lithuanians are paying very little attention to the support of this library, judging from the small attendance. The Lithuanian Library will have a deficit from this performance.</p>
