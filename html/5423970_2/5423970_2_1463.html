   <p>A lecture was given at the Providence of God Parish Hall (18th Street and Union Avenue) May 14. Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas showed slide pictures depicting the lives of drunkards, and explained the harmful nature of beer and whiskey. Afterwards the audience asked questions which Dr. Rutkauskas answered. Among other things, Dr. Rutkauskas explained that Lithuanians, by taking in boarders, derive very little financial gain from them but the harm done to the children of the household who listen to the conversations of the drunkards is very great. Therefore, the doctor ventured the suggestion that, in his opinion, it would be a good thing to establish special large hotels, where single Lithuanians could live in peace, happily.</p>
   <p>The hall was almost filled to its capacity. Such lectures are the good plans of the local pastor, the Reverend M. Krusas. Many people learn something and do not spend their time in a saloon.</p>
