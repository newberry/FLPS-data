   <p>In number 43 of the Katalikas, the Chicago branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America complains that not everything that was written about the Chicago Lithuanians was true.</p>
   <p>It might be so, but, dear patriots, is this the time to make complaints about what was written about the Chicago Lithuanians a year ago? Can I write anything better in my book (the History of the American Lithuanians) when I was unable to get information from the Rev. Krawczunas about the Chicago Lithuanians?</p>
   <p>I wrote to Lietuva for material about the Chicago Lithuanians. The obtained facts, I thought, might be partial. So I wrote to the Rev. Krawczunas for more information about the St. George's Church; how much it cost to build, how many parishioners belong to that parish, how many societies are there, but the Rev. Krawczunas gave no answer.</p>
   <p>You say in Katalikas that there was no misunderstanding between the Chicago Lithuanians and their priest. But I know, and all the Lithuanians in America know, that there was trouble at the St. George's Church in Chicago.</p>
   <p>You say that the nuns who are teaching the Lithuanian children know the Lithuanian language, but I know and all the Lithuanians know that the nuns do not know Lithuanian.</p>
   <p>You say that in Chicago there are more than 5,800 Lithuanians. I will say that there are no more until you prove it to me.</p>
   <p>The most important about the nuns and the Lithuanian parish school is this: What languages the nuns are teaching; in what language do the nuns speak to their pupils; in what language the pupils are speaking among themselves; how many children are attending the church school?</p>
   <p>Rev. John Zilinskas.</p>
