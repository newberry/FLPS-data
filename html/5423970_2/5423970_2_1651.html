   <p>A gigantic annual ball will be sponsored by the Motiejus Valancauskas Benefit Society on Saturday, November 23, 1918, at Milda Hall, 3142 South Halsted Street.</p>
   <p>A delightful evening awaits you, with Lithuanian dances and beautiful Lithuanian music.</p>
   <p>You will be able to enjoy yourselves until a late hour, for this will be the last ball before Advent; therefore, there will be no more opportunities for dancing and the like until the New Year. Everybody, come to the ball!</p>
