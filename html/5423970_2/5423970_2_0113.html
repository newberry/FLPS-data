   <p>Mr.J. Grigas, 134 W.15th St. opened a grocery store.We are glad to hear that Lithuanians are going into business and do not yield to others.</p>
   <p>To our brother Grigas we are wishing good success. He ought to be supported by all Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Remember brothers, Germans and Jews will not support us, they will not buy from Catholics, will go half a mile to their countrymen. Therefore we ought to take an example from other nations,by doing that we will obtain a better livelihood.</p>
