   <p>A concert for the benefit of Lithuanian independence was held at the Milda Hall last night. From an artistic point of view, the concert was most satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Miss Marion Rakauskas sang Donizetti's aria, "O Hio Fornando," and two compositions by Stasys Simkus, "Plaukia Sau Laivelis" [The Boat Is Sailing] and "Pamylejau Vakar" [I Loved, Yesterday]. At the insistence of the audience she repeated the last song.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stasys Simkus played his own" Andante Sonato C mol," and other compositions on the piano. The distinguished composer played perfectly, but without feeling. It was apparent that he was not feeling well. In fact, during the intermission Mrs. M. Damijonaitis announced that Mr. Simkus would not speak (as he had been expected to do) because he was indisposed, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but that he would play instead.</p>
   <p>There was dancing after the program. The audience was not very large.</p>
