   <p>Classes on parliamentary procedure will be held in the evening of May 23 (7:30 P. M.), at the Fellowship Hall, 831 W. 33rd St. The Lithuanian Socialist Society is sponsoring these classes on parliamentary procedure for its own members and others wanting to take advantage of this training in order to equip themselves for conducting public meetings in a parliamentary manner.</p>
   <p>This will be the last gathering of this class, so that all members of the Lithuanian Socialist Society should be present on that evening. We have many important problems to discuss at this gathering.</p>
