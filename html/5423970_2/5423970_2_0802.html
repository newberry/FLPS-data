   <p>The Lithuanian-American Physicians Society met last Saturday, May 1, at 3261 South Halsted Street. An election of officers took place with the following results: Dr. A. L. Juska, president; Dr. J. Kulis, vice-president; Dr. K. Drangelis, secretary; Dr. A. J. Zimontas, treasurer.</p>
   <p>At a previous meeting the Society endorsed Attorney John Kuchinskas for the office of city attorney. A letter from Mayor Thompson on this matter was read at the meeting. The mayor promised to take into consideration the recommendation of the doctors when he makes an appointment to the office.</p>
   <p>The Bridgeport branch of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Temperance Society appealed to the Society to furnish lecturers for the anti-alcohol exhibit to be conducted by the Temperance Society for two days, on Wednesday and Thursday of this week at the St. George's (Lithuanian) parish hall. The Society selected Dr. Juska, Dr. Jonikaitis, and Dr. Drangelis to lecture at the exhibit.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Lithuanian Roman Catholic Benevolent Association invited the Society jointly to establish a free dispensary, where poor people could receive free medical attention. The Society has been planning for quite some time to establish such a dispensary. A committee for this purpose, composed of Dr. Juska and Dr. Kulis, was formed some time ago. Two more members, Dr. Jonikaitis and Dr. Wiegner (a Latvian), were added to the committee at this meeting. The committee was authorized to investigate the proposal of the Association. It was pointed out at the meeting that the Society would be willing to join the Association in establishing a dispensary, provided that full control over the dispensary is assigned to the Society.</p>
   <p>The Society now has seventeen members; twelve reside in Chicago and five in the eastern states.</p>
