   <p>The Lithuanian evening school, which is being conducted by Casimir Gugis in the St. George's Lithuanian Parish Hall at 32nd Place and Auburn (now Lituanica) Avenue will continue at least until March 20. It opened last Fall on September 1. All elementary subjects are being taught. It was originally planned to include courses in the skilled trades, but due to a lack of funds this matter was postponed until the next school year.</p>
   <p>When the school first opened last Fall, a large number of (adult) Lithuanians enrolled. But now that employment opportunities have increased many have discontinued their studies. However, a fairly large number is determined to continue their studies until the end of the school term.</p>
   <p>Next Fall, if a sufficient number of applications are received, courses <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the skilled trades will be added to the school. This addition will be possible if the Reverend Kriauciunas continues to donate the free use of the parish hall for the school.</p>
