   <p>The following Chicago Lithuanian societies have just been organized in Town of Lake: Sons of Lithuania; Grand Duke Mindugis is of Lithuania Society; and Union of Brothers of Lithuania. All these are mutual aid societies. Apparently, they have been organized because of dissatisfaction with the other long-existing benefit societies in the community.</p>
   <p>A short time ago, the Dr. V. Kudirka Theatrical Club was organized by Lithuanians in this community. However, this club is barely existing because of religious and political differences among the members. For that reason, the more progressive members of the Club resigned and organized a similar society of their own known as the "Nationalist Circle." The main purpose of this society will be to stage theatrical plays and to organize a chorus. The members of the Circle are now making preparations to stage "Pirmi Zingsniai" (The First Steps).</p>
