   <p>Last Sunday, in Meldazis Hall, on the West Side, a three-act drama, "On the Brink of the Abyss," was presented. This was the first performance of the dramatic group of the Lovers of the Motherland Society, Branch 28. From all angles, this performance was excellent. This drama portrays the miserable life of a drunkard. In the beginning it is humorous, but in the end it is sad because it depicts the sorrowful finish to the drunkard's life. I am sorry that, for lack of space in this newspaper, I cannot give a complete account of this play. Anyone interested in seeing this play, will have an opportunity to do so when it is performed in the Providence of God Parish Hall, December 14.</p>
   <p>Besides the drama, Miss K. Zauriute recited a few poems; Mr. S. Biezis delivered <span class="page-break">\2</span>a short speech about Lithuanian students and the affairs of the students' journal, The Dreams of Youth. At last, the famous "wife" of Stepukas arrived. Stepukas' (the well-known comedian of the West Side) wife was so humorous, with her sharp tongue, that the audience was hardly able to sit in their seats. No doubt, many of the spectators wondered what kind of a married couple they were; while others, perhaps, thought that this "woman," with such a tongue, surpassed even her husband, Stepukas.....But in the end it was disclosed that this "woman" was Stepukas himself dressed in women's clothing.</p>
   <p>The attendance was large.....</p>
