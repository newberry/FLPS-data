   <p>It is well known that in Chicago there are many Lithuanians musicians who play various instruments. Many such Lithuanians are good players, but they are playing in Polish, Jewish, German, and other bands. Such Lithuanians do nothing good for themselves or for Lithuania as a whole. They simply are helping with their abilities to make bands of other nationalities famous.</p>
   <p>Any one that knows a Lithuanian playing any instrument or is a player himself, or belongs to any society, give his name and address to the editor of Lietuva. We must have our own Lithuanian band, and we can have a good band because there are many good players among Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Our societies have their concerts, banquets, dances, they always are hiring the bands of other nationalities. We Lithuanians must have our own band, and our band must play on our societies' balls and dances. Why pay money to the bands of other nationalities when we can have our own and much better band?</p>
