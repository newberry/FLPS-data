   <p>p. 3.... The 4th chapter of the Lithuanian Socialist League held its annual New Year Party, Dec. 31, 1914. This party was unique in that no intoxicating liquor was sold or employed by the celebrants.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of an address by T.J.Kucinskas and recitations by Miss P. Petraitis, Miss F. Stiklius, and Miss O. Kalvaitis. The program was opened and concluded with songs by the Lithuanian Socialist Male Choir.</p>
   <p>During an intermission of the program an appeal was made to the audience for aid to war refugees in Lithuania. A collection netted $17.15, which was turned over to the Lithuanian News Publishing Co. for transmission to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>After the program a banquet and a Lithuanian national dance contest were enjoyed by those present. Four prizes were awarded to the winners.</p>
