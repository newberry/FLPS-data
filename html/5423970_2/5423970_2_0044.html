   <p>Mr. P. Kaitis, who operated a general store, steamship agency, printing shop, and bank at 1607 North Ashland Avenue, disappeared last Thursday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaitis, whose real name is said to be Martinkaitis, published the Socialist Lietuviu Zurnalas (Lithuanian Journal) and the dirty periodical Sake (The Prong), which was recently transferred to New England. He was an influential and well-known person among Lithuanian Socialists. His place of business was a meeting place and center of the North Side Lithuanian Socialists.</p>
   <p>Many people had money on deposit in the bank of Mr. Kaitis. It is not definitely known how much money was on deposit in the bank. Some say the total is from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars; others contend that the total is less than five thousand dollars. It is believed that the people will lose all the money they had on deposit at the bank.</p>

   <p>The affairs of Mr. Kaitis have now been taken over by Mr. Galskis, a Lithuanian resident of the North Side. He will make an effort to salvage some of the money of the depositors.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaitis was one of the leaders of the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, which is in the hands of the Socialists. Last December, during the convention of the Association, Mr. Kaitis was elected as a member of the "Supreme Court" of the Association. He represented the Chicago Lithuanian societies at the convention in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
