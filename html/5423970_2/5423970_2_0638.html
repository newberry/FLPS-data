   <p>p.1...Scoffing at "thirteens" and all other superstitions, the young Lithuanians of Chicago and vicinity are preparing to bring their lovely ladies to the Lithuanian 13th at the Southtown Ballroom, 6319 So.Ashland Ave. Many of them will be there just to hear our foremost Lithuanian dance band, Edward Whitney Tarutis' Broadway Melodians. The musical organization is "fresh" from a successful engagement at the Drake, and is about to fulfill an important Cleveland engagement. The boys swing a "swingier" tune than you have heard in many months. What is more interesting, his unusal band boasts a versatile group of comedians; they have one of the most complete repertories in the land.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Youth Organization is a youth organization sponsored by Jaunimas. It includes the Riding Club, Feminine Fances Club, Camera Club, Literary Guild, Dramatic League and Art Society.</p>
   <p>Tickets are on sale at the Jaunimas office and are being circulated by the various club members. A whole evening of fun is yours for forty cents. Jaunimas' friends have an all important date for Feb. 13th.</p>
