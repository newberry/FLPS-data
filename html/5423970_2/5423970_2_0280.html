   <p>The Lithuanian Printers Alliance of America held its first gathering at the St. George Parish Hall last Saturday. The program consisted of musical numbers and recitations. Four choruses participated in the program: the chorus of the Young Lithuanian-Americans' National Club; the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, Lodge 81, Chorus; the Free Youth Chorus, and the Lithuanian Socialist Male Chorus. The first is directed by Mr. Girnius, the other three by J. Katilius.</p>
   <p>Young Edward Pajauskas played a few numbers on the piano in beautiful style. Little Bigelis and his sister played "Gypsy Dance" on the piano and violin. J. Jankauskas and Miss Juozaitis gave recitations. There was dancing to the Sarpalius Brothers' orchestra after the program. A flashlight photo of the whole group was taken after the grand march. The program was well organized. Mr. J. Klevas was master of ceremonies.</p>
   
   <p>The attendance was large and it is said the sponsors made a profit of more than a hundred dollars.</p>
