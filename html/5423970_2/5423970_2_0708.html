   <p>At the Simonas Daukantas Society's yearly celebration a collection was made for the benefit of the Aurora Society. They collected $18.37. If all the societies at their meetings and banquets would remember to make collections for the benefit of the Aurora Society, whose purpose it to help the young Lithuanian students, it would be a great help.</p>
   <p>We have many appeals from young Lithuanian students for help, but we have no money to help them. The collections can be made anywhere; we only need the will.</p>
