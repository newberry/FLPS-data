   <p>On Thursday two lectures were delivered in Bridgeport. The speakers were Dr. J. Basanavicius and M. Ycas, representatives of Lithuania, B. K. Balutis, editor of Lietuva, and the Reverend F. B. Seratinas of Chicago. The speakers were introduced by Bishop Matthew Krauciunas. About eight hundred people were present. Almost two hundred dollars has been collected for the Lithuanian Science Building in Vilnius [Vilna]. Mr. A. Olszewski had previously donated a hundred dollars. Bishop Krauciunas donated a hundred rubles. When the people began to murmur because the Reverent Matthews Krauciunas had donated so small a sum, he stated that he would visit Vilnius [Vilna] this year and would donate more at that time.</p>
   <p>The lecture was held in Divine Providence parish hall, at 18th Street and Union Avenue. At this lecture the honorable guests collected $75. If there had not been trouble between the priest and his parishioners the collection would doubtless have been much larger.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday the honorable guests delivered their lectures at Indiana Harbor; more than  dollars was collected there.</p>
   <p>Contributions are coming in fast. We believe that before Dr. J. Basanavicius and Mr. M. Yeas leave Chicago, they will have 5,000 or more for the Lithuanian Science Building in Vilna.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America, Branch 36, Bridgeport, has decided to buy one "charter" of the Lithuanian House of Vilnius. The St. Stanisluvas V. and K. Society donated $25. The Lithuanian Organists' Association has decided to buy one "charter". The St. Isidor Society of South Chicago will buy a "charter" also.</p>
   
   <p>The Sernas Musical Fund Society, at its meeting last Sunday, voted to donate $250 to the Lithuanian National Home of Vilnius. The Lithuanian Alliance of America at its twenty-fifth convention, held in Chicago, contributed a thousand dollars to the same institution--the Lithuanian Science Building of Vilna.</p>
   <p>While the honorable delegates of Lithuania are lecturing in Chicago, the Lithuanian committees of Pennsylvania, the New England States, and Omaha, Nebraska, are writing letters to the Chicago Lithuanian committee for instructions and information with regard to the best way of arranging the lectures. Since the demand is so great, and the time is short, both speakers cannot appear in the same place at the same time. On August 23 Mr. Ycas will speak at Omaha, and Dr. J. Basanavicius and others will speak on the same day at Melrose Park, Illinois, and before the Kensington Lithuanian colony, 115th Street and Indiana Avenue.</p>
   
   <p>We are sorry to say that there are among us Lithuanians who are trying to obstruct the lecture tour of these two honorable delegates from Lithuania. The enlightened Lithuanian public is paying no attention to their ignorant brothers' senseless action.</p>
