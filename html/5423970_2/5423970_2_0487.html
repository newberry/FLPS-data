   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance presented Togobocni's five-act "Scene of Life: Murderers", at the Hull House Theater on April 21.</p>
   <p>Participating in the play were M. Dunduliene, J. Augustinavicius, S. Varasauskaite, M. Juska, Z. Kalvaiciute, J. Buragas, G. Stasiunas, J. Sankunas and others. M. Dunduliene fitted her role and acted it with perfection. J. Buragas also thus distinguished himself. These two artists of the Circle were aided by good roles: individuals having real characters. J. Sankunas is a talented actor and tried hard, but his characterless role, or perhaps it would be better to say his role containing ten characters, could not be controlled, and he was not successful with it, especially in the last scene. Varasauskaite also played well, but did not appear to be the character she attempted to portray. Her speech is hardly distinguishable from a declamation.</p>
