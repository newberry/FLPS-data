   <p>A new periodical named Vaidyla began publication in Chicago last week. Its first issue announced that it will be a "general, literary, and political" monthly. It consists of only four pages, [containing articles such as]"Editor's Word", by a certain Peter Vardunas, criticizing the marring of the Lithuanian language with English words. It has also a discussion of the Birute performance, and several other short articles by the same author, like "Let Us Seek Enlightenment and Grandeur," and "The Old-Time Marks Have Remained". There are also some "running news", and a few jokes. These are all of the contents of Vaidyla.</p>
   <p>It should be remarked that even though the grammar of the Lithuanian language is lame it seems that this newly-born periodical is very much better than similar previous publications like Zemaitys, Samogitian, Vakary Varpas, The Bell of the West, etc.</p>
