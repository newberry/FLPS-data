   <p>A varied and beautiful program was presented last Sunday at Gavrilavicius' Hall by the Dr. Kudirka Society. Of the outstanding musical numbers offered, Sarpalius' quartet, which gave the public much enjoyment, is worthy of special mention. There were also good and instructive lectures. The lecturers were J.G. Leveckis, whose topic was "Training of the Will"; Dr. A.K. Rutkauskas, whose topic was "Temperance"; and Mrs. M. Jurgelionis, whose lecture was entitled "Lithuanian Girls in Chicago." The last lecture was especially interesting because of its originality. The audience was large.</p>
