   <p>We Lithuanians lack translations of the best literary productions of the world's famous writers. Since the time of our writer, V. Kudirka, we have not translated or published any literature from other languages. Seeing the lack of such literature, I have translated Shakespeare's "Macbeth" into Lithuanian, retaining the idiom of the original language. I thought that in some way I would be able to find a publisher, although up to the present, I have been unable to find one. I have decided to publish it myself in order to add this beautiful literary romance to Lithuanian literature. I hope that those who like classical literature, will help me to publish it. Before publication the price of the book will be fifty cents--after publication, seventy-five cents. If the Lithuanians approve my project to publish "Macbeth," then we will be able to add a good literary work to our Lithuanian literature to fill a much needed gap.</p>
