   <p>In Chicago, there are many Lithuanian woodworkers and carpenters whom it would be possible to organize into a Lithuanian carpenters union.For this purpose, several energetic carpenters have begun to organize the Lithuanian carpenters. The organizers say that by uniting all the Lithuanian carpenters and cabinetmakers into one union, it would be of greater benefit. In the first place they have organized a new mutual aid society among themselves: The Chicago and Vicinity Lithuanian Carpenters and Woodworkers Organization.</p>
   <p>This society is a mutual aid organization; besides the sick benefit payments, it also pays death benefits. The aim of this society is to organize all of the Chicago Lithuanian carpenters into one Lithuanian carpenters union. The meetings of this society are held every Saturday evening at Mikalajunas Hall, 2334 South Leavitt Street.</p>
