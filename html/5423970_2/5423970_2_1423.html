   <p>Branch No. 9 of the Lithuanian Women's Progressive Association sponsored a lecture on "Women's Sexual Life," Sunday, April 2, at Mark White Square, 29th and Halsted Streets. The lecture was delivered by Mr. A. J. Karalius, a medical student. The lecture was very instructive. It would be very desirable if our women would sponsor more such lectures.</p>
