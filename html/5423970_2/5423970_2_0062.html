   <p>Lietuva has urged the Lithuanian youth many times to learn a mechanic's trade. We are always glad to hear that some Lithuanian has become an individual mechanic by himself, or is employed as a mechanic. In recent days, Mr. Alfonsas Bartkus passed his examination for an electrical mechanic and will open his business at 2152 W. 24th Street. From now on, he will specialize in the installation of electric wires, fixtures, lamps, etc., in houses and factories. Up to the present time Mr. Bartkus was the representative of Boyse-Carmichell Manufacturing Company where he obtained a lot of electrical experience.</p>
