   <p>The Lithuanian workers colony of Chicago and other cities is celebrating tomorrow the tenth anniversary Jubilee of the existence of the socialistic paper Naujienos. Ten years ago this paper was created by a group of progressive Lithuanian intellectuals and workers. The course of its development was hard. There was not the necessary means, there was not enough contributors, and in the masses there was not sufficient foundation for the successful existence of the paper, for the solidification and establishment of its professed ideas. There was none of the means above referred to, but the Lithuanian-American workers colony was in need of a paper, which would be on the watch for the workers' interests and express their needs. As in other colonies, so likewise in the Lithuanian colony, there are servants of reaction, who carry on an agitation with the purpose of befogging the minds of the workers. Having very little strength and means, this paper undertook the difficult and complicated task of unselfishly serving the masses of the workers. Accordingly, by that service the consciousness of the Lithuanian masses became clearer and the influence of the progressive elements on the Lithuanian workers grew more and <span class="page-break">\2</span>more and so did the significance and the power of the paper. At the present time, this paper is well established, is of great influence on the Lithuanian colony, has a big circulation and is well placed among the socialist papers of America. This attainment is of great significance, taking in consideration how difficult it is for the socialistic papers to do the work, the opposition from the side of the capitalistic papers and how few papers there are in America, which defend the interest of the workers. Our wish is to have more of such Jubilees.</p>
