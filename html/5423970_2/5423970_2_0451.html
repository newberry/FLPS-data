   <p>Last Sunday, October 5, at St. George's Parish Hall, the Birute Society presented a three-act comedy, "Cannot Blow Against the Wind." The presentation of this play was fair. The artists performed their roles very well. If there had not been a mishap in one of the scenes of the third act, everything would have been perfect.....</p>
   <p>After the performance, the Birute Choir, directed by Mr. A. Pocius, sang several songs. The program was concluded with the Lithuanian national anthem. After the program were dances.</p>
