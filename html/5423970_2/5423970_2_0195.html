   <p>On Sunday, March 26, the A. Vitkauskas' Theatrical Group will present "Genevieve," a drama in eight scenes, at the St. George Parish Hall, on 33rd Street. A. Vitkauskas himself will play the role of "Golius". Among others in the cast are Miss Samolis, Miss L. Zilvitis, Miss V. Zilvitis, B. Vaitekunas, Valancauskas, Sankunas, Sirvinskas, Maculis.</p>
   <p>This play was performed in Chicago on January 23, but repeated requests for a repetition of the presentation compel us to accede to the wishes of the public. Because we believe that this time even more people will attend the performances, we are repeating the presentation. The play will be presented twice on Sunday. The first performance will begin promptly at 3:30 P. M., the second at 8 P. M. Ticket prices are twenty-five, thirty-five, fifty, and seventy-five cents.</p>
   
   <p>Since this play is being presented for the last times, we believe a large audience will be on hand to witness the spectacle provided by the performance of "Genevieve". Tickets are on sale at the Naujienos office and at the Olsevskis Bank.</p>
