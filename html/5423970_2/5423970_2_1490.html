   <p>A very educational lecture on "Tuberculosis and Its Causes" was arranged at the Davis Square Hall last Sunday. Dr. Strawson lectured in English; Dr. Zurowski in Polish; and Dr. A. Graiciunas in Lithuanian. So many people had come that the audience had to be divided into two parts, and Dr. Graiciunas was forced to give his lecture twice.....The lectures were arranged by the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute.</p>
