   <p>The weekly classes in the study of the English language and the American working class movement were held on Wednesday evening, Feb. 3, at the Cesna Hall, 4501 S. Paulina Street. These classes are conducted by the committee on Education of the Lithuanian-American Workers Literary Society. The first class was devoted to the study of English grammar. Another class was devoted to the study of the American working class movement. A <span class="page-break">2</span>book, The A B C of Communism was used as a text book in the latter course.</p>
   <p>These courses offer wonderful educational opportunities for members as well as non-members of the society. No charge is made for the instruction. A good knowledge of the subjects offered at the classes is essential to every member of the working class. It is advisable for parishioners of the local Lithuanian Catholic church to attend these classes and learn how to read and write. It is a well-known fact that most members of the parish are illiterate.</p>
