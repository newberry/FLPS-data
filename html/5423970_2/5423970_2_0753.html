   <p>Delegates of those Lithuanian organizations which support and maintain the Lithuanian Public Library on the West Side held a meeting in the J. Mikalunas Hall. A full report was made at the meeting on the financial condition of the library. It is apparent from the report that the Lithuanians of the West Side are enthusiastically supporting the library and that they are making good use of it.</p>
   <p>So far a total of $382.93 has been contributed toward the support and maintenance of the library. Total expenditures for the improvement and upkeep of the library have amounted to $203.50. This leaves a balance of $179.43 in the treasury.</p>
   <p>The extent of the use of the library by the Lithuanians of the West Side was also reported. Records show that during the past year the library was visited by 705 men and 132 women. Altogether 90 people borrowed 118 books to take home, read, and return. However, in comparison, the total number of Lithuanians who have made use of the library this year is twenty-five per cent less than that of last year. The organizations which maintain the library could increase the library patronage among the Lithuanians by the publication of a list of the books which may be obtained from the library. Furthermore constant improvements must be made if the library is to hold the interest of the patrons.</p>
   <p>Two more Lithuanian organizations have recently joined in the maintenance of the library. They are the Dr. Vincas Kudirka Society, and the Twenty-Second Branch of the Lithuanian Socialist League. Now that the group which supports the library is enlarging, greater improvements and a more prosperous future for the library may be anticipated. The library is located at 2336 South Leavitt Street. It is open to the public daily from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M.; on Sundays it is open from 3 P.M. to 7 P.M. Books and various newspapers may be read without charge.</p>
