   <p>The Society of the Motherland Lovers, Number One, presented a program at the St. George Parish Hall last Sunday. A one-act comedy, "An Eye for an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth," was presented by the artists of the Youth Circle.</p>
   <p>The performance cannot be described as successful. It was hampered by the failure of the actors to raise their voices.</p>
   <p>The infants which some women brought to the affair also distracted the audience's attention. A monologue, rendered after the play, was successful. There was dancing after the program. The attendance was large.</p>
