   <p>As soon as we announced in the newspaper the collection of money in order to exhibit our publication at the exhibition in Paris, we heard the cry from our clergy that they were against the exhibit of our publication at the Paris exhibition.</p>
   <p>Tevyne (The Fatherland, the organ of the Lithuanian Alliance of America at that time, under the control of the clergy) says that the money will be lost, etc. The collected money cannot be lost because it is under the control of a reliable committee. We do not ask people to send the money to Lietuva or to Vienybe's committees. Let the people choose their own committees, and let them decide where to send the money.</p>
   <p>We see no reason why the newspaper Tevyne is against the exhibit of the Lithuanian publication at the Paris exhibition. This is the only place where we can expose the oppression by the Russian government of the publication of literature in our own language in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>(Tr. n. - The clergy were against the exposure, at the Paris exhibition, of the Russian government's oppression of the Lithuanians in Lithuania, because the clergy themselves helped the Russian government to keep the Lithuanians in Lithuania in darkness and ignorance).</p>
