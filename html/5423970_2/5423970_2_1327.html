   <p>There are evening schools in the Chicago city parks, and we have received a report that not a small number of Lithuanians are attending these schools, which are taught in the English language only. At Davis Square Park, sixty Lithuanians are attending the school; at Fellowship House, Bridgeport, fifty; and at the Mark White Square School, thirty. Besides the English language, lessons in citizenship in preparation for citizenship papers are given free. The supervisor of these schools is Mr. E.B. Jacobson.</p>
   <p>Altogether, more than one hundred Lithuanians are attending these schools. They are good, and we urge Lithuanians to attend them. It would be much better if the committees appointed by the various Lithuanian societies would take care of the school problem. But our committees are elected only for decoration of the societies, and Lithuanians must fall back upon the benevolence of strangers. Even for such schools, Lithuanians cannot arouse their national spirit.</p>
