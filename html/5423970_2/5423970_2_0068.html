   <p>So-called Lithuanian building and loan associations have been in existence for many years.</p>
   <p>Space does not permit us to speak more fully about their organization, but we believe it will suffice if we state that members of such associations sign for one or several shares, which are usually worth one hundred dollars each, and pay twenty-five cents a week until the shares are paid for.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are nine such lending and saving associations and their most recent reports show that they have a total of $260,683.03 in circulation and in their treasuries.</p>
   <p>That same annual report shows that last year, $27,664.21 profit was distributed to members by all of these associations....</p>
   <p>The oldest of these building and loan associations is situated in the Town of Lake and calls itself D.L.K. Vytauto Building and Loan Society. It was incorporated in 1899, and according to its most recent report, had $70,396.50, and a clear, free profit of $8,855. The society's president is Antanas Bierzinskis.</p>
   <p>Besides this, there is yet another society which was formed much later, in 1910. It is the Lietuvos Loan and Savings Society, which has a capital of $11,389.75 and last year had a profit of $416. The head of the society is S. Anucauckas.</p>
   <p>The largest association is in Bridgeport..... This "capitalist" organization calls itself Keistucio Loan and Building Society. It was established in 1901. Its present finances reach $73,912.28, and last year it made a clear profit of $8,197.51. The president of the society is Pranas Butkus.</p>
   
   <p>Just as the Vytauto, so this Keistucio has a younger friend in Bridgeport--the Zirgvaikio Society, which was incorporated in 1910 and has already grown to a capital of $4,848.81 and distributed $129.38 in profits last year. Its president is K. Pajauckas.</p>
   <p>On the West Side there are three similar societies, one at 18th Street, two near Oakley Avenue.</p>
   <p>On 18th Street the Lithuanian Building, Loan and Homestead Association has been flourishing since 1904. To date it has reached $47,868.75 in capital and last year made $4,325.85 clear profit for its members. According to the State Auditor's report, the president of this society is Frank Dap...</p>
   <p>The other West Side societies are younger. Simano Daukanto Loan and Building Society began its activities in 1905 and today has a capital of $37,750.35; it made a profit of $4,736.78 last year. P. M. Alisonis is the president. In 1909, in this same vicinity another association, called the D.L.K. Gedimino Loan and Building Society, was established. Its capital totals $3,865.54 and it made a profit of $194.54 during the year. The presidency of this association is held by Justin Mackevicius.</p>
   <p>In that same year a similar society, Vienybe, was established in Roseland. Its capital totals $7,935.65, and last year it had a profit of $332.90. The affairs of the society are supervised by J. Grogula.</p>
   <p>Since 1910, the Lithuanian Foundation of the Northwest Building and Loan Association has been existing successfully, though on a small scale. Its most recent report shows that is has already reached a capital of $3,000..... Its president is Adomas Stepanauckas.</p>
