   <p>A newly invented musical instrument, known as a "piano orchestra," was installed in stalled in the Lithuania Theater, 3214 South Halsted Street, which was opened two weeks ago by the Lithuanian Theatrical Company. It is said that the instrument, which is operated by one person, does the work of six musicians. It was purchased by the Lithuanian Theatrical Company for $2,500. Very few theaters have this instrument, since it was invented only about four months ago.</p>
   <p>The Lithuania Theater was opened on Saturday, October 30 and scored a great success.</p>
