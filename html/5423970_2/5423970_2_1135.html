   <p>A new Lithuanian periodical, the Musu Draugija (Our Society), has just appeared in Chicago. It is being issued by the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies. The editor is Mr Frank Butkus, who is well known as an outstanding leader of the ill-fated movement against "Lithuanian tar cooks" [Translators note: This term was applied to traitorous Lithuanians who were loyal to the Russian Tsar]. The periodical is a monthly. It contains news of current events, news about Chicago Lithuanian societies, advertisements of merchants, and some short feature articles.</p>
   <p>A new issue of the Laisvoji Mintis (Free Thought) appeared this week. It is the first number edited by the Chicagoan, Z. Vitkauskas. The new number has a large variety of interesting features. According to the "creed" of the new editor, the periodical will stand for the following principles:</p>
   <p>Nationalism is recognized as an important part of our cultural activities. The <span class="page-break">2</span>Laisvoji Mintis will champion the cause of oppressed nationalities. It will uphold the democratic form of government. The periodical will be concerned with the affairs of the working class. Religion is recognized as a private matter of an individual. However, the periodical does not renounce the right to discuss religious questions. The Laisvoji Mintis will avoid polemics; but, when it becomes necessary to engage in polemics, personalities will not be attacked. The periodical will be concerned with the interests of public and parochial schools, farming, suffrage for women, etc.</p>
   <p>From the current number of the Laisvoji Mintis it is evident that the new editor will not entirely adhere to the principles of Dr. J. Sliupas, the former editor.</p>
   <p>The Laisvoji Mintis was formerly published in Scranton Pennsylvania. The new office of the periodical is now at 2627 Calumet Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
