   <p>The Lithuanian Youth Circle presented a three-act drama "Orphans", from the English, translated by J. J. Zolpis, on September 28, at St. George's Parish Hall, in Bridgeport. The important roles of the comedy were very well played. In general, the presentation of the comedy was good. One thing should be mentioned; as always in the past and at this time, the scenery was beautiful. It seems that the Lithuanian Youth Circle is the only society in Chicago that pays close attention to the presentation of scenery. The public was satisfied with the performance. After the program, there was dancing.</p>
