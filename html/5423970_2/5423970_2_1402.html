   <p>Chapter No. 187, of the Lithuanian-American Workers Literary Society, sponsored a debate on the question: "Is There Really Such a God as Recognized by the Catholic Religion"? The debate took place on Dec. 29, at Krencius hall.</p>
   <p>Rev. K. Matulaitis, editor of the Lithuanian Catholic daily Draugas (The Friend), was invited to defend the affirmative side of the question; T. J. Kucinskas, attorney-at-law, was assigned to the negative side. However, Rev. Matulaitis failed to appear. Mr. Kucinskas spoke on his side of the question, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and then members of the audience were permitted to ask questions and to express their views. Many questions were asked by members of the audience and answered by Mr. Kucinskas.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kucinskas displayed the same outlook on religion as did Karl Marx, the author of scientific Socialism, who said that "religion is the opium of the people".</p>
   <p>During an intermission period, a collection was taken to aid political prisoners in Lithuania. The collection netted $35.09. This sum was later sent to the Lithuanian section of the International Labor Defense for transmission to Lithuania.</p>
