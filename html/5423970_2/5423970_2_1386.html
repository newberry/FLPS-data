   <p>Since last Wednesday, September 1st, I opened in my house a new school to teach the Lithuanian children, whom I have been teaching for the last three years at the St. George's parish school. Therefore, I am inviting all parents who had been sending their children for the past three years to the parish school, where I have been teaching, to send your children to my new school. I will teach Lithuanian and catechism in my house, 850 W. 32nd place. I will do my best to inspire your children with education.</p>
