   <p>The most important and definite purpose of the Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle is to promote the theatrical art among Lithuanians and to provide an opportunity for the circle members to study the dramatic art.</p>
   <p>In order to achieve its purpose the Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle will:</p>
   <p>(A) Stage plays for its own benefit.</p>
   <p>(B) Stage plays for other societies, if invited to do so.</p>

   <p>Remark: The Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle will not participate either in political, religious or party disputes. Neither will it discriminate between societies when arranging theatrical performances.</p>
   <p>(1) It is the duty of every member of the Circle to participate in the Circle's activity, to learn dramatic art, to be at the performance and to take part in the play.</p>
   <p>(2) No one member can refuse, had designated role in the performance of any play, if there is no important reason why he cannot take the role.</p>
   <p>(3) When a member is appointed to play a role, he must learn it, always be present on time at the rehearsal and listen carefully to the stage manager's instructions.</p>
   <p>(4) If the member or members refuse to take part in a play when they were appointed to take a certain role, such members must take some other part connected with the same play.</p>
   <p>(5) Every member who does not fulfill, or does nor perform as is necessary, the appointed role, or does not attend the rehearsals will be punished according to the decision of the meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>(6) A member, who accepts a role in a play and then, without any serious reason, refuses just a few days before the performance to play his role, injures thereby the performance. Therefore he will be punished by the Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle.</p>
   <p>The Duties of the Stage Manager:</p>
   <p>(A) The stage manager selects the plays which are to be staged and submits his choice to the approval of the meeting.</p>
   <p>(B) Assigns the roles to the members and instructs them in the performance of the play.</p>
   <p>Remark: The stage manager can be fired, even though he is now a member of the Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle.</p>
   <p>General Remarks:</p>
   <p>(1) The Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle, can unite with other societies when they see the <span class="page-break">\4</span>necessity for common activity, also it can invite others to take part in the play, even though they are not members of the circle.</p>
   <p>(2) The decisions of one meeting can be revoked at the next meeting by a two thirds vote.</p>
   <p>(3) In case of liquidation of the Lithuanian Drama Lovers' Circle all the assets must be delivered to the Lithuanian Drama Societies' Association (if such association is in existence at that time) or to the Lithuanian Art Society. The scenery, the library and other material ought to be delivered to some local theatrical society, or to whomever the members at the liquidation meeting shall decide.</p>
