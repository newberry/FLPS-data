   <p>In these days we have in Chicago a very good agitator; J. Svirmickas, who is delivering lectures in every Lithuanian colony. His lectures are on the Russian revolution and on the worker's condition in America. He urges the people to join the Socialist party and fight for their rights.</p>
   <p>There are many people who are saying that the socialists are destroying religion and the churches. The clergy never have proved that the socialists are destroyers of churches. The clergy themselves are the greater destroyers of religion and the churches. The various Christian sects are ready to cut the throat of their brother christians, the christians by the order of their priests have committed more massacres than any other people of the world.</p>
