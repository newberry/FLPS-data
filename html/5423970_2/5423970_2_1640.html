   <p>p.5...............The Keistutis Mutual-Aid Club held its annual meeting on January 3, at the Mc Kinley Park Hall, 27th Street and Western Avenue. Almost all the members of the club attended the meeting and filled the hall to capacity. Two new members joined the club during the meeting.</p>
   <p>The most important question discussed at the meeting was the financial standing of the club. Many members had been alarmed over that matter, because eight members of the club died during the past year. For that reason the club suffered a serious financial set back. It was the worst year in the history of the club. In spite of that, a report showed that the club is still in fairly good financial condition. It will not be necessary to make special assessments against members. Dues will remain the same.</p>
   <p>The club decided at the meeting to give musical and theatrical programs and a picnic during the summer for the benefit of the club. A committee was elected to put the above decisions into effect. It is believed that the Lithuanian public of Chicago will support these affairs in the same enthusiastic manner as they supported the last annual concert of the club, which netted a net profit of over $150.00.</p>
   <p>The club is still in good standing and will continue to be so, especially if the members will do their share to help make all the benefit affairs of the club a success.</p>
