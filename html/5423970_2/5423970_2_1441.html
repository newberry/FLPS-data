   <p>p.2..... The lecture which Kleofas Jurgelonis delivered before the exclusive Chicago Woman's Club on "Lithuanian Renaissance Literature," Jan. 13, has become so popular that Mr. Jurgelonis has been requested by officials of the club to repeat his lecture in order to give an opportunity to other members of the club to hear the lecture. The members of the club who attended the lecture were impressed with the richness of Lithuanian literature. They particularly enjoyed the "Danos" (folk songs) and the "Raudos" (dirges).</p>
   <p>The coming lecture, which Mr. Jurgelonis has agreed to repeat, will be attended by a few famous authors and critics, who missed the opportunity to hear the first lecture.</p>
