   <p>An affair for the benefit of the local Lithuanian Public Library was arranged through the efforts of nine societies at the Meldazis Hall, on the West Side, last Sunday. The program was made up of a one-act playlet "Liquor," and a three-act comedy "One Tends Oneself as One Can." Besides these there was a speech, recitations, and dancing.</p>
   <p>The affair, from an artistic standpoint, can be called very successful. The artists of the dramatic branch of the Lovers of the Motherland, Chapter 28, who participated in the plays, fulfilled their tasks, one can say, faultlessly. Their conscientious preparation was apparent. Especially outstanding were S. Kriukas as "Saltysius," J. Balsevicius as "Kundoras," Mrs. S. Valonis as "Kundoras' wife," Stasiunas, Miss A. Ulkis, M. Juska and Miss B. Zilvicius. The audience appreciated their efforts and did not begrudge them thunderous applause.</p>

   <p>S. Biezis gave the speech, and Miss K. Ziaurius the recitations.</p>
   <p>But from a material standpoint, the affair was a failure. There were not many in the audience and there will hardly be any profit for the library.</p>
