   <p>Hereby we are announcing to all brother Lithuanians that this week there came the following change in the office of Lietuva:</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Zacharewiczie, who owned this print shop in partnership with Mr. S. Lelaszius, by his own good will and consent, sold his share this week to Mr. S. Lelaszius, so that Mr. Zacharewiczia is not and editor anymore.</p>
   <p>Now Mr. S. Lelaszius sold the share of Mr. Zacharewiczia to Mr. A. Olszewski, who now will be the editor of Lietuva and, together with Mr. Lelaszius, will publish Lietuva.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zacharewiczia was an old man and on account of his age cannot work hard anymore. Mr. Zacharewiczia and Mr. Lelaszius bought this paper, brothers, and they have separated without any dispute or misunderstanding.</p>
   
   <p>Now I, Antonas Olszewski, am inviting all brother Lithuanians to co-operate with me and send money on any business on my name: A. Olszewski, 941 W. wwrd Street.</p>
   <p>Brother Lithuanians, from now on we will print all kinds of books that we do not have in the Lithuanian language. We will sell steamboat tickets and send money to all parts of the world.</p>
   <p>Our newspaper will be edited in the Catholic spirit; it will attack everything that is bad and do the best for Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Up to this time our paper was young and unable to accomplish much. We ask you to help us to make this paper one of the greatest Lithuanian papers in America.</p>
   <p>Editor.</p>
