   <p>p. 8......Because of very long working hours ,workers have no time for reading books in order to get more thoroughly acquainted with their exploiters. However, those workers who attend lectures obtain a good understanding about their exploiters and learn how to combat them. With the purpose of acquainting the workers with their enemies, the 37th chapter of the Lithuanian Socialist League will give a lecture Sunday evening, Jan. 10, at Cernauskas Hall. The speakers will be Mrs. M. Jurgelionis and comrade A. Siderevicius. We especially urge ladies to attend.</p>
