   <p>An evening school for men and women was opened in the St. Michael's Parish Hall, on the North Side, last Monday. Classes will be taught on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from 7:30 to 9:30 in the evening. Whoever wants to learn to read and write the Lithuanian or English language, arithmetic, etc., can benefit by this good opportunity. The school will be conducted by Stanley Safranauskas, a young student who knows a good deal about teaching.</p>
