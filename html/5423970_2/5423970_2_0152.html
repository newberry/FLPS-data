   <p>The musical concert of Mikas Petrauskas and the Biruta Singing and Dramatic Society, which was held on Sunday evening, October 3, at Music Hall, 203 Michigan Boulevard (Fine Arts Building), was a great success. More people attended this concert than attended the first concert of Petrauskas. All the seats in the hall were occupied.</p>

The Biruta Chorus sang the following song, in addition to those listed on the program: "Noriu Miego" (I Want To Sleep).</p>
   <p>Mr. Petrauskas sang a total of eighteen songs; eleven of these were in Lithuanian, two in Italian, and one each. in French, Russian, German, Polish, and English. The most successful songs were: "Pasakyk, Lietuva, Mylimoji" (Tell Me, Lithuania, My Love); "Rusti Mergele"; "Ditiatko" (Not Enough), a Russian, "Lauksiu, Kolei Paliepsi"; "Jojau Diena, Jojau Nakti" (I Rode--A Horse--In the Day Time, I Rode in the Night Time); and "Pauksteliai Ciulba." The audience was mostly pleased with "Rusti Mergele," and "Jojau Diena, Jojau Nakti," which amused everyone and received much applause and shouts for encores.</p>
   <p>Anthony Pocius accompanied on the piano. He also played a solo, Mendelssohn's "Concerto in G Minor," and two shorter pieces by Schumann and Chaminade.</p>
   <p>The following Lithuanian vocalists: Dauksa, Strumskis, Janusauskas, and Limontas, sang Petrauskas' quartet, "Gamta Grazi" (Nature Is Beautiful).</p>
   
   <p>The Biruta Chorus sang a total of five songs.</p>
   <p>Towards the end of the program, members of the Biruta Chorus presented Mr. Petrauskas with a wreath of flowers in the shape of a lyre.</p>
