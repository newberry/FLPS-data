   <p>Last Sunday, October 21, the Biruta Music and Dramatic Society staged a one-act operetta, "Sienapjute" (Harvest Time), in the L. S. P. S. Hall. The Hall was crowded to capacity--proof that Lithuanians like musical plays. The Biruta Society as usual did not disappoint the audience--the performance was excellent.</p>
   <p>The leading role of "Aldona" was played by Miss Marion Rakauskas, whose singing thrilled the audience. Mr. J. J. Zolpis played the role of "Andrius Masulis"; he did not have much time to prepare for the role, but did very well. Miss Staniulis, who has a very beautiful voice, played the role of "Stepas Yuska". The Biruta Chorus also sang very well, although the best members of the Chorus are now in the United States Army.</p>
   <p>The affair was also a financial success in spite of the great expense of presenting the play.</p>
