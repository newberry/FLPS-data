   <p>The president of the Lovers of the Motherland Society, Mr. Pranas Butkus, of Chicago, received a telegram from Mr. Jagomastas of Tilsit, Germany, who is the publisher of the Lovers of the Motherland Society's books. Mr. Jagomastas stated that the works of Jonas Jonila will be published soon, and when the books are ready they will be immediately sent to Mr. Butkus.</p>
   <p>In a recent issue of the official organ of the Lovers of the Motherland Society, a suggestion was made that the operatic works of Mr. Petrauskas be published. His operas are the only ones we have produced up to the present time. The promoters know, that many of the members of the Lovers of the Motherland Society are not very well acquainted with musical notes, but their point is that such a publication would be a great accomplishment in the field of culture. Such a publication could be used not only among the Lithuanian-Americans, but in Lithuania as well.</p>
