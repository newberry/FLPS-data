   <p>Countrymen! For better understanding of our national and spiritual enlightenment, I found out that Lithuanians are eager to know about the American Indians and their destroyers in this free land, I decided to write a short story about the American Indians.</p>
   <p>Many a time I asked our brothers, why they are not reading newspapers. Every one answered, there is nothing in the paper about history. Up to this time our newspapers,except Lietuva, did not give to its readers what they demand. In order to give more light to our readers. I decided to translate American history.</p>
   <p>If the readers will like my translated story, I will be satisfied. By reading history the readers will get used to reading the paper, will obtain enlightenment and knowledge, then they will quit card playing and drinking.</p>
