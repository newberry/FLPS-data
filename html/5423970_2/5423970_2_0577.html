   <p>Last Sunday, Sept. 27, the 122nd Lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America presented successfully "Ponas ir Muzikai" (The Baron and the Peasants), a four-act melodrama, at Columbia Hall, 48th and Paulina Sts., in the Town of Lake colony. A capacity crowd attended.</p>
   <p>This was the first presentation of the play in Chicago. It has been staged many times with great success in Lithuania and in the eastern part of the United States. The plot of the play, which is educational and highly entertaining, deals with the attempts of Lithuanian peasants to overcome class barriers. An unsuccessful effort is made in the play to marry off a daughter of peasants to the son of a baron.</p>
   <p>A number of defects were noticeable during the presentation of the play.</p>

   <p>Only two players rendered satisfactory performances. Most of the players did not know their parts very well and did not behave properly. The role of "Mrs. Baltrus" was played by a very young Lithuanian girl, who failed in her efforts to characterize a middle-aged woman. The performance of "Liudyte," played by Miss Sophia Beinoris, was bad. Satisfactory performances were rendered by K. Strineikis, who played the role of the "Baron Magerskis," and J. Jankus, who played the roles of a priest and a Jew. The acting of "Onyte," the peasants'. daughter, was only fair.</p>
   <p>Recitations by Lithuanian girls and educational lectures by prominent Chicago Lithuanians were delivered during intermissions. Mr. K. Balis, president of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, delivered a lecture on good manners. He compared Lithuanians with people of other nationalities and stated that we have much to learn from them. As an example, he referred <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to the men in the gallery who were smoking and had their hats on during the performance. He stated that when these very same men go to a five cent show of the Jews they take their hats off even before they enter the door. He criticized the audience for not observing strict silence during the progress of the play.</p>
   <p>Another speaker of the evening delivered an address about the Lithuanian Alliance of America. He urged the people to join this mutual aid society, whose members receive sick and death benefits.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the performance, which started at 4:30 P.M., the floor of the hall was cleared for dancing.</p>
   <p>We would like to see all the Chicago lodges of the Lithuanian Alliance present such theatricals more often. However, an effort should be made to train the players more thoroughly, and select characters for the individual roles more carefully.</p>
