   <p>A new Lithuanian theatrical club has been organized in the Bridgeport section of Chicago. The organization has been named the "Amusement Club". The purpose of this organization will be to develop and organize a Lithuanian theater. Plans are being made to lease the second-floor hall of the Milda Theater, 3140 South Halsted Street, and establish a daily vaudeville show. Later, if these shows are sufficiently supported and endorsed by the Lithuanian public, the Lithuania Theater, at 3214 South Halsted Street, will be opened and the daily Lithuanian vaudeville shows will be continued there.</p>
