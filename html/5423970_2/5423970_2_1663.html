   <p>The Keistutis Benefit Club presented a program at M. Meldazis Hall on Sunday, February 27. The program included the presentation of a comedy entitled "The Wedding Ceremony," songs, monologues, and recitations.</p>
   <p>Misses L. Lavrinskas and K. Burdulis were outstanding on the program. The audience could not have enough of their impressive recitations. The audience was also pleased with the songs offered by G. Ivanauskis with mandolin accompaniment. A solo by Miss S. Kubliauskas and a monologue by Mrs. K. Kenstavicius followed next. They were not bad. To conclude the program, J. Uktveris and Mr. Balciunas presented a dialogue entitled "By the Photographer".</p>
   <p>The Keistutis Club Chorus, under the direction of Mr. Lankelis, opened and closed the program. The singing was adequate, and the audience seemed pleased. The Chorus is comparatively young, and it can be expected to <span class="page-break">2</span>become a truly great chorus. It has many young people with good voices. We should all join in wishing these young people success!</p>
