   <p>We have been informed that plans are being made to issue a new Lithuanian periodical. The name of the new periodical is to be Sauletekis (Sunrise). It will be non-partisan and will contain a variety of features, mostly about farming interests. It is rumored that if the plans materialize the periodical will be published either in the State of Michigan or in the City of Chicago.</p>
