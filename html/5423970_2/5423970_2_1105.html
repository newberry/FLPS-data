   <p>The newly published newspaper Amerikos Lietuwis (the American Lithuanian) states that I am the censor of that newspaper. Such a statement is without my knowledge and consent. Therefore, I am notifying everybody that I do not indulge in any other activities, except the church, neither in politics nor in any publications.</p>
