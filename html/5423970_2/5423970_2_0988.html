   <p>Olsevskis' henohman and Mr. Braculis, the attorney, started the case against Naujienos.</p>
   <p>Reactionary groups and the public bluffers immediately began to criticise and reprove Naujienos as soon as it appeared in Chicago. They realized the fact that Naujienos will not stand for any bluff and will not tolerate injustice done to the people.</p>
   <p>Naujienos, (The News) was organized for the purpose of telling the truth and nothing but the truth to the people. Our opponents are afraid of Naujienos and consider it an enemy and a very dangerous newspaper. So they are using every imaginable means to hurt the Naujienos as much as possible by spreading false propaganda and persuading the people not to buy Naujienos.</p>
   <p>They tried to make a complaint against Naujienos' editor and in addition, they tried to make him an anarchist and wanted to turn him over to federal authorities for deportation.</p>
   <p>They used every means possible to hurt Naujienos, but they failed and their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>efforts were in vain. They were spreading false propaganda openly and secretly against Naujienos, saying that it is corrupting; also discouraging people from reading it. They tried very hard to arouse the sentiment of the people against Naujienos, but this scheme was also foiled and they failed to accomplish their purpose. It was mentioned in Naujienos not once, but several times about this false propaganda against the paper.</p>
   <p>Not very long ago we published correspondence in which it was mentioned that John Kulis, the agent of Mr. Olsevkis, was telling the people that Naujienos' workers were striking and that Naujienos would be bankrupt soon. Those who were thinking day and night how to harm the paper in the most effective way, finally decided to sue Naujienos for injuring the reputation of Olsevskis' agent.</p>
   <p>John Kulis, Mr. Olsevskis' agent, sued Naujienos for $10,000 damages, claiming that Naujienos was trying to ruin his reputation. John Kulis' case was handled by Olsevskis' henchman, Attorney Braculis. On Tuesday morning a summons for appearance in court was served on Mr. Gugis, the president of the Naujienos corporation. we are not concerned greatly as to the outcome of this case, because we have a good witness who will support our statements.</p>
