   <p>The initial stage and motion picture show at the Lithuanian Theater, 3214 South Halsted Street, which was offered last Saturday, October 30, by the Lithuanian Theatrical Company was a great success. A capacity crowd attended the shows on both days, October 30 and 31; there was a shortage of seats during all the performances. In order to accommodate the unexpectedly large attendance, the performance on Sunday, October 31, was repeated seven times. Those who attended the performance stated that the program was very interesting and highly entertaining.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Theatrical Company is operated by Mr. H. Mockus, Mr. I. Pakalniskis, and Mr. V. Kundrotas. The theater will be open twice each week, on Saturdays and Sundays, until Thanksgiving Day, after which it will be open to the public four times each week.</p>
   
   <p>All the actors and actresses on the stage program are Lithuanian-Americans. The stage show is conducted in the Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>Details about the Lithuanian Theatrical Company were printed in the October 29 issue of the Lietuva.</p>
