   <p>The Young Lithuanian-American National Club sponsored a lecture on "The Solar System" last Sunday evening, April 23, (Easter Sunday) at Mark White Square, 29th and Halsted Streets. The lecture was delivered by Mr. J. A. Chmieliauskas, and was very interesting and instructive. However, a very small number of people attended, probably on account of the Easter holiday.</p>
   <p>This Club is doing very praiseworthy work by sponsoring such educational lectures. It is hoped that the Club will continue its good work.</p>
