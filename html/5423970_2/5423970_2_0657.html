   <p>This Sunday, June 25, will be the last day of the Fair now being held in the Town of Lake for the benefit of the Lithuanian Church. The Fair has been going on for quite a long time and will show a good deal of profit. It is being held in the Elijosius Hall. The profit is to be used for the building of a new church for which a plot of ground has been purchased on Hermitage Avenue, between 45th and 46th Streets. The old church is too small, therefore, the building of a larger one is planned.</p>
