   <p>Chicago. The Society of Simonas Daukantas is sending its hearthly gratitude to Dr. John Szliupas and the Rev. Demskis of Scranton, Pa.; W. Karalius, Baltimore, Md., and A. Olszewski, Chicago, for donating books on our request for our library. Also we are thanking the newspaper Vienybe Lietuvninki, Plymouth, Pa., which will send the newspaper free of charge for the entire year.</p>
   <p>Even though the Rev. Krawczunas appropriated our library, but the good people with their donations will again fill the library. Today we have again in our library several scores of books.</p>
   <p>The Simonas Daukantas Society.</p>
   <p>Trans. note:- Rev. Demskis was a Roman-Catholic priest, but he was too <span class="page-break">\2</span>honest to preach hypocrisy, so he quit the Catholic religion and became a free thinker. He wrote several books. The most important are: The Inquisition, From Where Comes the Lies and Wrongdoings of the People, and The Seven Thieves.</p>
