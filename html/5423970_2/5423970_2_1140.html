   <p>A periodical, Pranasas (The Prophet), has made its appearance in Chicago. I saw a copy of it and, according to my crazy thinking, I understand that it is one of those false prophets about whom the pastor sometimes speaks in his sermons. If it were a true prophet, it could have prophesied its own quick demise and, therefore, would have done better not to have been born.</p>
