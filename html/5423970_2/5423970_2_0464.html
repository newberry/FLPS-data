   <p>Last Sunday, at Meldazis Hall, the Birutes Society presented two plays, "Do Not Oppose," and "The Bear." The production was good. The best players among the artists were Mr. B. Vaitekunas, Miss L. Zilvitis and Miss J. S. Misevicius. One can see that the artists are devoting much time and energy to raise the level of theatrical art among Lithuanians. The Birutes Society has completed its activity for this season. During the coming autumn, the Birutes Choir will begin again its theatrical productions.</p>
