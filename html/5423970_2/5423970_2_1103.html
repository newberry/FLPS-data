   <p>No. 21 of Tevyne (Fatherland, organ of the Lithuanian Alliance of America) announces that in Chicago the Rev. Krawczunas started to publish a newspaper under the name Zemaitis (Samogitian).</p>
   <p>The purpose of this new newspaper is to harm Lietuva materially. We have heard for a long time about the coming of this new newspaper. We know very well the intellectual and moral value of Rev. Krawczunas, we have no doubt that the purpose of this newspaper will be as Tevyne has stated.</p>
   <p>As the saying goes, "the owl cannot give birth to the eagle", so Rev. Krawczunas has very little conception about morality, and for this reason he will create nothing good. In Chicago there are many Lithuanians. Lots of room for two newspapers, which can exist without trying to harm each other.</p>

   <p>The duty of a newspaper is to help our brothers, but not to harm them. If the purpose of Rev. Krawczunas' newspaper is to fight us, we will be forced to repel such an attack.</p>
   <p>It is not pleasant for us that a fight with a morally low individual like the Rev. Krawczunas will reflect against innocent priests. When you chop a tree, the chips fly and nobody knows what place they will hit. The same thing will happen in our struggle with this priest, we will be forced to attack the other priests, because they have not courage to caution or wan the wrongdoing priest. The clerical newspapers always are covering the blameful action and trespasses of such a priest.</p>
   <p>We have had an opportunity to convince ourselves in the struggle with Rev. Krawczunas, when we demanded an explanation on why the priest with Lithuanian money established a Polish school, and the accounting of the parish money, which other clerical papers, with minor exception, kept quiet about.</p>
