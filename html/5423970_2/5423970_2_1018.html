   <p>The editorship of Draugas, which has been a headache to certain people, to whom such a problem should be of no concern, has at last been solved. In a recent issue, Draugas announced that in the near future Reverend P. Kemesis, of Lithuania, will come to America and will fill the position of the late Reverend A. Kaupas. The Reverend P. Kemesis, was formerly one of the editors of Viltis (The Hope), in Lithuania. Viltis kept to the "central line" at that time, and we hope that Draugas will not become an extreme right organ. We hope that the Draugas will be kept in the same furrow of patience, as it was conducted by the late Reverend Kaupas.</p>
