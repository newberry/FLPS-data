   <p>January 28, Sunday afternoon, in the church hall, there was a great celebration of the opening of the Lithuanian library.</p>
   <p>There were speeches and declamations. The speakers told about the hardships of Lithuanians under the yoke of Russia, the Polish barons and the Polish priests. That we Lithuanians had been oppressed economically and culturally. For hundreds of years they fought and shed their blood to save their country's independence and culture.</p>
   <p>Now we Lithuanians are living in a free country, we can publish books and newspapers in our native language, open libraries, read books and educate ourselves; no Russian tyrant can stop us.</p>
   <p>By reading books and newspapers we can uplift ourselves, obtain knowledge and culture. Above everything else, we must have unity among ourselves as our forefathers had in the past.</p>
   <p>The celebration was a great success. The hall was crowded to capacity. There never was such a crowd of people before.</p>
   <p>Secretary J. G.</p>
