   <p>Through the efforts of Miss K. Persiukas an evening school for girls has been opened in Bridgeport. The English language is taught here. Classes were begun on February 21.</p>
   <p>It is very encouraging to see that even the girls are not lagging behind in public and enlightenment activity.</p>
   <p>It is true that there is another English language school in this vicinity; but the girls were not satisfied with this and organized a private school. There are fewer students in a private school, and therefore it is easier to teach them. The beginning was very good. Nine students attended the first class. It is expected that the school will be successful.</p>
   <p>Girls who want to study English should take advantage of this opportunity. The school is open every Monday night, from 7:30 to 9:00 o'clock.</p>
