   <p>The science society of Simonas Daukantas, whose library was appropriated by the greedy priest Krawczunas, has opened a new library. Even though the Rev. Krawczunas took all the books of this library, thanks to the good people's donation we were able to open another and better library.</p>
   <p>Today the society and its library is free from the Krawczunas yoke. It can have any kind of books and newspapers. Now everyone can take any book or newspaper to read without the censorship of the Rev. Krawczunas. We are inviting all the Lithuanians to join this liberal science society.</p>
