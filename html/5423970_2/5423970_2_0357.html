   <p>A wonderful show, sponsored by the Lithuanian Women's Enlightenment Society, will be given in M. Meldazis Hall, 2242 W. 23rd Place on Sunday, December 22, 1918.</p>
   <p>A three-act play, "The Blacksmith's Daughter", written by J. J. Zolp, will be presented.</p>
   <p>We invite the public to attend because "The Blacksmith's Daughter" is an unusually beautiful and interesting play, having the present war as its background. It will be well worth seeing. Therefore, do not miss it, for you will be sorry if you do. There will be dancing after the performance.</p>
