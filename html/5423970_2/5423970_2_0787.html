   <p>Branch 3 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America and Branch 20 of the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance of America have decided to establish a library. Each of the branches has donated $20 for the library fund. Therefore, we are appealing to the Lithuanian public of Kensington district to help us with funds to establish the library.</p>
   <p>All of us know that the Lithuanians are far behind other nationalities in culture. To uplift our brothers, to enlighten them, we must have the means: a library where everyone can read all kinds of books and newspapers.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if you see that such a library is essential to the Lithuanians, come with donations and help to spread enlightenment among our ignorant brothers.</p>
   <p>Committee of the above named organization.</p>
