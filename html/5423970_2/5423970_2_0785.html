   <p>The North Side (81st) branch of the Lithuanian Socialist League invites all the local Lithuanian organizations to a get together for the purpose of establishing a Lithuanian library. Well established public Lithuanian libraries for Lithuanians are very necessary. They play a very important role in the general educational uplift of the people.</p>
   <p>There are several rather wealthy Lithuanian organizations on the North Side. One of the aims of these organizations, according to their by-laws, is to promote the intellectual advancement of our people. With the assistance of these organizations, it would be an easy matter to establish a library and a suitable home for it. The library must not be located in a saloon hall so that it would be freely accessible to women and children.</p>
   <p>The desire for a Lithuanian library is constantly increasing among the Lithuanians of the North Side, and attempts to establish one are likewise increasing. These <span class="page-break">\2</span>facts are very good indications, and something of which every Lithuanian can be proud.</p>
   <p>All the Lithuanian organizations of the North Side are asked to elect delegates to a conference which will be called soon to discuss ways and means of establishing a Lithuanian library. Send the names and addresses of the delegates to Mr. J. Mickevicius, 1400 Dickson Street, and he will notify the delegates the time and place of the conference.</p>
