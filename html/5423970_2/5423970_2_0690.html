   <p>The Youth Educational Circle was organized in the Bridgeport colony about four months ago. The purpose of the Circle is to promote the intellectual development of its members. Meetings are held every Monday evening in the engine room of the field house at Mark White Square, 29th and Halsted Streets.</p>
   <p>A lecture on an important educational subject is delivered at every meeting of the Circle. Besides the lecture, discussions are held on important questions. The purpose of the discussions is to develop clear and logical thinking and to train the members in the art of public speaking. Most of the lectures so far have been on psychological subjects.</p>
   <p>Members of the Circle are planning a series of lectures for the general Lithuanian public. The first of these lectures is scheduled for Wednesday, March 31, in the hall at Mark White Square.</p>
