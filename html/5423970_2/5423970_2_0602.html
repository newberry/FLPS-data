   <p>Last Sunday, April 22, the Lithuanian Theatrical Group presented the well-known and famous play "Genevieve."</p>
   <p>The sponsors of this play knew that the Lithuanians do not care much to go to see such a play, because they do not know the value of such a spectacle. The sponsors of this play asked the Reverend Krauczunas to announce in the church about this performance. Reverend Krauczunas very gladly announced it and urged the people to come and see this wonderful spectacle.</p>
   <p>The actors did their parts wonderfully. The people saw one of the greatest religious plays, and the devotion of a wife to her husband. There was not one dry eye among the spectators.</p>
   <p>The play was a great success not only spiritually but financially as well. The profit was donated to the people of Kraziai, Lithuania, where the terrible massacre of Lithuanians was committed by the Russian Cossacks under the order of the Russian government.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians will remember this spectacle for a long time.</p>
