   <p>The Dr. V. Kudirka chorus is completely organized at last. On February 4th it had its first practice. The second practice will be on February 11, at 7:30 P. M., at 869 W. 33rd Place.</p>
   <p>We are lacking men and girls with good voices. Those who have good voices should come and join the chorus. Those who want to participate in cultural and artistic activity should come without delay.</p>
