   <p>On Easter evening, March 23, the Lithuanian Catholic Pleasure Club presented a play at Stancikas Hall, Kensington. They presented the six-act, so-called drama, "Mary, the Organist's Daughter". The "drama" is very scanty, its dramatization is bad. Its contents are too mixed up: revolution, spies and [the struggle against] Polanism; there was no point to this so-called drama.</p>
