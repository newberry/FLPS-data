   <p>p.10.....Swithiod Military Band has been engaged by Lincoln Park for two concerts, Aug. 6, and 13, respectively. This is the first time a Swedish band has been given the opportunity to play in the park, and it should be of particular interest to our countrymen. We are indebted to our Mr. John F. Friedlund, member of the park board, for this engagement. The program for both concerts is as follows: Aug. 6th from 3 to 5 P.M. :</p>
