   <p>Capital $200,000; reserves $40,000. Established and operated by Scandinavian businessmen, it has enjoyed a steady, sound growth from the very beginning. All of the bank's officials are Swedes, as are most of its patrons, and we therefore particularly invite countrymen to bank with us, where they can depend on absolute security and fair dealing.</p>
   <p>We have now on deposit more than one million dollars, most of which are Swedish accounts.</p>
   <p>We do all types of banking business, and pay three per cent interest on savings accounts and two per cent on checking accounts over $1,000.</p>
   <p>Our savings department is open every Monday night until eight. The bank is located at La Salle and Randolph Streets.</p>
