   <p>Do not forget the occasion of Wennerberg's Concert August 31. You are invited to this national song festival. Let us gather there as Swedes to honor Swedish song and reveal the memories of our youth's fosterland. The program will be found elsewhere in this paper, and to say the least, it will be a large affair, and if we all go there to make it a gala occasion, it will be a social occasion as enjoyable as we have ever had the pleasure of attending.</p>
