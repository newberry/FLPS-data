   <p>As such may be described the communication which was sent the other week by our government as reply to the German government concerning the action of submarines, and other offenses against international law as hitherto conceived.</p>
   <p>The German offer, to permit the American citizens to travel by sea under certain conditions, was politely but definitely refused. The United States consider having the right to such travel, in its capacity as a neutral power and will not permit any qualification of this right. As it is said with complete justification, to permit of such qualification of the right to travel at sea as suggested by the Germans, would imply the abolition of the very principle of free travel at sea, a principle which the government declares itself ready to defend at any cost.------- The German government has thus been informed of the stand taken by U.S., and it now knows what is required if the friendship of the U.S., is to be retained. If the German government will not abide by these requirements, it must accept the consequences.</p>

   <p>What these consequences are to be cannot be stated at the present time. It does not seem probable to us that war is to come. We do expect that Germany will avoid this. Even though new difficulties may arise, a spirit of reasonableness may be expected on the part of the U.S., unless Germany were to take action which could not be interpreted except as disdain of the warning expressed in our latest communication.-----</p>
