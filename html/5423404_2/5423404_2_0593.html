   <p>There was a time when a politician only had to make generous use of high-sounding phrases, such as the one about the farmer being the backbone of the country and other good old standbys, to secure the farmer's vote in an election year, but this does no longer suffice. The tiller of the soil is more and more aware of his real worth, and makes no secret of it.</p>
   <p>The Farmer's Co-operative Union of America is a strong organization which has been formed for the protection of the farmer's commercial interests and as a medium for unified action. This organization has just re-elected as its president, Charles S. Barret, who is an exceptionally able man and an agricultural expert well acquainted with conditions among farmers in the various parts of this big country. His efforts in behalf of the Union have already brought beneficial results and he holds high hopes for the future of the farm population. <span class="page-break">\2</span>In fact he believes that the latter will from now on relinquish its passive, waiting role, and take an active, leading part in America's political, commercial, and industrial progress.</p>
   <p>Mr. Barret is not alone in this belief, and we will add that the country as a whole is sure to benefit by such an active participation in its affairs by the farmer. There is something solid and faith-inspiring about the simple wisdom and keen intelligence which have their roots in the good earth.</p>
