   <p>The Swedish Engineering Society of Chicago counts among its members several young men who received their technical training in Sweden and who, after having worked for a few years in this country, already have made a name for themselves within their own specialized fields of engineering. Many of them have attained such brilliant success at a very early age that their future possibilities seem almost limitless. To this group belongs the young man whom we have selected as the subject of this week's In the Foreground article. His name is Eric O. Hamren. He is a mechanical engineer and is at present employed by the Webster Manufacturing Company here, as head of its drafting department. Hamren, who came to Chicago in June of last year, has already patented several devices used in power transmission, and more patents are pending.</p>

   <p>He was born in Nensjo, Angermanland, Sweden, June 15, 1893, and attended the public school of Kramfors. Later he worked for two years in a lumber mill, and it was during that time that he hit upon the idea of becoming a mechanical engineer. In his spare time he studied machines, and read all the books on the subject that he could get his hands on. But he was fully aware that he had a long and hard road ahead of him. It is not easy for a poor boy to realize such a dream. That Hamren was able to do so is due chiefly to the aid he received from a well-known business man in his community, who made it possible for him, at the age of fifteen to enter the high school at Gudmundra. From there he went to the Technical Institute of Harnosand, from which he graduated with honors in 1913. During his summer vacation in 1912 he worked as an assistant engineer on an ocean liner, and visited several foreign countries, among them England, France, Holland, Portugal, and Spain.</p>
   <p>In 1913 he obtained employment as a draftsman in the railroad shops at Linkoping, and a year later we find him as a draftsman at the army arsenal in Visby. During <span class="page-break">3</span>this time he created several inventions of military value, and these are now being utilized by the Swedish army. His last job in Sweden was with the Bofors armament works. In August, 1915, he decided to go to America.</p>
   <p>He went first to Marshfield, Oregon, where he worked as an engineer for the C. A. Smith Lumber Company. But Hamren thought that the East offered better opportunities, and in 1917 we find him in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he worked as a draftsman for the Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company. He remained there until 1918, when he became chief of the drafting department of the T. L. Smith firm of the same city. He worked for this firm until June of last year, when he came to Chicago to take over the position which he now holds.</p>
   <p>Hamren's parents are living in Kramfors, and his two brothers are going to school, planning to become mechanical engineers like their big brother in America. He is happy to be able to help them financially.</p>
   <p>Besides the Swedish Engineering Society, Hamren belongs to the American <span class="page-break">4</span>Association of Engineers and to the American-Scandinavian Foundation.</p>
   <p>He lives at 4722 Costello Avenue.</p>
