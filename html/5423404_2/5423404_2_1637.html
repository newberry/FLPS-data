   <p>This is one of the strongest Swedish organizations in Chicago. Only the name is new. It is the name assumed last Wednesday by what had been the Svithiod Singing Club, and the members hope to go forward under this new name to new victories in both a musical and a social sense.</p>
   <p>The fact that such a typically Swedish organization as the Svithiod Singing Club finds it necessary to change its time-honored name is a somewhat depressing sign of the times. It indicates a trend which, no matter how distasteful it may be to Swedes of the old school, can not be disregarded. It is making itself felt in our national singing circles throughout our adopted country.</p>
   <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when Swedish song in Chicago reached its zenith, blossoming forth in all its vigor and beauty. When old singers left, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their voices were replaced by new, young ones, coming from Old Svea [poetical name for Sweden]. But that time is passing, and the singing fraternity must now look to American-born Swedes for reinforcements. Swedish song is now going through a transition period, and the Svithiod Club wants to help and encourage those who were born in this country to understand and appreciate the Swedish language and song. We cannot, and would not want to, make old-country Swedes out of children born in America to Swedish parents. But we do want to invite them to join the transplanted Swedes, who learned to love Swedish song in the country of its origin, and who want to make it known on this side of the ocean.</p>
   <p>Some three decades ago, when practically all members of our organizations had been born in Sweden, no more fitting name than Svithiod could be found for a Swedish society. But times and conditions have changed and so have we.</p>
   <p>It was not without hesitation that the members of Svithiod gave up the venerable <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>name and assumed one that is easier on the American tongue and ear. Let us hope that their sacrifice has not been made in vain.</p>
   <p>The Orion Choir will continue practicing every Wednesday night in the old clubhouse at 624 Wrightwood Avenue, and singers of Swedish ancestry are welcome.</p>
