   <p>Mr. P. L. Hedberg, of Humboldt Park, has for many years made the so-called Metal Weather Strips and Dust Shields for doors and windows, and has now advanced so far that he practically controls the market for this product. Hedberg recently received his seventh patent in the United States, and the first one in Canada. The weather strips are made of thin copper plate, and are fastened on windows and doors in such a manner that draft and dust are excluded, but, at the same time, make it possible for doors and windows to be opened very easily.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hedberg was born in Sweden. He has worked himself through many difficulties, and has now more orders than he can fill. Where his fabricate is known, there is no market for similar weather strips. The public is cordially invited to visit his factory at 1617 North Troy Street.</p>
