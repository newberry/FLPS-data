   <p>The Svenska Sangar Forbundet (Union of Swedish Singers) held its annual meeting last Saturday in the halls of the Svithiod Sangarklubb (Svithiod Singing Club) under the direction of its chairman, C. Hjalmar Lundquist. Practically all of the delegates from its seven societies were present at the opening of the meeting, and a large number of other friends of music also attended. The first two hours were taken up with the reading of the minutes, the rendition of committee reports, etc. After this business, the meeting was adjourned. Supper was then served in the dining room. When transactions were reopened, the question of a singing excursion to Sweden in 1922 was taken up. A few of the delegates quailed at the expenses and urged that the final disposition of the question be postponed until after the song festival of the Union of Swedish Singers in Worcester, Massachusetts this summer, but these were in the minority and a decision was reached to arrange for the proposed excursion. One member from each society is to serve on the arrangements committee, and this committee is to meet in a month to begin work on the plans. In connection with this, it was decided that the income of the society from concerts, summer outings, bazaars, and other affairs, which are held before the song tour, is to go to the travel fund, after deducting necessary expenses. Another important decision reached was to invite the Union of Swedish Singers of America to hold its next convention in Chicago, in 1924. This invitation will be presented to the union at the convention in Worcester this summer. It was also decided to begin the campaign for funds for these two great events already this spring through the arrangements of another concert of a more pretentious nature. After these, and other important decisions were arrived at, the election of the directorate for the year of 1920 was in order. For chairman, C. Hjalmar Lundquiest was re-elected; first vice-chairman, August Thorson; second vice-chairman, Adolph Carlberg; secretary, Fred Bolling; treasurer, Hugo E. Jansen; librarian, Ben Peterson; publicity agent, Elof Peterson; monitor, Oscar Stomberg; chorus director, Joel Mossberg; auditors Carl Blumenthal, Frank Lundberg, and Thorsten Flodin. Prior to the election, the retiring officers rendered their annual reports, which were both exhaustive and interesting. The report of the chairman was especially inspiring. This was received enthusiastically, and the meeting decided to submit to the Musiktidningen (Music Journal) for publication. The treasurer reported that the treasury balance had increased more than $1000 during the year. After the election many encouraging talks were given interspersed with songs.</p>
