   <p>Linnea, the Swedish-American ladies' quartette, gave a concert in Schiller Hall last Saturday evening, and it was a success in every way. The popular quartette consists of the following members: Mrs. Signe Mortensson, director, Miss Lovendahl, Miss Hakanson and Miss Jansson. The many songs presented were delivered with excellent style and revealed high musical understanding.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, there is no Swedish ladies' quartette in Chicago except the Linnea...and we gladly welcome any public concert by this quartette.</p>
