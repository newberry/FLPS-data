   <p>Much has been written, from time to time, about the risk assumed by the capitalist when he tries to invest his capital during times of financial and industrial crises. The workers are constantly being warned not to act in a manner to cause the withdrawal of capital from industry, since the workers would then become idle and would starve. We admit that there is a certain amount of sense in this, but it must also be remembered that the capitalist is not the only one who assumes risks in connection with industrial undertakings. There are not many industries in which the workers do not risk live and limb--a risk far greater than that of all the industrialist's millions of dollars.</p>
   <p>The life insurance companies know more about the risks assumed by the worker than does the worker himself. The very existence of the life insurance companies depends on the accuracy with which their statisticians fulfill their tasks. From the information contained in the reports of these statisticians, the insurance premiums are calculated. On these reports, in so far as they deal with dangerous occupations, are based the insurance tables that determine what the workers that are employed in hazardous work must pay if they are to obtain insurance. Some occupations are so dangerous that the people employed in them are unable to obtain any insurance at all. As for other occupations, the insurance premiums are placed so high that the workers are unable to pay them.</p>
   <p>It has been proven, for example, that the work in plants manufacturing knives and scissors is particularly dangerous. In every plant of this kind, the air is full of metallic particles resulting from the grinding of metal, and these fine particles are inhaled into the lungs of the workers, causing asthma and tuberculosis. The operator of the grinder inhales so much of this metallic dust that he seldom reaches the age of forty, while the polisher of needles, who started at his work when he was seventeen, is considered lucky if he can reach the age of thirtyseven.</p>
   
   <p>Some of the worst industrial diseases befall those who sort wool and those who handle skins before they [the skins]are tanned. Not only do these workers inhale poisonous emanations from the material they handle; they are also in danger of blood poisoning, which results in boils and carbuncles.</p>
   <p>The glass blower, no matter how strong his constitution may be, cannot escape an untimely and certain death, as a result of his occupation. The life insurance companies are not eager to insure the lives of glass blowers. In all glass manufacturing plants the air is full of millions of sharp glass particles; these, after being inhaled, form a deposit in the lungs, where they cause bleeding that leads to an early death. The glass blower is also in danger of losing his ability to speak; this danger arises from the peculiar methods of work, which, in particular, overexert, and thereby paralyze, the jaws. In the mirror factories, the workers are exposed to still another hazard: mercury poisoning. Less than forty percent of the workers in the glass manufacturing plants are able to continue their work for twenty years, before death claims them.</p>
   
   <p>The work of the miner is dangerous both on account of the many accidents occurring in the mines, and on account of the unwholesome air to be found in the tunnels. No other workers suffer as much from diseases of the lungs as do the miners; in addition, their living in semi-darkness engenders blindness...Those who hold jobs as brakemen or switchmen with the railroads will find that many life insurance companies will refuse to insure their lives. Workers in powder mills, in sawmills, and those employed as divers will have difficulty in obtaining life insurance. And yet, with the exception of the divers, the workers in these various productive enterprises are not being paid any higher wages than those received by workers in less dangerous occupations.</p>
   <p>In determining wages within the various industries, special attention should be paid to the element of risk involved in the different kinds of work done. The worker ought to be paid in accordance with the risk to life and limb connected with his tasks.</p>
