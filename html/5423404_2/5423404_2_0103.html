   <p>The proposal made by Mayor Dunne in the City Council, that a referendum be taken to ascertain what the people thought of a renewal of the streetcar company's franchise, was defeated by a vote of 40 to 26. During the election campaign the present members of the City Council promised the voters the right of referendum, but now the situation is different. The Chicago Daily News does not approve of a referendum. All honor to Mayor Edward F. Dunne, who is trying to live up to his promises which he made during his election campaign.</p>
