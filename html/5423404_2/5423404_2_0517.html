   <p>Miss Anna Danielson, the Swedish educator mentioned in a previous issue of this paper, arrived in Chicago last Thursday afternoon. On the evening of the same day, a social in her honor was held in the rooms of Chicago Woman's Club, in the Fine Arts Building. This manner of greeting an honored guest from a foreign land was sponsored by Swedish-American Woman's Club, the International Women's Luther League (Chicago Branch), and the Women's Home and Foreign Mission Society, and a large number of Swedes who gathered to welcome the guest of honor.</p>
   <p>The social opened with a violin solo by Miss Karin Lindskog, accompanied by Mr. Sigurd Meck. The Rev. Mrs. Emma Evald made a speech of welcome....</p>

   <p>to Miss Danielson. She emphasized that women in Sweden are not at all behind their brothers in the country, and in this connection mentioned some Swedish women who have won international fame. Among them: Christina Nelson, Jenny Lind, Fredrika Bremer, Selma Lagerlof. We waited in vain, however, for the name of the woman who has endeared herself so greatly to all Swedish lovers of liberty, Miss Ellen Key.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Evald introduced Editor Jacob Bongren, who had tuned his many-stringed lyre, and in honor of the occasion, gave an ode to the women of the North. Our little song bird, Miss Ida Linn, charmed us with an attractive English song, which we would have been glad to have exchanged for one of the joyous refreshing Swedish folk songs. Reverend Mrs. Tengvall gave a speech <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in Swedish in honor of Miss Danielson. Knowing as we do Mrs. Tengvall's views concerning the instruction in religion in the public schools, we do not quite understand her expression of hope that "from the practical American method of education, Miss Danielson might take home with her ideas by which she might benefit the Swedish educational system, based as it is upon Christian principles."</p>
   <p>After the speech, Miss Helen Svenson sang a couple of English songs, and Miss Anna Evald gave two recitations. The Concordia Sextette, consisting of six young girls, sang an appealing song, and the female jurist, Mrs. McCullom, delivered a speech in which she emphasized that the knowledge-thirsty women in America as well as in other countries had been obliged to fight to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>gain entrance into the higher institutions of learning..... The well-known soloist, Miss Margaret Dahlstrom, gave a number, and as the last on the program, the guest of honor made a warm-hearted speech in English. The fact that she had an easy command of English furnished proof of the truth of the statements made by earlier speakers concerning women as against men: that the knowledge-thirsty woman does not rank below the knowledge-thirsty man. Miss Danielson expressed surprise that Swedes in America could remain Swedes in their hearts and souls and yet be good Americans.... She acknowledged that Sweden can learn much from the American system of education, but she also contended that America can learn much from the Swedish educational system.....</p>
   <p>After the program, a light supper was served in the richly decorated hall of the social.</p>
