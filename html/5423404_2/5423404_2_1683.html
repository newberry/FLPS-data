   <p>The second and third concerts by the "Kronobergarne" were held last Sunday and Tuesday nights at Orchestra Hall, with capacity houses on both nights. The programs were much better than at the first concert. The Harmony and the Glee clubs assisted. But the great attraction on the program was Mrs. Mally Hogberg, the great opera singer from Stockholm, who took the public by storm. Her husband, director Hogberg, who lead the Kronoberg's Regiment Music Corps, presented a new program which included the well-known Sousa March, "Stars and Stripes." Director Hogberg received a wreath at the third concert.</p>
