   <p>The "Super Maid" Cook Ware Corporation was founded not quite a year ago as a subsidiary company of the Advance Pattern and Foundry Co. 36th Place and California avenue. The officers of the two companies are the same, namely: Nels Shoan, E.R. Grundstrom and R.W. Wilson, all three are Swedish, although Mr. Wilson was born right here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The "Super Maid" corporation has attracted nation-wide attention during its short existence. The company's products, cooking utensils, are not only of a patented design, but the material used, an aluminum alley, is a strictly guarded secret. The design and principle involved make it possible to cook any kind of food without the use of water, so that not only the natural flavor but also valuable vitamins and mineral salts are retained.</p>
   <p>The "Super Maid" Co. already employs a sales staff of about 200 people in Chicago alone.</p>
