   <p>The Swedish Choral Club is now an Institution in the music world of our people and more particularly in the music world of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This organization gave its first concert Tuesday night in Orchestra Hall to a full house. The program consisted chiefly of two major musical creations, namely: "Jul-Oratorium" (Christmas Oratorium )of Saint Soens and Mendensohns, "Hymn of Praise."</p>
   <p>The soloists were: Esther Nelson, Esther Pearson, Hazel Huntley, John B. Miller and Joel Mossberg, who was really outstanding. At the organ was Harry T. Carlson. The orchestra was composed of forty members of Chicago Sumphony Orchestra,whose ability is well known. The tonal range and quality of the choir was perfect, in fact, the concert was a positive triumph and its energetic leader, Edgar A. Nelson, is to be commended too.</p>
