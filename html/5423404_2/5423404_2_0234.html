   <p>Whereas, In Chicago there are 150,000 citizens of Swedish birth or ancestry who are desirous of manifesting their loyalty and devotion to the United States, which has welcomed them, granted them citizenship protection, and opened to them and their children opportunities unequaled under any other flag to reap the fruits of their toil, build and maintain homes, enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and, whereas, we are the descendants of Swedish-Americans domiciled in this country for two hundred and eighty years and active participants in every war in which the United States has fought for independence, union and liberty; therefore, be it Resolved, That we take measures to support the President and Congress in their conduct of the war, and that we pledge to the United States, for her defense against every foe our moral and material support, our lives and our all.</p>
   <p>This great meeting which passed the above resolution, closed with the singing of the Star Spangled Banner.</p>
