   <p>Only a few of those who visit the great Oakhill Cemetery, south of Chicago, know that most of the tombstones and monuments to be seen there are the works of a Swede. If one walks a few blocks north from the cemetery and then along 115th Street to Fairfield Avenue he comes to a stone cutting yard, which is located directly opposite the entrance of the Mount Hope Cemetery, and bears the name of A. O. Novander. He has delivered most of the stones and monuments on Oakhill as well as on Mount Hope, Mount Olive, Evergreen and other cemeteries in and near Chicago.</p>
   <p>Our countryman Novander is an oldtimer in the city, having come here in 1869, <span class="page-break">2</span>before the great fire. He was born October 21, 1851, in the vicinity of the Grandmother Mine, near Atvidaberg, Sweden. Soon after his arrival in Chicago he went to work for a monument firm at Franklin and Washington Streets, and stayed there until the time of the big fire in 1871. After the fire the firm moved to Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street, and young Novander remained until 1883, when he opened a stone-cutting yard of his own at the present location, near Mount Hope Cemetery. Since then he has delivered a large number of memorial stones of all types; some of them very expensive. He is, himself, a very able stone-worker, and besides making tombstones he has also done much fine ornamental work on downtown skyscrapers.</p>
   <p>He has made his home in Morgan Park since 1880, and now lives at 11150 South Hoyne Avenue. Naturally, he is one of the best-known Swedes in the district, and it may be mentioned that he is a shareholder in the corporation which owns the Oakhill Cemetery.</p>
   <p>At the time he moved to Morgan Park, he married Hilma Carlstrom from Atvidaberg; <span class="page-break">3</span>and four children, one daughter and three sons, have been born to them. Mrs. Novander died four years ago as a result of an accident. One of the boys is now his father's first assistant in the business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Novander has been a Free Mason for many years, and in 1896 he was made a master of his lodge. The following year he was named Grand Lecturer, a rank which he still holds; and it is worthy of note that he is now the order's oldest Grand Lecturer in Chicago. He also belongs to the Royal League order, and worships in the Congregational Church near his home.</p>
