   <p>Child health and child training are subjects which rate a prominent place among the sciences but are, unfortunately, given too little practical and popular attention. According to official statistics one hundred and sixty out of every one thousand American babies die before they are one year old, and this death rate is highest in families in the low income groups. Reports from Erfurt, Germany, reveal that among the working classes of that city, five hundred out of every one thousand babies die during their first year of life.</p>
   <p>These figures are appalling and if such a death rate existed among cattle, for instance, the government would certainly be expected to spend millions of dollars, if necessary, for research into the causes and cures of such a terrible plague, and our sympathy would go out to the farmer.</p>

   <p>Ignorance and poverty are the baby's worst enemies, and we mention them in the order of their importance. Poverty is likely to be with us for some time to come, judging from present indications, but much can be done to eliminate ignorance. A newspaper has recently suggested that every applicant for a marriage license be required to take an approved course in the fundamentals of good housekeeping, health protection, and child care. We think our colleague has got something there.</p>
