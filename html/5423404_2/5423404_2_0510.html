   <p>Dispatches from Sweden bring the news that two women have been elected to high municipal offices in Stockholm, one of them a representative of the Labor party. It was hoped that the new franchise law would bring about beneficial changes and reforms in municipal and national government and indications are that such hopes were justified. And so far we have seen only the beginning. One of the newly elected officials, Mrs. Gerda Manson, a member of the Socialist party, has declared that she is deeply interested in the housing problem, and will concentrate her efforts on its early solution, because inadequate housing not only causes suffering among the lower classes but also has a destructive moral effect.</p>

   <p>In the state of Kansas women vote at municipal elections, and not long ago the ladies of Emporia demonstrated what determined women can do. The male city fathers, in their wisdom, did not bother about the disposal of the refuse and garbage accumulating in streets and alleys. But the women felt that the condition was both disgraceful and unsanitary, and decided to clean up. They controlled the required number of votes, and Emporia is now a clean city, thanks to the community spirit of its women. Another remarkable report comes from the state of Indiana, where much-needed housing regulations recently went into effect, chiefly through the efforts of one woman.</p>
   <p>When distinguished jurists and statesmen in England recently gathered to revise existing divorce laws they showed intelligence enough to call in a number of women as advisers.</p>
   <p>Even if women have not won the right to vote, their opinion should be sought, particularly on matters of primary interest to them.</p>
