   <p>Our countryman, C. S. Peterson, has donated a considerable sum to the Bush Conservatory of Music of this city for the establishment of a special department, which will open this fall, and which will be known as the Master School of Music.</p>
   <p>Many promising young musicians from various parts of the country have registered in this new department. Students are to be admitted on a selective basis, and auditions will be held during the week of September 19-24.</p>
