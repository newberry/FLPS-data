   <p>Professors of our great and venerable educational institutions often submit ideas and proposals of such a utopian and impractical nature that they cannot be realized at the present stage of our civilization. But even a blind hen may happen to find a grain of corn, and a few days ago M. J. Rosenan of Harvard suggested the organization of what he called a "public health-militia," for the purpose of studying health and sanitary conditions and proposing progressive legislation in that field.</p>
   <p>This is a fine constructive idea. America has reason to be proud of its record in the field of sanitation and public health in such places as Havana, Panama, and Manila, but it must be admitted that our accomplishments at home leave much to be desired, and in some instances our authorities have failed to take the most elementary protective measures.</p>
   
   <p>If a disease threatens our potato crop; if a strange bug attacks vegetables and plants; or if an unknown malady kills off domestic or wild animals, public agencies get busy and do everything within their power to get rid of the pest, but at the same time epidemics of diseases such as typhoid and tuberculosis do not cause any such excitement; in fact, they pass almost unnoticed except by the victims and their families.</p>
   <p>Professor Rosenan proposes a national organization for the study of health and sanitation in all their phases. Such a project costs a lot of money, and offers an excellent opportunity for our millionaires and philanthropists to erect a monument to their public-spirited generosity, and at the same time serve the finest humanitarian purpose. This is one field that is not yet overcrowded.</p>
