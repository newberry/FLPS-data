   <p>has been made by our countryman, William Noren, who resides at 3211 Portland Ave. The invention consists of a small contraption, which receives and registers the amounts of money put in the till. In a sense it is a regular cash register, but is superior to that because it is easier to manipulate and costs less. To illustrate the latter point, whereas the usual price of a cash register is from $100 to $150, Mr. Moren's device will sell at $50. He is securing a patent on the invention.</p>
