   <p>The United States Bureau of the Census announced last week that ten million American women make their living as wage earners, while twenty-three million do all, or almost all, of the housework in their homes.</p>
   <p>In this country the percentage of women not engaged in some definite kind of work is very low. Most of those who are not listed by the census as wage earners devote much of their time to useful club and welfare work. The number of women who are seeking regular employment in various fields of activity is steadily increasing. The struggle for existence and the desire for a higher standard of living are becoming more and more intense, and have, together with the general spirit of the times, driven women to seek employment in industry, and many of them hold on to their jobs even after marriage.</p>
   <p>In various periodicals one may, from time to time, run across articles written <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by women who attempt to show that there is not future for their sex in industry and the professions. They even advise business women to withdraw to the sheltered life of the home. But modern women could not follow that sort of advice even if they wanted to, because of the economic and social changes which have taken place during the last few decades. A great number of them have become self-supporting and must remain so. Their next move should be to obtain that to which they are entitled--equal opportunities with men and equal pay for equal work.</p>
