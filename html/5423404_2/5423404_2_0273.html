   <p>During a period of peace all nations make sincere efforts towards making life more and more pleasant and worth living. Doctors and scientists seek ways and means of relieving suffering, lengthening life, and employ the forces of nature for the benefit of mankind; statesmen strive for a just distribution of the good things of life; philosophers and educators try to teach people to think independently, refine their senses and desires, and attain more self-control.</p>
   <p>But every so often nations go on a rampage, fighting each other, breaking down much of what has previously been built up, committing mass murder, and destroying the fruits of long periods of labor. And when one outbreak is over, preparations are immediately under way for the next one, for the purpose of making the destruction complete.</p>

   <p>This is sheer insanity, the scourge of humanity. History offers us some consolation, however, by indicating that the efforts which have been put forth by the world's best minds to combat this insanity have not been entirely in vain. A study of the history of war discloses that the attacks have become less and less frequent, and, on the whole, in spite of more efficient weapons, less productive of general suffering and destruction. We are making progress, but very slowly, and we still have a long way to go.</p>
