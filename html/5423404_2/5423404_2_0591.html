   <p>There will be no danger of an oversupply of farmers and farm labor in this country for a long time to come. The number of consumers of farm products, which is increasing rapidly, is now nearing the one hundred million mark, and almost everything that these people eat must come from the country.</p>
   <p>Cattle and poultry raising require a good deal of training and insight, and these types of farming are more affected by the rising prices than any other, and offer great opportunities for those that are ready to take advantage of them. Very suitable land may be found within an hour's train travel from most of the large cities of the East, and conditions there are altogether promising.</p>
   <p>It is often said and believed that schools and other educational facilities <span class="page-break">2</span>in the country are poor as compared to those in the cities, but such statements are open to doubt, and there is much to be said in favor of the country. City schools are often overcrowded, and classes are so large that teachers cannot pay much attention to individual pupils, while in a country school a much closer relationship exists. In addition, life in the country is generally considered to be more conducive to a balanced and healthy physical and mental development. The nervous restlessness and haste of the city often place their mark upon the impressionable child.</p>
   <p>There is need for more farmers and agricultural workers, but it is not likely that any great exodus from the city to the country will take place, and with the present distribution of our population everyone may look forward to a steadily increasing cost of living.</p>
