   <p>Mr. Gustaf Adolf Akerlind, "the grand old man" among Swedish engineers in Chicago, has retired from his services with the City Engineering Department after just having passed his seventieth birthday. He now intends to return to Sweden to spend his declining years in the circle of close relations.</p>
   <p>In honor of Mr. Akerlind a farewell banquet was given last Saturday by the Swedish Engineers' Society, of which Mr. Akerlind is one of the founders and the first secretary. Mr. C. G. Axell, the Society's president, delivered the principle speech and presented the guest of honor with a beautiful gold watch as a token of appreciation from the members, at the same time announcing that Mr. Akerlind had been elected an honorary member of the society.</p>
