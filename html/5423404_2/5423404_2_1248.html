   <p>Last Sunday, this concert was presented before a large audience. The well-arranged program consisted of songs by the club, solos by Mme. Marie Sidenius-Zendt, a violin solo by Mr. Johannes, and a duet by Messrs. Lonnerblad and Anthony, who both are members of the club. The public was pleased and rewarded the chorus and the artists with generous applause.</p>
