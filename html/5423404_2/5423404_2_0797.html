   <p>"The Pearl of Chicago" as Lincoln Park is called, presents itself in a most beautiful setting this summer all the way from North Ave. to Diversy St. and from Clark St. down to the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
   <p>The most beautiful spot seems to be near the main entrance to the park, where there is a beautiful flower bed seventy-eight feet long and sixty-four feet wide, filled with thousands of different flowers. The gardener who planted it is our countryman, C. J. Strombeck, who has been employed at the park for fourteen years. He has five assistants. More than 200,000 flowers were planted by him this spring. He also takes care of all the greenhouses. Strombeck was born in Linkoping, Sweden. He was graduated at the Swedish Garden Society, Stockholm and arrived in Chicago in 1869.</p>
