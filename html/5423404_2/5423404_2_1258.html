   <p>At the next appearance of the music corps of Royal Kronoberg's Regiment in Chicago, the public will have the pleasure of listening to a Swedish Opera singer, Mr. Mally Hogberg, wife of the director of the music corps, Eric Hogberg. Her repertoire for her appearance with the corps includes compositions by Peterson-Berger, Grieg, Hallstrom, Alfen, and Lindblad, and the aria from "Tannhauser," by Wagner. She made her debut at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm in May, 1904, as "Santuzza" in "Pa Sicilien," the second appearance in September as "Micaela" in "Carmen," and the third appearance in October as "Agatha" in "Friskytten." Two days before she started for America, she assisted at the concert by the Music Society, and sang the soprano part in Cherubini's great Mass, which was given for the first time in Stockholm under the direction of Prof. Franz Neruda.</p>
