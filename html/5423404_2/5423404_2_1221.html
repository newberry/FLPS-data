   <p>Helmer Ortengren, baritone, appears to be pursued by continued ill luck in regard to his appearances before the Chicago public. His concert at the Swedish Club, on December 7, had to be postponed because he had a severe cold. Last Sunday, when the concert actually took place, Mr. Ortengren's throat was far from recovered. For this reason he, unfortunately, could not make his usual good impression. The doctor had ordered him not to force his voice in the least, and if he did not follow this order his voice might have been shattered forever. Therefore, he was obliged to restrict himself to singing his numbers in the most artistic manner possible, without at the same time daring to let loose the power which lives in his voice. From what he presented one could still judge that he owns a rare and beautiful voice, which is sympathetic and sweeping. His articulation of text was surpassing, and his delivery for the most <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>part facile. Mr. Ortengren gave renditions of compositions by Wagner, Sjoberg, Svedbom, Arlberg, Nordquist, Bedinger, and Andreas Hallen. His interpretation of Bedinger's "Vuggesang" (Cradle Song) was perhaps best of all, for here his voice came fully into its own. We hope to be able to hear Mr. Ortengren again at a concert when he will be able to do justice to his wonderful voice. He is really a man of music, and worthwhile knowing. We believe the public will be grateful to again have the pleasure of hearing him. Mr. Ortengren is, from what we understand, always open for engagements. His address, until further notice is 5724 Kenmore Avenue. Mr. Ortengren was brilliantly assisted by the worthy singer, Mrs. Edna Swanson Ver Haar who is to be one of the stars of the Swedish Choral Club during the excursion to Sweden this summer. Her singing is as remarkable as is her beauty and charm, and we think it unnecessary to say more. All of her numbers were received with stormy applause, which reached its culmination after she had sung a roguish encore. The concert ended with several duets by <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Ortengren, and Mrs. Ver Haar. After the first portion of the program, the Swedish Glee Club took the stage and sang "Vart Land" (Our Land) and "Hoross Svea" (Hear Us Svea). Under the direction of Einar F. Soderwall, both of these numbers were sung with spirit and were well received by the public. This was the first public appearance of the Glee Club after its resurrection from the world of the dead. The rest seems to have given its members new powers and an enthusiasm which was lacking in the past, and therefore this lack of enthusiasm made it dull. We wish the chorus success and prosperity in the future.</p>
