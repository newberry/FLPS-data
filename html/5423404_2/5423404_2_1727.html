   <p>The Svithiod Singing Club's minstrel show last Sunday night was witnessed by a large audience. The show fully merited the large attendance. From the very start, great enthusiasm was evident, and laughter and applause followed throughout the presentation. Every number had to be given da capo, some of them being repeated two and three times. Messrs. Dahlen, Anthony, and Valley won special favor by their singing. Messrs. Franson and Nelson played the comic roles in the show, appearing in black-face and in typical negro attire.</p>
   <p>On Saturday evening the same minstrel show will again be presented, and it is expected that many of those who witnessed the show on Sunday will be present, and that many others will also attend so as to get a chance to laugh.</p>
