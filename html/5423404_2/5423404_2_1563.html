   <p>The Svithiod Singing Society of Chicago is about to leave for Sweden and will begin on its tour less than a fortnight hence. Because the money required to meet the huge expenses for an undertaking of this kind did not come in as early as was expected last year, the project was for a long time very dubious attainment, Some of the members, however, and two of them in particular came to the rescue at the critical moment, when other plans seemed to fail. The two donors are the Club's president John A. Lind, the contractor, and County Architect Eric E. Hall, both of them known for their unselfish generosity. They not only contributed $1,000, each, but they also exerted themselves further to the extent of securing contributions from others in sums amounting to $500, $100 and $50.</p>
