   <p>The recent convention of the American Federation of Labor in Cincinnati was, of course, much influenced by the present unemployment situation. The sentiment was "warlike," to say the least, and the conference resolved to speak plainly in order to bring home to the governmental authorities and to industry the realization that something drastic has to be done to provide work for the millions of unemployed. Measures for the prevention of future catastrophes, similar to the one which is now ravaging the country, were also discussed, as well as methods by which workers might be protected against utter destitution during periods of unemployment.</p>
   <p>The convention went on record as favoring the introduction of obligatory unemployment insurance, a five-day work week, and a six-hour day. In regard to shorter hours, William Green, president of the Federation, pointed out <span class="page-break">2</span>that during the last twenty years labor saving inventions and technological improvement have made it possible to produce all the goods that are needed with less man power than was formerly required. In order to bring about the proper balance between production and consumption it is therefore necessary, according to Mr. Green, to shorten the working time. When the number of available workers is known, and also the amount of production which is needed, it is an easy problem to figure out how many working hours must be put in. He concluded his discourse by declaring that present conditions can no longer be tolerated, and that the introduction of a five-day week and a six-hour day is absolutely necessary for the future well-being of the nation. He challenged the opponents of this scheme to submit a better solution of the problem.</p>
   <p>In a recent speech in New York, Thomas W. Lamont, a Morgan partner, advocated a change in the capitalist system to adjust it to modern social needs. He realizes that there is something wrong with an economic system which cannot prevent hunger in the midst of plenty, and his statements, in general, indicate <span class="page-break">3</span>that Green's proposal of reduced working hours may find a willing ear among industrial leaders. Even the most hard-boiled capitalist should realize that it does not pay to employ machinery to produce immense quantities of goods if there is no market for the merchandise. And the best way of creating a market is to pay the workers good wages and to allow them as much leisure as possible, so that they may have time to enjoy their purchases. A man who is being paid one dollar for working fourteen hours is of no use to industry, but one who works six hours for fourteen dollars is a real asset, for he is a buyer and a consumer.</p>
