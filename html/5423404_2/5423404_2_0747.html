   <p>Dr. Josua Lindahl is the man who was elected by the owners of the Rock Island Tropical Plantation Company to undertake the responsible trip each year to Mexico for the inspection of the company's property at Tehuantepec. He leaves Chicago today and expects to return in a month to render his report on the properties, the natural resources, and the work being done. That his report will be of great value there is no question.</p>
   <p>A short biography of Dr. Lindahl may not be out of the way at this time.</p>
   <p>Josua Lindahl, after receiving his degree of doctor of philosophy, was called to teach zoology at Lund's University, and he was appointed professor of natural history at Augustana College in 1878. After serving in this position for ten years he was called in 1888 to act as state geologist and curator at the Illinois Natural Historical Museum in Springfield, Illinois. After more than five years of work there, in 1893 he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was of course relieved because of the political shakeup in the State after the Democratic victory of the fall preceding. He moved to Chicago and in 1895 to Cincinnati, where he was invited to become director of the Natural Historical Museum. For almost twelve years he held that post before he decided to leave it and go into an industrial venture. In the summer of 1904 he received a visit from his old academy comrade and friend, Dr. Hokansson, the celebrated chemist from Eslof, and the meeting between these old friends resulted in Dr. Hokansson's establishing an American branch of his business at Cincinnati. About two months ago the business was moved from Cincinnati to Grand Crossing in Chicago, where a roomy place was bought, and the manufacturing enterprise was carried on. The progress of this enterprise under Dr. Lindahl's leadership proves his ability even in the industrial field. Dr. Lindahl has as nature student and explorer traversed the whole of western Europe, a large part of Africa, and more than half North America, from northern Greenland to southwestern California. His knowledge and practical ability even in his earlier years are attested by his selection as secretary to the Swedish commissary first in Paris at the Geographic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Congress in 1875 and later at Philadelphia in 1876 at the Centennial Exposition. Dr. Lindahl was the first Swedish-American to receive [an honorary degree] of Vassar (1877), and prior to this he had been named by the French government Officier de l'Academie". He has always been recognized and admired for his sincerity and for his loyalty to duty.</p>
