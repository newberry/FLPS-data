   <p>The John Ericsson March, with words by E. W. Olson, and music by Emil Larson, has been published by the Swedish Music Publishing house. The Engberg and Holmberg Publishing Company of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This composition is typically Swedish and very catchy. It will no doubt be heartily received at our Swedish festivals, especially in our greatest gathering, the John Ericsson Annual.</p>
