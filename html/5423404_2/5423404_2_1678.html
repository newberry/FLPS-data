   <p>This celebration will be held Friday evening, February 26, at Orchestra Hall. A splendid program is already arranged and the large choir is holding rehearsals. This large choir of mixed voices, consisting of 300 members from different congregation choirs, is directed by Emil Larson. The large men's choir, of about 50 voices, is directed by Prof. C. J. Carlson. Prof. Alfred Holmes will play the organ. The committee has been fortunate in being able to engage Alfred J. Pearson from the Drake University of Iowa as speaker. Dr. Pearson is well-known, and is a popular and talented speaker. His talk will be of an educational character. His subject will be "Our Contributions to American Ideas and American Institutions." The admission prices will be twenty-five, fifty, and seventy-five cents.</p>
   <p>The net proceeds will be equally divided between the Augustana Hospital and the Chicago Lutheran Home Mission. Tickets are now on sale at the Augustana Book Concern, 79 Dearborn St., R. 301, and at the Augustana Hospital.</p>
