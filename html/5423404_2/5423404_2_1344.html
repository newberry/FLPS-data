   <p>The Swedish-American artist, Leon Lundmark, opened an exhibit of his marine paintings last Saturday in the Midland Club, 172 West Adams Street, where another Swedish painter, Thomas Hall also exhibited his works only a short time ago.</p>
   <p>Lundmark's show consists of twenty-eight numbers and, needless to say, is well worth seeing. It is of special interest to those who knew him in the early days of his artistic career, for it affords an opportunity to study his progress in his chosen field, that of marine painting. The road of an artist is said to be strewn with thorns, and it is well known that Lundmark encountered more obstacles than many of his colleagues. That is probably the reason he seems to prefer motifs which embody courage and stubborn, unrelenting power. He seldom paints the great, open ocean, but chooses coast <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>motifs, where magnificent waves throw themselves against unyielding cliffs.</p>
   <p>Almost all of the paintings in this exhibit are typical of the artist. But in three of them we note a different mood. The three are "On the Beach," "Gull Rock, Lake Superior," and "Beginning of Day". They are done in lighter, more cheerful tones.</p>
   <p>The exhibit will remain open until the end of the month.</p>
