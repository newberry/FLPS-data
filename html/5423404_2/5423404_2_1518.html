   <p>The Swedish Theatre Company presented this Frans Hodell's undying comedy at a matinee performance in the Grand Opera House last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The house was filled almost to capacity, and the enthusiasm of the audience reached the ceiling. The leading roles were played respectively by Chr. Brusell, Carl Liliengren, and Ernest Behmer, who excellently portrayed the three heroes, and the supporting cast did fine work. The costumes were excellent, as was the music, furnished by Meck's orchestra.</p>
