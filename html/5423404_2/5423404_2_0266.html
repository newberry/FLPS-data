   <p>We can readily understand how enlightened and thinking people in Europe are suffering under the iron heel of militarism, and we in this country certainly consider war the worst of all evils. During the current fiscal year, seventy-two per cent of the government's income goes directly or indirectly to payments for wars, either in preparations for future wars or in footing the bills for those already fought. Of this money thirty-one per cent is paid out in pensions to veterans, and the remaining forty-one per cent goes for the maintenance of our army and navy. Last year these expenses amounted to sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the government's revenue, according to figures quoted by Congressman Douglas during a debate in the House. Such a situation would be ridiculous were it not so tragic.</p>
   <p>Every year our scientists and inventors discover new ways of making life easier and happier. Comparatively small amounts of money would enable us to eradicate certain diseases, and minimize the suffering caused by others, and it does not always take so much to create beauty and happiness where squalor and sorrow are holding sway. And at a time when so many worth-while undertakings are waiting for fulfillment, past wars and preparedness for possible future ones are taking two-thirds of the federal income.</p>
   <p>Wars certainly do not increase the sum total of well-being in the world. What one nation may gain by it is lost by another, and the one sure result is suffering and loss.</p>
   <p>Better understanding and co-operation among nations are much to be desired, and all humanity joins in the hope that the time will come when the sums now wasted will be used to the promote the spiritual and material progress of the world.</p>
