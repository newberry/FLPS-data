   <p>The Swedish National Society has undertaken to present a first class theatre program once a month during the season of 1907 and 1908. For these occasions they have engaged the best dramatic stars, such as Miss Ida Ostergren, Mrs. Ida Anderson-Werner, Mrs. Signe Mortenson, Miss Sigrid Lindberg, Ernest Behmer, Carl Liljegren, Ernest Lindblom, Fred Bolling, and others. Friends, who attend, will be rewarded with the best entertainment from Sweden's stars. The first play will be presented at the Garrick Theatre Sunday, September 29. "Old Heidelberg" will be presented. The proceeds from these performances will be used to help the poor during the winter months. Since the public is willing to help a worthy cause, and not only be entertained on these occasions, the society is looking forward to its patronage, and is counting on it.</p>
