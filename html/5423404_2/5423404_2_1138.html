   <p>The directors for the new Swedish Chicago Cemetery Association invited several prominent countrymen from the South Side and representatives for the Swedish newspapers to visit the new Swedish cemetery, Oak Hill, outside the city limits at 119th Street and Kedzie Avenue. Over twenty persons accepted the invitation and took the train last Friday afternoon under the guidance of Mr. N. A. Nelson. The railroads and streetcar pass the place. The new cemetery is beautiful, some parts are grown with trees, and it is well located. Two small lakes will be made from a brook, which is running through the grounds. It embraces 160 acres, and was bought for $97,000. Improvements will be made. The new cemetery will be opened this fall, and it will be dedicated for its purpose.</p>
   <p>When the visitors returned to the city, they were invited by the directors to supper at Kinsley's. Several speeches were made. The Association is selling shares for $10 each, and nearly 5,000 shares are said to have been sold thus far. The directors are well-known persons in Chicago.</p>
