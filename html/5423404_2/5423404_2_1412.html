   <p>Among the Swedish artists who are taking part in the current great exhibit at the Art Institute is Carl E. Wallin, 7439 Rhodes Avenue. He is the only Chicago Swede represented at the exhibit, and has only one canvas there, "Evening Fantasy". Wallin's pictures have been seen every year, for a long time now, at the annual art exhibit in the Swedish Club.</p>
