   <p>p.6...The Swedish pioneering man is often praised and honored through speeches, newspaper articles, festivals and festival poetry. This is right and their due. Our pioneers have been heroes and have earned their names in history.</p>
   <p>But who thinks of the happy queen into whose true blue eyes the pioneer gazed, until he was certain he could not live without her? Who thinks of her, who in stock-house and cave prepared food and made clothing, reared children and kept the family clean and in good health for years with much economy, that in later times people shall say: "It was nothing less than a miracle." Who thinks of her who often remained at home alone, while the man was away at work for months; and neighbors only to be found in the next township or county? Who thinks of mother's furrowed brow, gnarled hands and bent figure? But she - she is the mother of our great West. Without her such a beautiful reality would have been impossible. All hail to her, the Swedish-American pioneer woman!</p>
