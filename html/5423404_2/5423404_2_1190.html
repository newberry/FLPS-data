   <p>G. Herman Nelson, photographer and artist, has moved his studies to the Hagelin Block, Clark Street and Foster Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nelson enjoys a reputation for artistic photography second to none. His eye for beauty in photography was discovered while living in Rochester, N. Y., the "Kodak City".</p>
   <p>He played the photographic trade there from 1904 to 1912, and then went to continental Europe, studying photography and art. For a while he was engaged in business in Stockholm, Sweden, but somehow he could not resist the call of the West. Since coming to Chicago a few years ago, Mr. Nelson has achieved great success. His specialties are interior and panoramic photography, and among his clients he lists such names as Vice-President Charles G. Dawes; the Edgewater Beach Hotel; and Benjamin H. Marshall, architect.</p>
