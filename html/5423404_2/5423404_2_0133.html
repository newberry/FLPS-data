   <p>p.11...Chief of Police O'Neill permitted Ike Rosen's saloon to be closed one day last week. The saloon is an infamous nest in the Levee-district. A person was robbed in the saloon and by order of the chief of police the saloon-keeper was relieved of his license. Rosen turned to "Hinky Dink" Kenna, alderman of the first ward, who at once went to the mayor and without much cermony prevailed on him to return Rosen's license. If this has any meaning at all it is this, of course, that the mayor's words about the chief of police having complete freedom is a deviation from the truth. Much has of late been said and written about the corruptness within the city's police department, and by the above mentioned incident one can draw one's own conclusions as to the cause for the evil complained of. Clearly, the chief of police stands powerless and the responsibility for the laxity in <span class="page-break">2</span>regard to the saloon-element and the reigning lawlessness must be placed on the mayor, and in the case mentioned even on Kenna, who appears to wield the sceptre in the First Ward. This was also the opinion expressed by the daily newspapers, when they took the Rosen case into consideration. This prompted the mayor to give fuller information concerning his action. According to him no misunderstanding prevails between him and the chief of police, that the latter had nothing to do with the saloon-matter, that alderman Kenna did not at all seek to make his influence felt for Rosen's benefit, that no robbery had taken place at the saloon, and for these reasons it would not have been right not to return Kenna's license, etc.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the explanations were lined with many phrases, but it is doubtful whether the mayor has thereby succeeded in fooling thinking people. Actions speak louder than words.</p>
