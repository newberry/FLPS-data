   <p>So far in this series we have been dealing exclusively with singers and choir leaders, and it is therefore high time that we now introduce to our readers an instrumental artist. We do so today and tell you something about the well-known Chicago pianist, orchestra leader, and composer, Johan Sigurd Meck.</p>
   <p>Most of us know of the beautiful city on the shores of Malaren over there in our beloved fatherland. We also know the chief characteristics of the inhabitants of that city, their vitality and love of life, and their keen interest in the fine arts, particularly music. A visit to one of their fine outdoor restaurants on a cool summer evening, or to some place of entertainment on a blustering cold winter night will convince one that they actually worship music.</p>
   <p>In this city, Stockholm, whose goddess is Thalia, a boy was born in the home of H. M. Meck, jeweler, September 6, 1876, who was given the name of Johan Sigurd. When he was four years old the boy with the rest of the family <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>left Sweden to join the father who some time earlier had gone to Chicago and obtained a good position.</p>
   <p>At an early age the boy showed an unusual talent for music and at ten he began to take lessons with a teacher named Grau. Later on he studied the theory of music at the American Conservatory, and then entered the Chicago Musical College, where he is now among the most promising students.</p>
   <p>During the last few years Mr. Meck has been very active in Swedish musical circles. His desire to work among his own nationals here is appreciated by the latter, for it is clear that the wider American field can offer him greater opportunities, and the fact that he passed only the first four years of his life in Sweden, and received all his schooling as well as his musical training here should tend to make him consider himself an American rather than a Swede.</p>
   <p>At the better Swedish concerts lately Sigurd Meck has participated either as a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>soloist or by rendering the accompaniment, and his orchestra has furnished the music at the Swedish National League's theatre performances and festivals. We particularly want to compliment him on his orchestra, which is made up of excellent musicians and has won an enviable reputation since he became its director three years ago.</p>
   <p>For some time now Mr. Meck has been engaged as a composer by three Chicago music firms.</p>
   <p>He is a thirty-second degree Mason, and president and director of the Lincoln Glee Club which he organized and which has its home in the Lincoln Club Hall.</p>
   <p>We take this opportunity to congratulate our young countryman on the progress he has made so far. His talent, technique, and thorough training, combined with energy and good judgment, assure him of a successful future.</p>
