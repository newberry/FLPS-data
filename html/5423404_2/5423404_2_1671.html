   <p>The Swedish Glee Club held its annual general meeting last week, and the report showed that the Club is enjoying a steady growth. Its membership, which now stands at two hundred and fifty, increased by fifty during the past year. The treasurer reported that the income last year amounted to $4,214.92, and the cash balance as of December 31, 1909, was $1,989.02. It was decided to earmark $1,500 as an initial fund for a future club building.</p>
   <p>The Club's name was changed to Svenska Klubben (Swedish Club), which name was considered more appropriate and more indicative of the organization's scope and activities. New officers for the current year were elected.</p>
