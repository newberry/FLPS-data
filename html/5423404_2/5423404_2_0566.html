   <p>In 1919, the American farmer received $35.76 for the products yielded from one acre of his land. Last year, the corresponding sum was $14.48. These figures have been given out by the Department of Agriculture, and are the results of calculations based on ten different kinds of crops, which, taken together, make up nine tenths of the entire farm production of the country. Such a fall in the market value has not taken place since the Department began keeping records of this kind in 1866.</p>
   <p>During the years immediately following the Civil War, prices on farm products fell steadily, so that the yield per acre dropped in value from fourteen and fifteen dollars to eight dollars. The bottom was reached in 1896. From then on, a rise took place, and in 1913 the figure was $16.49. The following year it dropped to $16.44, but in 1916, the year before America's entrance into the World War, it jumped to $22.50, and in 1917 it was $33.25. The peak was reached in 1919 when the yield per acre brought $35.76. From that time on, the fall has been rapid and great. Where will it end?</p>
