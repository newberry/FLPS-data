   <p>The Union Bank of Chicago, "the Scandinavian Bank,"as it is often called, which was established May 1, 1905, has already outgrown its home on the corner of LaSalle and Randolph Streets and has moved into larger, more convenient and modern quarters on Dearborn Street, between Madison and Washington Streets.</p>
   <p>Its new place of business, finished in mahogany and Italian marble and containing the most elegant waiting rooms for patrons, fine furnishings, and facilities for all types of banking transactions, makes this institution one of the most attractive of its kind in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The bank was founded five years ago with a capital of two hundred thousand dollars by a group of representative Scandinavian businessmen, and has from <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the very beginning enjoyed the confidence and patronage of the Swedish-American public. Its deposits have increased steadily.</p>
   <p>The men that founded the bank are still directing its affairs. The president, Charles L. Schlytern, and the treasurer, Gustaf Hallbom, are both Swedes, as are F. A. Lindstrand and John S. Rydell, vice-presidents. Most of the directors are well-known men of Scandinavian nationality.</p>
