The first is not to abuse freedom of speech. Together with this one must consider the welfare of the state, which is far superior to all other things and matters. We must not for a moment forget that we are at war, and that we must bring this war to a victorious close.</p>

   <p>Such is, in short, our political articles of faith, which we find quite proper and which we, like all other foreign newspapers,in the United States, ought to <span class="page-break">2</span>scupulously carry out. We must also to the Post Office Department send translated articles of any matter which touches on the war, and its contingent circumstances.</p>
