   <p>Before a full house and amid enthusiastic applause, Dahlgren's play, "Vermlandingarne," was presented last night. To some critics, the play is considered a classic.</p>
   <p>The basic motive in the play, if one may speak of such in regard to a play, which really is composed of loosely connected scenes, is a struggle between the old and the young, and the whole description is enhanced by a fragrance, as it were, of the mighty mountains with their fresh air and overwhelming nature.</p>
   <p>The intoxication of glittering May sunshine hovers over the play, the birds are singing, a joyous healthful life spreading freshness over the day; the <span class="page-break">2</span>dreaming, indescribable beauty of the Swedish lakes at once appear serious and appealing, the silent, secret forests; all of these make their appeal to us as we witness the ribaldous peasant wedding, with dancing around the flower bedecked pole.</p>
   <p>The play is a product of art of lasting value. Especially are the ditties, interwoven into the play now and again, masterpieces of its kind.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the greatest interest in witnessing the play centered about the celebrated guest of the evening, the opera soprano, Mrs. Hellstrom, who represented "Anna." The excellent artiste portrayed the role with brilliant <span class="page-break">3</span>effect which is invariably resulting from her firm, well tempered voice, her lovely appearance, her nicely measured play, her pleasant pliability. She filled her part so magnificently, both as to vocal and dramatic that one feels like congratulating the foremost scene in Sweden on its good fortune in retaining an artist so highly endowed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brusell who, at the last moment, was forced to take the chief male role, succeeded quite well, on the whole, and especially in his resisting the many temptations to pose and to bluster, which a less intelligent actor would not have done.</p>
   <p>Miss Sara Nordstrom was pleasing as "Stina," Mr. Schucker played well, in <span class="page-break">4</span>the role of "Jan Hanson," and Hulda Faltskogh seconded him quite well. But Mr. S-- was terrible as the Lopare-Nisse (Santa Claus)</p>
   <p>Mr. Lindblom won a real triumph in his realistic reproduction of the pompous sheriff. His presentation was true to type from start to finish.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosengren was given the role of "Anders." His play was rather hit or miss; the character did not quite coincide with his temperament. Mrs. Anderson-Werner presented "Lisa" in her ever splendid manner.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mossberg cut a poor figure, Mr. Liljegren a poorer figure, and Mr. <span class="page-break">5</span>Hulthen, a still poorer one. We refrain from speaking of the rest of the cast.</p>
   <p>The folk dances occurring in the third and the sixth scenes came off with life and vigor.</p>
   <p>Immediately following the play, Mrs. Myhrman appeared on the stage and presented Mrs. Hellstrom with a beautiful silver coffee urn, and Mr. Brusell presented her with a laurel wreath.</p>
