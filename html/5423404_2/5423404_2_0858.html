   <p>The Builders and Merchants State Bank, the new Swedish-owned bank in the Edgewater district, opened for business last Saturday, and if one may judge by the crowds which visited the institution on the opening day, its future is assured. The bank is housed in its own building, which was built for this particular purpose, and is located on the southeast corner of Clark Street and Foster Avenue. The impressive, three-story structure is a credit to the district. The main banking floor and the offices in the upper stories are, of course, thoroughly modern, and are attractively furnished and decorated. Some twelve thousand people passed through the bank last Saturday, and they did not all come purely out of curiosity. Fifteen hundred accounts were opened, of which eleven hundred were savings accounts. Fifteen receiving tellers were kept busy for twelve hours, and the day's business amounted to $225,000.</p>
   <p>The officers of the bank are: G. Hallbom, president; John P. Friedlund and Carl J. Johnson, vice-presidents; Edward M. Olson, cashier. All the members of the Board of Directors are Swedish-Americans.</p>
