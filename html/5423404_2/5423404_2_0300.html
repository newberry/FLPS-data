   <p>The legislative proposals regarding registration of aliens, which have been submitted to the Congress have encountered such strong opposition that their sponsors have given up all hope of bringing about a final vote during the current session. Even Senator Blease's bill, which provides for voluntary registration, has been received with coolness and characterized as an unwise and unfair measure by many of his colleagues. When this bill was being considered a few days ago in the Senate immigration committee, Joseph Schlossberg, who is secretary and treasurer of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, declared that registration would seriously hamper the organization work among aliens, and the representatives of several other organizations expressed the opinion that such legislation would tend to retard the Americanization process among foreigners, and also encourage <span class="page-break">2</span>blackmail and corruption.</p>
   <p>There seems to be general agreement that these bills, dealing with registration of aliens in one form or another should either be put aside and forgotten or voted down decisively in the Congress.</p>
