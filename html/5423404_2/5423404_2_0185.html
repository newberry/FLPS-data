   <p>Times change and we change with them as we all have heard many times. It is completely true, we may add piteously. For times change, and we with them, all too often.</p>
   <p>During the War, only six months ago, when the fighting was at its height, almost everyone who made public utterances spoke idealistically. There could be no talk about any conquests, about the demand for reparation in monies as punishment for the vanquished, or other measures of vengence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>No, it was only a question of justice, of the brotherhood of peoples, and the right of self-determination, of universal peace and expatiation.</p>
   <p>When one thought of ending the war, and of a permanent settlement, it was always held forth that any Vienna Congress or "Holy Alliance," could never enter it; no, nothing at all of secret transactions at the peace conference. Everything was to take place openly and honestly, and the people were to know at every moment how the leaders sought to shape their future.</p>
   <p>There was no reason to make any objections against this. One could, of course wait and see, if the frightful punishment which was felt by the entire <span class="page-break">\3</span>World, would not give the peoples as well as the statesmen a thorough knowledge of how old mistakes could be avoided, old sufferings wiped out and suppressed, and a new, improved World rise from the ruins. Those who knew human nature shook their heads, but said nothing. Even they waited and hoped.</p>
   <p>They have not yet given up all hope though their fears have been confirmed. For the War was hardly over before the suppressed sufferings began to take free scope. There was no longer any preaching of peace and expatiation. There was a loud clamor for hearings and trials, judgment and punishment. Each and everyone wanted compensation for his <span class="page-break">\4</span>losses, and the justice which was to have been exercised at the peace conference assumed about the same representations as the Congress at Vienna, or the conference in Berlin of a former date. The old statesmanship raised its head at once - the statesmanship whose chief belief is that the acquisition of new possessions, and new subjects, is the aim of war, and the victor's right. Utterances in the European press, and even by the outstanding European statesmen indicated that they were preparing to continue the old game of crowns and sceptres, but for the sake of appearances, these were wrapped in beautiful Democratic parlance.</p>

   <p>One heard that England and France had conflicting interests in Syria; that the occupation of the Rhine provinces, with their purely German population, was indispensable to the security of France in the future. Italy and the Jugo-Slav state made claims on the same parts of the Adriatic coast. The restored Poland wanted to round out its borders, and the precious question of nationality was not so important.</p>
   <p>This was at the beginning of the peace conference. The end we have not yet seen. But it is, in the meantime, a cheering sign that the <span class="page-break">\6</span>American influence still makes itself felt.</p>
   <p>Sometime ago, we called President Wilson the World's arbiter. He was truly this when this utterance was made, and we hope for the sake of humanity, and for the stability of World peace, that he does not grow weary in the role he has taken upon himself, and that he will receive from his own people all the support which this difficult, responsible and exalted position over various egoistic interests demands.</p>
