   <p>He organized the Southern Sugar Company in order to extract the sugar from the cornstalks. The Company now owns large areas of land in Florida, and sugar manufacturing plants which already are the largest of their kind in the country, and which will be further expanded. Dahlberg has just announced that during the next few years his company's sugar production will amount to 450,000 tons annually.</p>
