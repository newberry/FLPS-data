   <p>Is it not strange that as long as Mr. Peterson keeps quiet at home, selling coffee, or Mr. Johnson goes about selling sewing machines, or Mr. Anderson collects bills for some creditor, none of them gets a free pass on the railroad, not even to the nearest town.

Will some of our wise readers tell us why this is so?</p>
