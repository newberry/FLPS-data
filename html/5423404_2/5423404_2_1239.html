   <p>The well-known tenor, John Chellman, will give a concert Sunday, November 29 at Belmont Hall, assisted by Miss Minnie Cedargreen, violinist; Frank Earnest, pianist; Joel Mossberg, baritone; and the Swedish Glee Club. We earnestly hope that the house will be sold out, because Mr. Chellman is very popular, and the program is very good, both deserving the patronage of Chicago music lovers.</p>
