   <p>What is to prevent the American government from warning,publicly ,all American citizens from using ships belonging to any of the powers at war as means of transportation? At least,it cannot be insisted that such action would be contrary to common sense.</p>
   <p>We must confess, in addition, our inability to understand that such announcement would, by inference, contain a recognition of the method adopted by the German submarines in connection with commercial vessels.</p>
   <p>Our government appeared to find no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that it was under no obligation to protect the life and property of American citizens in Mexico, and in consequence, the warning or exhortation long since, was given to American citizens visiting in Mexico, to give up their property there and leave the country. Even that latest act of violence when sixteen Americans were pulled off a train bound for the United States, and murdered in cold blood, did not appear to have much altered the attitude of our government toward the Mexican government. Where, then is the logic in a foreign policy which calmly tolerates open and cruel acts of violence against American citizens in Mexico,while,at the same time claiming it to be equivalent to an open declaration of war if American citizens be killed through a submarine attack, even though these Americans, at the time of the attack were traveling, together with people from other nations, on a ship belonging to one of the belligerent powers. The fact remains that the overwhelming majority of the population in America want war, neither with Germany,nor with any other country.</p>
