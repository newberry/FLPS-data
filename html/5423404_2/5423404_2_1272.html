   <p>Another Swedish Chicago song bird, who has been studying under Europe's most famous teachers, made her American debut on Monday, June 5, 1906. Her appearance was sponsored by the Men's Club of the First Congregational Church of Oak Park. At Minnie Bergman's initial appearance she won her audience, holding them spellbound from beginning to end with her beautiful voice, perfect rendition, and pleasing personality. Minnie does not intend leaving Chicago to roam all over the country nor does she intend to return to Europe; a decision with which our Swedish Chicagoans are wholeheartedly pleased.</p>
   <p>We congratulate her for her talent and the friends she has won, and wish her a thoroughly happy future.</p>
