   <p>Mendelssohn Concert Company gave a concert last Tuesday evening in the Methodist Church, at the corner of Clark and Washington Streets.</p>
   <p>Three of our Swedish people were among the assisting artists, one of them, Mr. John Ortengren, being the main attraction of the evening. His solos were "Still Is The Night" and "Per Svinaherde". The other two were Mr. and Miss Shogren, who were liberally applauded.</p>
