   <p>"The Creation," a series of paintings depicting the six days of creation which belongs to the St. Stephan's Episcopal congregation, will be on exhibit in the Albany Avenue church as part of the art department of the Chicago World's Fair, according to Dr. Tucker, pastor of the church.</p>
   <p>The temple, which is now under construction, is almost completed, but work on the interior is still going on. The paintings, which express Zoir's conception of the creation, will be placed permanently in the church and will serve as a monument to Swedish art in America. As our readers know, the Swedish Lutheran Church of Albany Park, Chicago, also owns three other paintings by Zoir, "The Crucifixion of Christ," "Jesus in Gethsemane," and "The Burial." They are a gift from the artist to the congregation.</p>
