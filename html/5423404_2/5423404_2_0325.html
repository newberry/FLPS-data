   <p>A newspaper recently compared the practice of working twelve hours a day, which is still current in many American industries, with conditions which existed under the Persian shahs. Even those who have the power to abolish this out-moded evil admit that it is a blight on our twentieth-century civilization, but they stubbornly refuse to introduce a shorter working day.</p>
   <p>Three hundred thousand industrial workers in this country, in some forty different industries, are still working twelve hours a day. A committee appointed by the Federated American Engineering Societies has spent two years investigating this practice, and has come to the conclusion that it is highly undesirable, even from the point of view of the employer. The committee's report <span class="page-break">2</span>points out that the employers of labor would gain by a shorter working day because it would make for more efficiency, greater uniformity in production, and better morale and increased satisfaction among the workers. These are only a few of the advantages which were pointed out by the committee. And it should be remembered that the committee was looking at the situation as it affects the employers, without considering the advantages of shorter hours to the workers themselves.</p>
