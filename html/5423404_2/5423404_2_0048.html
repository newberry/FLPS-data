"They have ignored us and laughed at us," says the Alderman. "Only 15 of the 100 large coal dealers in the city have responded to the invitation of the Investigating Committee.</p>
   <p>"We are not here in behalf of the very rich, who can afford to buy coal at any price, but we are here in behalf of the poor unfortunates, who must search for coal on the railroad tracks in order to keep warm and keep body and soul together."</p>
