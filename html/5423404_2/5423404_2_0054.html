   <p>The democratic candidate for Congress, Mr. Ole Johnson Ryan, gave the following excellent address at Des Moines, Iowa last May. We wonder where this gentleman picked up the name "Ryan".</p>
   <p>"Master Charman, Yentelmans and Lady: Ay never med spetz en republic convenston before, men ay tank ay haw got so gut rit to mak spetz for sweed mans some live on Manasota, as gankee fellow had to mak spetz for gankee mans doren est en.</p>

   <p>That was the Democrats' way of knocking Knud Nelson. We all know he is a staunch Republican, but the Democrats want it to appear that he is a dumb and ignorant farmer.</p>
