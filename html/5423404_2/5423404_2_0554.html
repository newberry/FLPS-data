   <p>It is highly interesting to observe the results of the scattered intelligent efforts to encourage farm lads to go in for really rational and efficient farming. Most of the attempts of this kind which we have previously reported have been made in the Northwest. But today we will tell about an agricultural college in the state of Mississippi. This school was attended by thirty-two boys, who last year made a net profit of $4,381, or $137 each, as the result of facilities of the farm which belongs to the college. Some of them even earned additional money from other activities.</p>
   <p>This work was done on part time, while the boys were attending school. Imagine what they could have done on full time, and what they may do later on, when <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>they begin to utilize fully on their own farms the knowledge gained in school. Intelligent farming always pays well, both in cash and in a rich, worth-while life.</p>
   <p>Automobiles and good highways have reduced the obstacle of distance to almost nothing. A farmer who lives miles from the nearest town can get there as quickly as the city worker, living in a residential section or a suburb, can get to the business center of his city. Almost all occupations in the cities are overcrowded, while the world is clamoring for producers. Draw your own conclusions.</p>
