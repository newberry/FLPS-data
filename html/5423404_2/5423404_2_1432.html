   <p>To the casual visitor Chicago may seem a gray and rather dreary place. If he does not take time to see the newer residential districts and the extensive park and boulevard system which has been developed during the last few years, he is likely to get the impression that the metropolis on Lake Michigan consists only of a mass of gigantic office buildings, business establishments, factories, and in addition, block upon block of dingy, rather dilapidated workers' homes. But the people who actually live here and who explore our parks and boulevards at various times in the year, especially in the summer--these people know better. There is much truth in the claim of local boosters that Chicago is not only one of the largest cities in the world, but also one of the most beautiful.</p>

   <p>The city's surroundings are in a class by themselves. Most Chicagoans have heard about the great wooded areas just outside the city, which have been purchased and are maintained for the benefit of the public for purposes of outdoor recreation. But many do not know that certain sections of these forest preserves are real beauty spots.</p>
   <p>A Swedish-American artist has made it his business to impress upon Chicagoans the treasure they possess in the forest preserves. He is Hugo Von Hofsten, the landscape painter, whose career we shall outline briefly.</p>
   <p>Hofsten was born in beautiful Varmland in 1865. After having completed his formal schooling, he studied at the Art Academy in Stockholm. Later, he came to America, finally reaching Chicago, where he found employment as a newspaper illustrator. He was very successful in this work, but it did not give him the inner satisfaction he desired. It was not to become his lifework.</p>
   <p>He was a born nature lover, and it may be assumed that an inner urge drove <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>him to study art in Stockholm. This urge finally became so strong that he gave up his newspaper work and took up painting. Within a short time, his canvases began to attract attention at exhibits, and his water-color drawings still adorn the walls of many Chicago homes. When the annual art exhibit at the Swedish club was initiated more than ten years ago, Hofsten immediately became one of the most noted exhibitors. He has also been represented in numerous other exhibits, and has won many prizes. His special mission has been to call to the attention of the people of Chicago the wealth of beautiful scenery they have right outside their doors, so to speak. He stands alone in this regard, and that fact makes his work all the more worthy of recognition. This he has won, and leading citizens--art lovers as well as others--are greatly interested in this phase of his work. The County Commission has from time to time arranged special exhibits of his paintings.</p>
   <p>Last year, he visited Sweden, and the trip resulted in a series of landscape paintings with motifs from that country; all of them were well selected, and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>they have won much praise. Of the murals in the Swedish Club, Hofsten has done two: "The Swedish Villa at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1895," and "Stockholm, seen from Skansen".</p>
   <p>His wife is the former Marie Louise Case. They live in Winnetka, but Chicago is really his town.</p>
   <p>Hofsten is somewhat quiet and reserved, and does not say much. But he preaches, through his art, the gospel of nature's beauty--a gospel which modern man, in his hurry, is apt to overlook and forget. </p>
