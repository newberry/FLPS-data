   <p>A. H. Wimermark, a well known and skilled druggist in Chicago, now a resident of Cambridge, Ill., has during the last two weeks, undergone and completed a most brilliant examination as medical doctor at Rush Medical College, where he was made "Primus" in his class of 175.</p>
   <p>This is very encouraging for us Swedes, so much the more as the demands are more strict at this medical college than in any other. Students are coming in a steady stream to this college from all parts of the country.</p>
