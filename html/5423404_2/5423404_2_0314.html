   <p>There is a considerable shortage of adequate housing in our large cities. Rent in the highest brackets has come down somewhat of late, but apartments for ordinary working people are as high-priced as over, and law-enforcing authorities are inclined to overlook infractions of renting regulations, for, after all, people must have a roof over their heads.</p>
   <p>Every time this distressing condition is brought to our attention, we are reminded of the sinple and sound solution of the housing problem which was presented in a series of articles in this newspaper a few weeks ago by Carl E. Swenson. As our readers will remember, he explained in detail a plan which he has worked out for apartment houses built and owned by the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Federal Government. In brief, he recommended that the Government build and maintain a housing project where families that qualify for such assistance would be permitted to live for, say, a period of five years at a relatively low rental. At the expiration of that period, the total amount paid for rent would be refunded to the family. The money thus "saved up" would enable the family to purchase a home of its own, or at least to make a substantial payment on one.</p>
   <p>While prices on apartments in most American cities are much higher than the average person can really afford to pay, the pitifully poor German Government has built thousands of apartment houses in order to provide adequate housing for people of small means. It may seem somewhat humiliating, but it appears that in this respect, our rich and secure nation can learn something from the shaky and practically bankrupt German republic.</p>
