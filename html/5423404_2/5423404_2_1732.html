   <p>The concert given by the Harmony Singing Club last Saturday evening was well attended. The audience, consisting of several hundred persons, gave proof of their satisfaction with the program by their vigorous applause. The Club itself presented six numbers and was rewarded with thunderous applause. Messrs. Joel Mossberg and Frank Winters rendered solo numbers which were received enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>Iduno's orchestra furnished the music both for the concert and for the dancing later in the evening.</p>
