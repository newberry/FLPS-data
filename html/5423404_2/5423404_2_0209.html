   <p>That our countrymen and countrywomen are all eagerly supporting the Third Liberty Loan drive is being confirmed everyday. Many individuals, business houses, clubs, societies, churches, and newspapers are in feverish activity for this cause. Since no account of Swedish subscriptions, has been kept, it is impossible to even estimate the total, but it can be truly said that the Swedes have done their share and with honors. The main thing is that "Uncle Sam" should get the money as soon as possible, and with this aim in mind, the Swedes are now working.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Order of Svithiod, which bought $5,000 worth of bonds of the Second Liberty Loan, will take a like amount of the new issue as well as $1,000 in War Saving Stamps. Svithiod's Veterans' club used one-third of its total reserves for Liberty bonds. Alpha Lodge, No. 50, I. O. S., at its last meeting, subscribed for $100.</p>
