   <p>The United States government prints and furnishes the banks with $500,000,000 in bank notes, and then borrows it and is paying interest on this money. The banks know that the citizens in general know so little about this kind of transaction that they will never be able to get at the root of the matter, and Congress is the agent of the bankers. Would not a person feel just a trifle foolish if he were to lend one of his neighbors one thousand dollars, then afterwards borrow back the money he had lent, paying interest on the amount he borrowed back? But that is precisely what we, as a nation, are doing. For forty years, the Congress has voted for such a system, and the people do not know it.</p>
