   <p>One of the greatest dangers to American agriculture is the tendency among farmers to be more concerned about the sale of land than with actual farm production. There are in this country great areas of farm land which do not yield profitable crops, but the farmers hold on to them because of their increasing sales value. This situation is partly responsible for the increase in tenant farming.</p>
   <p>The area farmed by tenants was eleven per cent greater during the years 1910-1920 than during the preceding decade, even though the number of tenants was smaller. According to the 1920 census, thirty-three per cent of the country's farms were rented out for a fixed sum during that year. The mean value per acre was $153.67, and the rent per acre $5.45, or 3.54 per cent of the value. It should be remembered that between 1850 and 1920 land values increased at <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>an average rate of two per cent each year.</p>
   <p>Evidently, a person who wants to make a living from the land can do better by renting it for 3.54 per cent of its value than by buying it with money borrowed at an interest rate twice that high. It has been pointed out time and again that agriculture in this country cannot experience a sound development until the excessive speculation in land ceases. The most effective measure to bring this speculation to an end would be to tax the land, not according to the improvements which have been made on it, but on the basis of its yield value.</p>
