   <p>For one who so to speak has made it his lifework to write about prominent Swedish Americans, it is particularly pleasant to meet a Swede, who is outstanding, not only because of his fine, magnetic personality, but also because of his typically Swedish capacity for hard work, coupled with the American knack for speed and accomplishment, which qualities have placed him among the leading Chicago manufacturers in his line.</p>
   <p>When, in addition, such a man has absorbed the best of what we will call the American spirit, and at the same time preserved the typically Swedish within himself, our pleasure is that much greater. Today we will introduce such a man.</p>
   <p>If one visits the big cabinet-making shop of Jessen &amp; Rosberg and asks one of the men in overalls where Mr. John Rosberg may be found, he is likely to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>answer: "I am Mr. Roseberg. What can I do for you?"</p>
   <p>When the first surprise is over, one soon understands that this is the key to Mr. Rosberg's success. He personally supervises his plant from the engine room, construction and sandblasting departments to the finishing rooms, stock rooms and office. It is entirely unnecessary to call up in advance and ask for an appointment; he is somewhere in the plant, and wherever you find him, he is ready to talk to you.</p>
   <p>The firm manufactures a great variety of products, but, according to its comprehensive and elegantly finished catalogue, it specializes in watchmakers' work benches and dentists' laboratory benches and cabinets. Mr. Rosberg is now taking out a patent on his latest design for a dentist's cabinet, which is considered the finest on the market, and appears to be the answer to a dentist's prayer. This product has found a ready market not only in the United States, but also in South American and European countries; orders have even come in from Australia. To all appearances Mr. Rosberg stands to make a fortune on this <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>design alone. The wholesale price is $125, which is considered reasonable, and orders are coming in faster than the firm can fill them.</p>
   <p>This particular instance shows up clearly the difference between America and Sweden in regard to business opportunities. Back home one might spend one's entire life making such a cabinet, and one will earn a bare living, while here the whole world is one's market, and one is assured of a reasonable profit.</p>
   <p>According to the catalogue, this firm has produced almost every watchmaker's bench now in use west of New York. This product, together with the dentist's bench is also of the firm's own design and patent protected. The superior qualities of the dentist's bench have been attested to by some of the most prominent dentists in the country.</p>
   <p>John Henrik Rosberg was born in Malmohus, Sweden, November 23, 1856. His father was a farmer, but the boy early showed a liking for working with tools and decided to become a cabinet-maker. He finished his apprenticeship in 1877, and since Copenhagen was known as a place where they made fine furniture <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>he went to that city, where he worked for one year, and then left for Stockholm. He worked there until 1882, when he set out for America and came to Bridgeport, Connecticut where he obtained employment at Patterson's, a pipe organ manufacturing company. However, he did not stay there for long, but left for Chicago in July 1882. Here he worked for several firms until he and Mr. Jessen opened their own establishment on Jefferson Street. After some time they moved to 82 Fulton Street, and then moved again to Union Street. When that plant was destroyed by fire, they moved to their present location, 405 West Kinzie Street.</p>
   <p>In 1882 Mr. Rosberg married Miss Kerstin Holmgren a native of Arof, near Malmo, Sweden, and the marriage has been blessed with six strapping sons.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosberg is a good mixer and a member of several lodges: King Oscar Lodge, Oriental Consistory and Mystic Shrine; in addition to these he also belongs to the Odd Fellow lodge, Atlas, and the Independent Order of Svithiod, No. 1.</p>
   <p>His partner, Mr. Jessen, died two years ago and Mr. Rosberg is now the sole owner of the concern, employing about sixty workers.</p>
