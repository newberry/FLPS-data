   <p>p.6. There is nothing creditable enough in the present mayor's career to recommend him for re-election. During the four years of his office life he has used the city of Chicago chiefly to further his personal interests as well as those of his friends.</p>
   <p>The police department is now nearly a subordinate political organization which protects law breakers and even omits collecting fines from this; the Democratic campaign fund usually gets its share from this "crime-preventive source" - such as it is. The city schools have never before been used for such evident political purposes and motives! In fact incompetency within various departments is so apparent that it openly shrieks with injustice. Innocent people have been made to suffer while rather doubtful characters have been left at large.</p>
   <p>In the public works only the loosest possible control has been practiced. The <span class="page-break">2</span>financial management has, in fact, made the city insolvent and now the administration agitates for more excessive debt placements through loans of obligation to refill the plundered treasuries.</p>
   <p>The inspection of coal deliveries to the city's buildings and institutions has been a scandalous affair. We could present column after column of intolerable corruption for which the present administration is responsible.</p>
   <p>The Democrats always reply with the charter question. It must cover a large portion of wrongs. Harrison's viewpoint on the charter, which was adopted because the public was so favorable to it, is considered his lone accomplishment. Hence when both parties are practically of the same opinion about the question; and the Republican program speaks out just as plainly as the Democratic, for short terms and just compensation for the city as conditions for the renewal of traction charters - then in the name of reason - there must be some regard for other public matters of <span class="page-break">3</span>of importance in the coming election.</p>
   <p>And if, as we hope, this should come about, the electorate should take into consideration the following election program which the Republican mayoralty candidate Judge Elbridge Hanecy speaks for and promises for the party: -</p>
   <p>(1) An honest, economical business-like administration.</p>
   <p>(2) The complete separation of the school system from any relation with party politics.</p>
   <p>(3) The management of towns and all taxing bodies should be consolidated into one central city administration.</p>
   <p>(4) The civil service system should be upheld and kept clean of favoritism and partiality.</p>
   <p>(5) Politics must not enter into the police department whose discipline must be sharpened above all.</p>
   <p>(6) Just and reasonable compensation shall be charged for all local concessions and privileges.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>(7) The special assessment department means should be used only for known ends and overcharges punctually repaid to the taxpayer. No treaties with crime and vice.</p>
   <p>(8) The streets should be cleaned both materially and spiritually and kept safe all hours of the day.</p>
   <p>We put before the police these and other questions which the spring election will decide.</p>
