   <p>As reported in the news columns of this issue, City Engineer [John] Ericson has been acquitted in the so-called "shale-rock" scandal which was aired in the court of Judge Barnes. The judge found that the testimony given in the case produced no evidence involving Mr. Ericson and instructed the jury to acquit him.</p>
   <p>We do not have to repeat here that during the entire trial the City Engineer enjoyed the unreserved confidence not only of his countrymen but of the general public as well. As an example of the general attitude, we quote from an editorial in the Chicago Journal:</p>
   <p>"We are not surprised that Judge Barnes, considering the lack of evidence against Mr. Ericson, instructed the jury to acquit him. For many years the City Engineer has been known to the people of Chicago as an able man in his <span class="page-break">\2</span>profession and as an honest public official, and neither his skill as an engineer nor his personal integrity has ever been questioned until recently, when these entirely unfounded accusations were brought against him, and so promptly disposed of by Judge Barnes.</p>
   <p>"Ericson's acquittal came as a matter of course, but dishonest city officials were openly and shamelessly prostituting their public trust in accusing him. State's Attorney Wyman should let men like Ericson alone, and devote all his energies to the prosecution of public servants whose flagrant dishonesty is well known."</p>
