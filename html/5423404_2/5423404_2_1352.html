   <p>Mary C. Peterson's separate exhibit in the Illinois Women's Athletic Club is very interesting. Unfortunately, time did not permit us to review it in last week's issue, and it closes today.</p>
   <p>Miss Peterson is well known to Chicago's Swedes as a singer, and member of the popular Northland Trio, but many do not know that she also is becoming a painter of note. She is one of the few Swedes whose work has been accepted for the great art exhibit which is now being held at the Chicago Art Institute.</p>
   <p>Her present exhibit at the Illinois Women's Athletic Club is comprised of forty-three numbers in all, among which are eleven portraits and ten still life paintings. Her landscapes are all summer and fall scenes, and there is over all of them an atmosphere of fragrance and sunshine. Her technique has that finished touch which is so often lacking in young artists. Her colors are warm and rich without being boisterous.</p>
   <p>Among the portraits is one of a young girl which we especially liked. Miss Peterson has even mastered the art of painting hands which is considered very difficult. Among the landscapes we noted particularly "Autumn Day," "Yellow Leaves," and "The Brook". Her flower paintings are also very well done.</p>
   <p>Judging by this exhibit we should not be surprised if Miss Peterson, in the not too distant future, becomes even better known as a painter than she is known as a singer.</p>
