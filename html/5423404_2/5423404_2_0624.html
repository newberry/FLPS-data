   <p>A series of lectures by Dr. John W. Johnson and sponsored by the Order of the Good Templar has just begun in the Order's building, 647 East 61st Street. The lectures deal with certain common bodily disorders and their prevention and cure. The topics are: "Constipation,Its Causes and Cure," "Rheumatism, What is It?" "Foot Disorders and Correction," "Catarrhal Infection, How Relieved," "Occupational Diseases," "Kidney Disorders and their Effect on Body Health," "Children's Health," "How to Ward off Old Age," "Blood Vessel Diseases," "Indigestion, Causes and Cure".</p>
   <p>The lectures will all be given in English, but that should not keep anyone from attending them. They are to be as non-technical as possible and anyone with a fair knowledge of the language can benefit from them. Dr. Johnson has generously donated his time and knowledge, and there is, therefore, no admission charge.</p>

   <p>The lectures are given every second and fourth Wednesday of the month. The next one takes place Wednesday, February 10, when the doctor speaks on "Rheumatism, What is It?"</p>
