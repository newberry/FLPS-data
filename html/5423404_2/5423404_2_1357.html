   <p>Two of Chicago's younger Swedish-American artists, the sculptor Carl Hallsthammar, and the landscape painter Frederick Remahl, are now exhibiting their work in the Midland Club, 172 West Adams Street. The exhibit will remain open until the end of the month. It comprises thirty-three numbers, twenty-one sculptures and twelve paintings. Some of the latter have been framed by the Swedish-American "Artsmith," Rudy Renzius, who is beginning to make a name for himself here.</p>
   <p>A few of the sculptures have been exhibited before, but there are also a number of new ones; all of them, with the possible exception of "The Spirit of the West," are typical of Hallsthammar's work. They are characterized by strength coupled with good-natured humor. Under his artistic hands his material, which is wood, takes on the qualities of life, power, and feeling. Few Swedish-American artists, be they sculptures or painters, have Hallsthammar's ability to make their material look alive. The most notable among the pieces which he is exhibiting this time are, we think, "The Pauper's Funeral," "The Escape of the Fox," "The Struggle to Fame," and "Fresh Air Taxi". The first one really tells a long story; and one is bound to smile at the long face of the hunter being outsmarted by the fox. "Fresh Air Taxi" pictures a group of young people on an excursion. It is a charming piece of work that explains why Hallsthammar has become one of Chicago's most popular artists.</p>
   <p>Remahl's paintings are also typical of their creator, characterized by stunning color combinations. He shows great originality in his choice of motifs as well as in his treatment of them, and when looking at his canvases, one cannot escape the feeling that one is confronted with something unnatural. But that is Remahl's way! He is a modern artist, too modern, perhaps, for ordinary folks, but that does not mean that he doesn't have the "spark". Besides his paintings, he also exhibits a number of charcoal drawings, some of which are attracting much interest.</p>
   
   <p>The exhibit will close October 31.</p>
