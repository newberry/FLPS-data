   <p>F. F. Backstrom &amp; Son, Manufacturers of Specialty Machinery, have now moved into their new factory building at the corner of 12th Place and 47th Avenue. Their old quarters at 825 S. Kilpatrick Avenue have long been too small for this rapidly growing concern.</p>
   <p>Mr. Backstrom, Sr., is the inventor of several labor-saving specialty machines upon which he has taken out patents.</p>
   <p>Among his many steady customers for machinery of different types and for different purposes are listed the Wm. Wrigley Company of chewing-gum fame, The United States Tobacco Company, The Acme Felt Works, and several others.</p>
