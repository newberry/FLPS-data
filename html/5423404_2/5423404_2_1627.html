   <p>On account of the War, the male voices within our singing societies, and church choirs, have diminished considerably in number. The Swedish Choral Club, which practises every Tuesday evening in preparation for the grand Christmas Concert, is hereby urging all male singers to join in the Club's auditions for later participation in the honors.</p>
   <p>Applications are received every Tuesday evening at 8 P.M. in the Atheneum by Edgar Nelson, who is the director for the Club. His address is Bush Temple.</p>
   <p>Applications will also be received by the secretary of the Club, Jennie Eckblom-Peterson 6031 Eberhart Avenue, Telephone: Hyde Park 9188.</p>
