   <p>A concert for the Swedish Old People's Home in Evanston was held last Sunday by the Harmony Singing Club.</p>
   <p>About twenty numbers were rendered to the delight of the old folks. They appeared to grow about ten years younger as they listened to the singing and music. Other Swedish singing societies and clubs should follow Harmony's example, and give a concert for these folks so as to shed some gladness and cheer into their lives.</p>
