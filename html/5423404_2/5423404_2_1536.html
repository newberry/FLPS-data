   <p>A brand-new Swedish melodrama will be presented on the fourth of October at North Side Turner Hall. The play is written by the well-known actor Leopold Kjellman; it is in four acts, and the title is "Pelle Jonsson's Afventyr" (The Story of Pelle Jonsson). The work is written in American style, and the famous Negro comedians, Messrs. Smith and Avery, are to assist. Our best Swedish actors in Chicago have been engaged for the occasion, and it may be safely said that the stage settings will be excellent.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Kjellman is as capable a writer as he is an actor, the theatre-loving public will have a thoroughly enjoyable time on the fourth of October. We have been told that the play is being translated into English and is later to be presented to the American public.</p>
   <p>The Wellington Male Quartet will assist at the performance on the fourth of October.</p>
