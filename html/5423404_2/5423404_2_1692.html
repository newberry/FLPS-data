   <p>The concert given by the Svithiod Sangarforbund (Svithiod Singing Society [a Swedish Male Chorus]) on Sunday, April 22, proved to be a success in every way as was predicted. There was a capacity audience, which enthusiastically applauded each number.</p>
   <p>The program consisted of the opening song by the chorus, Ljungt Hvilar Sjon (Peacefully Rests the Sea), followed by violin solos:--Miss Elsie Oberg; soprano solos:--Miss Clara Englehorn; tenor solos:--Frank Steen; Duets (including "The Fisherman"):--Steen and Mr. Anthony; and solos and duet, respectively:--Mr. Dahlen and Mr. Anthony, with chorus accompaniment.</p>
   <p>In our estimation, a failure, or even a disappointment by the Svithiod Singing Society would be absolutely an impossibility.</p>
