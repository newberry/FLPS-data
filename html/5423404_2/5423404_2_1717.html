   <p>Among the great composers, the name of Wennerberg looms with a clearer lustre than most; and among the compositions of this great composer, we find a collection of duets which have special appeal to young students. The duets are rich in music technique, and portray great humor in the sketches of student life in a large university city. His works have won their way into broad circles, and today one may find an interested, intelligent, and appreciative public applauding the presentation of Wennerberg's "Gluntar". Also among the Swedish-Americans, the "Gluntar" has won popularity....For this, thanks are due principally to Christoffer <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Brusell, our popular theatrical director, and a great businessman. He introduced the "Gluntar" to Chicago, and, together with the late Editor Otto Pallin, has on numerous occasions rendered the piece in such masterly manner as to enthuse the public. Mr. Brusell is not merely an outstanding singer of the "Gluntar". Because of his splendid voice resources, his unusual capacity for understanding, his studies in music, and above all, his musical talent, he has become a valued soloist also in other circles.</p>
   <p>The readers of the Svenska Nyheter, read in the issue for November 3, 1903, a biography of Mr. Brusell in conjunction with a picture gallery of prominent Swedish-American businessmen; for this reason, we do not believe it necessary to repeat the biography. But we wish to extend our thanks to this outstanding singer, and, in Chicago, unsurpassed actor; thanks for what he has accomplished in the field of singing; thanks again for his energetic work to bring Swedish dramatic art in Chicago to a level with <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that in Sweden. In Sweden the dramatic arts are subsidized by the government, work which has of late been crowned with success.</p>

   <p>"A chip off the old block."...In Miss Hedvig Brusell, daughter of Christoffer Brusell, singer and theatrical director, we observe a young lady of decided dramatic and musical talent.</p>
   <p>Miss Hedvig Brusell was born in Chicago, November 14, 1884, and...is well versed in the language of her father. In 1901 she finished her high school course, and later she became a stenographist with the firm of Stromberg and Carlson.</p>
   <p>Miss Brusell's desire is, however, not for the world of business. As <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>mentioned, she is gifted both as a musician and as a dramatist. Is it not to be wondered at, then, that she wishes to follow her calling and develop her talents? Her voice is the very liquid type of mezzo soprano, and she understands how to utilize her voice although she has studied singing only a very brief time. When last we heard her, she sang Gounod's "Margareta." Her singing teacher, Professor Ortengren, praises her highly. Surely, with a voice like hers, trained by a teacher such as Professor Ortengren, one may expect the very greatest things from her.</p>
   <p>Miss Brusell appeared in the role of "Lotta" in "Valborgsmessoafton," in Chicago in 1903; she was cast as "Lovis Haverman" in "Country Life"; "Anna" in "Vermlandingarne," "Margareta" (excellently) in "Around the World in Eighty Days," and "Susanna" in "Oregrund-Osthammer." It is the firm intention of Miss Brusell to study for the opera, and we venture to predict that she will be a success. She is attractive, of joyous <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>personality, keen and quick of thought, which ought to enhance her chances for success both as a singer and as an actress.</p>
