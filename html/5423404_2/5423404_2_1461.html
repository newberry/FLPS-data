   <p>Our Swedish-American artists have always had good reasons for complaining about lack of encouragement on the part of their countrymen, and it must be admitted that those of them who have finally "arrived" have done so without the aid of their compatriots. On the other hand, the latter have been quite willing to share in the honor when a Swedish artist has succeeded in making a name for himself in the world of art. In fact they have often demanded a slice of it.</p>
   <p>However, a marked change in this attitude has come about lately. Swedish-American artists as a group are now given opportunities to exhibit their works: for instance, the art exhibit which recently was held in the Swedish Club here in Chicago. During this event sales of paintings and sculptures totaled $2,500, and several cash prizes were awarded.</p>

   <p>Such a sum is not in itself impressive, but it indicates that the Swedish-American artists' position as a cultural factor has become established, and it certainly is a heartening sign. If the trend continues, the time may not be far off when our artists will no longer have reason to complain about lack of encouragement.</p>
