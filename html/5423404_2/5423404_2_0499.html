   <p>The Swedish-American Women's Association held a meeting last Wednesday night at the Swedish Club, 1258 North La Salle Street. The meeting was well attended, in spite of the fact that several other important gatherings took place in other parts of the city.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, president of the Association, presided, and opened the meeting with a brief speech in which she touched upon the purposes and working methods of the organization. She introduced the violinist, Mrs. Ebba Hjerstedt-Anderson, who entertained the audience with two beautiful compositions. The soprano, Mrs. Jennie Peterson, who is also the secretary of the Swedish Choral Club, gave generously of her artistic talent, singing several numbers. Both ladies were rewarded with hearty applause.</p>
   <p>The speakers were Mrs. William Hefferan, who represented the National League of Women Voters, and Harry B. Miller, judge of circuit court. Mrs. Hefferan emphasized the importance of women's active participation in the solution of the many vital problems which are now confronting society, citing statistics to prove her points. She dwelt at length on the necessity of promoting popular education. As an example of the existing ignorance, she told of a Kentucky regiment in which her husband served as an officer during the World War. Three-fourths of the men in that regiment could neither read nor write, and yet they were Americans. She urged the building of more and better schools, and higher appropriations for educational purposes, and finally the creation of a Department of Education within the Federal Government, in order to place the children of America on at least an equal footing with the pigs and cattle of the American farmer.</p>
   <p>Judge Miller's speech also dealt chiefly with the question of a higher standard of popular education, and he stressed the duties of the press in this respect, duties which are not always fulfilled.</p>
   <p>Following the two main speakers, Attorney Alfred O. Erickson and Chicago's building commissioner, Charles Bostrom, also addressed the meeting.</p>
   <p>At the end of the meeting, Commissioner Bostrom invited everybody into the dining room for refreshments.</p>
