   <p>A lyric tenor will sing in the final selection of participants for the charity concert to be held for the benefit of Swedish Old People's Home in Orchestra Hall, Sunday October 6 at 3 P.M. His name is Tor von Pyk, and he has never before appeared in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Von Pyk was born in Gothenburg, and studied first under the opera singer, Fritz Arlberg. He has since trained his lovely voice under the instruction of famous masters in Vienna, Dresden, and Berlin, and he also became a teacher of great reputation.</p>
   <p>Among his students, we find such eminent singers as William Weeden, the tenor, Fanny Ferguson von Turner, the soprano, and the tenors, Clarence Cannon, and Arthur Middle, and others. The widely read Musical Courier has the following to say regarding Mr. Von Pyk as a singer:</p>
   <p>"Tor von Pyk, the Scandinavian tenor, gave a recital at the Waldorf-Astoria, composed of an unusually attractive list of songs. Mr. Von Pyk has one of the rarest of all voices, a true, pure tenor, and his singing is free from the defects that often mar a voice of these qualities. In songs of romantic sentiment, and in the characteristic songs by Scandinavian composers, Mr. Von Pyk afforded his hearers an hour of real delight."</p>
   <p>Thus, it shall be interesting to make the acquaintance of this singer, even at a distance.</p>
   <p>We can say that the concert on October 6 will be four concerts combined into one. First, we have Alice Sjoselius' debut, the main event of the evening. Next, on the program will be Mr. Von Pyk's songs. The songs from the great Swedish Veterans' Choir will surely prove a great attraction. The Choir has postponed its own annual concert in order to assist on this occasion. It will perhaps be the only chance the public will have to hear these veterans, who are still young in soul and voice.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the Swedish-American violinist, Ebba Hjertstedt, will be on hand to defend her position as the ranking concert player.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edgar Nelson, the director, will open the concert with an organ prelude, and will also accompany the various soloists at the piano.</p>
   
   <p>The arrangements committee is negotiating with several persons of high rank in this country regarding a very pleasant surprise for the Swedes in Chicago, which will be revealed during the concert.</p>
   <p>Tickets should be secured early, and can be had after September 24 at Orchestra Hall Ticket Office. The ministers in the city who receive complimentary tickets may have these exchanged for valid tickets at the ticket office also.</p>
