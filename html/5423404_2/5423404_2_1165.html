   <p>"The Double Acting Filter" is the name given an invention by our countryman J. W. Malberg. It is a small device to be attached or screwed onto a water faucet; its construction is very simple, yet it is a surprisingly effective apparatus. The filter is made in such a way that either end may be attached to the faucet and the cleansing is done by merely reversing the end to be used. The water is forced through an egg-shaped strainer, which is filled with crushed quartz. This filter so simple and yet the most effective on the market today, is already widely in use and the demand for it is increasing day by day. In addition to this small filter for home use, Malmberg has also invented a large filtering apparatus for industrial purposes. In the large apparatus the water filtering is done by a chemical process.</p>
