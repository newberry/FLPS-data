   <p>In certain quarters entirely wrong ideas are being entertained in regard to the Progressive party. Republican "standpatters" are living and acting under the illusion that the progressive movement is disintegrating, if not liquidated. They are deceiving themselves. The progressive movement in American politics does not depend upon the success of Roosevelt and the Bull Moose party. It has deeper roots than that, having as its basis the steadily growing phalaux of independently thinking and voting citizens, which can no longer be subdued. Everybody who is at all familiar with political developments knows that a new spirit, a new attitude, was making itself felt in the country long before the Chicago convention. The "Old Guard" had been filled with misgivings, and put its biggest and loudest guns into position in order to keep the advancing reformists at bay.</p>
   <p>Scandals, revealing dishonorable conniving among political bosses and crooked business interests, kept popping up, and writers and speakers who had the courage to expose such conditions were called names such as "muckrakers" and "demagogues," <span class="page-break">2</span>but they could not be downed.</p>
   <p>No matter what happens to the parties there will, from now on, always be independent voters without rings in their noses, and even if the Progressive party should cease to exist as a unit, the real progressives will not be silenced. So far, the love feasts which have been arranged between "standpatters" and progressives have not borne any fruit.</p>
   <p>If it should come to pass that the Progressive party organization is dissolved, some of its members will probably support Wilson in 1916. Others will go along with a progressive Republican. But one thing is certain: Whether or not a Progressive party remains as an active, independent unit the independent voters know from their experiences in 1912 that they can control the presidential election. And they are not likely to forget it.</p>
