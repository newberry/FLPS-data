   <p>Chief Justice Harry Olson of the Municipal Court did not mince words last Wednesday when he announced that the graft system which has been so much in evidence among the personnel of the Police and Peace courts has now come to an end, once and for all.</p>
   <p>If hereafter a bailiff, clerk or any other officer of the court is found guilty of accepting extra remuneration for his services, he will be immediately dismissed and punished according to law.</p>
