   <p>The Art Institute's annual exhibit, comprising the works of artists living in or near Chicago, opened January 26, and will close March 5.</p>
   <p>Swedish-American artists are very well represented this time, and this should be an added incentive for Swedes to visit the exhibit. There is a miniature portrait of the late Tom Randolph by Edward W. Carlson, and another portrait by Gustaf Dalstrom. The marine painter Charles E. Hallberg exhibits a canvas called "Sea Song," and J. W. Hallquist another marine painting called "Moonlight off Cape Cod". Other Swedish-American painters and the names of their works follow:</p>
   <p>Thomas Hall: "The Old Homestead"; Fred T. Larson: "Reflections" and "Summer <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Smiles"; Axel Linus: "Afternoon, Merida Mountains"; Leon Lundmark: "The Song of the Sea"; Arvid Nyholm: "Still Life" and a portrait of Dr. George T. Jordan; Torey Ross: "Gypsy Lore"; Fridolf Spolander: "Sky and Water"; Emil O. Thulin: "Sumacs"; and Arild Weborg: "The Teatable".</p>
   <p>The exhibit contains an unusually large number of sculptures and the Swedish-Americans exhibiting in this group are Frank Gustafson, with a fine bust of Jenny Lind, and Agnes Fromen, with "The Arrow's Flight" and "Bambino-Ellis Island". "The Arrow's Flight" has been awarded a prize, and has attracted much attention.</p>
   <p>The Swedish painter, Arvid Nyholm, is on the committee which was appointed to select the pieces of art that were deemed worthy of being exhibited. Our countryman, Charles S. Peterson, has donated five hundred dollars to the Art Institute, with the stipulation that the money be used for the purchase of two paintings, which are to be placed on exhibit in Chicago's public schools. The Institute's selection committee will choose the paintings which are to be bought for this purpose.</p>
