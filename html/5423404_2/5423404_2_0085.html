   <p>The Merriam Commission appointed to investigate and straighten out the charges and counter charges of graft against City officials in their dealings with M. H. McGovern, who was paid $45,982 for extra work on the Lawrence Avenue Tunnel, is now hard at work. John Hanberg, chief of Public Works, and his right-hand man, Paul Redieske, want to hold City Engineer John Eriscon responsible for what has happened. When Ericson learned of this maneuver, the otherwise calm City Engineer explained the situation to the commission, saying that all the facts had not been reported. When these facts become known, the Commission broadened its investigation and discovered serious conditions for which Hanberg is now held responsible.</p>
   <p>The commission proved that the T. H. Cummings Foundry Company was favored with all orders on material used by the Water Department. How much graft <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>there is in these transactions remains to be seen.</p>
   <p>The City Engineer has promised to make it hot for the City officials who tried to put the blame on his shoulders for the $45,000 paid-out. Very clearly and positively, he has shown that he could not do anything without orders from Hanberg. He had responsibilities aplenty, but no authority. He also told the commission that certain persons would like to see him replaced, because he would not run their errands, or lend his good name to dishonest transactions. On several occasions he has saved the City hundreds of thousands of dollars by shrewdly preventing purchases from the privileged corporations. Hence, the opposition.</p>
   <p>"I have been persecuted by contractors whom I have prevented from cheating the City," he stated. "They would like to drive out this Swede because he was too honest. I shall not shield anyone in my <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>testimony; the guilt shall fall on those who are responsible."</p>
   <p>On Thursday, the books and papers that might have revealed the McGovern transactions, were stolen from assisstant City Engineer R. A. Bonnell's home. Who stole them is the question. Bonnell had been given permission to have the papers photographed by the department bureau, but had no permission to take them to his home. Bonnell confessed that he had done this without Ericson knowing it. Ha had taken the books and papers to McGovern's lawyers. Only Bonnell, the attorneys, and McGovern know if he left them there or took them home.</p>
