   <p>The Department of Agriculture announces that no less than 136,441 young boys and girls registered in so-called agricultural extension schools last year and devoted themselves to some special kind of farm activity, such as the raising of cattle or poultry. These young farmers, as they may well be called, owned 76,148 head of cattle and 554,286 domestic fowl, the total value of which amounted to $3,605,176. The net profit realized on these activities is not given, but it may be assumed that it was considerable. However, the most important consideration is the practical training and experience which these youngsters obtained.</p>
   <p>What kind of men and women they will be, say fifteen or twenty years hence, is to a great extent dependent on what they are doing now, what they are interested in, and what they are thinking about. Unnecessary worries and <span class="page-break">2</span>hardwork should not be placed on the shoulders of young people, but their education is neglected if their sense of responsibility and duty is not encouraged, and if they are not required to do some light but useful work around the home.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the boys and girls covered by the report of the Department of Agriculture are very fortunate. They are getting splendid training, and are becoming accustomed to doing useful work and to reaping the fruits of honest effort.</p>
   <p>Parents who implant in their children a love for work and the habit of being usefully occupied are doing them a great service. They are laying the foundation for the future happiness of their children.</p>
