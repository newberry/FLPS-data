   <p>At long last the Government seems to realize that the farmers, especially the wheat farmers, are in dire need of aid, and measures are being taken which will afford some relief. But much remains to be done, if the farmers are ever to get on their feet again. The help is coming in the nick of time, for the agricultural crisis has wrought havoc among them, especially in the wheat belt.</p>
   <p>What is needed is nothing less than economic equality between agriculture and other industries, and in order to attain and maintain this condition, and to secure the proper development of our agricultural resources, a sufficient supply of labor must be provided.</p>
   <p>It is also of great importance that co-operation among farmers should be <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>encouraged, and this includes both sales and purchases. The success of such co-operation depends, of course, upon the farmers themselves, but the task can be made easier by proper legislation, designed to encourage the co-operative movement.</p>
   <p>Of equal importance is Government aid in curbing the activities of speculators and profiteers, who profit by low prices on farm products and high prices on those commodities which farmers must buy.</p>
