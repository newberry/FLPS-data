   <p>The Record Herald, in a late issue spoke most complimentary about the Swedish-American Men's Business Club, which was recently formed in Chicago by representative businessmen of Swedish birth or extraction. In the Club's Restaurant, 126 Washington Street, Swedish dinners are being served, and the patrons attempt to break themselves of the habit of swallowing their food in the shortest possible time. At midnight, a grand supe (dinner) is served, at which time one can enjoy the good foods, and be entertained by one's friends. </p>
