   <p>The annual art exhibit in the Swedish Club opened last Saturday with a reception which was well attended in spite of the cold weather. One does not have to be much of a prophet to predict that the current exhibit will attract a large attendance, since from among the paintings and sculptures shown a selection will be made for the exposition to be held in Gothenburg next summer. Few Chicago Swedes will want to miss seeing the pieces selected.</p>
   <p>In size, this exhibit does not differ much from those of previous years. There are about one hundred paintings of various types, and thirteen sculptures, large and small. But there is a decided improvement in quality and a greater variety in styles and motifs. It is also gratifying to note that the number of participants is greater this year than ever before.</p>
   <p>The portrait painters are represented by Arvid Nyholm and Christian Schneidau.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The former's self-portrait is excellent, as is the latter's "Lapland Woman," a title which has not been happily chosen. Nyholm also exhibits three landscapes with motifs from California.</p>
   <p>Two marine painters are represented: the veteran Charles Hallberg and Leon Lundmark. The former exhibits five beautiful canvases, of which two--"The Atlantic," and "Sunset in Gothenburg Harbour"--are especially remarkable. Since Hallberg's return from his trip to Sweden last year, we have been waiting to see some of his motifs from the Swedish coast--and here they are. We think most critics will agree that his latest paintings are the best he has ever done. Lundmark, who up to now has been almost unknown among his countrymen, is represented by three canvases with motifs from the northern share of Lake Superior. Like so many other Swedish artists, he has been fighting hard for recognition; but the worst should now be over. His work has attracted the interest of the well-known art dealer Young, who paid Lundmark's expenses while the latter painted on the shores of Lake Superior. Lundmark's work is very promising.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Needless to say, the landscape painters are well represented, We especially noted John F. Carlson, whose "Blowing Snow" is one of the gems of the exhibit. It has been borrowed from a private collection.</p>
   <p>Birger Sandzen, who, better than anybody else, can depict the beauty and mysticism of the great West, has eight paintings at the exhibit, all of which are notable for their distinct technique and artistic finesse.</p>
   <p>It is quite a distance from Sandzen's vital colors to Hoffsten's delicate aquarelles, with their fine details, but we will make it in one jump. Hoffsten exhibits eight paintings: four with motifs from Sweden, and the rest from the forest preserves around Chicago. They have all the characteristics of previous fine works which have come from the hand of this master.</p>
   <p>In this brief survey, we cannot do justice to all the exhibitors. Instead, we recommend that our readers visit the Swedish Club and see for themselves.</p>

   <p>The sculpture group comprises thirteen pieces. In addition to such well-known names as Agnes Fromen, Carl M. Linner, and Carl F. Skoog, we noted some new artists: Andrew Bjurman, C. M. Hedman, and Peter Johnson. Miss Fromen's bust of Mrs. C. S. Peterson, and an Indian figure by the same hand, are both very well done. Skoogs, "The Heart of a Woman" and "The Binding Link," are very interesting, but we have seen better work of his.</p>
   <p>We repeat that, in quality, this exhibit is ahead of those of previous years. Three prizes will be awarded: a one-hundred-dollar prize, offered by the State Bank of Chicago, for the best oil painting; a fifty-dollar prize, offered by the Union Bank of Chicago, for the next best oil painting; and a prize of twenty-five dollars, offered by C. M. Hedman, for the best aquarelle.</p>
   <p>At the reception which was held on the opening day, John E. Ericsson, president of the Swedish Club, C. S. Peterson, and Robert Harshe, director of the Chicago Art Institute, addressed the guests. Mr. Ericsson introduced Mr. Peterson as <span class="page-break">5</span>the man who has made these annual exhibits of Swedish-American Art possible. The chief speaker was really Mr. Harshe who discussed Swedish art in general and Swedish-American art in particular. He also touched upon the plan for a Swedish room in the Art Institute. In this matter, also, Mr. Peterson has taken the initiative.</p>
   <p>The exhibit closes next Sunday.</p>
