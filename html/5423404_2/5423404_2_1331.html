   <p>The painter, Emile Zoir, has now returned to Chicago. Our readers will remember that he went back to Sweden. On the urgent request of leading Chicago artists and other prominent individuals and groups he has consented to resume his activities here as a lecturer at Wilmette School of Modern Art. One department of this school is now located here in Chicago, in the Fine Arts Building on Michigan Avenue.</p>
   <p>Professor Zoir will lecture there on anatomy and psychology, and he will also make demonstrations. He will remain here for at least one year, and during that time he will probably arrange an exhibit of his own works.</p>
