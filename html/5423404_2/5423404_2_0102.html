   <p>Maybe during the campaign there has been more unkind words and false accusations made by both candidates for mayor than in any campaign before. That they should scold one another is only natural, but when the newspapers take it up it becomes worse; at least one of the candidates is seeking legal help to stop the accusations of one of them; we had hardly expected this. Fred Busse last Friday sued W. R. Hearst, owner of Chicago American and Chicago Examiner for false statements and is asking $150,000 damages. Hearst has sued the Chicago Tribune for a like amount; Walsh, who owns the Chronicle, has complained against the Daily News; it is rumored that the Chicago Tribune will start suit against the Chicago American.</p>
