   <p>Two changes affecting our fellow-countrymen on the police force have just taken place. One affects Victor Johnson, formerly a Sergeant on the staff of Chief of Police Major McClaughry. Mr. Johnson is now an ordinary patrol officer and has been transferred from the lake View District to the 22nd St. Station. Patrol officer John P. Nelson has been appointed Sergeant, to take the place of Mr. Johnson.</p>
   <p>In this connection we may mention that Sergeant Nelson, some time ago, held the rank of Police Lieutenant at the East Chicago Avenue Station, but was insidiously demoted during Mayor Cregier's regime.</p>
