   <p>"The best that the Swedish-Americans have in them was expressed during this concert." We feel sure that thoughts to this effect occupied the minds of the majority of those who attended the concert in Orchestra Hall, last Sunday afternoon, which was given on the occasion of the Countess Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's visit here. The program was harmonious and at the same time offered a pleasing variety. The lively applause with which the performing artists were rewarded after each number showed clearly that our people really appreciate fine music. However, this love for the finer things in life was not the only quality that characterized the audience, which filled the concert hall. Even more apparent and, one might say, more important, was the will to give generously to a good cause, namely the relief of European children who are in distress. The guest of honor, the Countess Wilamowitz, struck the keynote of the event.</p>
   <p>But first something about the concert itself. It opened with the singing of "America" in unison, and with a brief prayer by Dr. C. G. Wallenius, pastor of the Bethania Methodist Church. Under the baton of Musical Director Edgar A. Nelson, the Swedish Choral Club then rendered three of the finest numbers in its repertoire, namely: "Deep River", "Listen to the Lambs" and the Norwegian composition "Landkjending" (Sighting Land). If we should make so bold as to offer any critical comment, it would be that the last-named selection lost some of its beauty and power by not being sung in the original language. Otherwise the execution of these three numbers was excellent; the voices were well schooled and placed, and every nuance reached its highest possible effect. H. William Nordin, the baritone, sang the solo parts of "Landkjending," and we are sure he won many new admirers. In "Listen to the Lambs" Mrs. Jennie Peterson was the soloist. Then followed the Northland Trio, which, accompanied by Edgar A. Nelson at the organ, rendered with force and artistic feeling, three Swedish songs, "The Musician's Medley," "Summer Joy," and "A Summer Song". The audience demanded an encore, and got "Tula Vall," which was not on the program.</p>
   
   <p>Next on the list of performers was the violinist, Mrs. Ebba Hjertstedt-Anderson, an artist who a few years ago had European music lovers at her feet. She was supposed to play only one number, Saint-Saens' beautiful but technically difficult composition "Rondo Capriccioso," but she yielded to the persistent applause and gave Wieniawki's "Romance" as an encore. She was accompanied on the piano by Edgar A. Nelson, who a short time ago was called "one of the country's foremost accompanists" by a Chicago metropolitan daily.</p>
   <p>When the program was concluded, the chairman of the concert committee, C. S. Peterson, made a brief speech in which he called attention to the real purpose of this event, namely, that of obtaining funds with which to aid the starving and sick children of those European countries which were ravaged by the World War. Introducing the Countess Wilamowitz, he declared that few people in the world are better qualified than she to describe the misery under which these poor children live, for she has lived and worked among them for a long time, and has observed conditions with her own eyes. She has come to this country to ask all Swedish-Americans to help her carry on her work of mercy.</p>
   <p>The Countess then spoke simply, but with words that went straight to the heart, about the critical situation in the war-torn countries of Europe. She also reviewed the magnificent contribution which the Swedish nation has made towards the alleviation of suffering among these unfortunate peoples. During a period of ten months, seven million kronor (approximately $1,800,000) and miscellaneous merchandise, valued at a like amount, were donated by the Swedish people and distributed where most needed. The Countess went on to tell of the Swedish families who opened their homes to hundreds of the "war children".</p>
   <p>Pastor C. E. Hoffsten followed the Countess on the rostrum, and urged the audience to give generously to this humanitarian cause. The collection which was taken brought in about $900. The net proceeds of the concert, the amount of which has not yet been published, will be added to this sum. It is expected that thus the total will be increased by several hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>The festive event ended with the appearance of the Swedish Glee Club, which, under the direction of H. William Nordin, sang "June Night," "Would that Life were Endless Sailing," and "Sandman".</p>
   <p>Orchestra Hall was filled almost to capacity.</p>
