   <p>Four women were elected to the legislature in the state of Colorado at the last election, and the fact is being commented on in various ways by the American press. And rightly so. It is really an important event, for even though women of that state have voted for some time, and have been eligible for all public offices, they have up to now held rather unimportant positions. It has been customary in Colorado, Idaho, and Wyoming, all three of which have granted suffrage to women, to elect them to minor offices, even appoint them superintendents of schools, but really important political influence has been denied them. The general effect of woman suffrage is not put to a decisive test by thus limiting the scope of their activities to jobs which can be equally well handled by both sexes. The legislature is the real testing ground.</p>
   <p>It has often been said that the women's franchise in Colorado has not produced <span class="page-break">2</span>any remarkable legislative results, and the reason may well be that so far the women have failed to use their political privileges effectively.</p>
   <p>But now the ice has been broken. Four lone women are not likely to revolutionize a state legislature, but their presence there should throw some light on the value of women as constructive lawmakers.</p>
