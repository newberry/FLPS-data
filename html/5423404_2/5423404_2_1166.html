   <p>Our countryman A.G. Anderson, who is an instrument maker in the employ of Lyon &amp; Healy, has made an invention that has attracted well-merited attention. The invention consists of automatic, self-operating booms or gates to be used in connection with turn-bridges, such as are in use in great numbers in Chicago. When the bridge turns, the gates close, and vice versa. The working model has been demonstrated by Anderson before authorities and traffic experts, who have expressed their approval of the great practicability of the invention as a guard against such accidents as are prevalent. The drawings of the invention have been sent by Anderson to the U.S. Bureau of Patents at Washington, D.C.</p>
