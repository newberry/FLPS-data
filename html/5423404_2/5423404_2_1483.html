   <p>Our well-known seascape artist, Charles Hallberg of Chicago, has recently completed a work of art that is the most impressive modern painting we have seen exhibited. In painting pictures like the traditional "Flying Dutchman" Mr. Hallberg has attained the most natural effect by the high running foam-tipped billows. One can almost see and hear the great waves as they strike the two boats.</p>
   <p>Of the two boats, which are similar in type, the ghost effect of the "Flying Dutchman" in this picture makes one think that the traditional boat still plows the seas and can, under certain conditions, be seen today.</p>
   <p>Few modern paintings picture the spirit of the subject painted so truly that it almost speaks to those whose privilege it is to view such work. We predict a great future for one whose technique is outstanding as that of Hallberg.</p>
