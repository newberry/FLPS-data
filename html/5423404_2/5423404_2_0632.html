   <p>Millions of workers in this country enjoy the benefits of sick insurance, chiefly through societies of which they are members. But those that do have such insurance are usually the better paid workers, while the wage earners in the lower brackets seldom belong to organizations of that kind, even though they are the ones that need such assistance most when sickness suddenly cuts off their earning power.</p>
   <p>These facts were revealed in a report recently submitted to the Federal Industrial Commission by Dr. B. S. Warren of the United States Public Health Service, and for the purpose of correcting this situation the report recommended the establishment of a sick insurance fund to which the government as well as employers would be required to contribute a certain percentage.</p>
   <p>Such a fund certainly would do much good, bringing help to those that need <span class="page-break">2</span>it most. At the same time it would bring home to the public the desirability of improved sanitary conditions in the community, since individual contributions to the fund would be reduced as the general health improved.</p>
