   <p>Swedish-Americans are successfully participating in many branches of American business and industry, and a great many are engaged in the building industry as architects and contractors. In this issue we present four men who are leaders in their field, and it should be evident to all Chicago Swedes that it is entirely unnecessary to turn to other nationalities when they need anything done in the building line. No matter what kind of structure is to be erected, Swedish-American architects and contractors can handle it.</p>
   <p>Charles T. Green, partner in the firm of Green and Carlson, with offices in the Chicago Opera House Block, has been in business in Chicago for thirteen years, and during that time built a large number of first-class apartment buildings which are the firm's specialty. Among them are the Chateau Apartments on Evanston Avenue, and the Netheland and Elfra Comb Apartments. There are no finer apartment buildings on the North Side. We may further mention the Winona and Fritz Schoultz Apartments, the Lehle Apartments on Sheridan Road, and the Drexel at 43rd Street and Prairie Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Green was born in Vireda parish in Smaland, Sweden, August 21, 1860, and came to Chicago in 1881. In 1901 he married Signe Carlson, and they have a fine home at 744 Lewis Avenue, Austin.</p>
   <p>For many years he was a director of the Carpenters and Builders Association of Chicago, and is now its treasurer.</p>
   <p>Mr. Green is a member of the First Swedish Odd Fellows and King Oscar Lodges, and also of the Oriental Consistory and Medinah Temple.</p>
   <p>Our countryman, Andrew Sandegren, ranks among Chicago's ablest architects, and in architectural periodicals of Chicago as well as of New York, his name and work are often mentioned in very complimentary terms.</p>
   
   <p>He was born in the beautiful city of Halmstad, June 25, 1867, and went to school there. Later he graduated from the Carolinian Cathedral School of Lund, and then went in for technological studies for which he demonstrated unusual aptitude. The railroad engineer, A. Soneson, became interested in the promising young student, and gave him an opportunity to gain practical experience in the shops of the Halmstad-Nassjo Railroad, and Soneson's successor, Carl Stendahl, finally made the boy his assistant in the engineering department of the road. During all this time he also occasionally worked in the office of the city architect, Knut Beckeman, and finally devoted all his time to architecture as the latter's assistant.</p>
   <p>He came to America at the age of twenty-one, and after having worked for several architectural firms in Chicago, Boston, and New York, he opened his own office in this city in 1892. He now has his roomy and up-to-date offices in Suite 1731, First National Bank Building.</p>
   <p>During the sixteen years Mr. Sandegren has been in business here he has prepared the plans for more than 450 buildings of various types, including private residences, apartment buildings, hospitals, churches, hotels, and other commercial structures.</p>
   <p>He is president of the Scandinavian Engineers' Club, and a member of the following clubs, societies and lodges: The Swedish Glee Club, Svithiod Singing Club, Chicago Architectural Club, Chicago Architectural Business Association, Illinois Athletic Club, Chicago Art Institute, Swedish-American Historical Society, John Ericsson Lodge, I. O. O. F, Masonic Covenant Lodge, St. Bernhard Commandery, and Medinah Temple, A. A. O. N. M. S.</p>
   <p>Andreas Edward Norman was born in Holbacken, Vermland, March 13, 1860. He learned the cabinetmaking and patternmaking trades at the Finshyttan shops, the owners of which considered him so promising that they urged him to make a study trip to America, and then return to take over an important position with them.</p>
   <p>He came to America in 1880, and worked for some time in Brooklyn, New York, and Ishpeming, Michigan. He discovered that he liked it here, and decided to remain in America. During the following years his work won prizes and diplomas in competition with the finest artisans in his line in the country.</p>
   <p>In 1887 he started in as an architect and contractor here in Chicago, and now has offices in his own building on the corner of Clark Street and Devon Avenue.</p>
   <p>He has prepared the plans for and built a number of fine churches in Chicago, and a great many fine residences and apartment buildings, particularly in the Sheridan Road and Logan Square districts.</p>
   <p>Alfed Nelson, of 254 Bradley Place, has been a building contractor in Chicago for twelve years, and erected a large number of apartment buildings in Lake View, Ravenswood, and Sheridan Park; he owns and operates some of them himself.</p>
   <p>Nelson was born in Linkoping in 1871 and came to Chicago in 1887, where he started in as a building carpenter. He gradually became interested in the real-estate and contracting business and has expanded right along. Last summer he built three large apartment buildings in Sheridan Park which are considered among the finest in that part of the city.</p>
   <p>In addition to the contracting business he has been an active real-estate operator, particulary in the North Shore district.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nelson is a member of Verdandi Lodge No. 3, I. O. O. S. ,Frithiof Lodge, I. O. O. V, King Oscar, Oriental Consistory and Medinah Temple.</p>
