   <p>Miss Ellyn Marie Swanson, contralto, was born in Chicago, Jan. 1, 1884, and started on her musical career early. At the age of 17 she received a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, where she studied for three consecutive years under the famous baritone Herman De Vries.</p>
   <p>She won great acclaim for various concert performances, and no less than three diamond medals in intra-school competitions. On several occasions she has performed on the Auditorium stage in such operas as "Samson and Delilah," "Faust," and others. At present she is engaged as a soloist at the Oak Park Congregational Church and also as a singing instructor at Balatka Musical College of Chicago, and at Central College of Music of Austin, Illinois.</p>

   <p>Miss Swanson's voice is a well-schooled, full-toned, and clear contralto, and her diction is superb. These qualities, together with her natural loveliness and youthful appearance, have made her one of the most popular concert singers in Chicago.</p>
