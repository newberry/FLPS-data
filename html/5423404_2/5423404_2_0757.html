   <p>There is one, and only one, patent attorney in the Chicago Swedish colony, Mr. J. Warner Beckstrom, with offices in the Monadnock Building, 270 Dearborn St.</p>
   <p>Mr. Beckstrom is well-versed in mechanical lines and is well-read in the law. His father was a successful inventor and his brother an outstanding student of law, being the only Swedish attorney in Kansas, who is privileged to practice law before the United States Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>Mr. Beckstrom was unknown to us, until a few days ago, when a prominent Swedish-American inventor, located him and immediately hired him as attorney for his patent.</p>
