   <p>Roadside markets are springing up all over the country, and are becoming more and more numerous. For the benefit of those that do not know what they are, let us hasten to explain that they are small stands, or wagons, from which farmers offer their products, such as fruits, vegetables, eggs, etc., to passing motorists. Most of them are found along the busiest highways.</p>
   <p>Such markets offer many advantages. In the first place, the farmers obtain good prices for their products without having to ship them to the city, and at the same time the city dweller pays less than he would have to pay in the city. These are among the immediate advantages. There are others which are bound to make themselves felt in the long run. This method of doing business will cause a demand for more and better roads, since those farmers who live far from the highways do not have the opportunity to get a share of this trade.</p>

   <p>The practice also serves to bring the farmer and the city dweller closer together. From these transactions at the roadside, permanent acquaintances and friendships often develop, which result in an exchange of visits between the city and the country. Thus, the chasm which has always existed between the city and the country becomes narrowed, and may finally disappear, to the advantage of all concerned.</p>
