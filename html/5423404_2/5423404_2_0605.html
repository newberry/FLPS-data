   <p>Sixty thousand acres of irrigated government land in the rich North Platte River Valley of Wyoming will be opened to settlers in the latter part of this month. This is fine land, conveniently located, and we shall be glad to give our Swedish-American customers all information they may want about this unusual opportunity to obtain fertile and well-irrigated farms.</p>
   <p>Act today. If you hesitate it may become too late, and this is an opportunity the like of which may never again be offered to you.</p>
   <p>A Swedish colony has already been established, and many Swedes from Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, and Illinois have settled in the valley. The new land which is now being opened is in the same locality.</p>
   <p>Excursions leave Chicago every Monday, and Omaha, Nebraska, every Tuesday.</p>
