   <p>One hundred thousand human lives are saved each year through the activities of the National Tuberculosis Association. In the year 1904, when this organization was founded, two hundred out of every one hundred thousand of our population died of tuberculosis. According to the Statistics for 1921, this death rate has now been cut in half.</p>
   <p>When the Association was formed, there were ten thousand beds available in hospitals and sanitariums for tubercular patients, and about half a dozen clinics and research institutions in the entire country. Today there are sixty thousand beds, close to six hundred tuberculosis clinics, and some three thousand open-air sanitariums where patients receive treatment. In addition, there are more than eleven thousand nurses engaged in helping people combat the "white plague"; and, thanks to the educational work done <span class="page-break">2</span>by the Association, authorities in both city and country districts have become aware of the tuberculosis menace and are taking effective measures to check the disease.</p>
   <p>In order to make information concerning tuberculosis and its prevention and cure more widespread, the National Tuberculosis Association has just published a circular entitled "What Everybody Should Know About Tuberculosis". It is printed in sixteen different languages, one of which is Swedish. It may be obtained free of charge by writing to The Swedish Bureau, Foreign Language Information Service, 119 West 41st Street, New York City. This Bureau also gives the addresses of the representatives of the Association in the various states.</p>
