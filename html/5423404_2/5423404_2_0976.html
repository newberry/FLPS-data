   <p>We are now living in the year 1909. But when the State Bank of Chicago (Haugan and Lindgren's Bank) was established they wrote 1879 on the date line.</p>
   <p>This bank has thus been in operation for thirty years, during which time it has served Chicago's Scandinavian public with honesty and efficiency, and won its confidence and good will.</p>
   <p>The bank is capitalized at one million dollars and its reserves have now reached $1,300,000. It is thus the largest Scandinavian bank in America.</p>
   <p>Three per cent interest is paid on savings accounts.</p>
