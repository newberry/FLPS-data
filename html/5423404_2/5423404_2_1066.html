   <p>While specialization has been developed to a higher degree in America than in any other country, we do occasionally find individuals and firms that have the ability to spread out and become experts in a variety of fields. Even among our own countrymen, one may run across such an individual, and we shall forthwith narrate the life story of one of them.</p>
   <p>When a man succeeds, in spite of such a business crisis as we experienced during President Cleveland's administration, in building up a considerable real-estate business and make a neat fortune in so doing, he possesses more than ordinary ability.</p>
   <p>Albert Rundblad did just that, and earned not only money but--what is more important--the respect and confidence of the financial institutions and the public with which he was dealing. He is a combination real-estate owner, real-estate broker, building broker, and building contractor. He owns building lots in every section of Chicago. If the buyer of a lot also wishes to <span class="page-break">2</span>build on it, but lacks capital, Rundblad arranges a loan for him and erects the kind of building he wants. In fact, he will lend him cash against any acceptable security. Another part of his business is the building and sale of apartment houses on his own account.</p>
   <p>His business keeps him on the go. At the present time, he has so many buildings under construction that winter will be far advanced before they are completed. We do hope that, in his strenuous hunt for gold, he does not ruin his health, which is not very good.</p>
   <p>Rundblad was born on September 17, 1865, near Sundsvall, Sweden. His father later moved to Skonvik, where the boy went to grade school. At the age of eighteen, he entered the well-known Vester Norrland People's High School, and thanks to the training he received there, he obtained employment as a loading boss in his native town. The work consisted in supervising the loading of lumber cargoes.</p>

   <p>He had a woman relative living in Michigan, who assured him that he would find better opportunities in America than existed at home, and in 1886 he embarked for the promised land, bound for Diamond Lake, Michigan. He stopped there for only about four months, however, and then moved to Muskegon, where he went to work in a sawmill.</p>
   <p>In 1888, he decided to go to Chicago, where he was employed by a sculptor. He stayed on that job until the big building boom struck the city, when he decided to enter the real-estate game. Lady Luck was with him. For the last ten years, his office has been on the seventh floor of 88 Washington Street, and space does not permit us to list the important business deals which have been consummated there on the buildings which he has erected.</p>
   <p>Two years ago, he discovered that it is not well for a man to live alone. It so happened that he became acquainted with a splendid Stockholm girl, Miss Ella Wallin, who soon recognized the good qualities of this energetic young man from Norrland. The liking was mutual, and resulted in what we hope will <span class="page-break">4</span>be a permanent union. The couple went on a honeymoon trip to Sweden.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rundblad is an honest and straightforward person, who makes a favorable impression on everybody who meets him; at the same time, he possesses that renowned Yankee shrewdness.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the Knights of Pythias, the King Oscar Lodge, and the Mystic Shrine.</p>
