   <p>Further, it was decided to appear at the Swedish-American Republican League's John Ericsson festival at the Hotel La Salle, Sunday afternoon, March 9. Practice is held regularly at the Svithiod Singing Club usually attended by from seventy-five to one hundred singers, which indicates that the concert is to be something exceptional in the history of the Swedish Singers of Chicago. New songs are now being practiced, and the song -loving public will be treated with a number of delightful surprises. The singing society, as a whole, will present "Vikingarne," (Vikings) and "Son of the Sea," with accompaniment by a musician from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.</p>
