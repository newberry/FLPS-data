   <p>No country in the world can show as many accidents in connection with railroads and streetcars, year after year, as this our adopted country. In respect to this, the United States is without a peer. The victims of these means of transportation are counted in thousands upon thousands every year. The newspapers contain reports every day of one or more regrettable accidents of this kind, and afterwards follow reports of damage demands by the victims or their relatives, on the companies which frequently, on account of lack of safety arrangements, are directly responsible for the accidents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It may be safely stated that only a small fraction of the awards in the suits for damage in accidents cases are in favor of the claimants. But why? Partly on account of the ignorance of those who have been hurt, and partly on account of the legal advisers of the rich companies, whose duty is to protect the companies from all expenses which might arise from the accident.</p>
   <p>He who is familiar with the language of this country may be able to guard against the pitfalls laid for him by the attorneys of the companies, but the many foreigners, Swedes more than any other, who are hurt when streetcars collide, or who are thrown from streetcars in motion, do not have command of the language, and have great difficulty in avoiding the traps laid out for them when the accident is under investigation at the office of the company.</p>

   <p>There sits the smooth corporation lawyer, kindness in eye, but guile in heart, asking questions of the poor cripple concerning the manner of accident. He pretends sympathy for the cripple, and traps him in a labyrinth of cross questions. The crippled one answers to the questions as well as possible, and the hypocrite writes down the replies, adding to them, when suitable. Now the victim is permitted to leave, but is directed to return in a couple of days. He appears as directed, and questions to snare him are once more presented by the minion of the corporation. At length, the sly lawyer is through with his work and has composed a lengthy document, containing the questions asked by him and the replies given by the claimant. He reads the paper slowly and clearly, and the victim brightens, as he finds that everything he has said is contained in the paper, merely edited somewhat by the kind jurist. Now the crippled man is requested to sign the paper. He does not quite understand the "catch" paragraphs, but is ashamed to admit it. He wants to show that he has great understanding of the language, although <span class="page-break">4</span>having been in this country for only a couple of years, and he signs the document. A couple of days later he is called before the investigation committee, the members of which, tears of false sympathy in their eyes, inform him that however much they would wish to award him compensation they cannot do so; he has no just claim against the company for injuries sustained.</p>
   <p>Not until then does the injured man go to a lawyer, asking him to take the matter in hand and sue the company. The first question the lawyer asks is, "Did you sign any paper?" And usually the answer is in the affirmative. "Then there is nothing to be done in the matter," says the lawyer; he knows what the signed document signifies.</p>
   <p>We urge our fellow-Swedes who are hit by a car, overthrown, thrown off, or <span class="page-break">5</span>in any other way injured by streetcars to place their case in the hands of some capable lawyer at once, and not try first to get compensation directly from the company in question.</p>
