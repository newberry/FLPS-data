   <p>In matters of business it happens not infrequently that continued exchange of letters seems to offer no result, and one of the writers may then very briefly tell the other party that a definite statement must be given as to what this other party will undertake to do, or the interchange of letters will be at end.</p>
   <p>Affairs between nations resemble much those between individuals or business concerns in this respect, and our country seem to have reached a point in its correspomdence with Germany where definiteness must be demanded.</p>
   <p>As long as the statements actually received from Germany's side consisted in expressions from the German press or from some diplomat, even an ambassador, we considered it wisest to hold the final outcome as undecided - We did not at all overlook the embarassment of the German government as it was placed at the point of having to choose between satisfying the demands of the United States or satisfying the demands of public opinion in Germany, an opinion, which, by the way, the German government had nurtured.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>To state it briefly, our suspicions have been justified. The German government's only authentic reply is that there is no reason for apoligizing on its part. According to the report the German government claims to have received from the captain of the submarine which sunk the Arabic, the sinking was a matter of self defence; the Arabic had tried to sink the submarine, according to this report. So the German government suggests bringing the question of recompense before the International Court at Hague.</p>
   <p>We do not need to trouble about the question of whether the German submarine interpreted correctly or incorrectly the intuition of the Arabic. Whichever these intentions were, the submarine could save itself by submerging - as it did before firing the torpedo. In any case it is clear that the commander of the submarine openly disregarded the American demand for safety where U.S., citizens or property is concerned, as presented by our President at the time of the <span class="page-break">3</span>sinking of the Lusitania. The demand at that time can only be considered an ultimatum. The sinking of the Arabic was taken as the German reply to the ultimatum. The official message from Germany makes it clear that the sinking was meant to be the reply.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this, we consider the American people's love of peace so strong, and the aversion to war against a nation from which we have received so many and highly valued citizens so great and general, that President Wilson may consider himself justified in appealing once more to the sense of justice of the German nation. Leaving the German explanations concerning the Lusitania and Arabic at their face falue, the president might, in one opinion, accept an official German declaration that in the future, the principles of international law will be closely adhered to by German submarines. But definite, clear statment must be demanded. There are kinds of wrongs which a nation no more than an individual can submit to without losing every claim to respect and independence.</p>
