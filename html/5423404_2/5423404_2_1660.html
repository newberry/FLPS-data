   <p>The concert of the Swedish Theater Association held last Sunday at Lake View Hall was attended by some five hundred persons. It was opened with a piano solo by Doctor G. Erikson, followed by a solo by Nils Carlson, who later on in the evening, appeared as a comedian. Thure G. Tureo, baritone, sang several numbers, and Ernst Lindblom, together with Nils Carlson, sang a duet. Dancing followed, and the public seemed to be very well satisfied.</p>
