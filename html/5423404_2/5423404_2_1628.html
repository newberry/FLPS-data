   <p>With the coming of Christmas, the Swedish Choral Club will give a concert in Orchestra Hall December 26.</p>
   <p>The principle number on the program will be the great oratorio, "Maria Magdalena".</p>
   <p>This great musical piece is taken from the Biblical story. About sixty artists from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra will take part. Among them were: Sopranos, Lillian Wright, and Mohle Carlew-Smidt; the tenor, Edward Atarson, and the baritone, Burton Thatcher.</p>
   <p>The leader, as usual, will be Edgar Nelson. This oratorio is said to have a peculiar appeal, as it has sweet, soft, and touching, tones, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and will be new to the Chicago audience. This masterpiece was produced by Massenet in 1873, and which made him the greatest compositor after the Franco-Prussian War.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Choral Society has not yet held a concert where less than one hundred have been unable to get tickets, so it is best to apply early.</p>
   <p>The price of tickets is the usual one, as we have not yet adopted War prices.</p>
