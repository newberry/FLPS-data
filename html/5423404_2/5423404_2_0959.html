   <p>H. P. Nelson Piano Company has opened a place of business at 1385 Milwaukee Avenue. A number of the company's best instruments are now being moved into this location. The head of the firm is Mr. H. P. Nelson, a man who has always an eye open for business, and the ability to select capable helpers. He has secured Mr. Carl Anderson as manager of his Milwaukee Avenue establishment. Mr. Anderson is well qualified for this position. He is 42 years old, was raised in Stockholm, came to Chicago eighteen years ago and represented for seventeen years well-known piano companies all over the country. We wish this thrifty countryman the best of luck in his new work, and likewise we congratulate Mr. N. P. Nelson on his last acquisition.</p>
