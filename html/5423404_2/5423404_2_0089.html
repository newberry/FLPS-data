   <p>In the Norwegian newspaper Scandinaven we read the following article, and we are taking the privilege of re-printing it.</p>
   <p>"City Engineer John Ericson says he intends to resign from his position as soon as the investigation of contractor McGovern is completed. Ericson explains that he is tired of all the trouble he has been put to by the contractors, whose graft schemes he revealed, and others who could not do anything with him because he was Swedish. It would be a great loss to the City if Ericson left his post. He has handled his responsible position during a long span of years, and it can be truthfully stated that he is the best city engineer Chicago has ever had. He has surrounded himself with capable persons, capable at least as long as he himself could manage them.</p>

   <p>"He says he has saved large sums of money for the City by efficient management of his department. He has conducted himself as the position warrants. He has tried to obstruct crooked schemes conceived by the contractor rings. No doubt that he is right in this matter. He has been an honest and capable man, and for that reason he has not been the right man for the contractors. He has, like other Scandinavians who have been in the City Hall, been considered an angel in the eyes of the powers that be. The "ruling race" cannot stand anyone who attempts to tie the hands of the contractors. This unwillingness shows itself in many ways, and it is no wonder that a splendid man, trying to do his duty, becomes tired. But it would be a little unusual if it should happen now. The dishonest contractor, and the Scandinavian haters have punished Ericson and other Scandinavians in the City Hall before under Democratic management. It was expected to be a little better since we have a Republican administration in the City Hall, and a Mayor who does not hail from the Green Island.</p>

   <p>But these hopes seem to have vanished."</p>
   <p>We have re-printed the foregoing article because it came from another nationality than Mr. Ericson's. The Scandinavian-Americans have so many times printed their full and firm belief that Ericson is honest and upright in all his dealings, that our views are well known in the matter.</p>
