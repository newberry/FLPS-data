   <p>As previously has been mentioned, our well-known countryman L.F. Hussander has received the Republican nomiration for Alderman from the 25 Ward. His nomination was unanimous, and we express a sincere hope that his election to the office will fall but little short of a unanimous vote for this sincere and unusually capable man.</p>
   <p>The Swedish-Americans of Chicago feel that they have a right to demand that they should be represented by at least one of their own nationality in the administration of this great City. It is no easy or grateful task to be Alderman in Chicago, and among those who are really qualified and of proven integrity, very few can be induced to be placed on the ticket. For this reason we Swedisk-Americans owe gratitude to Mr. Hussander, and it is only to be hoped that his honest endeavors shall become realized through the united efforts on the part of the Swedes on election day, April 7.</p>
