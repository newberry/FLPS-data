   <p>The property-owners at "Skansen," the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter's summer colony on Lake Lorraine in Wisconsin, at an open-air meeting last Sunday decided to formulate a new constitution and new by-laws and immediately to incorporate their organization. A board of directors was promptly elected, and its members are Ernest Franseen, Joseph Blongren, Otto A. Velander, Ivar Johnson, Erik Thulin, Gunnar Nelson, and John Youngve. Officers are to be selected from this group of men at a meeting which will be called in the near future.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday's meeting was well attended, and many new members joined the association. Enthusiasm for "Skansen" ran high, and it was even suggested that Chicago's Swedes be invited out there some Sunday this summer, to spend a happy day in beautiful surroundings. Those who live in this Swedish "Colony" are proud of it and wish to show their countrymen in Chicago what they have accomplished up there among the beautiful lakes of Wisconsin. [Translator's note: The word "Skansen" means "rampart". In this case the name is probably chosen because an elevated section of Stockholm, Sweden, including a park, is so named.]</p>
