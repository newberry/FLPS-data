   <p>In September 1918, Congress passed a law which fixed minimum wages on the District of Columbia. It was opposed on the grounds that since it also applied to women workers, it would have a detrimental effect on business, and would cause an increase in the cost of living. It was also prophesied that, as a result of this law, many jobs previously held by women would be taken over by men.</p>
   <p>The committee which was appointed to study the effects of this controversial legislation has now submitted its third annual report, and according to this report none of the disheartening predictions has come true. Employers admit that business is better. The cost of living is as high in the District of Columbia as in other parts of the country, but no higher. The number of employed women has decreased by only four per cent since the end of the war, and practically no women have had to give up their jobs in favor of men.</p>

   <p>It thus seems that the minimum wage law has had no ill effects. On the contrary, it has benefited women especially. Before it was passed, seventeen thousand, or about seventy to eighty per cent of all employed women in the District of Columbia, earned less than the present minimum wage. In certain occupations, such as those in laundries, restaurants, hotels and stores, where half of the employed women formerly earned less than twelve dollars per week, and many received as little as six, five, or even four collars, the minimum weekly wage is now from $15 to $16.50. About twelve thousand women have received an hourly pay increase of thirty-eight per cent, and two fifths of them now receive more than the minimum wage.</p>
   <p>This certainly marks a great improvement, but there is still a long way to go before women receive the same pay that men get for the same work.</p>
