   <p>On the initiative of C. J. Nilsson the sculptor, 774 Racine Avenue, a number of Swedish artists met last Thursday evening at Hotel Bismarck in this city, to discuss the organizing of a Swedish-American society of art. All those present were in favor of the organization of an art society, the purpose of which will be, among other things, to develop co-operation between Swedish artists and Swedish-American artists and to arrange for annual exhibitions of art in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A second conference, to which all the Swedish artists in Chicago are to be invited, is to be held at the same place on this coming Friday, at 8 P.M. At that meeting proposals for statutes will be discussed, and the organization may take place. It is intended to push the matter so as to make it possible <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to present an art exhibition next spring.</p>
