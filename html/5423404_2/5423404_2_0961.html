   <p>One of the country's largest and most up-to-date piano manufacturing plants is located at Kedzie and Chicago Avenues, along the Northwestern Railroad.</p>
   <p>The main factory and office building is modern in the real sense of the word, with plenty of light and fresh air, and occupies eighty-two thousand square feet of floor space. It was built for the purpose of piano manufacturing and contains all the latest and best machinery and equipment necessary to produce a first-class piano, and the health and well-being of the hundreds of employees have received due consideration. Railroad tracks lead right up to the buildings <span class="page-break">\2</span>where materials are stored, and also to the shipping department from which one thousand pianos a month, or twelve thousand a year, are being shipped to all parts of the country, to the large cities of the East as well as to the pioneer homes on the western prairies.</p>
   <p>When one reads about the fine manufacturing plant of the H. P. Nelson Company one is bound to ask about the man behind it, the chief who is directing this well-ordered industrial enterprise, and whose energy and business ability are responsible for its remarkable growth and success.</p>
   <p>Well, his name is on his product as a guaranty of the finest quality and workmanship. H. P. Nelson is a native of Skane, Sweden, and was born in a farm home in Farhult Parish, near Helsingborg, December 30, 1867. At the age of sixteen he left the old home, and set out for America, which he had heard so much about, to try his luck. His first job here was in a factory in North Easton, Massachusetts, and after working there for some time he went to Chicago, <span class="page-break">\3</span>where he started as an apprentice in one of America's finest piano factories. He worked for some time in each one of the various departments of the plant, and became so familiar with every phase of the manufacturing process that he was able to construct a complete piano, a feat which few, if any, present-day piano manufacturers can duplicate. He spent seventeen years in this place, and advanced steadily until he became superintendent, a position which he held for several years.</p>
   <p>He finally quit the firm, and seven years later we find him heading a concern of his own, located in a small building on Division Street. To start with, he employed seven or eight men, and built one piano a week. At that time he had fifty thousand dollars at his disposal, and could well have started in a bigger way, but such was not his plan. However, from the very beginning his product was well received, and became known both for its fine appearance and excellent musical qualities, and it soon became necessary to move to larger quarters, install more machines, and hire more workers. The demand increased rapidly, and within a short time another expansion had to be planned. Mr. Nelson <span class="page-break">\4</span>then decided to reorganize his business entirely. The operating capital was increased to a quarter of a million dollars; several acres of land were bought in a suitable locality, and the present plant was built. Additions have later been made to it.</p>
   <p>High-grade workmanship and only the very best materials are required for the making of a really fine piano, and in the Nelson factory no trouble and expense are spared in order to produce an instrument as close to perfection as present-day knowledge and skill can make it.</p>
   <p>Due to its large production the firm buys its materials at the lowest possible prices, and this saving is passed on to the customers. That is why the Nelson piano, which is superior in both appearance and tonal qualities, costs no more than other less attractive products.</p>
   <p>People interested in pianos may inspect the Nelson piano at the Rudolph <span class="page-break">\5</span>Wurlitzer Company's salesrooms, 266-268 South Wabash Avenue. This Company is one of the world's largest dealers in musical instruments, and its high standing and business principles are the reasons why Mr. Nelson has chosen it to handle his product.</p>
   <p>The Nelson piano is sold by music dealers all over the country, but if it cannot be obtained in your locality, write directly to H. P. Nelson Company, Kedzie and Chicago Avenues, Chicago, Illinois, and a catalog containing price list and detailed information will be mailed to you. In Chicago H. P. Nelson's pianos are sold only by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company, 266-268 South Wabash Avenue.</p>
