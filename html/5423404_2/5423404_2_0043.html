   <p>In the list of members of the committee from the various wards, who were appointed to work for the election of Charles S. Deneen for governor, we noted two Swedish names, John A. Linn and Otto Cederwall. The former is so well-known among the Swedish-Americans as a politician of long standing and local power, that there is no need for a discussion of his qualifications here. The member from Ward 33, Otto Cederwall, on the other hand, we take pleasure in presenting to our readers.</p>
   <p>Membership on a committee such as the one mentioned is, of course, in itself important; it shows that the ward organization has confidence in the man. This circumstance alone would not have been sufficient, however, to induce us to enter Mr. Cederwall in our portrait gallery. We enter him because we are convinced that the public will find him, within a short time, in more <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>important functions in the arena of local politics. In our opinion there is, to begin with, excellent material in Mr. Cederwall for a good alderman or county commissioner. Within his ward he is....well-known as a mar of honesty, reliability, and sound business principles. These attributes have made him well-liked in his ward and have created confidence in him among those who have had business dealings with him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cederwall has never sought public office, and he will surely be surprised when he learns that Svenska Nyheter considers him suitable material for a candidate. Our intention is simply to have the attention of our compatriots called to the man.</p>
   <p>Whatever one may think about the higher schools of learning in Sweden, one fact remains; he who has studied for some years at one of those schools will carry with him into life a certain something in his favor, which is missing in those who did not have the privilege. The discipline exerted by the fellow students, the influence of the teachers and of the surroundings as a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>whole, contribute in this respect, as does also the fact that the people as a whole look up to those who frequent the higher schools.</p>
   <p>A conversation with Otto Cederwall will soon give evidence of his education. He was born in Gothenburg on November 1, 1864, and will thus be forty years old this fall. His father was a merchant. Having graduated from the higher schools, Cederwall obtained a position in the office of the White Star line and remained there for four years. Being in constant touch with returning Swedish-Americans and American tourists, it was hardly to be wondered at that the young man should wish to see for himself the great country across the ocean, of which so much that seemed pleasant had been told him. Consequently he.....emigrated to New York in 1885.....Joining the great current of Swedish immigrants, be continued to Chicago where he soon got a position at Knute Nelson's Clothing Store on Chicago Avenue, and remained with that company for one year. He was anxious, however, to see more of the country and started out for the West, landing in San Francisco where he worked for two yeans with the firm of Lachman and Company....</p>

   <p>In 1888 he returned to Chicago where he opened a buffet in Grand Crossing....It is the finest of its kind in the place....because Mr. Cederwall gave the noisy element to understand that he did not want its business. Consequently, his place is always orderly and clean....In the year 1896 Mr. Cederwall married Miss Annie Broberg....He is a member of Svithiod, Hilding Lodge No. 9; Grand Crossing Turner Verein; Baltic Society of Grand Crossing; Sweaish Glee Club....During the year of famine in Swedish Norrland, Rev. Svanback, J. R. Pierson, and Otto Cederwall formed a subcommittee for the collection of money for the sufferers. The committee collected more than $300 which was added to The Laily News' fund.</p>
   <p>During the past ten years, Mr. Cederwall has taken active part in politics. As will be realized from what we said at the beginning of this article, he is a regular and unswerving Republican.</p>
   <p>By his faithful character, his pleasant ways, his honesty in business, his <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>personal magnetism, his liberality and his friendliness, Mr. Cederwall has won a large circle of friends who will be sure to agree with what we have stated about him in this article.</p>
