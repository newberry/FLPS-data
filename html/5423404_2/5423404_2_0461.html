   <p>Robert Lindblom, the well-known Chicago Board of Trade man, was a guest speaker last Sunday evening at the meeting of "The Economic Conference". His subject was "Speculation and its bearing on prices". He made a vehement attack upon land speculation in uncultivated land in particular. He described the dangers and pitfalls of this type of speculation in a manner that won great acclaim from his listeners. The great hall was packed to capacity a full half hour before the hour scheduled for his speech.</p>
