   <p>A just verdict of guilty has been rendered against John R. Walsh; he was convicted because he disobeyed all possible bank laws. When his doom came, or better said, when the jury returned the verdict "guilty" the prosecuted thought this was only the beginning, naturally he thought he would be free. He has money at his disposal, all he needs.</p>
   <p>When the oil trust was prosecuted for having violated the laws of the land and was fined $29,000,000, it ought to make business men understand, although this fine may never be paid; the oil trust also had plenty of money at their command.</p>
   <p>When Court Clerk John M. Cook was found guilty of misuse of large sums of money, he said it would be hard to punish him. Cook has a lot of political influence and the way it looks it is almost impossible to punish him. And if one wish to look around there would be hundreds of the rich and influential politicans <span class="page-break">\2</span>who have broken the laws and been found guilty, but thru political influence or their wealth they went free, to the detriment of the entire community. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at that a large number of people become dishonest, especially when among 999,000 one poor vagrant is complained against for some minor thing, such as taking a loaf of bread, and is immediately prosecuted. It is clear that dissatisfaction will become prevalent when such justice is dealt out to the poor while there is no prosecution for the rich. That is when the masses fail to have respect for the law. It is not to be wondered at that mistrust breeds hate, and hate becomes encouraged by such groups as the anarchists and other reform parties whose desire it it to tear down the present type of social life and build a new kind of social order that will be ideal with justice for all and injustice to no one. This dissatisfied element has shown itself in times past as being ready to break the way if the occasion offered itself even with blood and murder. We blame the anarchists. But who shall wonder at their getting adherents? We do not need to search for the reason. It is the unrighteousness of the rich, in other words, the rich break the laws and use political influence to escape prosecution. That element which by murder and <span class="page-break">\3</span>crime makes life what it is, are the individual anarchists. But the rich law breakers and gentlemen with strong political influence that flaunt the law who are the Mothers of the Anarchists.</p>
