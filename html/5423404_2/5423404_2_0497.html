   <p>In certain quarters it is being realized that the manner in which women dress these days has its undesirable effects, aspecially in that the ultra modern trend is not conducive to the maintenance of good health. A short time ago Swiss life insurance companies announced that from then on the trend in womens' clothing would be taken into consideration when insurance rates for the weaker sex were being determined. Women who used short skirts and low cut gowns would be required to pay a higher rate than those who dressed more conservatively, for the insurance doctors had found that the modern way of dressing causes much sickness among women.</p>
   <p>In the good old days sensible mothers urged their daughters to put on heavy, warm clothing in cold and rough weather, and such advice was probably better than the youngsters realized at the time. A woman with an exceptionally strong constitution may be able to defy the elements and get away with it, but few <span class="page-break">\2</span>women are sufficiently robust to do so. Excessive cooling off of the body surface is unwholesome, causing colds and more serious disorders.</p>
   <p>The wise woman does not allow herself to be completely ruled by the decrees of fashion. She dresses according to the weather and the season, thus protecting her health, which is her most valuable asset.</p>
