   <p>The W. Williamson Printing House, 1702 Winona Avenue, is this week observing the fiftieth anniversary of its establishment, for it was in 1872 that the owner, Wahlfrid Williamson, opened his job printing shop here. Both Mr. Williamson himself and the printing industry have undergone great changes since that time; but he is the kind of man that always keeps up with the times, and his shop is an up-to-date establishment. He is an old hand at the trade. </p>
   <p>In 1869, at the age of nineteen, he embarked for "the Far West" and came to Chicago. He had had considerable experience in the printing trade, having worked for some time in the shop of the newspaper Oresunds-Posten in the city of Halsingborg. He was born in Tralleborg. When this young immigrant first came to Chicago, conditions here were not what he had expected them to be. So he went to Missouri, where he went to work for a railroad. After some time, he returned to this city and worked for a couple of years for Swedish newspapers here. In 1872 he opened his own printing shop, and he has continued <span class="page-break">2</span>in this business ever since.</p>
   <p>Williamson is a member of the Bethania congregation, and from 1882 to 1899 he served as secretary of the Methodist Aid Society.</p>
