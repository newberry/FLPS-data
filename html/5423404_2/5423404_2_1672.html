   <p>A committee on the Svithiod Singers' Journey to Sweden met Saturday evening in Svithiod Singers Club Room, and set up plans for the contemplated trip to Sweden in 1910. One hundred of the members have expressed their desire to make the trip, but only fifty will be selected. It is the duty of Professor Ortengren to make the selection. At the meeting, a travel committee was appointed with Frank Gustafson and Consul Henry Henschen to handle the finances. Mr. Olaf Nelson of Chicago is to serve as chairman, and Victor Nilsson from Minneapolis, is to serve as secretary. We believe several hundred countrymen will go on a trip to Sweden at this time, and with the choir, pay a visit to their homeland together.</p>
