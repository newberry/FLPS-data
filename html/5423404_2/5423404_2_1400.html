   <p>The organization, Swedish-American Artists, opened its first art exhibit last Sunday night in the imposing building of the Illinois Women's Athletic Club of this city in the presence of a large number of Swedish-American, as well as native American, art patrons. The art objects number close to 140, and the exhibit is the largest ever presented by Swedish-Americans, and in regard to quality it compares favorably with previous events of its kind.</p>
   <p>There are exactly 136 pieces, and most of them are on display in the large salon on the thirteenth floor. But this room is not quite large enough, and all the sculptures and a few of the paintings had to be placed on the ninth floor. This causes some inconvenience, which is unavoidable however, and it is to be hoped that visitors will put up with it gracefully.</p>
   <p>There are only a few portraits. Two of them, "Rose and Green" and "Brita," are by the late Arvid Nyholm, who died last year, and are typical of his <span class="page-break">2</span>masterly work. Torey Ross, who is known as a many-sided artist, also is represented by two portraits, "The Model" and "Waiting," both of which are brilliantly done.</p>
   <p>The landscapes are numerous, and this group is also the strongest in every respect. John F. Carlson....is back again with two fine winter landscapes, "Opal Mists" and "Melting Ice Floes". Gerda Ahlm's two canvases are also good. There is something deep and genuine in the work of this artist. Of Gotthild Ahlman's three canvases, "Lake McDermott, Glacier National Park" is the best. In it he has really caught the spirit of winter.</p>
   <p>Alfred Jansson's two winter landscapes are beautiful, as is his "Lily Pond," but the latter is placed at a disadvantage because of the poor lighting effects. Thomas Hall exhibits two paintings, one of which, "Summer in New England," excels anything he has done before in this category. A rich, warm painting! He also exhibits two aquarelles, one of which is done in a style that is new to this artist, showing more details than are usually seen <span class="page-break">3</span>in his aquarelles.</p>
   <p>Axel Linus is making a fine contribution to the exhibit with his "Ruins of Borgholm Castle". Martin Lundgren exhibits two paintings of which "After the Rain" is the superior. Signe Palmblad's "A Corner of My Woods" is a fine, delicate painting. She also exhibits four others, one of which shows her home in the Svenska Tribunen-Nyheter's summer colony, Skansen.</p>
   <p>Birger Sandzen, who, as an artist is in a class by himself, is again represented in a Swedish-American exhibit after a long absence; he exhibits four powerful canvases, one of which is a still life. Carl E. Wallin's paintings, three in number, are readily recognized, and are attracting much attention.</p>
   <p>There are only a few marine paintings in the collection, and they are all of the highest quality; they are the work of Charles E. Hallberg and Leon Lundmark. All but one are done by Hallberg. That one is Lundmark's "The Open Sea".</p>

   <p>There are many aquarelles, and they really deserve a special writeup; but time and space do not permit of more than a passing mention. In fact, we are unable to present an adequate picture of the entire exhibit. It must be seen to be appreciated. And to make a thorough study of it requires much more time than the few hours we had at our disposal.</p>
   <p>The sculpture group is excellent and quite extensive. Among the sculptors, we note especially Charles Haag, who is regarded very highly by American art critics, but who has not taken part in a Swedish-American art show for many years. He exhibits seven sculptures, of which "The Cyclon [sic]" attracts most attention. Among the other artists in this group, we noted Carl F. Skoog and Agnes Fromen.</p>
   <p>The opening nights' program was in charge of City Treasurer Charles S. Peterson, and included several speeches, with song by the Swedish Glee Club and an Italian opera singer in the intervals between speeches. Among the speakers were Charles S. Peterson, Mrs. Pierson, who is the president of the Illinois <span class="page-break">5</span>Women's Athletic Club, Mrs. Bertha Bauer, Ralph Clarkson, and Mr. Harshe, director of the Art Institute. The latter declared the exhibit officially opened, and, complimenting the Swedes on their initiative, said that he did not believe any other national group in Chicago could arrange such an exhibit as this one. All the speakers lauded the society, Swedish-American Artists, and also expressed their thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Charles S. Peterson for their part in making this event possible.</p>
   <p>The exhibit will close next Sunday.</p>
