   <p>The well-known building contractor, Simeon Swenson, president and treasurer of the Morton Construction Company, will build a large apartment hotel next summer at Sheridan Road and Wellington Avenue at an estimated cost of $4,500,000. The hotel will have an unusually attractive location, and is to be named the "Ben Mor".</p>
   <p>Construction is to start next April, and one wing of the building is expected to be ready for occupancy by next October. The hotel will contain eight hundred rooms, and on the roof there will be five bungalows with a wonderful view of the North Side and the Lake. According to what we hear, the restaurant and kitchen will represent the last word in culinary art, and Mr. Swenson, as a good Swede, has already decided that genuine Swedish smorgasbord will be served daily. All in all, the hotel will be the largest and most elegant in that part of town.</p>
