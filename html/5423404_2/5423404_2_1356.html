   <p>An art critic on the Chicago Tribune has seen Carl Hallsthammar's exhibit in the Midland Club and likes it. We quote from his review of it: "From being practically unknown, Mr. Hallsthammar has achieved a national reputation. He has a unique talent for gentle caricature, and can make tiny models of men and women--though they are wood--alive. He brings humor and enthusiasm and spirit into being. He whittles a lifetime into a ten-inch stick. Look at "The Cobbler" in the present exhibit, look at "The Photographer"--or the old peasant couple. There is reality and life and fun. A little pathos, too, but rich with conviction.</p>
   <p>"Frequently Mr. Hallsthammar paints his figures. A magnificent portrait of a cowboy on a bucking horse has been left in the natural wood, and it is one of the most striking and beautiful pieces of carving we have seen in some time. The rendering of the old ox-drawn wagon is another brilliant piece of work that does not challenge the eye with color."</p>
