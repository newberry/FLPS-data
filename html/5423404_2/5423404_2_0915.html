   <p>At the luncheon of the Swedish Chamber of Commerce held last Tuesday, Dr. Per Hugo, B. A., of Stockholm, gave a short lecture on the cultural and economic relations between Sweden and the United States and in this connection he brought up the matter that is responsible for his presence in America, the Orphei Drangars"(The Followers of Orpheus) concert tour in this country. The speaker said there was mild opposition to such a tour, but that the great majority still were very much in favor of at last having the opportunity of hearing this famous chorus, undeniably the finest in Sweden. In regard to the most suitable time for their arrival here, the Chamber presumably will make this matter known at its meeting this week. At this time Dr. Hugo will attempt to present new points of view about the interesting visit of these singers from Sweden.</p>
