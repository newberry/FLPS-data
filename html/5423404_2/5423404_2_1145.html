   <p>Mr. P. S. Peterson, our countryman, of Rose Hill, owns the largest gardens and hothouses in Chicago. His property comprises 500 acres. A portion of this is used for flower cultivation. A number of acres are in peonies, some of which are five years old, and at present are at their most sumptuous beauty.</p>
   <p>The Klio Club, composed of society women, visited the Peterson residence, during the past week. The visitors were fascinated by the luxuriant peonies.</p>
