   <p>The concert presented in the Humboldt Park Baptist Church, by the Lake View Hospital Aid Society on Saturday, June 2, was a musical treat somewhat unusual in our Chicago churches. The church choir pleased the full house with several well-executed songs. The rest of the program was excellent. Vocal solos were rendered by Frida Ecklund, Anna Johnson, and Seth Gordon; organ and violin solos were rendered by Ben Peterson and Oscar Peterson.</p>
