   <p>Mr. T. T. Verdier, the newly elected alderman of the 11th Ward is a long-time Chicagoan. He is a Swede, and has a bake-shop, perhaps the biggest in Chicago, in his house, 196 W. Lake Street. He is not what one usually calls a politician, but a man who genuinely cares about the interest of his ward. As a big tax payer, he will no doubt see to it that when the question comes to improvements in the 11th Ward, the City Council will mete out justice to the tax payers of that ward.</p>
   <p>Mr. Verdier speaks, aside from Swedish, also German and English fluently. His countrymen in Chicago, who number perhaps 25,000, have in Mr. Verdier at present their only representative in the Aldermanic Council.</p>
   <p>We sincerely congratulate the 11th Ward.</p>
