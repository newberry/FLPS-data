   <p>City Engineer John Ericson predicts that in 1915 Chicago will have a population of three million, to which 500,000 will be added by 1920. His prediction is based on the increase of population during past years. These figures are in compliance with a request by the Chicago Association of Commerce that he express his opinion on the matter. Mr. Ericson is of the opinion that Chicago should build a more efficient water system than the one it now has. He also pointed out that Chicagoans use too much water; in other words, that they waste it. "The day must come," said Ericson, "when water must be supplied the same as gas, through meters, so that families will pay for what they use."</p>
