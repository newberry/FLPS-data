   <p>Twelve prominent citizens of Swedish nationality have just made a magnificent donation to the city of Chicago. As a token of the gratitude which these men feel toward Chicago they have decided to present to the city one of the most noted works of the world-famous Swedish sculptor Carl Milles, namely, his Triton Fountain.</p>
   <p>In the opinion of many experts the Triton Fountain ranks among the outstanding works of sculpture created in modern times, and this gift will undoubtedly attract much attention in Chicago. It is also safe to say that Swedish-Americans throughout the country will accord their admiration and their gratitude to these twelve countrymen of ours for the manner in which they have honored the Swedish name.</p>
   <p>It has not yet been decided where the fountain is to be placed. It is rumored that its creator, Professor Milles, will arrive in Chicago in the fall, and he will then, in all probability, be present at the dedication ceremony.</p>
   <p>The men who in this manner are expressing their love for the city in which they have made good are the following: Albert I. Appleton, Vincent Bendix, J. P. Seeburg, C. E. Carson, Nels Shoan, Roy W. Wilson, E. G. Grundstrom, Adolph Lindstrom, Charles S. Peterson, Herbert Hedman, F. A. Thulin, and E. P. Strindberg, Sr.</p>
