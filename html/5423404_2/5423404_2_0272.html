   <p>The Swedish society of veterans in Chicago was organized about four years ago by Swedes who had participated in the Civil War, as well as such as had worn Uncle Sam's bloody shirt when the latter had his fight in Cuba against the Spanish forces. The society which already has a very large membership, is yet desirous of gaining more members. Tomorrow evening at 8 o'clock, the society will hold its regular meeting at 109 East Chicago Avenue, and it is expected that many Swedes interested in the cause, especially those who served in the wars mentioned, and others, will be present at the meeting. Election of new officers will take place at the meeting.</p>
