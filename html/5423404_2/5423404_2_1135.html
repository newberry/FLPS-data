   <p>Samuel Anderson was born in Halland, Sweden, August 14, 1848. In Sweden, he was apprenticed to a carpenter and learned the carpenter's trade. At the age of thirty years, he arrived in America, coming to Chicago, the year before the great fire, in 1870.</p>
   <p>He worked for a time at this trade. Mr. Anderson had become interested in chemistry, and practiced his hobby whenever he could. He found that leaf lard, mixed with butter and cream in proper proportions, was as nourishing to the body as pure butter, and started to manufacture it. A Mr. Brown became interested in the venture, and together they started the manufacture of this product on a large scale. The farmers would then sell butterfat to the creameries, and buy "butterine" for their own consumption. This "butterine" was, as has been stated, made from the oleo-oil which was extracted from the leaf lard.</p>

   <p>At the height of the popularity of "butterine," the firm of Braun and Fitts, by whom Anderson was then employed, manufactured as much as two million pounds of "butterine" a month. Only the very best ingredients were permitted to be used. The butter trusts fought the popularity of this product, "tooth and nail," as the "butterine" could be sold much cheaper than genuine butter.</p>
   <p>At the present time, most stringent regulations have been passed by Congress against the profitable manufacture of "butterine" at a cost, so it is said, of more than one million dollars on the part of the butter trusts. Such, as for example, the yellow coloring of "butterine" has been prohibited, also a ten cent tax added to each pound manufactured.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anderson has been married twice. His first wife died in 1879, leaving four children. In his second marriage, he had seven children. One daughter is married to Edward Linn, our well-known countryman. Another daughter is <span class="page-break">\3</span>married to Anton E. Peterson, agent for Erie Railroad Company. Mr. Anderson lives with his family at 694 North Park Avenue, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anderson has been a deacon in the Swedish Immanuel Church for the past twenty-eight years, also a director of the Augustana College, and the Theological Seminary.</p>
