   <p>In the old days, when continual feuds existed among the Western stock raisers, it happened once that two sheep herders were on trial for murder. Sentiment in the community was running high, and the courtroom was filled with tough-looking men, who had come in from neighboring counties to witness the proceedings. The judge, in taking precautions for the maintenance of peace and order, made every person present submit to a search, and such deadly weapons as were found were confiscated, and were not returned to the owners until the trial was over.</p>
   <p>A somewhat similar situation exists at the disarmament conference in Washington. Representatives of several countries have come together for the purpose of trying to reach a peaceful agreement in regard to limitation of armaments. But they come armed to the teeth, so to speak, and the peaceful discussions may well develop into a free-for-all.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In order to bring about real disarmament, some nation should set an example. America is the only nation which might dare to say to the others, "I am going to stop preparing for war, what are you going to do?"</p>
   <p>Should America make such a declaration? We hope she does, and in that case the other naval powers could hardly find any excuse for opposing a real peace plan.</p>
