   <p>After a notable career of thirty years as an artist, Charles E. Hallberg, well known in this country as well as in Sweden as a marine painter, will say good-by to his public with a separate exhibit which is scheduled to open December 13, and which will include his works of the last few years. It will be held in the Admiral Hotel, and kept open to the public until next February 15.</p>
   <p>The aging artist has stated definitely that this is his last exhibit. The grand old man is getting a little tired, and wants to withdraw from the public life. But that will not, of course, prevent him from dabbling a little with colors for the fun of it, and to pass the time. One cannot just simply throw a lifelong habit in the wastebasket and forget about it.</p>
   <p>The fashionable Admiral Hotel is located at the foot of Foster Avenue, close to the lake from which Hallberg so often has taken his motifs, and the owners generously offered him space there for his final exhibit, which is also to be his greatest. It will include the following paintings: "Remember the Maine," "Sigurdring's Death," "The Beginning of a Perfect Day," "Mysterious Battle of Jutland," "A Drama of the Sea," "The Roaring Wave," "A Northeaster," "The Schooner 'Atlantic' on a High Sea," "Near the Gulf Stream," "Early Morning on the North Sea," "Misty Summer Morning on Lake Michigan," "After a Thunder Storm," "Summer Evening," "America Forever," "Evening Glow," "After the Storm," "Summer Morning," "Crossing the Ocean," Moonlight," "Michigan Gale," "An Ocean Wave," "Evening," "The Sea," "The Coming Thunder Storm," and "Restless Sea".</p>
   <p>The list includes many artistic gems, and it is safe to predict that a steady stream of visitors will find its way to the Admiral Hotel to view this magnificent gallery of pictures. By doing so the visitor will find pleasure and enrichment for his soul, and at the same time pay homage to the old artist.</p>
   <p>Hallberg is truly a self-made man and artist. In the following we shall give a few data on his career. He was born January 15, 1855, in Gothenburg, Sweden. The home was poor, but there was good stuff in the boy. In order to help his mother provide for the family he began to peddle small items of merchandise after school hours, and he also spent much time in the city's museums and art galleries. He was not very old when he began to try his hand at painting, but not even he himself thought much of the results.</p>
   <p>When he was seventeen years old he went to sea, and sailed the oceans of the world for eighteen years. During that period he spent much of his spare time sketching the sea and sky in all their varying moods and colors, and it was then he developed that intimate understanding of the elements of nature, at peace or in violent outbursts, which is reflected in his art, especially in his marine paintings.</p>
   <p>About 1890 he left the sea, and he came to Chicago in 1892. He found employment as a watchman in a bank, and fitted out a studio for himself in the basement, where, in his spare time, he tried to reproduce on the canvas the impressions of the magnificent, ever-changing ocean and the heavens above it, which he carried in his memory.</p>
   <p>Hallberg received much encouragement from the two great artists, Anders Zorn and Alexander Harrison, both of whom had occasion to see his work. They urged him to keep up his efforts and not let the talent which they felt sure that he had, go to waste, and it was then that he decided to devote his life to his art.</p>
   <p>In 1901 he took part in an exhibit for the first time. He received due recognition, and from then on rose steadily in the esteem of both critics and the public. He is probably the only Swedish-American artist who ever rated a full-page write-up, with numerous reproductions of his works, in the New York Herald. This happened in 1902, and the article is to be found in the issue of March 9.</p>
   <p>For a long time now Hallberg has taken part in all of the more important art shows, and many of his paintings have found their way to Sweden. There is one in the National Museum in Stockholm, one in the Gothenburg Museum, and a third one in the museum at Vaxjo.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday, next January 15, friends and admirers of the venerable artist will give a banquet in his honor. Henry S. Henschen, the banker, and Colonel John A. Nyden have taken the initiative, and will appoint a committee to take charge of the arrangements for the affair, which, it is expected, will be attended by a large number of Hallberg's friends and colleagues, as well as by art patrons from all walks of life.</p>
   <p>The banquet will be given in the Admiral Hotel, in the very same room where his exhibit is housed.</p>
   <p>Tickets for the banquet, at three dollars a plate, may be obtained from Oliver W. Reese, of the Congress Trust and Savings Bank, 410 South Wabash Avenue.</p>
