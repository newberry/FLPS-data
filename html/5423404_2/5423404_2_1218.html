   <p>When the Opera, after a time, once more takes up "Fidelio," it is also to celebrate one of its most esteemed stalwarts, its truly necessary artist, Ernst Svedelius. This year makes a full fifteen years during which he has let his mighty bass from the nether-world ring on the operatic stage, and the role in which he made his definite entree was as "Rocco" in "Fidelio," his most loved part.</p>
   <p>What Ernst Svedelius has meant to the Opera during all these years is evident by a passing glance at his role interpretations, which include no less than fifty-three greater and lesser parts. Besides "Rocco," he is marked the "Cardinal" in "The Jewess," the "Governor" in "Don Juan," and all the great bass parts in the Wagner cycle, among which "Parsifal" is his greatest role. As a Wagnerian singer he has the record of being the only one capable of handling all the great bass <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>roles, among them Hagen's demanding role.</p>
   <p>Svedelius began early his singing course in America, where he studied under Artero Marescalci. He was a resident of Chicago for a number of years, where he still has many friends, and here he won a great amount of adulation and attention for himself, finally going home to Stockholm in the year of the exposition, 1897, with the large Swedish-American Chorus, which was then under the direction of John Ortengren. He was a co-worker in a number of other concerts, with such a success that the Opera decided to save his talent for the homeland. He, therefore, was permitted to sing on trial, and was engaged in 1898 at the Opera under a contract, making his debut as the "Governor" in "Don Juan," in 1900.</p>
   <p>After his debut, he went directly to Ranft and remained with him four years. Under Ranft, he sang in operettas such as "Stokadetten" (The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Naval Cadet), "Cornevilles Klockor" (The Bells of Corneville), "Villaris Dragoons," and others, and also in the opera "Louise," which then was given at the Swedish Theatre. When the four years were over, Sveledius, was "attacked" anew by the directors of the Opera and was "captured" in 1904 definitely to make his real entree on its stage in "Fidelio."</p>
   <p>Some years ago, in 1911, the Opera came near losing him, when he was called to the Opera in Berlin. He sang on trial there, and even had a five-year contract offered, when the Opera at Stockholm, in the eleventh hour, succeeded in obtaining his stay, and again rolls his bass in the wide expanse of the Swedish Opera.</p>
