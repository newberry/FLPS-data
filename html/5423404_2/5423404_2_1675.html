   <p>Our celebrated countrywoman and operatic singer, Olive Fremstad, who is at present performing here in Chicago, is being acclaimed by the American press as one of the world's really great artists. The critics have carefully analyzed her voice and technique, and she has passed the test with flying colors. We do not mind admitting that it gladdens our Swedish hearts to read about the honors showered upon her by leading American newspapers. She is a mature woman at the zenith of her career, and her own countrymen as well as other nationalities vie with each other in paying her tribute.</p>
   <p>This turns our thoughts to another state of affairs not so pleasant to contemplate. After all, it is easy to join the chorus and pay homage to one who has already won her laurels. We are simply reveling in the glory reflected by somebody else, but it has often been demonstrated that we Swedes do not appreciate our talented Swedish-American singers until they have first been discovered by the other Americans. Then we suddenly get excited and claim them as our own. What do we ever do to make the road easier for the struggling young artist to help her reach her goal? Are we not rather niggardly with our encouragement? There are today many young Swedish-American women in this country who may have a great future as singers, but they would not receive much attention if they were to make a concert tour of our largest Swedish-American communities. Even such a famous prima donna as Madame Norelli has had to sing before comparatively small audiences in various parts of the country, and that also goes for the great Swedish-Finnish singer, Sigrid Westerlund, who is now giving concerts in the East.</p>
   <p>We Swedish-Americans hesitate to applaud our own talent, and seem to take it for granted that our singers, musicians, speakers, and leaders in other lines of endeavor are inferior to those who come over here from the Old Country. A typical demonstration of this attitude was observed recently in Seattle, Washington, where it was decided to import artists from Sweden, at great expense, to perform on Sweden's Day at the fair, while Swedish-American artists, who compare favorably with anything they have in Sweden can be found right on the west coast.</p>
   <p>The action taken at Lindsborg, Kansas, on the occasion of the great Messiah Festival was an exception. An important singing role was entrusted to a product of "home talent," Mrs. Bertha Vestling, who gave such an excellent performance that even the state's American press devoted columns to her praise.</p>
