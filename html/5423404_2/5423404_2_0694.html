   <p>It was reported last Friday that the Commissioner of Public works, Colonel A. A. Sprague, had dismissed City Engineer Alexander Murdock, and in his place appointed our countryman, John Ericson, who had previously served in that capacity for twenty-two years, from 1897 to 1919. It is pointed out that ever since his resignation four years ago, Mr. Ericson has been associated with the city's engineering department as a consultant, drawing the same salary as the city engineer.</p>
