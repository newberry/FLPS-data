   <p>It has been proposed that the different clubs adopt the following war song; it fills the bill and the music could be easily arranged:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Sing A Song of Thrift Stamps,</p>
   <p>A pocketfull of dough;</p>
   <p>Sixteen little Thrift Stamps</p>
   <p>Standing in a row.</p>
   <p>When the War is over,</p>
   <p>How happy I will be;</p>
   <p>My four bucks will be five bucks in 1923."</p>
