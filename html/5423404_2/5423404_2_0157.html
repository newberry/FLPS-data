   <p>Last Saturday we observed the fourth anniversary of the armistice. Four years ago, the world was full of hope that the time for reconciliation had finally arrived, and that militarism and imperialism had received their deathblow. But instead of the long-awaited harmony, hate and revenge are still at the helm.</p>
   <p>On this anniversary, it behooves us, as Americans, to examine our position in relation to the rest of the world, and if we do, we shall be astounded at the immense responsibility which rests upon us.</p>
   <p>To begin with, we should remember that it was on the basis of the principles of Wilson's fourteen points that the Germans laid down their arms. Has the promise contained in a single one of these fourteen points been fullfilled? Are they to go down in history as an example of universal treason, or is America going to throw its weight into the scale, and do what it can to restore a resemblance of right and justice? It is true that Wilson is now out of the picture, but this fact does not relieve America of her responsibility.</p>
   <p>The German people trusted Wilson, not because he was Wilson, but because he was the President of the United States. Picturing Germany's position today, one may use Shakespeare's words in "The Merchant of Venice". "Ask permission to go and hang yourself, but your property is confiscated by the state, and you do not even have as much as a rope. You shall, therefore, hang at the expense of the state."</p>
   <p>Wilson's country, our country, still has a great mission in Europe, greater, perhaps, than that which it undertook when it went to war. It must remove the shadow which the Versailles Treaty throws on its good name by causing a revision of that treaty to be made, and seeing to it that Wilson's fourteen points are adhered to.</p>
   <p>It must not be truly said, in the future, that America shirked her responsibility, and thereby contributed to the oppression and enslavement of an entire nation.</p>
