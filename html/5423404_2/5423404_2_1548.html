   <p>A presentation of "Rika Morbror" (Wealthy Uncle) will be given by a Swedish Theatrical company at the North Side Turner Hall Sunday, January 27th, together with another farce, "En Svartsjuk Tok"(A Jealous Fool). Mr. P.W.Nilson is the director, and he has promised that there will be both good stage decorations and costumes. We do hope our readers will not miss the opportunity to enjoy a happy evening, as the tickets for admission are very reasonable, and such good entertainment is very seldom offered to our countrymen in Chicago.</p>
