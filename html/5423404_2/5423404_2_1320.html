   <p>p.11.....................Our countryman and popular music instructor, Professor A. Alfred Holmes invited an appreciative audience to Kimball Hall last Monday night to a piano concert by one of his most talented pupils, Miss Cora C. Deere.</p>
   <p>We have praised Miss Deere's piano abilities before, but her renditions, this time made her still more worthy of recognition. Among the many piano numbers performed for the interested lissteners were two numbers which were especially well played. F. Chopin, Nocturn in C-Sharp Minor; Opus 27, Number 1; and Polonaise in A-Flat, Opus 53. The compositions demand rare pianistic ability. Mr. W. W. Carnes gave passages from Dicken's "Nickolas Nickleby."</p>
   <p>Professor Holmes has invited music lovers to various concerts, but this was without question one of the best. It was truly a pleasure to be present.</p>
