   <p>The Swedish Dramatic Society, last Sunday night, presented "Oregrund-Osthammar," a farce rich in amusing incidents and situations. The play was presented at the Illinois Theatre, under the direction of E. H. Behmer.</p>
   <p>The curtain went up at 8 o'clock and revealed the Osthammar trio composed of "City Treasurer Bratt" (C. Brusell); "Dye-Manufacturer Gronberg" (E. H. Behmer); "Druggist Ortenquist" (Ernst Schycker). The keenest critic could not have detected any break in their acting, or even a faulty gesture. They were well poised, and in full control of every situation. However, in a drinking scene, an unlucky evening when they were arriving home from a day of drinking and gaiety in merry Stockholm, Behmer and Schycker tended to exaggerate their roles, only Brusell kept properly within bounds. But when "Manufacturer Gronberg" met his beloved wife, he appeared as a commendable actor, excellent in his mimicry, as in everything else. The druggist was charming in his rascality. The three wives of the merry "Osthammar" fellows were played by Ida Anderson-Werner (Bratt's wife), Augusta Milton (the wife of Gronberg), and Alice Collini (Ortenquist's wife). The three women were worthy competitors of their husbands. The masks and costumes used were worthy of praise. The wife of "Bratt" was the leader among the women, as "Bratt" was the leader among the men, yet she was surpassed in acting, time and again, by the dye-manufacturer's wife, who, in her every move, proved master of her role.</p>
   <p>The Oregrund trio was composed of "Deacon Ringdahl," (Carl Liljegren), "Glazer Rutberg," (Ernest Lindblom), and "Toupee Maker Frisen," (Fred Bolling). Their character portrayals are entitled to praise. "Ringdahl" was a deacon incarnate..."Rutberg" and "Frisen" gave splendid presentations. Their acting was natural throughout. "Emil Klint" was played by Wilma Sundborg-Stern. It is sufficient to say that Mrs. Stern was not suited for her role as the thieving boy. On some occasions, however, her acting was very good. The role of "Mrs. Soderstrom" was played by Marie Schycker or, rather, was read by her, for she displayed but scant theatrical talent. Her lover, "Engineer Karl Thorell" (John Fernlundh) was, therefore, compelled to act the lovers' scene, written for two, practically by himself; that he scored in spite of this, is to be attributed to the fact that he is an actor by profession....</p>
   <p>Aside from a few, not very disturbing mistakes, the presentation of the farce was as true to life as could be expected or desired, and rarely would a more appreciative audience be found. Financially, the undertaking was a success, and we hope this type of success may become even greater when, on Sunday, March 5, the Society presents Johan Jolin's happy farce, "Friaren fran Vermland" (Vermland Courtship). This play also will be presented at the Illinois Theatre.</p>
