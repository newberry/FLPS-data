   <p>The Swedish (New) National Society's concert last Sunday at Medinah Temple was very successful from a musical viewpoint, but not from the financial standpoint. The big place was far from filled.</p>
   <p>The most attractive name on the program was that of Mme. Julia Claussen, the prominent opera singer. She sang both numbers listed on the program, and also four extra numbers. She received lively applause from the thankful audience. Gustaf Holmcuist preceeded her on the program and sang several Swedish folk-songs. Mrs. Carl R. Chindblom served as an excellent accompanist. The chorus sang several Swedish folk-songs directed by Joel Mossberg. Mr. Gustaf A. Carlson directed the orchestra, which played several enjoyable numbers.</p>
