   <p>Our countryman, Einar Soderwall, is a noted marine painter besides being a librarian. He has just completed two giant canvases for the brokerage firm of Peabody &amp; Company, whose offices are in the Otis Building, 10 South LaSalle Street. He is to make two more paintings for the same firm, and all four will decorate the walls of the company's offices.</p>
   <p>On account of the size of the canvases Soderwall has been forced to rent a larger studio, which belongs to the art photographer G. H. Nelson, of 5154 North Clark Street.</p>
