   <p>The Scandinavian American Orchestra, recently organized here under the leadership of Frederik Frederiksen had its debut last Sunday at Orchestra Hall before a public, completely filling the hall. The debut was a success in every way, and not least from the point of view of music as an art. The orchestra might be described as a high grade musical instrument in the hand of the artist leader.</p>
   <p>The public responded with enthusiastic applause. The special soloists Mme. Sundelius, Marie Bergersen and Oscar Bergstrom in every way met the high expectations which their reputations had awakened, and the public response was proportionally enthusiastic.</p>
   <p>All in all the concert was a triumph for the new musical organization and for Scandinavian music. It is to be hoped that the orchestra may be able to wake also the American public families with this music.</p>
