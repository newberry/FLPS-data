   <p>The Swedish Home Building Association was founded in 1896, and obtained its charter on November 10 of that year. Originally there were ten shareholders, each of whom invested one thousand dollars in the undertaking, except for one of them who doubled this sum. Changes of management have then place during the years, but some of the incorporators are still active in the affairs of the Association. Attorney Norton became its legal adviser in 1919. The membership has increased steadily, indication that the organization enjoys the confidence of our people. The capital at its disposal, as of December 31, 1920, amounted to $201,703.56, as compared with <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.17 in 1910.

   <p>The Association pays five per cent interest on the invested capital, and members may withdraw their money any time they wish to do so.

Mr. Norton ended his speech by thanking all those who have supported the Association and have contributed to its success so far.</p>
