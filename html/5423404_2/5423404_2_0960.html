   <p>The well-known concern, N. J. Sandberg, and Company was established in 1870, and our compatriot, N. J. Sandberg, now has branches at 319-323 West Division Street; 735-739 West 63 Street; and 2335-2337 West Madison Street. For many years, the company has enjoyed a steadily growing business, Now the firm finds its quarters too small and crowded, and has rented a larger building at 255-257 Wabash Avenue. The lease runs over a period of years, and calls for $192,000 in rent; possession to be taken over in may 1910. This will be the headquarters of the firm.</p>
   <p>The officers are: George N. Sandberg, president and treasurer; Harry S. Sandberg, vice-president; Wm. J. Sandberg, secretary. Naturally, the firm will continue operations at its present location for the present. The one to be opened on Wabash Avenue next year will be the most centrally located.</p>
