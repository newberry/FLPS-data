   <p>The spirit displayed by the citizens of foreign birth and extraction is in keeping with that of the entire nation, and elicits the warmest commendation from those who have been charged with the direction of the Liberty Loan Campaign - aside from the time and energy given by these citizens, their ready response to the appeal to place their funds at the disposal of the government by subscribing for the bonds is praiseworthy in a high degree. It is with this thought in view that we wish to express, publicly, our sincere thanks to them.</p>
