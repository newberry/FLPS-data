   <p>During the past few days some very significant forward moves have been made. As most of our readers know, this bank was founded in 1905, the capital being $200,000.00, reserve fund $25,000.00. The bank was housed at the South Western corner of Randolph and LaSalle Streets. On the first day, deposits amounted to only $3,300.00, but there was steady increase, and on November 1, 1915 deposits amounted to $2,333,116.57.</p>
   <p>Already after five years, the original business place proved too small, and in 1910 the bank moved to its present place where up-to-date attractive and convenient banking quarters greet the customers.</p>
   <p>The following year the capitol of the bank was increased to $500,000.00, and the reserve fund to $100,000.00, and at the same time the building in <span class="page-break">2</span>which the bank had rented quarters was bought for the bank, a very fortunate deal for the bank. During the past summer the building, now known as Union Bank Building, has been modernized and its front altered so that the building is now one of the most elegant on Dearborn Street, giving full impression of being a metropolitan bank. The new banking quarters are to be formally opened on Monday November 15, and the Swedes in Chicago are invited.</p>
   <p>The majority of the leaders in the bank are Swedes.</p>
