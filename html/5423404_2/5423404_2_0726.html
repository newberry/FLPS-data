   <p>The Swedish Club of Chicago gave a luncheon last Saturday in honor of Professor Svante Arrhenius, Nobel prize winner from Stockholm, Sweden. About seventy members participated. The chairman of the club, C. S. Peterson, presided, and asked Consul Henry Henschen to make the welcome address. Prof. A. J. Carlson, of the University of Chicago, delivered the festival address, and spoke of Professor Arrhenius and his achievements in chemical and physical science. Other speakers were Attorney Carl R. Chinblom, and Judge Harry Olson. Professor Arrhenius then spoke, and thanked all for their kind words and their attention. He then departed for Rock Island, Madison, and Minneapolis, but returned yesterday to receive the Willard Gibbs medal from the American Chemical Society.</p>
