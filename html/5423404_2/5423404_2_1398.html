   <p>The artist Carl M. Linner, who for years has been well known in Chicago as a productive artist, and who has participated in many art exhibits, has just made known that he will make an artistic contribution to the John Morton Memorial Building. The gift will consist of four of his own bronze plaques, one each of John Ericsson, Jenny Lind, John Hanson, and Gustaf Hesselius. If these plaques had been made to order, they would have cost a considerable sum. And it so happens that were it not for Mr. Linner's generous gift they would have been ordered, for in the decorative plans of the building the likeness of each one of these famous Swedes is called for. Linner's action is so much the more laudable in that he is not doing it on request, but simply because he is deeply interested in this memorial.</p>
   
   <p>The dedication of the building will take place next summer.</p>
   <p>Linner was born in Smaland, Sweden, and is said to belong to the noted Linne family. It is rather unusual for prominent artists to give away their works, and Linner has certainly set a fine example.</p>
