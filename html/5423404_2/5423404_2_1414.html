   <p>An exhibit of the latest works of the marine painter, Leon Lundmark, was opened yesterday in J. W. Young's art gallery, on the fifth floor of the Fine Arts Building, 410 South Michigan Avenue. A number of Scandinavians, mostly Swedes, were invited to a reception which was given last night in honor of the artist, and Swedish singers and musicians presented a program of song and music.</p>
   <p>It is only lately that Lundmark has begun to attract attention as a painter. Three years ago, he exhibited a painting at the Art Institute. It was a rather small and unassuming canvas, but there was something about it which fascinated visitors, and the directors of the Institute ordered three additional paintings from him, all of which were sold to art collectors. Since then, Lundmark's name has become increasingly well known in art circles, and his paintings find a ready market among art lovers throughout the country.</p>
   
   <p>One of his largest canvases has been bought by the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and will be donated to the municipal art collection in Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>Lundmark has participated in the annual exhibits at the Swedish Club here, and last year his painting, "Morning, Lake Superior," received honorable mention by the prize jury. This painting was also included in the collection of Swedish-American art which was sent to the Gothenburg exposition last summer, and at the present time it is on exhibit in the National Academy, New York City.</p>
