   <p>Charles A. Palmgren, head of the Chicago Tool &amp; Engraving Company, has just taken out a patent on a very ingenious device which he has invented. It is an automatic hammer, powered by compressed air, and easy to handle, weighing only four pounds. It has the form of a pistol and fully "loaded" holds from five to ten thousand nails, depending on their size. The hammer is operated on almost the same principle as an automatic pistol, and is expected to be used extensively in certain industries. Experts declare that the invention ranks among the most important ones that have been made in the mechanical field during the last twenty years.</p>
   <p>Palmgren has previously attracted attention as an inventor of mechanical devices. Among them is an electric control watch, which is now being used in the plants of the Illinois Steel Corporation here.</p>
