   <p>The annual meeting of this Society was held last Sunday in Odd Fellows Hall, 6313 Yale Ave., and was presided over by Carl Blomstrand, the newly elected President. Annual reports from the various singing organizations were read and new business was discussed.</p>
   <p>Among new decisions reached was that pertaining to the Swedish Tuberculosis Sanitarium, Denver, Colorado. This was of special interest, insofar as a unanimous agreement was made to raise the Society's annual contribution to the Sanitarium from $1,600 to $2,500, which increases the quota of the "National Swedish Singers' Society" to $12,000. It was further decided to hold the big annual summer picnic at Riverview Park, Sunday, June 28th, and that both picnic groves should be rented.</p>
   <p>The installation of new officers was conducted by C. Hjalmar Lundquist, and as a worthy finale a dinner was served, at which the South Side clubs were hosts.</p>
