   <p>At the concert given last Friday evening, Dec. 26th, 1924, by the "Swedish Choral Club", at Orchestra Hall, this rightly famous choir's rendering of Haendel's "Messiah" was received with a great ovation. The hall was packed to capacity. The chorus, as well as the fifty-piece orchestra, selected from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was conducted in a masterly manner by Edgar A. Nelson, ably assisted at the organ by Harry A. Carlson. The soloists were Else H. Arendt, soprano, Arthur Boardman, tenor, and Herbert T. Gould, bass.</p>
