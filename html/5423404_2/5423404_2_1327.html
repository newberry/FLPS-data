   <p>The Swedish Artists' Society opened its fifth annual art show last Saturday in the Edgewater Beach Hotel. A large number of artists and art patrons were present at the opening ceremony. The program included songs by Florence Ruden and the opera singer Sigrid Borgstrom Peterson, and also by a male quartette. Dr. Julius Lincoln gave a very interesting talk on the development of Swedish-American art, and dwelt especially on the contributions made by the old Swedish school town of Lindsborg, Kansas.</p>
   <p>The exhibit is comprised of about one hundred numbers by twenty-three artists. It closes Sunday, December 4.</p>
