   <p>Doctor O. E. Wald has recently been appointed chief of staff of Bethesda Hospital, formerly the German-American Hospital, located at 30 Belden Court, near Belden and Cleveland Avenues. So far as we know, he is the first Swedish physician in Chicago to occupy such a distinguished and responsible position. The late Doctor Fenger, the famous surgeon, held this position for a number of years, and it is the place vacated by him that Dr. Wald is now taking. It has been vacant ever since his [Doctor Fenger's] death.</p>
   <p>We believe the directors of the hospital have made a wise choice. The new chief of staff graduated with honors from the school of medicine of the University of Illinois, known as the College of Physicians and Surgeons, in 1898. Later he studied for two years at the medical school of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, following which he also served on the staff of the University Hospital. Upon his return to Chicago he became resident physician at Augustana Hospital, a position he held until two years ago, when he went <span class="page-break">\2</span>into private practice. He has earned a reputation as an excellent surgeon, and the appointment is a logical one.</p>
