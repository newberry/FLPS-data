   <p>Our Chicago Swedish Colony has started an earnest campaign for Postal Savings Banks by calling a mass meeting at the North Side Turner Hall on Saturday evening that drew a capacity house. Mayor Dunne presided at the meeting while our prominent countrymen spoke fluently on the subject. Jane Addams, Julius Goldzier, Frank Buchanan, and Quin O'Brien also spoke with great enthusiasm. Among statistics given out, those from Sweden were enthusiastically received. The statistics showed that Sweden had 571,500 depositors in the Postal Savings Banks, the deposits totaling $14,000,000.</p>
   <p>These figures won the interest and confidence of the assembled people of all nationalities and nearly all signed a petition to Congress to arrange for this branch of banking throughout the United States.</p>
