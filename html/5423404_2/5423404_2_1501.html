   <p>The Swedish Folk Theater, a dramatic company which was established here in Chicago a short time ago, made its debut last Sunday night in Belmont Hall with the presentation of "Tosingar" (Halfwits).</p>
   <p>The house was well filled, a fact which indicates that public interest in Swedish theater has not waned, and to the new company this is especially encouraging.</p>
   <p>There is plenty of fun and humor in "Tosingar"; and its demands on the actors are quite high. But all of them played their roles in a creditable manner. They were somewhat uncertain during the first act but, after that, they warmed up to their roles, and it was, all in all, a laudable performance.</p>
   <p>After the final curtain, Carl Stockenberg addressed the audience, telling <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>how his company had come into being, the reasons for its existence, and its plans for the future. Some of the actors then rendered a few numbers of songs and recitations, and the pleasant evening ended with dance to the music of the Bergquist Brothers.</p>
   <p>The next performance of the Folk Theater will be given in the Viking Temple, on the South Side, January 18, when it will present the comedy "Det Skadar Inte" (It Doesn't Hurt).</p>
