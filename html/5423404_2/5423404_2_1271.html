   <p>Yesterday evening, Miss Nellie Ruby Nelson was awarded a diamond medal in recognition of her unusually talented rendition of the most difficult piano music known.</p>
   <p>Nellie is a daughter of Peter H. Hanson, 1665 Fletcher Street. She was born on the Nelson homestead, near Buxton, North Dakota, on August 10, 1886, and came to Chicago with her parents when she was six-weeks old. At the age of eleven, she began taking piano lessons and in 1902 entered the Chicago Musical College. In 1903, the college awarded her with the silver medal; in 1904, the gold medal was awarded to her, and now she has the diamond medal, the highest honor awarded by the college.</p>
   <p>We congratulate Nellie and trust that soon her Chicago countrymen will often have the opportunity to enjoy her wonderful talent.</p>
