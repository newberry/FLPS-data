   <p>The Republican convention from the 13th Senatorial District of Illinois was held in Chicago last week for the purpose of nominating a candidate for the State Legislature. Three were slated for the contest, namely, former Senator Garrity, William Biedenweck and our countrymen Samuel E. Erickson. During the cause of the election, ex-Senator Garrity withdrew his candidacy in favor of Biedenweck. This did not enhance Erickson's chances, however, but after a hard and long drawn-out fight Erickson's friends succeeded in winning the nomination for him.</p>
