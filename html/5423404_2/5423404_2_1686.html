   <p>The Svithiod Singing Club's concert last Sunday night was well attended. The chorus received generous applause. The biggest ovation went to the two soloists: the singer, Ellyn Swanson, and the violinist Miss Elsie Oberg, each playing with deep feeling, and fine, artistic emotion. The club, itself, sang wonderfully.</p>
