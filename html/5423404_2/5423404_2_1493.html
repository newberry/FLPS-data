   <p>p.12... The artist, Svend Svendsen, is having the fifth annual art exhibition of his own paintings. The exhibit is to be held at Thurbers Attelier's on Wabash Ave. It is reported to be his best one thus far.</p>
   <p>His paintings portray chiefly scenes from his far-north native land; and are truly works of art. Mr. Svendsen appears to have a very special talent for winter twilight as well as early day-break scenes.</p>
   <p>A queer feeling of sadness is often felt by the city-dweller as he views these calm, peaceful scenes. Among the most noteworthy of these one must mention, "Peaceful Evening," "Twixt Day and Night," and "The Evening Cloud." The latter is reputed to be one of the most artistic paintings in America.</p>
