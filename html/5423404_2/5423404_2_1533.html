   <p>Shakespeare's play, "The Taming of the Shrew," was presented in the Swedish language for the first time in America at the Garrick Theatre last Sunday. It was the Swedish Theatre Company, under the direction of Mr. E.H. Hehmers, that ventured this rather ambitious undertaking.</p>
   <p>For most of the players, the job was a little too much. This criticism may seem to be too severe, but we say it in an advisory manner, remembering the old adage about punishing those that we love, and we do love the theatre. We believe it would be wiser for the theatre company to present a Swedish play for a Swedish-American audience, because the latter is not properly receptive to Shakespeare's works.</p>

   <p>"The Taming of the Shrew" is written in rhymed and blank verse, which adds to the difficulties of the actors. Some of the best witticisms were entirely lost, partly because some of the actors lacked the declamatory finesse to get them across, and thus do justice to the play.</p>
