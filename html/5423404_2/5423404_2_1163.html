   <p>The Oriental Labyrinth Company is the name of a new undertaking incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois. Officers of the new company are: H.J. Reiling, president; Oscar J. Nelson, vice-president; Wm. F. Olson, secretary; T. E. Pierson, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the company is to purchase and ship from Stockholm, Sweden, to Chicago a Swedish invention called a "mirror labyrinth" intended for amusement. This labyrinth consists of a multitude of mirrored corridors, through which the visitor is supposed to find his way out. The special arrangements of the mirrors create false perspectives, however, and the visitor becomes utterly confused - and amused. Pillars, statues and palms, placed variously throughout, add to the confusion. A special pavilion will be built on a site already selected, on Wabash Avenue near the Auditorium.</p>
   <p>The designer of the labyrinth, Architect Sundell, will accompany the shipment from Stockholm for the purpose of supervising its assemblage here.</p>
