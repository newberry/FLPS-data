   <p>So far we have given you only baritone singers in this series, but today you will meet a tenor. It used to be that a man had to be a tenor in order to rate as a real singer, and honor and acclaim were showered upon him, while a mere baritone or bass received no such attention. In fact, it was hardly considered worth-while to make any special effort to develop this kind of voice. However, that was a long time ago, and in this day and age, we realize that each type of voice has its place, its value depending upon purity of tone and proper training, as well as on its owner's artistic talent, such as his ability to interpret and present various compositions. Yet, even today the tenors seem to be the favorites; this is partly due to the fact that we have comparatively few first-rate singers of this classification. Also within Chicago's Swedish-American singing circles has this scarcity of fine tenors been felt; but we have had a few, and one of them is William Dahlen. He ranks high among singers in Chicago, and we shall here briefly review his life and work.</p>
   
   <p>He was born in Timmelhed parish, Vestergotland, Sweden, February 14, 1862, and left home at the age of eighteen, bound for Chicago.</p>
   <p>Here he began the study of music and singing in 1882 and kept at it for several years. Among his teachers were Signor Caroto, Harding, Baker, and Towne, all well-known names in Chicago's musical world. He also studied at The Chicago Musical College. He has been an active singer since 1882, when he organized one of the oldest Swedish choirs here, the Lyran Song Club, and a little later, the well-known Orion Quartet. At present, he is a member of The Svithiod Singing Club, The Swedish Glee Club, and an honorary member of The Sons of Svea, of Rockford, Illinois.</p>
   <p>For many years, Mr. Dahlen has been a soloist in several of the city's "American" churches, and at present is solo singer and choir leader in the Swedish Immanuel church. He also directs the Lyran and Norden song Clubs of Pullman, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dahlen is a much traveled man, having visited his beloved fatherland three times since he first came here. He has traveled extensively in England, Scotland, and Germany, as well as in this country. In 1887, he participated in the Swedish-American singers' tour of Sweden, and was one of the tenors who sang before King Oscar.</p>
   <p>Dahlen is undoubtedly the outstanding Swedish-American tenor of today. His voice has great volume and characteristic tone color; it is particularly well suited for lyrical compositions.</p>
   <p>At the end of our interview, he said about himself: "I cannot judge whether or not I have done anything of lasting value for my countrymen in America, but what little I may have accomplished is the result of sincere effort and a deep felt veneration for the traditions in song and music which we have inherited from the land of the midnight sun."</p>
