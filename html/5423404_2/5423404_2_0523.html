   <p>In the New York Herald recently appeared an article, in which the Swedish girls were given great praise for their adaptability and fine qualities as domestic servants. Most of our Swedish-American newspapers have reprinted the article and commented upon it. Even a Norwegian paper here in Chicago, "Norden", has commented upon the article in question, in part as follows: "It is to be pointed out, however, that neither the young women nor the young men from our Scandinavian countries come here with a view to remaining merely good domestic servants, or in subordinated positions. They set out with hopes and determination to make their fortunes and gain such positions in life as they can rightfully claim by virtue of their ability, honesty and industriousness".</p>
   <p>It can not be denied that our lassies from home make excellent domestics, but undoubtedly this is the reason why they also make excellent housewives. under no circumstance do the sons and daughters of our nationality intend to remain on the bottom rungs of the ladder. Surely, even if somewhat slowly, they are working towards higher levels. And it is our guess that, if the children born here of Swedish parents do not go altogether wrong, the day will come, as it already has come to pass in the State of Pennsylvania, when it generally will be thought an honor and a privilege to have Swedish blood in one's veins.</p>
