   <p>It has been a real pleasure for us to mention-from time to time- in the columns of our paper, those among our countrymen who have succeeded in forcing their way forward to social standing and economic independence. We shall continue to rejoice in their good fortune and to announce their deeds of peace time to all within reach of our paper.</p>
   <p>Among those whom we have reason to be proud of are the brothers, Henry and John Ericsson, owners of Chicago's largest building contract firm. In <span class="page-break">2</span>these days it is of no small significance to be the largest Swedish firm in the branch of industry mentioned, but to surpass even American firms is of far greater significance.</p>
   <p>Before the younger brother entered the firm, Henry Ericsson was in company with Mr. Lindquist, and we Swedes could boast of the fact that the firm erected the first thirteen-story building (Monon) in Chicago, and, shortly afterwards, the first sixteen-story building (Manhattan). Eight years ago this firm was dissolved, and Henry took his brother in as partner. In three weeks the new firm will have finished the world's largest warehouse; it is being constructed on lots 462-506 Illinois Street, and it is six stories in height. For wages alone, in connection with the construction of this building, one thousand dollars is required per day.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Mr. Ericsson is also engaged in erecting a $100,000 building at the corner of 20 Street and Indiana Avenue; it is being built for the Western Banknote and Engraving Company. Throughout the year, the Ericsson firm gives employment to between three hundred and four hundred men, most of these being bricklayers and helpers. The specialty of the firm is erecting factory buildings, warehouses, and other industrial buildings, and on the West Side one finds large districts exclusively occupied by factory buildings, constructed by the Ericsson firm.</p>
   <p>In spite of the progress made by the Ericssons, they have not succumbed to the evil spirits of pride. The two brothers are the same splendid Swedish boys that we knew before they advanced so far. Born in Smaland, Sweden, on the Thorp estate, which belonged to his father at the time <span class="page-break">4</span>and is still owned by the family, Henry Ericsson came to America about twenty-five years ago. John came at a considerably later date. The boys did not come empty-handed, thanks to their father.Mr. Ericsson had found a rich deposit of iron ore on his estate. Together with a brother and another relative he built the well-known Thorp Iron Works, which later were sold to a corporation in which the Ericsson family hold part of the stock. The Thorp Iron Works are said to be worth about one million crowns at the present time, and we would not be at all surprised to learn that Henry and John each own a similar amount.</p>
   <p>It may be added that the Ericsson firm prefers to employ Swedes, for, as <span class="page-break">5</span>the senior brother stated, Swedes are the best workers to be found, and it would be difficult to find even one large building under construction where the foreman is not a Swede.</p>
