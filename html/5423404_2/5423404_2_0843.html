   <p>Bror G. Dahlberg, inventor of the synthetic or artificial building material named, Celotex, and president of the Celotex Company, has announced that his concern has made arrangements to erect a plant in Australia for the manufacture of the material. The present plant in New Orleans, La., is not large enough to supply much more than the domestic demand and very little for export, since the sales of Celotex increased from 32,000,000 feet in 1923 to 80,000,000 feet in 1924.</p>
   <p>Celotex is a chemical product made from bagasse, which is the refuse from sugar cane after the sugar has been extracted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dahlberg, who maintains offices and headquarters here in Chicago, was born in Kristianstad, Sweden, in 1881.</p>
