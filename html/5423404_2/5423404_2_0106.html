   <p>John A. Linn, convicted ex-Clerk of Cook County Circuit Court, was taken to Joliet yesterday to serve his sentence. Early in the afternoon, accompanied by his sons and Attorneys Forest and Rosenthal, he appeared before Judge Dupuy again applying for a new trial, without avail.</p>
   <p>Linn looked ill, ready to collapse, though he did not say a word when Jailer Whitman took him away.</p>
