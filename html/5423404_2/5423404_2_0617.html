   <p>Who can, at least in the midst of the harvest time, forget the splendid Swedish-American farmer? Mr. editor, you should have traveled through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Colorado during the past week. Had you done this, then your whole warm-hearted soul would have flowered into an expanded enthusiasm for farming; for the countryside and for our farmers, whose friend your newspaper has always been. Glorious land, glorious harvests. God of our fathers be thanked for all.</p>
