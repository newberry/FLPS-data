   <p>The great registration day has passed without any disorder, but so great a number sought to register that some "Boards" had to ask that registrants return on some day certain to be registered. To fight is the nature of man. But even those who do not like to fight, or see others do so, must nevertheless, voice their satisfaction in this great registration.</p>
   <p>Our opinion regarding the War Loan, is, that it will be quality oversubscribed. Should this prediction not prove true, we would say that it would not be due to a lack of patriotism, but rather to the fact that the people as a whole do not want war.</p>
   <p>One need only recall the remarks of Mr. Charles G. Daves, banker,who has said:"Give him a blow and let him lie there!" referring to those who do not wish to by Government Bonds. Such patriots as Mr. Dawes should not be countenanced.</p>
