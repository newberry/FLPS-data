   <p>The entertainment given last Saturday at Schiller Hall by the Linnea Ladies' Quartette was a success.</p>
   <p>The Quartette sang J. A. Ahlstrom's "March of the Singers," C. P. Vahlin's "Drive into the Storm," and Lindblad's "Nature and the Heart." The Bellman Mandolin Club assisted in splendid fashion, and Miss Helga Hakanson, who possesses a fine Swedish sense of humor, sang a few ditties that made the audience laugh.</p>
   <p>Mr. Axel Ahlstedt gave an interesting lecture on "The Power of Music." It was regretted that on account of the late hour it was necessary for him to cut short his lecture. The final number on the program was a successful pantomime from "Ljungbyhorn."</p>
   <p>After the program, there was dancing.</p>
