   <p>Our well-known countryman, Captain A. Lofstrom, has just received a large consignment of new books from Sweden for his bookstore on Clark Street. During his visit in Sweden last summer, Mr. Lofstrom made large purchases of books representing the best in modern Swedish literature. They arrived a few days ago in fifteen large boxes, weighing altogether five tons. This is the largest consignment of its kind ever to pass through the Chicago customs house, and the Captain declares, and we believe it, that the contents of the books are as weighty as their bulk.</p>
   <p>Captain Lofstrom's bookstore is widely known for its well-stocked shelves, on which one may find a fine selection of good, modern literature, and its latest acquisitions will be welcomed by its patrons.</p>
