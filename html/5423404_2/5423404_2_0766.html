   <p>Our well-known countryman, surgeon, and head physician of Bethesda Hospital, formerly of Augustana Hospital, Dr. O. E. Wald, was recently appointed chief physician and surgeon of the new Lincoln Hospital.</p>
   <p>The president of the Lincoln Hospital is Dr. B. S. Henderson, from the Lake Side Hospital; the secretary is Dr. J. A. Raithel, from the Cook County Hospital. The new hospital is the most up - to - date and well-appointed hospital in Chicago. The Swedes in Chicago may well exult at the choice of one of their countrymen as president of this institution. The hospital is located at 500 LaSalle Avenue, near Lincoln Park.</p>
