   <p>A subscriber from Minnesota has asked us to call to the attention of all our women readers the fact that thirty-nine state legislatures have now granted pensions to single mothers who have young children to provide for. We are glad to comply with the request, even though this subject has repeatedly been discussed on our pages.</p>
   <p>Our correspondent points out that in many states the pension is being paid until the children reach the age of sixteen or seventeen. The state of Minnesota grants fifteen dollars per month for the oldest child, and ten dollars for the younger ones.</p>
   <p>She goes on to say that many Swedish-American mothers, being rather bashful and also proud, fail to apply for this pension, and would rather suffer privation than ask for help. We want to assure such mothers that the pension does not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>represent charity at all. It is the right of the children, determined by law, and no mother in needy circumstances should deprive them of this privilege. The purpose of the pension is to take care of children who have no father to support them, and enable their mother to give them as good an upbringing as possible in their own home; thus keeping the family together instead of allowing it to become scattered among strangers.</p>
   <p>Mothers who are eligible for this pension owe it both to themselves and to their children to apply for it. It certainly is no disgrace for them to secure decent living conditions and the proper upbringing of their children in this manner.</p>
   <p>This aid given by the state often saves the children from having to go to an orphanage or to some other charitable institution. Such places, no matter how well they are run, can never take the place of a family home, be it ever so humble.</p>
   <p>If, as our friend from Minnesota states, many eligible Swedish-American mothers neglect their duty by failing to apply for the pension, we can only say that it <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is a most deplorable situation. They are actually doing an injustice to themselves, to their children, and even to society as a whole. It is in the interest of the latter that the youngest generation be well taken care of, for upon it rest our hopes for the future of the race.</p>
