   <p>Other nationalities have contributed less than a half million each. Under the heading of "Miscellaneous" are listed $43,988,400, subscribed to by persons of foreign birth or descent, which could not be classified under any nationality. Further, as "Unclassified," are listed $66,272,600., and as "Late Subscriptions," $21,478,900. How much of these sums should be accredited Swedish-Americans' accounts is impossible to say, we know, however, that many subscribed for large amounts as Americans without stating their nationality.</p>
