   <p>On Thursday April 30, a century had passed since the agreement was signed by which Napoleon, as First consul of the French republic, ceded to the United States the so-called Louisiana Territory. The lands which in this manner came to belong to the new American republic were of great extent. It included all the land situated between Mississippi River and Rocky Mountains, with the exception of the Spanish possessions in the present day Texas, Colorado, etc. At the time, the extent of this new territory was not known.</p>

   <p>It was thought, however, that most of it consisted of an unexplored desert. The number of inhabitants, not including the Indians, was estimated at 90,000; 20,000 of whom were slaves.</p>
   <p>The amount paid to France by the United States was $15,000,000, an enormous amount, according to the estimates of the day, and, in spite of the great extent of the territory, its undoubted fertility, and its great possibilities, the whole affair was considered by many as not a good bargain at all, and it is doubtful if the deal would have been entered into except for the fear of the English by the leading statesmen in Washington. Chiefly to prevent the latter from getting in possession of the territory in question, our government decided to buy the land.</p>

   <p>Now we know the type of bargain which was made when this deal was concluded one hundred years ago. Out of the territory acquired from France at the time mentioned, no less than fourteen states of the Union have been cut out of the land acquired from France. More than 15,000,000 people are now living there, and the natural resources seem in general to be nearly inexhaustible. More than one half of the wheat production of our country comes from the old Louisiana Territory. Last year, the corn production of Iowa alone was estimated as of a value of more than six times the price, $15,000,000, paid for the whole Territory. Another state which was cut out of the land in question has added more than one billion dollars to the national property value in treasures hidden below the earth's surface. These are facts to be noted. It is natural, therefore that the whole nation now, after a century has passed, should congratulate itself at having had at that time a statesman wise enough to conclude the deal in spite of all the protests presented at the time.</p>

   <p>The centennial of the Louisiana Territory purchase is now being celebrated impressively, in a manner magnificent in every way. Last Thursday, the formal opening of the St. Louis Exhibition took place, an exhibition which promises to constitute a worthy celebration of the Louisiana Territory Purchase Centennial.</p>
