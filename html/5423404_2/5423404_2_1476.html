   <p>At the art exhibit which was recently held in Minneapolis, our well-known countryman, Charles E. Hallberg of Chicago, was represented with a number of marine paintings. Seven of them were sold, one of which brought the price of $350.</p>
   <p>It has been gratifying to follow Mr. Hallberg's progress. He has now definitely "arrived".</p>
