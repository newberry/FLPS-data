   <p>The poor man's burden is the upper class. For this class the poor man gives his health and his hope, his past, his present, his future. In regard to this class, he becomes a slave instead of an equal. For the benefit of this class, the poor man is being suppressed. For the sake of this class, his highest wishes, his best manhood, his mind's ennobling ideals are stultified. But in spite of this, it is better to be the poor man with his burden than the rich man with his conscience.</p>
