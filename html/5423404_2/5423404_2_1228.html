   <p>The Stockholm Concert Company, is a newly organized music quartet which has already made its debut before the American public, but has not as yet appeared before our Swedish population. This quartet will give a concert Sunday evening May 12, in the Grand Salon of the Swedish Club. For other details of this concert will be announced. We wish, however, to point out, that this quartet is composed of ladies, and if their music is as attractive as the representatives, who on Tuesday honored the editor with a visit - we predict the Swedish Club's quarters will prove entirely inadequate to accomodate the throng, which will be present at this "music premiere" among the Swedish population of Chicago.</p>
