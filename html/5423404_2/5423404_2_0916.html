   <p>The art of organ building-as old as it is-has gone forward in double-quick pace during the last ten years. The introduction of electric power has opened unexpected possibilities in the domain of organ technique. We read that a few days ago, the world's largest all electric transmission organ has been installed in the Palace Church in the capital city of Sweden. And we were especially exultant to read that the inventor of this organ was Swedish Director J. Johansson, of Akerman and Lund's new organ factory at home. The organ is revolutionary, we decided we should give this joyous information to one of our most outstanding specialists in this country, Mr. J. P. Seeburg, chief of the J. P. Seeburg Piano Company, and head of Seeburg and Smith's magnificent organ building company in Chicago.</p>
   <p>After a talk with him, our admiration for the Swedish invention fell considerably.</p>
   
   <p>We are told that Director Johansson's invention is by no means new. Seeburg and Smith has manufactured similar organs for a number of years. The company has made great progress in this field.</p>
   <p>The first Swedish church in this country to install an organ similar to the one in the Palace Church of Stockholm, was the Ebenezer Church, at Foster Avenue and Paulina Street in Chicago. Since then, many other churches have purchased electric transmission organs.</p>
   <p>The new principle in these electrical organs is called "The Unified System." This invention is undeniably great and revolutionary. But the honor does not go to Sweden, but to England. The rights to the invention were obtained a number of years ago by Mr. Seeburg and his firm. The company has since greatly developed the invention. Seeburg and Smith now manufacture electrical transmission organs which set forth complete orchestral effects. The organist at the keyboard is "the leader of the band." Hundreds of organs of this kind are sold yearly to first class theatres in this country,and in South America, and other countries.</p>
   <p>The concert organ in the Ebenezer Church cost $12,000, but the price of an orchestral organ starts at $15,000, and ranges upward to $100,000, and more, depending on the number of instruments one wishes the organ to "manage." We visited the company's display hall, 1004 Republic Building, and heard an organ demonstrated, which, besides being an ordinary concert organ, was also an orchestral organ, reproducing intonations of such instruments as violin, clarinet, flute, harp, violincello, piano, cornet, chimes, etc. This instrument is a true miracle of inventive ability. Seated at the keyboard, the player may bring forth the tones of a violin or cello solo, with piano or harp accompaniment, or other arrangements.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seeburg is now manufacturing a self-playing orchestral organ. This is built on about the same principle as the orchestral organ mentioned. It uses paper rolls like the ordinary player-piano. It is operated by electrical power. These self-playing orchestral organs, primarily designed for movie houses, reproduce the music without the mechanical and annoying bi-sounds, which appear in the music of the ordinary player-piano. This and the other inventions are the work of Mr. Seeburg and his assistants, and thus, can be said to be Swedish-American. For it should, of course, be known to the majority that Mr. Seeburg is Swedish. He was born in 1871, in Gothenburg, and came here at the age of fifteen with "two empty hands," as the old saying goes. At the present time his enterprise is the leader in its field. The firm's main office, factories, and display halls are located in Chicago, but a branch office has been maintained in New York for a number of years, and there are branches in other cities throughout the country.</p>
