   <p>Charles E. Hallberg, Chicago's eminent Swedish marine painter, has recently obtained copyrights for his paintings; he is the first Western artist to be granted such rights. Mr. Hallberg intends to sell reproduction rights to some of the largest corporations in America.</p>
   <p>More than fifty-four thousand people have viewed Hallberg's masterpieces, on display at the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>A dozen of his paintings have already been sold at very good prices, and other sales will take place after the Institute exhibit. During September Mr. Hallberg will take an extended trip seeking desirable scenes for his future productions. Considering what he already has done, we eagerly look forward to seeing his future painting treasures.</p>
