   <p>In another place in this issue we are reporting on the observance of the fifteenth anniversary of the Union Bank of Chicago, and we will here present two of its officers, Charles E. Schlytern, president, and Gustaf Hallbom, vice-president.</p>
   <p>The Union Bank of Chicago was organized as a state bank, and is thus subjected to inspection by the state. It offers its patrons all the various services available in a modern bank, and it is, of course, imperative that capable and experienced men be in charge of each department. In this connection it is worth noting that several of the men who were active in establishing this institution are still directing its activities. That is the case with the president and the vice-president.</p>

   <p>Charles E. Schlytern was born in Norrbotten, near Lulea, Sweden, January 17, 1853, and graduated from college in Lulea in 1871. That same year he came to America, and after having moved about for a couple of years he finally came to Chicago, where he worked as a bookkeeper, credit man, and bank cashier. At the time when the Union Bank was organized he was in business as a real estate broker.</p>
   <p>Gustaf Hallbom, who was the bank's first treasurer, was born in the city of Lulea, Sweden, Apr. 16, 1865. He is, perhaps, better known among Chicago's Swedish population than any of the other officers of the Union Bank. In the first place, his work in the bank has brought him in personal contact with a large number of people, and, in addition, he has been very active within Swedish organizations in this city for more than twenty-five years. He is an enthusiastic singer, and, as most men of the singing fraternity, is a good mixer. He is a valiant champion of any deserving Swedish cause, and his friends are legion.</p>
