   <p>All the big nations and the majority of the small ones are up to their necks in debts which they contracted for the purposes of conducting war or preparing for war against other powers. Nevertheless, most countries are right now spending immense sums on armaments in preparation for "the next war," in spite of the fact that the money thus appropriated is desperately needed for social improvements in many fields. As one observes this evil and illogical situation, one must come to the conclusion that it is caused by lust for power, suspicion, jealousy, and fear.</p>
   <p>The situation is truly deplorable, and most people can see no good reason why such conditions should be permitted to exist. It is generally assumed that it is the governments, or those who control government policies, that cause wars to break out. That is certainly true, but it is not the whole truth. The lust for power is found among individuals in all classes of society. The war fever is not confined to the ruling class, but it usually takes well-directed propaganda to make it acute among the masses. Only through education, and by convincing the people that war serves no good purpose, can this scourge of mankind be prevented and eradicated. The greatest obstacle lies in the fact that even though the majority of nations want peace, there are still some that do not want it. They despise peace, and keep their neighbors in constant fear and insecurity, thus forcing them to arm and remain prepared for war. An effort must be made to make these disturbers of peace and security change their attitude.</p>
   <p>It is most regrettable that civilized humanity must always stand ready to take to arms as soon as disagreements occur. Surely it must be possible to substitute peaceful negotiations for devastating war. Peaceful means do exist, but before they can be generally accepted, nations must divest themselves of false pride and lust for power.</p>
