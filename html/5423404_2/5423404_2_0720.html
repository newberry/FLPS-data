   <p>This week we have the pleasure of presenting to our readers a countryman who in the profession of medicine is serving his fellow men, many of whom are grateful to him for the aid he has given them. We refer to the Swedish doctor, J. M. Axelson, and in the following we shall give you a few biographical facts about him.</p>
   <p>He was born on December 17, 1871, in Ostre Broby, Sweden. In 1889 he emigrated to America, and came directly to Chicago where he took up the study of medicine, graduating in 1900. After having served as an interne in the County Hospital for two years, until 1902, he moved to Austin, where he went into private practice, which became very extensive as the years passed. He enjoys a fine reputation as a doctor, and his personality is of the kind that invites confidence. At the same time he is of the modest type that does not care for the spotlight.</p>
   <p>Swedish in heart and soul, Dr. Axelson takes an active part in Swedish-American activities. He is particularly interested in literature and art, and Swedish-American artists count him among their benefactors.</p>
   <p>He has done much in behalf of the Swedish Tuberculosis Sanitarium in Denver, Colorado, and it was chiefly due to his and Mrs. Axelson's efforts that the painting donated to the Sanitarium by Charles E. Hallberg brought close to four hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>His wife was the former Miss Anna Peterson. They were married in 1904 and have one son. Their home is at 840 North Laramie Avenue, Austin.</p>
   <p>Dr. Axelson is the examining physician for many Swedish societies and fraternal orders, such as the Svithiod, Viking, Odd Fellows, and the Society Kronan. He is on the staff of the West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park and a member of the Chicago Medical Society, Illinois Medical Society, and the American Medical Society. He is also a Free Mason and belongs to the Swedish Club. His church is the Swedish Lutheran Church of Moreland, in the activities of which he takes an active interest.</p>
