   <p>The new water tunnel under Wilson Avenue, designed and constructed by the City Engineer, John Ericson, will be ready for use July 1. Through this tunnel, the North and West sides of the city will be supplied with water. This tunnel is bored through several miles of solid rock, an undertaking considered by many technicians to be impossible. However, Mr. Ericson seems to have accomplished the impossible.</p>
   <p>The preliminary work started April 1913, and the tunnel work on September 1914. The tunnel reaches from Mayfair in the west, to the lake shore in the east, a distance of seven miles with a diameter of seven feet.</p>
   <p>In the construction 865,420 sacks of cement were used, and 517,440 cubic yards of rock were excavated. The east of the crib has been estimated at $4,550,870. The pumping station in Mayfair will have a daily capacity of 152 million gallons.</p>
