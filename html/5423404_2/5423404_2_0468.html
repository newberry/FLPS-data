   <p>Stories of the life of Theodore Roosevelt, who has just died, are without doubt of great interest. Our opinion regarding his administration is a thing apart. Here we have nothing to say in connection with what we said previously. Roosevelt was a clever politician, but not particularly a good statesman. His love for the country was greatly praised, and one of his greatest accomplishments was to split the Republican Party and make possible the election of the Democratic President Woodrow Wilson during the most critical times in the history of the United States. Those who consider this accomplishment useful to our country have every reason to praise Theodore Roosevelt and mourn his passing, which undoubtedly is a thing that will bring about a feeling in the Republican ranks that nothing else could have accomplished. And in this connection, we wish to quote the old maxim, "Regarding the dead, nothing but good."</p>
