   <p>The Apex Appliance Company is a progressive concern which about one year ago be an the manufacture of the Apex Washing machine invented by our countryman, C.W. Swanson, who is also the founder and president of the company.</p>
   <p>The machine has attracted much attention all over the country and, if one may judge by results so far obtained, the company is well on its way to become one of the largest of its kind in America. One of the leading department stores in Chicago has been demonstrating the machine for some time, and sales are mounting. From firms in other parts of the country orders are coming in for as many as 1,500 units in one shipment.</p>
   <p>The machine has been exhibited in the largest cities of the country, and Mr. Swanson informs us that it will also be on display at the electrical exposition which will be held in Chicago next January.</p>
   
   <p>The machine comes in two models, one operated by hand and one by electricity. The owners of this company are all Swedish-Americans whose ambition is to make it the greatest washing machine manufacturing concern in America.</p>
