   <p>Our countryman, the machinist Ernst. R. Malmberg of 217 West Congress Street, has invented a letter-stamping machine, which last week was approved by the local post office and reports very fine results. Mr. Malmberg has been working on his invention for almost six years.</p>
   <p>Among other things his machine has an automatic mechanism, which changes ciphers every minute during the stamping operation. In this way the time of stamping is secured on every letter. Two persons have quite enough to do to feed the machine because 800 letters a minute or 48,000 per hour is its rate of speed.</p>
