   <p>The Swedish concert season for the year will open on the 24th of this month at Orchestra Hall with a musical event which will overshadow similar events of all preceding years. For several months intence activity has been going on to make this concert a success and the public may expect great surprises. Already early last spring did the violinist F. Frederikson conceive the idea of gathering in one organization the most outstanding musical talent of Scandinavian blood to be found anywhere in this country. The purpose of this organization would be to form an orchestra to bring in a worthy manner the musical art of the Scandinavian people before the American public.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frederikson is a man who understands how to realize a good idea. "The Scandinavian American Orchestra" is a reality. About forty people, all masters on their specific instruments, are members of the orchestra the name of which is "The Scandinavian American Orchestra". Mr. Frederikson is acting as the leader, and we are running no risk in predicting the orchestra a bright future.</p>

   <p>The program for the concert at Orchestra Hall on October 24, will include compositions by the great masters, Grieg, Alvin, Palmgren, and others. Grieg will be represented in world-known composition "Sigurd Jorsalfarer", and Alvin in his great work "Midsummer Wake", perhaps the most beautiful of any Swedish musical creations. The Danish composition, Fini Henrique's overture from the orchestra suite "Volund" will without a doubt win the admiration of the public. In addition, a piano-concerto, "The River", by Palmgren is to be played by the pianist Miss Marie Bergesen who, before the world war won fame in Paris as a pianist of rank. But - and here we are to announce probably the greatest attraction of the concert - we have saved the best to the end. As singers for the concert Mme. Marie Sundelius and the famous Swedish opera barytone Oscar Bergstrom have been engaged.</p>
   <p>Much has been written in the newspapers about Mme. Sundelius, and all of it in praise. A summary of all the statements in the press might be condensed into two words"The Divine". Her wonderful voice caught hold of the great American public all the way from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and now she is going to awaken this public to the appeal of the most beautiful of our Northern music.</p>

   <p>Oscar Bergstrom is new to the Chicago Public, but we are ready to guarantee his acceptance when heard. Mr. Bergstrom holds the love of the public in Stockholm, and everywhere his singing takes hold of his public.</p>
   <p>So much for the splendid program. In conclusion a word about the leader of the whole. Mr. Frederiksen is born in Frederikshold Norway, was one of the most noted students at the conservatory at Leipzig, and lately studied with the world famous master Sauret in Berlin and in London. He has been connected with the famous concert orchestra in Europe, thus he was first violinist of Lamoreux orchestra in Paris. He is considered one of the foremost masters of the violin in America.</p>
