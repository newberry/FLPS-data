   <p>During the past four years Hedwig Brusell-Melinder has been with the Swedish Theatrical Company, being during all that time their leading representative in the younger roles; in fact, she is an outstanding favorite among the Swedes.</p>
   <p>Hedwig Brusell-Melinder will soon leave Chicago to take up her residence in Stockholm, and her last performance here will be in the role of "Agnes Brand," in Johan Jolin's Masterpiece, "Lojen and Torar," to be given next Sunday, Feb. 16. It is possible that she will avail herself of this occasion to say good-bye to the theater-going Swedes of Chicago.</p>
