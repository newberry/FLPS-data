   <p>The National Child Labor Committee has made a discovery which places the foreign-born population of this country in a favorable light as compared with native Americans, and which must be rather discouraging for the supporters of Know-nothingism. A report recently submitted by the Committee shows that the greatest percentage of illiterates in America are not to be found in the highly industrialized States, with their large foreign-born population, but in the States where the great majority of the people are native Americans, who make their living by tilling the soil.</p>
   <p>The foreign born now constitute 14.7 per cent of our total population, but only 2.9 per cent in the sixteen states in which illiteracy is most common. In many country districts, a large number of people are unable to read and write, according to the report, and the chief reasons for this are the short school term and <span class="page-break">2</span>the fact that many parents take their children out of school and put them to work on the farm or in the home.</p>
   <p>The Committee finds the situation highly lamentable, and recommends the establishment of more modern schools, strict enforcement of the compulsory attendance law, and, in general, more efficient welfare work among these underprivileged children.</p>
