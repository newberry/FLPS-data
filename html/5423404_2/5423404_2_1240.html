   <p>Mr. William Dahlen died last Friday at the Augustana Hospital. He is survived by his wife and daughter, three brothers, and other relatives.</p>
   <p>He was born in Sweden in 1862, and emigrated to Chicago in 1880. Dahlen was a member of many societies, among them: the King Oscar Lodge of the Masons, Royal Arcanum, Svithiod, and Viking. He was a singer, and a singing director, which he regarded above anything else. He had organized the Lyran Singing Club and the Orion quartette, and was a leader for the Swedish Glee Club and Norden Singing Society until his illness two weeks ago made it impossible to direct the singers.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Herman Lindskog conducted the funeral service last Monday. The Glee Club, the Chicago Sextet, and the Swedish National Chorus, sang at the services..</p>
