   <p>Mr. Oscar Nelson, the young and very capable Swedish-American violinist, is attracting ever increasing attention and is being accorded praise from a number of musical authorities..... Several of Chicago's most outstanding music critics have predicted a great future for this seventeen-year-old Swedish-American. Signor Costello, one of the prominent musicians in Chicago, has been so enamored with the playing of the young man that he has presented him with a very costly Guarnerius violin, made in 1760, the same violin used by Ole Bull when he played at the Central Music Hall in 1880.</p>
   <p>The youthful Mr. Nelson has also shown great ability as a composer. In the concerts he will give in various cities in this State during the latter part of the month, he will include two of his own compositions on the program..... We believe the young Mr. Nelson will become famous in the world of music.</p>
