   <p>Last Saturday night the sixteenth annual Art exhibit in the Swedish Club was opened with a program of song, music, and speeches in the presence of a large audience of artists and art patrons. A committee headed by Herbert R. Hedman has charge of this year's show, and the arrangements, including the lighting system, are laudable in every respect. All the art objects are placed against a flattering background which does justice to them, and the efforts of the arrangements committee are sure to meet the approval of both the public and the artists themselves.</p>
   <p>The catalogue lists a hundred and ten pieces, fourteen of which are sculptures. But more than two hundred items were submitted for acceptance, so it is evident that the jury had no easy job making its selections.</p>
   <p>Axel Linus, who is probably the most versatile of Chicago's Swedish artists, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>exhibits several paintings. The portrait of his artist friend, Fred Spolander, is very well done, as is his miniature, "The Idealist," but the latter might well have been done on a somewhat larger scale. His still life ranks among the finest things in the entire exhibit.</p>
   <p>Martin Lundgren, who is best known as a landscape painter, is this time represented by a portrait, "Mr. Houston". It is a good painting, but it produces an impression of hardness.</p>
   <p>J. Theo. Johnson is taking part in a Swedish-American art show for the first time, and his work is attracting well-deserved attention. He belongs to the modern school, and regardless of what one thinks of that particular tendency in Art, one is struck by the genuineness and force in his work. He possesses an excellent color sense, and there is something attractively mysterious and exotic in his paintings. His "Music and Mode" is among the outstanding canvases of the show.</p>

   <p>Irving C. Christenson, the son of Dr. Carl Christenson, pastor of the Saron Swedish Lutheran congregation, is still young, and is also of the modern school. He exhibits two portraits. "Iago" is a forceful canvas, and indicates a fine sense of color. His "The Crinoline" is a delicate little painting.</p>
   <p>Edward C. Carlson is represented by five very fine miniature portraits, one of which is of Mrs. Herbert C. Hedman. Among the other portrait painters that deserve mention are Webster C. Kullberg, Mary C. Peterson, and Earl Smith. It is evident that the latter has been influenced by Sanzen, even though his choice of colors is quite different.</p>
   <p>There are many aquarelles this time, fifteen in all. Thomas Hall exhibits two: "The Old Willow Tree," and "Summer Night," and both of them are very good. Several out-of-town artists are represented in this group, among them Hugo Hoffsten, who is now living in California. He exhibits two very fine aquarelles with motifs from that sunny state. Another out-of-towner is Einar Lundquist, of Rockford, Illinois. His five water colors are typical of this artist.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The landscape group is also quite numerous, Gotthilf Ahlman's "Dunes Park" is a warm and airy painting, which makes one want to leave the city and spend some time among the dunes.</p>
   <p>Of Alfred Jansson's three canvases, we like "Evening" the best. It is an autumn scene. His "Early Snow" is also quite good. Carl E. Wallin exhibits two paintings, "Atlantis" and "Winter". The former is undoubtedly the best this artist has ever done, and that is saying a good deal. It ranks among the best, technically as well as purely artistically.</p>
   <p>Birger Sanzen's "Red Rocks of Moab," "By the Sea," and "Aspens in Autumn," are the works of a master. He is in a class by himself.</p>
   <p>Of Carl Linden's "Neglected Farm House" and "Heavy Skies," the latter is by far the better, though the former is not bad at all. Signe Palmblad's "Winter-Sweden" is really fine. Carl G. T. Olson also exhibits a landscape called "Winter", in which, in our opinion, the brown color is too predominant.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Carl O. Erickson's "Rock Harbor in Moonlight" is a beautiful painting,full of fine sentiment; it ranks among the best he has ever done.</p>
   <p>There are a few canvases with motifs from Sweden, and among them are Anne Anderson's "Kristineberg Mill-Sweden," which is a little too rich in color; Carl J. Nordmark's "March Day in Sweden," a very fine painting; and Gustaf Dalstrom's "Street Scene" from Visby.</p>
   <p>There are not many marine paintings in the exhibit this time. Among the best are Charles E. Hallberg's "Out on the Deep," and Leon Lundmark's "Sea and Sky".</p>
   <p>There are many other fine paintings in this year's exhibit, but we cannot cover them all, and the fact that they are not mentioned here must not be taken as an indication that they are without merit.</p>
   <p>The sculptures include some very fine work. Eight of them are done in wood, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>and we were particularly attracted by "The Letter from America," by Axel Farb, and "The Skipper," by Oscar Sjogren.</p>
   <p>The opening program consisted of songs by the Swedish Glee Club and the Orion Male Quartet. George F. Anderson, president of the Club, and Herbert R. Hedman, chairman of the arrangements committee of the exhibit, addressed the gathering.</p>
   <p>Prizes amounting to a total of one thousand dollars will be awarded next Sunday, which is the closing day.</p>
