   <p>The Swedish Theater Company presented last Saturday the play "The Soldier From Smoland" to a house only poorly filled, which was in sharp contrast to the play: "The Wedding in Ulfasa," just closed.</p>
   <p>The play is what is called a folk-play, centering about a well-to-do farmer's daughter and the alderman's son, with the Soldier "Hurtig," who is penniless, winning the girl...</p>
   <p>The play has a good cast and runs along in rollicking fashion, with plenty of laughs to make up for the pathos.</p>
   <p>Irrespective of the light turnout, the interest of the theater-goers was glued on the players, so there is hope that attendance will increase.</p>
