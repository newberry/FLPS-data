   <p>.....Thousands upon thousands of Swedes all over the United States.... have done business with Anders L. Lofstrom whose picture appears in today's issue of the Svenska Nyheter....Anders Lofstrom was born in Malmo, Sweden on October 30, 1864....At the age of ten he was given a job as cabin boy on a ship sailing the Baltic.....and thereafter for many years he sailed the seas. He came to America, and in Salem, Massachusetts he passed the shipmaster's examination before the Navigation Board. He soon received an appointment as the captain of a ship and for a number of years continued in this role... In 1880 Mr. Lofstrom came to Chicago, where he was given successive command of several ships.</p>

   <p>In the fall of 1895, Captain Lofstrom found that he had had enough of the sea air--at least for the time being....He settled in Chicago, where he started a cigar factory. His cigars were given the Swedish name Dalkullan. With his tireless energy and his business ability it did not take him long to win his way. After only one year he had gained economic security to such an extent that he resolved to marry. To his home, he brought Miss Mathilda Maria Larson, of Ulricehamn, [Sweden], to become his wife.</p>
   <p>To his factory he added a cigar store, a news agency, a bookstore, and a lending library. All of these business undertakings are progressing splendidly, situated as they are in the midst of the Swedish colony on the North Side. The address is 113 Oak Street.</p>
   <p>Since Lofstrom was only ten years old when he first went to sea, it is clear that his school training was not very extensive. For this reason, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it is all the more remarkable that he has an easy command of the Swedish language, both in prose and in poetry. He has written innumerable ditties and interesting stories about life at sea. He has even appeared in the role of dramatist, having written a monologue, "The Kitchen Boy", which has been reprinted in most of the Swedish papers and has been read to hundreds of audiences.</p>
   <p>In 1899 Mr. Lofstrom began the publication of his almanac and calendar, Dalkullan, which has found many thousands of readers every year. The almanac contains a large number of short stories and ditties.</p>
   <p>Closely connected with literary activity is the art of printing. In 1901 Mr. Lofstrom set up a press for the printing of books and business necessities. In this undertaking, his efforts were also crowned by success; from the very start he has been unable to keep abreast of the printing he has <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>been called upon to do....</p>
   <p>Captain Lofstrom is of a jovial temperament and has been much sought after in social life. He is a member of the Order of Masons..., the Order of Swedish Odd Fellows, the Order of Vikings, and, in addition, of several American clubs...</p>
   <p>Last year he visited Sweden and there made business connections with publishers, dealers in antiques, etc., so as to be able to fill any order from his many customers.</p>
