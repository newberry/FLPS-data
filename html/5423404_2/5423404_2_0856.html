   <p>During the coming summer, the Nelson-Wiggem Piano Company will erect a new factory building at 1731-45 Belmont Avenue, near Lincoln Avenue. The concern manufactures automatic pianos, and the old factory has become too small. The building will be erected by the construction firm of Ericsson &amp; Crumlich.</p>
   <p>The president of the Nelson-Wiggem Company is our countryman, Oscar Nelson, who was formerly associated with another large Chicago piano company.</p>
