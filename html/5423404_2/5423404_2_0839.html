   <p>Announcement was made a few days ago by the Drake Hotel management that our countryman, Erik Dahlberg, has been selected to fill the position of "Maitre d'hotel", at this fashionable hotel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dahlberg is no stranger to the Swedes of Chicago, and he is by no means a novice in the hotel business. In fact, the restaurant and hotel business has been his sphere of action for the last twenty-five years, and he is only forty-five years of age.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dahlberg was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He has been employed by the Drake Hotel, a number of years as head waiter.</p>
