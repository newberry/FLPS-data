   <p>A good many people seem to think that politics is of little or no interest to women and children, but this is, of course, an entirely wrong idea, inasmuch as we take pains to teach our children and to proclaim before the world that ours is a government of the people and for the people. We like to say that it is the people that rule, and that the representatives are elected for the express purpose of doing what the voters want them to do.</p>
   <p>The theory has a pleasant sound, but its practical applications are rather disappointing when we consider the behavior of Congress, the state legislatures, and our municipal administrations. For we are forced to admit that these bodies often demonstrate little or no regard for the people's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>wishes.</p>
   <p>We have all the implements required for popular rule, but the machinery does not function in a satisfactory manner due to the manipulations of certain public officials who are in politics for no other reason than to promote their own selfish interests. From the earliest days of this republic, we have had political parties, and the voters have voted for the candidates of one of these parties at all elections, municipal as well as national. He who had personal interests to promote would try to get his hands on the party machine, and if he could gain control of its nominations, he had the entire administration in his pocket.</p>
   <p>For a while it was possible for the independent element within the electorate to checkmate the majority party, if it became too corrupt, by giving its vote to the opposition, but in the course of time the greedy interests within the two major political parties, the Democratic and the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Republican, joined hands, and through this co-operation the voters are losing out no matter how they vote.</p>
   <p>The graft which is so common in our cities, and the exploitation of the public are possible because individuals and special interests control both the major parties and are able to place their henchmen in key positions.</p>
   <p>There is no essential difference between Democratic grafters in New York and Republican grafters in Philadelphia. We will not mention Chicago.</p>
