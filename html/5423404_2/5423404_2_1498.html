   <p>Augustinus Wallenberg is given "a big hand" by the Swedish Tribune today as a most welcome Swedish sculptor to Chicago. Two of his works are on exhibition in Abbotts art store on Madison St. One is a head of an old sailor and one is a head of a laughing young girl. "These works," says the Tribune," are both full of life and character, All his works are, we can say,'peculiar, in that they always reflect the master's peculiar genius."</p>
