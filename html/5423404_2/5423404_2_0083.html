   <p>Without a doubt, all coal companies that deliver coal to the various City departments will be investigated by the Grand Jury for criminal action. It is thought that they have received money under false pretenses. The December Grand Jury is already investigating, but most of the work will be done by the January Grand Jury. It is a disgrace the way the coal companies have conducted their affairs and cheated the City. It is certain that the City's purchasing agent who gave the contracts for delivery of coal will have something to do with the Grand Jury and the prosecutor before the investigation is completed. The McGovern's deal caused the investigation of all departments by the Merriam Committee that has sent in its report by B. F. Walton. All City departments have been subjected to severe criticism. There's only one man, however, of those connected with the Department of Purchasers who will be spared, and that is City Engineer John Eriscon. Walton says that Ericson was a little too easy going, which might be taken as a compliment in this case when all other parties of the transaction are to be brought before the Grand Jury. Assistant Chief <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Paul Riedske intends to resign it is said, and so will Chief John Hanberg.</p>
