   <p>The Swedish Choral Club has started its regular practice this week. The work of selecting and developing the best voice material from out of the rich supply to be found in the singing societies in Chicago is well under way, and the results so far have been very good. Singers of high voice quality are yet welcome, however. Information may be had from the secretary, Room 82, Auditorium Building.</p>
   <p>The Swedish Oratoria Society and Choral Club undoubtly is facing a bright future.</p>
