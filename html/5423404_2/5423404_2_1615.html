   <p>The Swedes here in Chicago celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Jenny Lind, the Swedish Nightingale. Jenny Lind became an American citizen in the fifties through her marriage to Otto Goldschmidt. The Chicago festival was held in Orchestra Hall. Alma Peterson represented Jenny Lind at the festival, singing all the songs that Jenny used to sing, and she was dressed in an exact duplicate of the dresses and hats which Jenny used to wear. The ushers were all dressed in hoop skirts, and the gentlemen connected with the festival wore the dress of the period.</p>
