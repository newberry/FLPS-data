   <p>Eversun Carbon Arc Lamp Company is the name of a new business organization by our countrymen Sven Sundstrom and Bror Lundquist, the former an electrical engineer and the latter an ex-aviator in the Royal Swedish Navy. The factory and office are located at 5018 North Clark Street.</p>
   <p>The carbon lamps, as such, is not a new invention, but Mr. Sundstrom has made several improvements over the existing types, whereby "the Eversun" is rendered more effective and at the same time cheaper to manufacture. The improvements have been patented by Mr. S. Sundstrom.</p>
