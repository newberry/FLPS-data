   <p>Among the exhibited paintings in the art gallery at the corner of Erie and Clark, Streets is one by our countryman Axel Westerlind. It is done in water colors and is entitled "Shore Motif from Rogers Park." It is a fine picture, pregnant with sentiments. In the fore-ground the sandy shore, against a back-ground of foamy waves. Far out on the horizon, a ship is visible. The sun is just breaking through a mass of dark clouds and its rays are adorning the edges of the clouds with gold.</p>
   <p>Translator's Note: Mr. Westerlind still is an active artist, although nearing his eighties. He is a member of "Svenska Kostnarer" (Swedish Artists' Society), of which he is a charter member.</p>
