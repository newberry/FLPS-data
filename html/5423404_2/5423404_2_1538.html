   <p>Carl Pfeils has produced the play "The Union Man," a version of the Swedish play "Death's Father," which Pfeils once tried to present to the public under the title of "The Devil and the Swede."</p>
   <p>On its run the play got as far as Hammond, Ind., where the drama lovers ignored that they were being offered the greatest drama of the century. This accounts for the fact that no one showed any interest towards "The Union Man."</p>
   <p>Mr. Thomas Nelson, of the Baggage and Delivery Drivers' Union, Local No. 25, is the president of the company in charge of publicity for the play. We shall follow this unusual enterprise with interest. It has received so much <span class="page-break">2</span>free advertising already that at its next presentation the play is bound to draw a large audience.</p>
