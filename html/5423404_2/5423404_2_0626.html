   <p>[Translator's note: The sale of the mayflower to aid the fight against tuberculosis has become an institution in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries. The mayflower is an artificial flower, the design and color of which is changed every year.]</p>
   <p>The excellent idea of transplanting the Swedish mayflower to American soil has been hit upon by a group of our countrymen in Providence, Rhode Island. The mayflower has become a tradition in the old country, and its sale brings in a considerable sum every year, which is used in the fight against tuberculosis.</p>
   <p>We can see no reason why the mayflower should not become as popular <span class="page-break">\2</span>among Swedish-Americans as it is among Swedes at home. We have advanced to the point where we now have our own sanitarium, where at least some of our tubercular countrymen are being cared for. We are all hoping that it will become possible to expand this activity so that many more cases can receive proper care. We are sure the mayflower would be a great help, and sincerely hope that men and women of initiative in every Swedish community in the country will take up the idea and see it through. </p>
