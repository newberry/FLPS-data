   <p>Each day brings new evidence of the truth of the old saying, "idleness is the promoter of evil." Idleness breeds unhealthy and criminal thoughts, which subsequently produce crime. In our prisons there are many people whose first step in their criminal careers was the result of idleness. Only a few days ago, a young Chicago man, who is in prison for sex murder, declared that idleness caused his downfall; he added that idleness is as great a vice as drunkenness and leads to the same result--the degradation of man.</p>
   <p>There are two kinds of idleness: voluntary and compulsory; both entail the same consequences. Jane Addams, the prominent writer, places a great deal of the blame for soul-destroying idleness upon the employment of young children in factories.</p>

   <p>It is disturbing to notice how many people have become vagrants as a result of their monotonous and spirit-devouring work in factories. Just as the businessman casts his business troubles aside when summer comes and hurries off to sea and forest for the sake of recreation, so also does many a worker, weary of the daily monotony of his work, put away his tools and go away to enjoy sun and light.</p>
   <p>Many of these people become lost to industry for all time. The reason for this dislike for work may in most cases be traced to the fact that even as children the vagrants of today were compelled to work in a factory from eight o'clock in the morning until six o'clock at night. The natural desires of man must be considered. The liberty which was denied in childhood is demanded by the youth and the nearly mature man. The child does not possess the physical, the mental, and the moral strength which is necessary if he is to become interested in the work assigned him, regardless of whether or not he likes his task. However, it is just this interest which every first-class worker must necessarily possess.</p>

   <p>Jane Addams has written of a typical case of the development of a vagrant. As a child, he was put to work in a textile mill. Day after day, for sixteen years, he remained at his machine. The work did not require much thinking: he was simply a cog in the great industrial machine. One day, he became ill, and for three weeks he was confined to his bed. When he recovered he was seized with a strong dislike for the work in the factory, and declared that he would rather go to hell than go back to his work.</p>
   <p>This man is not a thief, but he is a thoroughgoing vagabond, who shudders whenever he sees a factory building.</p>
   <p>Similar cases are frequent, and they strongly indicate that a large part of our hobo army is being recruited from the ranks of those young men who were forced to begin the struggle for existence during their childhood days.</p>
