   <p>The Swedish Choral Club, under the direction of Edgar A. Nelson, commenced its second season with a concert in Orchestra Hall.</p>
   <p>The program was almost entirely in the Swedish language and included the following: "Den Store Hvite Flok" by Giveg, "Sverige" and "America". Gustaf Holmquist's solos were received enthusastically by the audience. In brief, despite the fact that he is considered an outstanding musician with an unusual voice range, he seemed to outdo himself that evening.</p>
   <p>He sang Armas Jarnfelts, "Titania" and "Nat Kveld"; and Peterson Bireger's "Host Sang" and several encores. The choir sang Swedish songs of a familiar type. The Swedish Choral Club now has two hundred and fifty voices.</p>
