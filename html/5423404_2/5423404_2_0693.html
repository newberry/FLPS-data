   <p>The Swedish Engineers' Society is holding its annual mid-summer pic-nic next Sunday, June 28th, on the grounds of the Nordic Country Club, a few miles west of Chicago. The Club house and ground improvements are not yet completed, but the natural beauty of the property more than compensates for any inconvenience. Games will be played and other forms of entertainment offered.</p>
