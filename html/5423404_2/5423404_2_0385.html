   <p>It is undoubtedly only a question of time when the much discussed income tax will be introduced in this country. Without it, it will be almost impossible to frame a just tariff law.</p>
   <p>Senator Bailey has introduced an income tax bill in the Senate, but according to it, incomes of less than five thousand dollars would not be taxed, and this clause is considered a serious mistake. Decisions so far handed down by the Supreme Court, and which are related to the tax question, indicate that a constitutional income tax must embrace all incomes, be they high or low. This interpretation will, of course, seriously affect the wage earner, but we are inclined to believe that if we assume, say, a three per cent tax on all incomes, the worker making three hundred dollars a year will gladly pay nine for the satisfaction of seeing the one-million-a-year man lay his thirty thousand dollars on the line as his contribution to the support of our government. The tax which the worker now pays in the form of high prices on necessities amounts to much more than the tentative nine dollars, and, furthermore, the trusts take most of it, leaving very little for the Government.</p>
