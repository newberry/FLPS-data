   <p>Many of our more prominent Swedish-Americans have a very interesting past, from which one might learn much, but which is usually unknown to the public. By means of great personal sacrifices and unbending energy, often actually suffering privation, they have acquired the knowledge and training which they needed in order to fulfill their ambitions. Some may have had to give up with victory almost within their grasp, but a great many reached their goal, and in their mature years enjoyed the fruits of their early struggles.</p>
   <p>Such a man is Attorney Alfred A. Norton, who was born in Vermland, Sweden, in a happy, well-to-do farm home. In his childhood he was a playmate of the present Governor of Minnesota, A. D. Eberhart. When he was seventeen years old, his desire to make his own way in the world became irresistible, and he decided to cross the ocean to America, the promised land. In 1886 he came to Iron Mountain, Michigan, where he remained for three years, and then left for Minneapolis, Minnesota. In that city he attended the Central High School, and then entered the State University, where he took the Bachelor of Science degree in 1897, and graduated from its law school two years later.</p>
   <p>During all these years in school, Norton supported himself entirely, and we can readily understand that it was tough sledding. But hardships and difficulties did not stop him, and he finally got the education he wanted.</p>
   <p>Immediately after graduation from law school, he lived for some time in Spokane, Washington, but went to Chicago in 1902, and has practiced his profession here, with offices in suite 1518 in the Ashland Block.</p>
   <p>Mr. Norton is a bachelor; his genial personality has won him numerous friends, and he is a popular member of many lodges and societies. He is a high Mason and Odd Fellow and a member of the lodge Nore, I. O. V., and several other organizations.</p>
   <p>He has been very active in behalf of the new Home for the Aged in Evanston, and admits that this institution is his hobby, for which no sacrifice or effort is too great. As a former president of the Swedish Old People's Home Society, he has been the driving power behind that organization for many years, and its fruitful activities at the present time are to a large extent due to his inspiring enthusiasm and example.</p>
