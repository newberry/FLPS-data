   <p>In honor of Attorney Bertha C. Moller, who just recently received an appointment as Assistant Attorney for the Chicago Sanitary District, the American Daughters of Sweden will give a banquet at the Swedish Club, Feb. 4th.</p>
   <p>Miss Moller is the only practicing Swedish woman attorney in Chicago. But that is not all: She is the only actively practicing woman criminal lawyer in Chicago, and the part played by her in the recent Mickelberry trial made a sensation.</p>
