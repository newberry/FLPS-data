   <p>On Sunday, September 4, our distinguished countryman, Lars Gustaf Hallberg, the architect, observed his sixtieth birthday at his residence in the scholarly city of Evanston.</p>
   <p>Still in the prime of life, Mr. Hallberg can nevertheless look back on an active and useful career.</p>
   <p>Lars Gustaf Hallberg was born on September 4, 1844 at Venersnas, on the shores of Sweden's largest lake, the beautiful Venern. He attended the public schools of the community, and then studied with a private instructor for some time, in order to qualify for admission to the Chalmer Institute of Goeteborg. Here he took the course in civil engineering, and received his diploma in 1866, at the age of twenty-two. He then went to Stockholm, where he studied architecture and related subjects at the Fine Arts Academy, <span class="page-break">\2</span>after which he returned to Goeteborg.</p>
   <p>He now had a very fine professional education and obtained a position with the well-known Architect Westerberg of that city. While he was there, the firm was commissioned by Mr. Dickson, one of Goeteborg's most important businessmen, to prepare plans and blueprints for a number of buildings on his estate, "Fimmersta," and also to supervise the construction work. Hallberg was selected for this job.</p>
   <p>When the city of Gefle was destroyed by fire in 1869, he realized that there would be a great demand for architects during the reconstruction period. Accordingly, he went to the scene, and became one of the leaders in rebuilding the city.</p>
   <p>At this time, preparations were being made for a great agricultural and industrial exhibition in Goeteborg. Westerberg submitted the plans and secured the contracts for erecting the buildings. He needed an able <span class="page-break">\3</span>assistant, and, knowing what Hallberg could do, wrote him and asked him to drop everything and come to Goeteborg on his own terms. Hallberg accepted and wound up his business in Gefle. When the Goeteborg job was completed, he had some money saved up; he decided to see the world and went to England in the spring of 1871.</p>
   <p>While he was still there, the news of the terrible Chicago fire of 1871 shook the world, and Hallberg, realizing that men of his profession would be in demand, set out for the city by the lake. Thus he became one of the founders and first settlers of the new city which grew out of the ashes of the old, and has right along taken an active role in its expansion and beautification. But we will not even begin to mention here all the buildings for which he has submitted the plans and calculated the costs.</p>
   <p>It is not easy for a newspaper man to obtain an interview with Mr. Hallberg, but when the difficulty has been overcome, he has many interesting things <span class="page-break">\4</span>to relate from his experiences both in this country and in Europe. The only trouble for one who wishes to write about his career is that he prefers to place his own personality in the shadow. The remark, "Write about beton, and leave my insignificant person out of it," is characteristic of his attitude in this respect.</p>
   <p>What about beton? Outside of the engineering profession, few people know much about it. It is a building material somewhat similar to concrete or cement; when it has had time to set it becomes hard as granite....</p>
   <p>Mr. Hallberg is much interested in this new material and believes it will become the building material of the future. He has patented a new method by which to manufacture it, and uses it on his own construction projects wherever possible. On the South Side, he has used this material in building the bridges over an alley between two apartment buildings and also in constructing the front steps of the Augustana Hospital. Balconies, stairs, columns, indeed the entire building, may be constructed from this material; <span class="page-break">\5</span>it resists corrosion for a long period of time, and dampness and water make it even harder.</p>
   <p>In 1881, Mr. Hallberg married Miss Florence Estey; they have two sons and two daughters. The family residence is in Evanston, at the corner of Ridge Avenue and Greenwood Boulevard.</p>
   <p>Everybody who comes in contact with Mr. Hallberg socially or in business admires his pleasant and friendly manner; he is the personification of kindliness. Even though he has, through his marriage, become related to prominent American families, he has not forgotten that he is a Swede, nor has he permitted his success to go to his head. He has visited Europe several times for recreation and study; in spite of his sixty years he is as active as a man of thirty, and we join his many friends in wishing him a couple of more scores of birthdays.</p>
   <p>His offices are located on the eighth floor of the Oxford building, <span class="page-break">\6</span>where one finds combined the atmosphere of old-fashioned solidity and modern progress.</p>
