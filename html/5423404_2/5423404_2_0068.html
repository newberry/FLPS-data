   <p>Alderman Oscar F. Nelson of the 46th Ward is publicly accusing John J. Sloan, President of the Board of Local Improvements, for favoritism and underhanded methods in the awarding of contracts for the construction of the new Wacker Drive.  Alderman Nelson claims that eighty-five per cent of all contracts have been let to one and the same firm, and that Mr. Sloan is discouraging competitive bids from other contractors.</p>
   <p>In the City Council, the other day, Alderman Nelson openly stated that Mr. Sloan, on the one hand is the owner of a favored company and, on the other, the company is owned by relatives of Mr. Sloan's, namely the Wisconsin Granite Co. and the Universal Granite Co. Upon a motion made by Alderman Nelson, a council committee was appointed to investigate and report on the matter.</p>
