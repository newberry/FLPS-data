   <p>The "Northcenter Commercial Association" held its regular annual meeting the other day and elected as its president our popular countryman, Mr. Henry A. Moberg, member of the Moberg-Nord Printing Co., Irving Park Blvd., on which thoroughfare the company has been located for the past thirteen years.</p>
   <p>Incidently we may mention that the name "Northcenter" for the district centering at the busy intersection of Irving Park Blvd., Lincoln Ave., and Robey Street, was "invented" by Mr. Moberg and first used by him commercially.</p>
