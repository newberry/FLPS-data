   <p>Samuel E. Erickson is the Republican candidate for State Representative from the Twenty-ninth District.</p>
   <p>Born in Sweden, he came to Chicago in 1864 at the age of four, and has lived here ever since. When he was nine years old his father died, and he had to go to work to help support the family. Finally, he obtained employment with the Western Union Telegraph Company, learned telegraphy, and advanced rapidly. Later he was appointed to the Cook County Abstract Department, and at present he holds the position as Assignment Clerk of the Superior Court, a position which entails considerable responsibility.</p>
   <p>He has previously served five terms in the State Legislature, and sponsored a number of very important bills. It was due to his efforts that the State in 1903 gave five thousand dollars to the famine victims in Finland and Norrland, Sweden. He gives the best he has, not only for the benefit of his own constituents, but for the community as a whole, and has been an honest and conscientious public servant.</p>
