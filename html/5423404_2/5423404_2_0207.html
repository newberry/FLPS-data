   <p>The South Side Swedish ladies' grand patriotic meeting in the Swedish Lutheran Bethel Church, 62nd and Peoria St., became another proof of the Swedish-American patriotism. The meeting, which was presided over by Mrs. C. Palmer, president of the Linnea Society, was opened by Dr. A. P. Fors, who dedicated a new flag to be hung to the left of the altar. On the right was a Service Flag with forty stars, a silent but eloquent proof of the Society's offer to Uncle Sam.</p>
   <p>Both Miss Harriet Vittum and Chief Justice Harry Olson delivered forceful addresses, and appealed to every one to do his utmost to help his country in these times, the gravest in its history. Gustav Holmquist's beautiful song and Professor Hjertelius' music helped in a marked degree to heighten the enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Liberty bonds were sold to the amount of $3,550, with $500 more guaranteed.</p>

   <p>The committee hereby wish to thank Dr. Fors and other Swedish ministers on the South Side for the interest and sympathy they have shown for this patriotic meeting, which, through their help, became a grand success.</p>
