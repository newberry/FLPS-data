   <p>A vote taken last week by the members of the Board of Commissioners of the Cook County Poor House resulted in the ousting of our countryman, Dr. Wimermark from his position as superintendent of the institution. The voting was 10-4 for his dismissal. A man by name Pyne, a chief engineer at the Poor House, has been appointed to succeed Dr. Wimermark.</p>
   <p>This dismissal and the appointment of a non-medical man for the position in question comes as a great surprise, as it is contradictory to the accepted policy of filling positions of this nature with physicians of good standing. This action on the part of the commissioners is, no doubt, actuated by something else, most likely politics.</p>
