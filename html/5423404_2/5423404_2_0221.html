   <p>Chief Justice Harry Olson, on last Sunday, spoke at a Loyalist Meeting in Belmont Hall, to a Swedish-American audience. He prophesied that, at the end of the War, three powers would control the world. "The United States," he said, "would dominate America."</p>
   <p>England, according to his opinion, would lead Europe. Japan, since it has become more democratic, would be the controlling power in Asia. The audience consisted mostly of women of Swedish-American ancestry.</p>
