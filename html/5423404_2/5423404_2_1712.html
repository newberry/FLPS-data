   <p>The students of Charles Erickson, the violinist, assisted by Edna Swanson, soprano, Walfrid Lindberg, mandolinist, and members of the Roseland School of Fine Arts, gave a concert on Tuesday evening last week in Market Hall, Pullman. The presentation by the pupils showed clearly that the teachers had fulfilled their tasks satisfactorily. The numbers presented were received with great applause, and several encores had to be given.</p>
