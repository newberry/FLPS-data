   <p>On April 9, 1909, Congressman Fred Lundin of the Seventh District of Illinois, introduced a resolution before the House of Representatives requesting the Speaker to appoint a committee to study the question of old age pensions in all its phases, and with instructions to report to the House whether or not its findings indicated that such a pension system would be desirable and practical for the United States.</p>
   <p>The resolution was referred to the Committee on Rules, which apparently has taken no action on it, for Mr. Lundin has felt compelled to bring the question before the people in order to stimulate public interest and discussion. In a lengthy paper he relates the history of old age pensions in other countries, and urges newspapers and other publications to lend their support to this important social undertaking. This letter to the nation is accompanied <span class="page-break">2</span>by a copy of the resolution adopted by the Illinois Legislature, April 22, 1909, endorsing the Congressman's proposition to the House of Representatives in Washington.</p>
   <p>It is none too early for the United States to wake up and do something in this important matter, and there are, we are glad to say, signs of an awakening. Thus Congressman Coundrey of Missouri has recently introduced a proposal for a pension law which does not have to wait for the report of a slovenly committee, and which has, of course, not a chance of being passed. But we consider it an encouraging sign, and as a forerunner of things to come. The people are not yet quite ready for such an epoch-making event, but we venture to predict that within a few years, when the question has been thoroughly discussed, a law providing for old age pensions will be considered a matter of course.</p>
   <p>Such a law has strong opponents even among persons who claim to be able to influence public opinion. Thus a university professor--not a Chicago man <span class="page-break">3</span>this time, but one from Harvard--has in a recent speech declared that all support of aged people ought to be withdrawn for the benefit of young persons in order to help the latter become independent in their declining years. In his wisdom this man would even abolish homes for the aged and other such benevolent institutions on the grounds that these unfortunate people are entirely worthless, and society is better off without them.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that Congressman Lundin's timely proposal will be taken up for serious discussion, and that this humane cause will receive the consideration it deserves. We are getting off to a late start at that.</p>
