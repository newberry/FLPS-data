   <p>Comptroller Lawrence E. McGann, of Chicago, has a theory of heroic courage which does not correspond with that of many others. He expresses himself as follows:</p>
   <p>"The average man would rather fight for his country and stand face to face with death than dig in the city streets or sweep the boulevards. Still these men (city laborers), looked upon as a lower, even a degraded class, seem to be the city's leading heroes. It is the faithful, industrious work of these men that has made Chicago one of the world's greatest and best industrial communities in the world."</p>
   <p>As to his last statement we will not speak our mind at present, but we fully <span class="page-break">2</span>agree with him with reference to the "heroes of Chicago". Heroic courage, according to the average citizen's idea, is brought to the surface in the bright lights. One seldom looks on work as requiring courage, pride and daily sacrifice. Still this faithfully done work has accomplished more for the advancement of humanity than have all the military battles ever fought.</p>
   <p>The sewer laborer gropes his way through the darkness under the streets in very bad air, and is threatened constantly by unseen dangers. His life is full of unpleasant things and of sacrifices, still he continues steadily without complaint.</p>
   <p>The ditch digger also sets an example of as serious, faithful application of energy as one may find on the field of battle. All day long he works hard and steadily, without yielding to fatigue; his broad back and powerful arms carry the heaviest burden of civilization for a very small financial recompense.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>He who goes through the ill-smelling neighborhoods, in the quiet hours of the night, removing the waste of the city, makes it possible for the rest of us to breathe purer air, and to live under more sanitary conditions. His faithfulness is another example of sticking to even unpleasant duties for the benefit of his fellow man.</p>
   <p>It is more of a strain to stick to such work with its daily strife and nightly strain than it is to muster up courage to face the enemy on the line of battle. No stirring drumbeats and music call them, and no flashing, heart-stirring banners urge these men on in their daily effort, and in the sacrifice and courage necessary to keep the work on a proper schedule.</p>
   <p>Millions of men spend their entire lives in difficult and poorly paid activity, so one cannot overestimate the heroic courage it requires to carry them through. They accomplish more for the benefit of humanity than all the politicians and soldiers in the world. Their heroic courage is the greatest example that could possibly be held on high for the world to realize.</p>
