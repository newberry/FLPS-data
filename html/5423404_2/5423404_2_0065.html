   <p>A bill has been introduced in the state legislature which calls for the formation of a state commission whose task will be the financial supervision of public works, especially of expenses and the letting of contracts.</p>
   <p>The bill in question, House Bill No. 1042, which is now being studied by a committee, is of a rather drastic nature. The proposed commission would be empowered to order an accounting by all department heads and other officials who handle public funds and have a hand in spending them for public works. And furthermore, the control would also apply to the firms who obtain contracts for these works.</p>
   <p>If this bill is passed by the legislature it will be difficult for crooked <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>politicians and cheating contractors to enrich themselves at the expense of the taxpayers. It will not be as easy to pad the contracts as it has been in the past. Only last week it was again bared how unscrupulous politicians and contractors co-operate in fleecing the public. The Chicago Daily News, claiming its rights as a taxpayer, sued one of the firms, which held contracts for the building of McCormick Boulevard, and in doing so showed the court that the project cost the community several hundred thousand dollars more than necessary. The illumination of the thoroughfare alone cost close to a million, because three times as many lamp posts were installed as were actually needed.</p>
   <p>The initiative for the introduction of this bill was taken by District Attorney George E. Q. Johnson. In a number of talks, one of them before the Chicago Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Johnson revealed the injustice which is being done to the taxpayers in the letting of contracts for public works. As a rule, written, sealed bids for such contracts must be submitted, but that is no guarantee that the lowest bid or the one most advantageous to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the public is accepted. And in any case, so many "extras" are usually added that when the job is completed it costs twice as much as it is actually worth.</p>
   <p>In taking the initiative in this matter and calling it to the attention of the public and the legislature Mr. Johnson has rendered a valuable service to the community, for the waste of public money is immense in every field, but nowhere is it greater than on public works.</p>
