   <p>A revolutionizing invention in photography has been made by our countryman, Mr. P. Joh. Berggren, civil engineer, and since a few years back, associated with the Essany Film Corporation in Chicago. Mr. Berggren calls his invention "Natural Vision Pictures," inasmuch as they also possess depth and give a stereoscopic illusion.</p>
   <p>A demonstration was made the other day in the Essany studios on Argyle St. before a select gathering of scientists and representatives startled by what they saw.</p>
   <p>It is predicted that Mr. Berggren's invention will revolutionize the film industry, but the processing will require many more years to perfect.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berggren was born in 1888 in MoSocken, Halsingland, and came to Chicago in 1912.</p>
