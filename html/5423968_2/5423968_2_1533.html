   <p>The workers, like any other class of people, should care for their own welfare and protect themselves against injustice and defend their trade and honor.</p>
   <p>Man, as an individual and as a group, must regulate his demands continually to conform with the demands of his fellowmen; he, while protecting himself must not injure his fellowmen; and he, while protecting his class, should not injure others, for all classes and occupations are necessary to life and progress of the nation.</p>
   <p>It is an excellent thing when the workers protect their rights, when they demand a better piece of bread, or (better food) when they demand better working conditions and less hours, in order to take better care of their families,their education and welfare.</p>
   <p>But it is entirely wrong when these demands are unreasonable, when these demands extend beyond the limits of national prosperity, and when the <span class="page-break">2</span>privileges of the working classes are secured by harming other classes, necessary for life and development of the nation. An eight hour working day is a very good thing, but, it is ruinous to the whole nation and the country to forbid any one to work longer if he so desires.</p>
   <p>It is a good thing to penalize an employer who forces on his employees a ten or twelve hour working day, but it is a bad and injurious thing to the whole nation to penalize a man just because he willingly agreed to work more than eight hours in one day.</p>
   <p>In Poland the Diet violated this measure, forgot about the fundamental principles of the balance in the privileges of the classes, for it established an eight hour working day, and - provided a penalty for anyone who would work longer than eight hours in order to make a better living for his family.</p>
   <p>This law has caused incalculable harm to Poland, because it is the principal cause of business depression, because it equalizes indolence with industrialism, <span class="page-break">3</span>which is the cause of the drop in Polish currency value, high prices of articles necessary in everyday life and dissatisfaction among the working classes.</p>
   <p>This compulsory eight-hour law also hurt Poland with the outside world for it gave the impression that the Poles do not want to work and cannot manage themselves.</p>
   <p>If it is true that hard work made nations and countries prosperous; if it is true that a man must obtain everything by hard labor then it is not right to compare laziness with industriousness, for the law of nature will punish it very severely.</p>
