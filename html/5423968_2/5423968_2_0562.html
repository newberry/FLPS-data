   <p>There are people having <span class="gap">[gap]</span> towards high learning and wisdom, having even in certain directions a <span class="gap">[gap]</span>education, who in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of all have to be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> with as fools, if one is called a fool who willingly cause an injury or harm unto himselr.</p>
   <p>There are people who lack <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to such a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> which in bad or good for them, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to any sort of suicidal theory set from in the Christian world by the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> religion and become its <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. </p>
   <p>To such idiotic <span class="gap">[gap]</span> spread at present among Christians, chiefly in American, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the se-called <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for would-be <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>This watch-world was thrown <span class="gap">[gap]</span> world by the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of modern socialism, promising to fools a paradise on earth with the help <span class="page-break">2</span>of doing away with private property, with the help of preparing a free love tie by nothing, a boundless freedom.</p>
   <p>Only fools allow themselves to be taken by this kind of talk, those not knowing how to distinguish laws of nature and not understanding the fundamentals of life and human happiness, generally the fundamentals of our entire Christian civilization.</p>
   <p>We have written many times about Socialism. Our attentive readers already understand perfectly the entire idiotism concluded in the Socialistic doctrine, relative to the make-up of the state. Up to this time we have not written extensively about the free-love proposed by the Socialists professors of universities, for would-be economic reasons. The Catholic church condemns this doctrine as incompatible with the principles of faith.</p>
   <p>We will try to enlighten it briefly from a purely <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and self-preserving viewpoint.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>There is not one human being with a sound mind that would not admit from a patriotic <span class="gap">[gap]</span> purely <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that the artificial <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of births is national <span class="gap">[gap]</span> knows that the greater the population of a nation, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the easier it is to uphold its culture and its political independence. It is a thin so clear that there is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of having a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> over it. So then, the propagaters of "birth control" are <span class="gap">[gap]</span> <span class="gap">[gap]</span> about this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and are raising only the economic question and saying that the uncontrolled number of births is bringing poverty not only upon the families individually, but also upon the entire country. Under the pretext, it would seem that they have a reason, when you take into consideration the fate of this or that numerically large and poor family.</p>
   <p>We are saying this under pretext only, because in reality the thing happens to be altogether different when we take into consideration the good of the entire country.</p>
   <p>Above all, the healthiest individuals, equally under the spiritual and <span class="page-break">4</span>physical respect, are being born, in particular where the number of births is not bound by anything. This is happening particularly because they are conceived in natural manner from physically and spiritually healthy parents. Only the most morally and naturally conducted marriages can bear many children. A marriage, limiting by an artificial method the number of births, can never bring into the world healthy and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> children, because the artificial act of prevention ruins the health of both individuals, and above all the woman's.</p>
   <p>You cannot point our as one physically and spiritually healthy married woman who has conformed to artificial sterility. Such a married woman is almost always ill and usually comes to an untimely death. Generally, the women who live the longest and feel the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> fortunate, are those who have had a natural number of children.</p>
   <p>It is also a downright lie that an artificially lessened number of children, or sterility gives a woman satisfaction in life. Such beings are truly the most unfortunate, particularly when it comes to definition of one growing older.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>If it <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the nourishing and the proper bringing up of the children of peer parents, that is remedied very essily by every city, every smallest community, and lactly the state. A <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is also the claim that a greater number of people brings about a greater poverty, because every normal and industrious person can himself produce enough livelihood, that would be sufficient for six people.</p>
   <p>Further, the one who <span class="gap">[gap]</span> "birth controls" is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> who,briefly saying, performs suicide and corner number upon his posterity and nation. If the Jews propagate among Christians the principle of birth control, then one must ask them why is it that they do not adapt themselvess to it, but call every newly born child a treasure and blessing of Jehovah?</p>
