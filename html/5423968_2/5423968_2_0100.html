   <p>The children of Polish workers should attend the public schools, schools from which they may benefit a great deal!</p>
   <p>If we wish the children not to blame us when they grow up we should forbid them from going to Polish parochial schools, schools which are infested with clerical bums, disseminating unworthiness.</p>
   <p>If we aren't fortunate enough to possess Polish public schools, then let us send them to English public schools. Even though they are not such an excellent model, but in every reason teach three times more and better than those Polish parochial schools, - unreasonable clerical establishments.</p>
