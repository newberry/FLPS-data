   <p>As has been previously announced, examinations are over at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish School. Their results were favorable, to say the least. We were well informed about this but were not inclined to mention it in the paper because we did not wish to be called biased, nor did we wish to praise the school too much, since the principal,Reverend Vincent Barzynski, is also the manager of Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>We are of the opinion that the present article will not be considered biased, since it has been taken from the columns of another Polish paper. This article, reprinted from Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette), reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The St. Stanislaus Kostka Parochial School is undoubtedly the largest in the United States. At the present time three thousand children attend its classes. Five trained teachers and thirty-four Sisters of Notre Dame are in charge.</p>

   <p>Last Thursday and Friday, June 6 and 7, classes were placed in the hands of the members of the Board of Education, who supervised the annual examinations. It is unfortunate that not one of those who are opposed to parochial schools was present. He would have been surprised to note just how far our boys and girls have risen in the various fields of learning.</p>
   <p>Thursday morning the pupils of Mr. Domka were examined, and in the afternoon those of I. Kowalski; Friday morning Szczesny Zahajkiewicz's class was inspected and in the afternoon that of B. Klarkowski. The children gave answers with ease to the questions put to them. It has been said that children are inclined to memorize what they learn and repeat the same automatically. During this examination no such replies were given, for upon further questioning the children definitely convinced the examiners that they knew their subjects thoroughly.</p>
   <p>The first examination was in catechism and the replies to queries were quick and to the point. Tests in Polish history revealed that the children were well <span class="page-break">\3</span>versed in this field. Some children gave recitations, and then the entire class sang Polish national songs, including religious numbers. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, who conducts the history and singing classes, was well pleased with the results.</p>
   <p>Arithmetics and geography are taught by Mr. Klarkowski. The most difficult problems in the former branch of study were solved with ease. All students have shown throughout the year that they have a natural aptitude for arithmetic.</p>
   <p>Drawing lessons are given by Ignace Kowalski. It must be conceded that the students in this class fare well. The most promising students in the drawing class are John Marach, Stanislaus Krepec, Thomas Nalepinski and W. Gorecki. The following excel in color work: P. Katki, who is the best, and J. Blank. Although the latter draws with his left hand, his right being stiff, his work is excellent.</p>
   <p>English grammar is placed in the capable hands of Mr. Kellet. It cannot be said that this class is neglected.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In a few words, the boys at the Stanislaus Kostka Parish School, with the training they receive, will be able to help themselves in their later years. Through their obedience to the teachers and the fulfillment of their lessons they can be not only a credit to themselves but also to Poland. Their advanced education, of course, depends largely upon the interest of their parents. That is why the parents are warned to keep a careful eye upon their children after they leave school.</p>
   <p>The children highest in deportment in each class received rewards of books. W. Gorecki received the first reward.</p>
   <p>It would be superfluous to add more about this fine school. This school represents the best there is in parochial schools.</p>
