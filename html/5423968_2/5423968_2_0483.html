   <p>There are two sides to every story; to the one side you may have to add, and probably, you may have to detract from the other. However, here we are concerned only with the side that outweighs the other.</p>
   <p>It is true that there are in this country at the present time many urgent problems that require immediate solution, and that if the many gentlemen, now engaged in fighting the liquor interests, would turn their attention toward the solution of these vexing problems, their accomplishments would be more valuable, and they would be rendering a real service to their country.</p>

   <p>The harm resulting from the use of liquor has not as yet been definitely ascertained, and is still an open question. Some learned persons claim the liquor, even in the smallest quantities is harmful, others again claim it does more good than harm.</p>
   <p>No two people are able to agree on the question of whether the use of liquor is beneficial to the life and health of the man in the mine, the factory, or the street.</p>
   <p>We therefore contend that anyone, who wants to sacrifice his time and money, endeavoring to further the conservation of the life and health of his fellowman, would do well to promote a proposition acceptable to a greater number of people.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>If there is a certain group of people in this country, who firmly believe that the use of alcoholic liquors is harmful, they are at liberty to make these facts known to all. They are at liberty to agitate and to promote prohibition. If this is accomplished legally, it would be constitutional, and would not be considered a curtailment of personal liberty.</p>
   <p>If they can convince the majority, that some article in the constitution is bad, and should be amended, and if the majority vote accordingly, so it shall be, and that puts an end to all recriminations. The majority rules. Words and arguments don't mean anything, and the ballot is always the most effective method of silencing the antagonists.</p>

   <p>The argument is that those in favor of temperance themselves over indulge occasionally, or they enjoy seeing others overindulging. On the other hand, hundreds and thousands of people spend most of their lives in saloons, where they drink to excess, spending their hard earned money that is directly needed at home, undermining their health, depriving themselves of the much needed rest and sleep, wasting precious time that could be spent in the company of their family at home, or in reading good books. This stupid dissipation is detrimental to all concerned, the inebriate himself, his family and the community.</p>
   <p>Such daily drunken orgies, are seen everywhere, and by everybody; they are sad and pathetic sights to witness.</p>

   <p>Moderation in all things is a virtue of wisdom, but there are weaklings that are ignorant of this virtue.</p>
   <p>They are possessed with the idea, that the more one drinks, and treats his friends, the more popular and influential he will be. Some fear that, if they do not drink and treat their friends, they will be labelled as misers. Others are boastful and pretentious, and there are those who ape others, but all make animals of themselves, by drinking beyond their capacity. They do, however, receive applause from the many fools that surround them.</p>
   <p>The fact is that people who use food and drink in moderation are better workers, and fulfill more thoroughly and efficiently their obligations as citizens</p>

   <p>The Russian-Japanese war is a splendid proof substantiating the above statement. During the night, while the Japanese officers slept and rested, the Russian officers played cards, and drank wine. Although both sides appeared alert on the field of battle, the Japanese being thoroughly refreshed, were able to outsmart and outmanoeuvre the dissipated and tired Russians.</p>
   <p>Napoleon drank one glass of wine with his dinner, and sometimes during inclement weather, on the field of battle, he would drink a glass of punch.</p>
   <p>Poland suffered great losses because of inebriety and overindulgence. The flourishing nobility of Poland in the eighteenth century drank wine by the jugfull.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>But when it became necessary to defend the country against invaders, this flourishing nobility, in a drunken stupor, was lying under the liquor barrels. The task of defending the country fell upon the shoulders of the moderationists, those believing in, and living a life of temperance, such as Kosciuszko, who ever in his life was either drunk, or even tipsy.</p>
   <p>It is our contention that if you like liquor, or if you think a drink or two will aid digestion, you should drink a glassful or two, but you should not overindulge. If you must enjoy yourself on such occasions as christenings, weddings, parties, meetings, etc., eat, drink, sing, and dance, but all in moderation. Don't try to impress others with your importance. Don't drink because you are financially able to do so, and don't try to show others how much your system can stand.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Dont drink or spend because, as a member of your organization or lodge, you want to do your share in the raising of funds. You and your lodge would profit more if, instead of drinking, you would drop the five dollar bill outright into the treasury.</p>
   <p>If you want to fight the prohibitionists and reformers; if you want to divert their attention and agitation to some other cause, then you and your friends, must adopt moderation and temperance.</p>
   <p>When refusing a drink will cease to offend a friend, when drunkenness and the drunken orgies at the bars and saloons will end, the agitation of the prohibitionists and reformers will end. We will then enjoy a healthier, happier, and longer life. We will enjoy greater security, because our savings will be greater.</p>

   <p>Women, it has been proved, live longer than men, even though they are the weaker of the two. Why? Because they are either total abstainers from intoxicants, or use them in moderation.</p>
