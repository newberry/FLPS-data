   <p>Owners of the packing house industry are making millions of dollars a year, yet they exploit labor and give it such a relatively poor remuneration for its efforts that it is almost impossible to eke out the bare necessities of life. We are well aware of the fact that the workers are in their sixth week of the strike, many of which have four, or five, or six or even seven children. Most of them worked hard to keep these large families fed without ever giving a thought to putting something away for a dark hour. Consequently, many of them are in dire need. They can be seen daily gathering about the halls where meetings are held. And the Stockyards magnates are trying to pay these strikers, who are heads of families, fourteen or fifteen dollars per week. Will this sum of money feed a small family, let alone a large one?</p>

   <p>Thanks should go to the priests, church societies, and Polish businessmen within the locale of Town of Lake for trying to fill the needs of the unfortunate strikers in every way possible.</p>
   <p>The police are arresting strikers on the slightest provocation; however, Judge Trude, who hears the cases daily at the Stockyards Police Station, sets them free. He is truly a friend of labor, for he treats the workers like a father.</p>
   <p>J. Rytyna, a Lithuanian, who operates a bakery at 46th and Hermitage Avenue, is giving five dollars worth of bakery goods daily to the strikers. D. Zalewski, pharmacist, 4645 So. Ashland Avenue has given twenty-five dollars. Who is next!</p>
