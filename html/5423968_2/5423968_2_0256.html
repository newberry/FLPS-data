   <p>In the last issue of Dziennik Chicagoski, I read the statement, "As its schools, so the nation" (Jaka szkola, taki narod), and that every father should interest himself in the school attended by his children.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago, the school that concerns us most is that of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, attended by about three thousand of our children. It is not an English public school--it is a Polish parochial school. The term "parochial schools" involuntarily brings to mind the various charges made against them even by supposedly thoughtful people. I myself have heard one thing and another against parochial schools in general from various "wiseacres," and since this is a very important matter, I decided to see for myself what parochial schools and their teachers are worth.</p>
   <p>I have a cousin who attends St. Stanislaus School, and so I began to ask him <span class="page-break">\2</span>questions about his school work and to look through his lessons. This disposed me favorably toward the school and convinced me that the little fellow was really learning something. I did not stop at this. At various times, I visited the school, ostensibly to see how my cousin was getting along, in reality, to observe the system of teaching. What did I see?</p>
   <p>The school opens at 7 o'clock in the morning, at which time at least two teachers are already present. At 7:15, all of the teachers are in their classrooms, so that if a child comes to school a little early, he has the benefit of instruction before class time. The children go to church at 8:o'clock every morning, and classwork begins at 8:30, immediately after Mass. The time before going to church is used in reviewing the previous day's lessons under the teacher's supervision. Regular classwork continues from 8:30 to 11:30, with a fifteen-minute recess; in the afternoon, classes are conducted from one o'clock to four o'clock, with another fifteen-minute recess.</p>
   <p>Everyone knows that the children spend a certain number of hours in school, <span class="page-break">\3</span>but, one may ask: Do they learn anything? What do they learn? That again is another question. I asked myself those questions and determined to investigate. I went to the principal and asked for the plan upon which the school is conducted. My request was willingly complied with. What did I find?</p>
   <p>First I saw the register, in which every pupil's name is written, together with the name and address of his parent or guardian. Here every absence of each pupil is recorded and, in a separate column, notations are made of how many times and in what manner the parent has been notified of such absence. Next, I was shown the school regulations, in Polish and English, which are posted in each classroom. The classroom walls are hung with maps and charts, which tends to prove that those in charge of the school are not sparing in their purchases of educational equipment.</p>
   <p>A "daily calendar" is to be found in every classroom. This is a book in <span class="page-break">\4</span>which the teacher records the subject and hour of each lesson. From these "calendars" it is possible to see what subjects have been taught to the children during the course of the entire year. This interested me very much, so I looked through the "calendars" of each classroom and discovered thereby the time that was spent in teaching each subject.</p>
   <p>The educational system of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parochial School follows the public school eight-grade plan. In addition to the subjects taught in public schools, parochial schools teach religion, religious history, Polish geography and history, and the Polish language. The curriculum is determined by professional educators and is therefore above reproach.</p>
   <p>The entire curriculum at St. Stanislaus School includes religion, Polish language, English grammar, arithmetic, geography and history of the United States, geography and history of Poland, writing, spelling, drawing, music, and physical education. It is understood, of course, that the lower classes teach only religion, languages, writing, spelling, and arithmetic; the rest of the subjects are taught in the upper classes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Records show that the pupils make good progress--the last final examinations convinced those parents who were present that their children have progressed admirably in the above-mentioned subjects. I was also present at the examinations.</p>
   <p>The great hall in which the children took their examination was hung with specimens of their work, such specimens as even a European secondary school would not be ashamed of. A large table was covered with children's written work, though I wondered that this work did not awaken greater interest in the parents who were present. Exercises eloquently demonstrate the progress of a pupil in a given subject. I found exercises of every conceivable nature. There were exercises in every phase of Polish history (biographies of kings, descriptions of important battles and events, etc.); there were exercises in drawing and music, in the Polish and English languages (grammar, literature, etc.), in arithmetic, United States history, etc.</p>
   <p>After looking over all this work and noting that every error had been corrected in red ink by the teachers, I was convinced of the instructors' conscientiousness. <span class="page-break">\6</span>I thought of how many hours of drudgery, how many well-nigh sleepless nights it must have taken to read and correct so many exercises. Very few parents recognized or appreciated all this painstaking labor.</p>
   <p>As far as I am concerned, from the children's answers to my questions, from their exercises, the "daily calendars," from the whole system upon which the school operates, I have come to the conclusion that the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parochial School is at least equal to, if not better than, the best public schools. It employs professional teachers, all of whom have been trained in Europe, who work wholeheartedly and so achieve unexpected results.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski printed an invitation to attend the examinations, extended to all those who are interested in the school, but, unfortunately, none of the critics of parochial schools were present.</p>
   <p>They call themselves patriots! Those who condemn our own schools and praise</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>the schools of others--with no foundation whatever for their complaints--call themselves patriots.</p>
   <p>That is not patriotism! Anyone can criticize and complain. After all, if there are parochial schools in which inadequacies exist, surely that is no reason to tear them all down. Rather should we correct their faults and commend those who wish their children to be educated in a godly manner, in Polish. It is because of the parochial schools that our children can still talk with their parents in Polish and that they adhere to the Catholic faith; on the other hand, the children of these noisy critic-patriots, who attend public schools, can hardly say a few words in Polish, and those incorrectly.</p>
   <p>But I must end this rather long article with hopes that in the future our patriots will remember "As its schools, so the nation," and take a greater interest in Polish schools. Perhaps their judgment will then be a little kinder.</p>
