   <p>All Catholic churches in Chicago celebrated the feast of Corpus Christi yesterday. As is known, in America,all feasts of such a nature are postponed, for the benefit of the working class, from Thursday to Sunday. In St. Stanislaus Kostka's church, as in former years, yesterday too, most solemn processions were held in the afternoon. The weather was favorable.</p>
   <p>An unpleasant accident also occurred, when a part of a walk at the corner of Noble and Ingraham Streets caved in under the weight of the people. Several of them fell below the sidewalk. However, no one sustained any serious injuries and it ended in fright and shock.</p>
