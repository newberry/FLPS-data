   <p>To the Christian Mothers! Very often we appealed from this section to the mothers that they should not demand too much from the school and that they should help the school. It is not a great merit to the parents who only clothe the children, supply them with books and send them to school. It is also their sacred duty to see that they not only attend the school regularly but also that they do their home work. From time to time they should see their teacher and inquire about their children's attendance as well as their conduct. So controlled the child consequently has better care and a chance to become a better pupil. Their education is more advantageous. When through with school the books are usually thrown into a corner or given to other children. As soon as the school is over "sonny"does not think about books any more. Here the mothers should see that the grown up children continue their studies after physical work; to look into their books frequently. This will be useful in the future.</p>
   <p>Above all let them study the catechism and the History of the Bible. Let them study frequently. Our nation shall last as long <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>as we observe our faith and say our prayers. Whoever neglects this noble work commits a sin against the people and the nation. We have sometimes very sad cases among our youngsters who are getting married. Some of those young men do not know even the Lord's Prayer or how many sacraments there are. Some do not know how many persons there are in the Holy Trinity. In one case, the father of the girl happened to be present when a couple was questioned by the parish priest before the wedding. The girl answered all the questions but the young man failed to answer any of them. When the father of the girl noticed that, he promptly took the girl home stating that be could not trust such a man with his daughter. A wise father he was! He really wished his daughter well.</p>
