   <p>A Polish Technical School has been established in Chicago, by an organization of Polish engineers, to teach the Poles the qualifications demanded here by factories.</p>
   <p>The program of this school's course is as follows: Arithmetic, common fractions and algebra. Technical drawings, parts of machinery, ways of using tools, names of the tools, reading meters of the various air and machine pumps.</p>
   <p>As we glance on the above mentioned program we know that a school of this sort was in a great demand because nearly all of our workers who came from the old country, not knowing the machinery and tools, and ways of using them, were in position that prevented them getting further advancements in their line of work.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that our Polish readers will take advantage of this newly established Polish Technical School.</p>
