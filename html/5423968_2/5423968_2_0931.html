   <p>Although Germany has been defeated, this reptile of the Teutonic Order of Prussia, together with the Jews and Bolsheviks, is endeavoring to harm Poland while it is being reborn. German politicians are using all means for the purpose of lowering the Poles. They are working mostly at the present time, so as not to give up lands conceded to Poland at the Peace Conference. They are being aided in this ignominious work by Jews and Bolsheviks.</p>
   <p>We all understand well the hatred of Germans toward the Poles. A powerful and independent Poland is an impassable wall against German aggression directed toward the East. However, we do not understand yet the reasons why the Jews are fighting against us so obstinately. The majority of Poles look at the agitation of Jews against Poland as a matter of small importance. Nevertheless, it is dangerous. Without further delay we must try to understand it, comprehend it, judge it, in order to know how to conduct ourselves, how to guard ourselves, what sort of medicine to use. The enemy is the most dangerous when we do not know with what weapon he is fighting.</p>
   <p>Therefore, to make it easy for our readers to understand this situation, we are drawing up the following remarks:</p>
   <p>The Behavior of Jews in Poland</p>
   <p>At the Polish parliament in Warsaw, the deputies showed with documents: That the Jews, during the entire duration of the war, helped the Germans, and hurt the Poles; that they sucked life's most vital juices out of the Polish people; that they practiced usury; that, by dishonest business methods, they became rich; that they did not go to the front at all because they bribed the Austrian and German officers while the Polish peasants perished by thousands; that they always spoke German, spied on the Poles, and delivered information to the German authorities.</p>
   <p>That they fought and are fighting on the side of Ruthenians against the Poles, perpetrating the most ignominious crimes; that they made an effort to bring about anarchy in Poland, which would justify the claim that the Poles had not grown up to liberty; that they murdered Polish children; that they poured hot water on and shot Polish soldiers at Lwow; that they hoarded food, while the Polish population died from hunger.</p>
   <p>That they seized arms and ammunitions; that they falsified documents to the disadvantage of the Poles; that they scoffed at the Allies; that in columns of Jewish-German newspapers they unjustly cried with fury against the Poles.</p>
   <p>During the war the Jews, with the Germans, carefully kept all of this secret, judging, that when they were victorious, the world would never find out about that. However, a great misfortune has happened to the Germans and Jews. The Allies were victorious and the hideous crimes of the Jews and Germans began to come to light.</p>
   
   <p>They Contrived the Pogroms</p>
   <p>Desiring to divert the attention of the world from their crimes, the Jews, always cunning and having at their disposal a huge mass of Jewish-German newspapers, sounded a horn throughout the world that, in Poland, the Poles were staging pogroms on them. And over here also trumpeting about pogroms, the Jews are covering up the whole campaign against Poland.</p>
   <p>Although the Jews, with the Germans, can mislead England, France, and the United States, they cannot cover up their work before the eyes of the Poles. We know:</p>
   <p>That Jewish press bureaus are sending to the press not only false stories about Jewish pogroms in Poland, but also about anarchy and bolshevistic riots in France and England, so as to implant mutual distrust among the Allies; that the Jews organized in England some kind of united, envoy committee, which is working to the disadvantage of the Poles; that they are endeavoring to bring about bolshevistic anarchy in Poland, and they are subsidizing bolshevistic agents; that they are using Socialists for their own purposes.</p>
   <p>The agitation of the Jews has grown to such dimensions that the Jewish German press has proved itself too small, therefore they started to stage manifestations and protest meetings in the United States against these would-be pogroms in Poland and Rumania. About these meetings we write in another place of todays edition.</p>
   <p>The Truth About Pogroms in Poland.</p>
   <p>The Jews have slandered the Polish nation; they have filled the press with fictitious fables; they are staging protests, but no one has been able to cite any proof for these slanders in spite of thorough inquiries conducted in different cities with the cooperation of representatives of local Jewry. Instead, it was confirmed that there was rioting here and there, however these arose as a result of the laxity of social order in devastated-by-war and Jewish exploitation areas.</p>
   <p>Attacks were made on Jewish and Christian population by the worst criminals, robbers, pillagers, mercenary soldiers liberated from prisons by Ukrainians and Germans. Because the Jews had everything in profusion, money and food supplies, the Austro-Ukrainian mercenary soldiers looked for these things from them before going anywhere else. They first looked into their shops through doors and windows. This was only a natural thing to do.</p>
   <p>Eye witnesses of the riots in Lwow tell that the Ukrainian command intentionally made it easier for the Jews to collect their food supplies, while the Christian population was literally starving. The information is spread among the masses of the population that the war was won by the Jews, who, actually took only a small part in the battles at the front because they could always excuse themselves from front-line service with the help of bribes. Behind the front-lines in Poland and Austria they acquired by usury, profiteering, and buying of stolen articles, millions upon millions.</p>
   
   <p>The people, namely, those who wanted to rob, knew, therefore, where the supplies and money were.</p>
   <p>There were instances where the population, excited to a high degree by the treason and provocation, punished a Jew endeavoring to inculcate bolshevism in Polish soil, but the Jews and not the Poles were to blame. The Poles must guard themselves against the contagion of bolshevism spread by the Jews because otherwise they, themselves, would be the victims.</p>
   <p>Such are the facts concerning the pogroms in Poland. Not pogroms, but riots took place, and those riots were brought about by the Jews themselves.</p>
   <p>Two characteristic and very important particulars strike one while reading the reports from meetings and Jewish manifestations in the United States. First, that the Jews are staging protest meetings against the alleged pogroms in Poland and Rumania; second, that at these meetings the speakers are Jews and Episcopalian pastors, Protestants, and Methodists. This is an interesting alliance of the Jews with the pastors. It is worth while for us to reflect somewhat over these important particulars.</p>
   <p>Between Poland and Rumania there exists a certain informal understanding as to war with the bolsheviks. Both countries resolved to use all possible means to hold back and break up the bolshevistic masses driving from the East. This they are effectively doing. This is leading the Jews into a rage. Seeing that they cannot with weapons in their hands overcome the difficulties put by Poland and Rumania, the Jews used their most damnable weapons - money, slander, and calumny, on these two nations. In their protests there is no mention about the Czechs, Hungarians, and Ukrainians, who battered the Jews more than the Poles or Rumanians. Why? Because they, instead of fighting bolshevism, together with the Jews, are attacking the Poles.</p>
   <p>This is the explanation of one particular, having for its foundation politics. The second enters into the sphere of religion. The pastors of different denominations would not mix with the Jews if it were not to their interest. They are concerned in this case with Catholic Poland. They know that the Polish population belongs to the Catholic church. They see that, together with a powerful Poland, the influence of the Catholics will grow stronger, therefore, they come out against it. In no other way can this fact be explained and if it is so then the Polish Catholics ought to know about that and act against it.</p>
   <p>The Reasons for the Agitation of Jews Against Poland.</p>
   <p>From what we have said above, we can come to the following conclusion: Jews invented the pogroms and are staging protests against Poland, first, to turn the attention of the world from their crimes; second, to destroy the obstacles to bolshevism; third, to prevent the creation of a great Catholic Poland; fourth, to compel the Poles to take the necessary steps to grant various concessions and privileges to Jews in Poland.</p>
   <p>It is indeed ridiculous that not the Jews in Poland but those in America are protesting against pogroms. From what source do they know all this? Why don't the Jewish deputies in the Polish parliament at Warsaw protest? The above four points give us the correct answer to this. The Jews would like to seize all Polish trade and commerce; take over control of the railroads in Poland; demoralize the Polish population; in short, make a new Palestine out of Poland.</p>
   <p>Those are their aims; those are the reasons why they are conducting a furious agitation against Poland.</p>
   <p>What We Poles Should Do in the Presence of This.</p>
   <p>We do not care to stage pogroms against the Jews. We will not fight them with arms. Standing as high as the whole Heaven above them, we have no desire to mix with the Jewish rabble. Financially they are stronger than we, but spiritually, morally, and politically, they cannot compare with us. From this we can only have contempt for them and, above all, we should withdraw from them, as from wrong-doers and slanderers. Let them live by themselves. Let them do business with their own kind. Poles to the Poles. Let us support Polish trade, Polish merchants and manufacturers. Let us turn to trade and industry and leave the Jews in peace, and let us avoid them like contagion. Here you have the only way to get rid of Jewish protection. When we will not go to them, they will themselves leave us alone and then we will not have any leeches sucking our life's blood. We do not care to take vengeance on the Jews, but we have a right, and we ought to avoid evil.</p>
