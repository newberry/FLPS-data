   <p>We published an advertisement in yesterday's paper in which Mr. Robert Koszynski announced that he was not responsible for the debts of his wife Agnes, and warned everyone not to lend her any money or give any goods on credit, because she has deserted him without any cause.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Agnes Koszynska has requested us, in the name of truth and justice, to announce that she has gone to live with her parents, that she does not intend to hide, or purchase any goods on her husband's account, and that she left her husband, who had once before deserted her, because she refuses to attend services at the "Independent" Church, and that she is a member of the Saint Hedwig Church, which her husband forbids her to attend.</p>
