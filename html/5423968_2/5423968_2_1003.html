   <p>One of the worst diseases tormenting the United States is the playing of politics. This disease is steadily attacking the structure of the country, If the nation does not wake up and perform an operation by removing the ulcer, it might prove fatal.</p>
   <p>We should distinguish between a statesman and a politician. A statesman is a man versed in state affairs, but also engaged in politics. He considers it his profession and makes his living therefrom. A statesman is an intelligent person, educated, and above all, he is an honest person. He selected politics as his means of serving the public, just as a physician selects medicine, a lawyer law, or a professor teaching.</p>

   <p>A statesman possesses knowledge and convictions. He serves the nation with his knowledge and work, in the line of his convictions, but retires to his fire-side, when the nation does not desire his services in the line of his conviction.</p>
   <p>A real statesman does not employ wicked means for gaining his objective. If he cannot gain it honestly, he will wait for another opportunity, if he has the patience.</p>
   <p>A politician is an entirely different type of man; he is engaged in politics and makes his living from it, but he is usually a worthless person, without education, lacking higher abilities, without convictions or ideas. He is interested only in gains and his own comfort and does not seem to care about the good or future of the country or nation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>He rejects no means, no matter how base, in order to attain his aim, he demoralizes people, practices bribery, slander, promotes intrigues, degrades himself in front of his enemies, even prostrates himself before them, when he needs them, and betrays his friends when they no longer serve him.</p>
   <p>These two types are also represented in our own "Republic," The Polish National Alliance. We also have statesmen and politicians. It is not hard to distinguish them; it is only necessary to observe who practices slander, who degrades himself for receiving favors, and on the other hand those who adhere to the honorable principles.</p>

   <p>The Polish National Alliance would be in grave danger if the politicians gain control of it. These people abuse our organization by using its name for gainful purposes, disregarding the welfare of the members of the Alliance and that of the whole nation. They use the Alliance as the means in obtaining personal gains.</p>
   <p>All good members of the Alliance should unite in protecting the organization against the abuses of the politicians. Elect any one for your leaders, conservatives, radicals, educated or uneducated, young or old, but do not elect politicians. The danger will be great because the Alliance is growing and must take an active part in politics, Polish and American as well.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance is organized for the purpose of protecting the interests of our people and for that reason it must have influence in politics.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>To stay away from politics would be to neglect our duties as American citizens, for our Alliance is an American institution.</p>
   <p>This work must be accomplished by statesmen, not by politicians. The Alliance must stand firm so good can be accomplished and fatal results avoided.</p>
   <p>The Alliance should not support any particular political party, either American or Polish; it should not serve any party, for neither party nor its program serve the public.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, the Alliance should support the people of every party, of every organization and oppose doubtful or harmful people.</p>
   <p>The Alliance should take this under very careful consideration.</p>
