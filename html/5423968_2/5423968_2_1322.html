   <p>Zgoda, which is edited by a person who is endeavoring very zealously to discredit the Polish National Alliance, states in its last issue that the entire program arranged by the Polish Roman-Catholic Union to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Constitution of the Third of May, and announced by Dziennik Chicagoski, is made for the purpose of misleading the public. We suspected for some time, but now are almost positive, that the editor of Zgoda is either incapable or does not care to support, spread, and explain the ideals of the Polish National Alliance and other national organizations. It seems to us that he is only concerned with his own ridiculous ideas. Even though the title of his paper calls for harmony, it is not strange at all that he be preaching the opposite, causing dissension among <span class="page-break">2</span>the Poles.</p>
   <p>"Why didn't we arrange for this festivity earlier?" asks the editor of Zgoda. Yes, we tried to arrange it last year, but the deliberation broke up, not through the fault of the organizations affiliated with the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, that waited for an answer and further deliberation, but through the fault of the delegates sent by national organizations not connected with the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, and who gave no answer, and through the fault of the editor of Zgoda, who obstructed our plans by articles which could have been stopped by the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The editor of Zgoda implies that it would be impossible to eliminate organizations of nihilistic and unpatriotic tendencies, or those which are soiled with anarchism or czarism, for the simple reason that not everybody could clear himself of such charge if it were made for the purpose of elimination. Yes, then it is true that the independent organizations, and those which are affiliated with the Polish National Alliance, cannot prove that they are not soiled with anarchism or czarism if they were accused of it. And if they cannot prove it and cannot clear themselves of such charge, then it is the fault of the editor of Zgoda, who is degrading the organ of the Polish National Alliance by publishing in it foul articles.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Zgoda, "The assay, the chemical means that can prove all this," so has expressed himself the sarcastically happy editor of Zgoda, which should be the organ of all Polish organizations, if they have one, has been very badly polluted, but in our opinion it can still be cleansed. So much for the editor of Zgoda today.</p>
   <p>We are not accusing at present the Polish National Alliance or any other organization not affiliated with it or with the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, unless they confirm their sympathy with the editor of Zgoda by silence or open declaration.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>We are of the opinion that the prospect for celebrating the commemoration of this historical event is very good in spite of the opposition of the editor of Zgoda.</p>
   <p>That some organizations will observe this commemoration very solemnly downtown on Saturday, that the church societies will observe it on Sunday, May the 3rd,and that there will be another celebration for school children on Monday, is no reason why we should not get together on some other day in order to form some kind of a constitution for the entire Polish element in America, and by this act conclude the commemoration of declaration of the Polish Constitution a hundred years ago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Indeed, we need a special day for consultation, for understanding and for putting an end to quarrels, for it would be impossible to accomplish all this on a day devoted to other activity.</p>
   <p>We hope that our extended hand will be welcomed by all good and sincere patriots; that every organization will elect a number of delegates, - one to every twenty-five members, - and send their names to the secretary of the celebration organized by the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. We hope that all of us will admit that we need a general conference. We also hope that in case someone has any objection to our plan, or a better proposition, or a good suggestion for some improvement, or any question to make, he should come forward without prejudice, without bitterness in his heart, with the conviction that he is serving the national cause and with the desire to effect solidarity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Inasmuch as Zgoda will not publish any reconciliatory articles as long as it is controlled by its present editor, we are offering the columns of our paper for such remarks, advice or propositions as may be constructive, peaceful, serious, and not opposed to the principles of patriotism and the Roman-Catholic church, and provided that such articles bear the signature of the writer or organization,which we as editors like to have for our private information.</p>
