   <p>During the time of the last great trouble that was caused by the conditions in Wilno, which practically resulted in a crisis of the government of the Polish Republic, General Pilsudski, temporary president of Poland, threatened to resign because of this grave situation. For a few days uncertainty prevailed throughout the country. As each day passed the situation grew graver. Because of the distance and privation of immediate information, which was published exclusively in the American press and many times the stories were padded, twisted, and adverse to Poland, it is not necessary to bring light upon this condition once again. The suspension of uncertainty in Poland, as we know today, lasted only twenty-four hours; however, in America it lasted practically two weeks. Without any facts, we <span class="page-break">2</span>were not aware of what had transpired relative to the settlement of the conditions; we were not even definite about the stand of the president. We finally learned all this from the recent batch of news direct from Poland. According to the information received, a brief outline of what has happened is given.</p>
   <p>The situation pertained to the election in Central Lithuania. At the general assembly an understanding was to have been reached, pertaining to the political and eventual appurtenance of that nation toward Which, which has been honorably governed for a long time by General Lucian Zeligowski. Meanwwhile, the time was nearing for a proclamation to be issued to the residents of Central Lithuania, upon which the League of Nations and the Council of Ambassadors had consented. However, the <span class="page-break">3</span>negotiations proposed by these two foreign bodies did not result in any definite decision. Nothing was accomplished for either side. Poland and her people insisted that Lituania give the people of Wilno a voice in the matter. This made the situation more complex.</p>
   <p>The foreign mediators agreed upon having the people take a vote as to how they stood upon the question of Wilno. But a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of opinion on this resolution arose in Poland. This threatened to make matters worse. One school of thought that arose and which was formally accepted by the Central Powers of the Polish Republic, was that after the public election in Wilno, which undoubtedly would be pro-Polish, the territory would be annexed by Poland and that would put an end to the entire affair. The <span class="page-break">4</span>other school of thought was supported by the president and his clique, who have always yielded to the central powers ever since the expedition to Kiev. These Belvedere Cliques were connected with the Polish federation. This federation included the small, neighboring countries that were to protect Poland against Russia, and which were to aid Poland in the event she opposed <span class="gap">[gap]</span> As it happened, from the very beginning of the occupation of Central Lithuania by General Zeligowski <span class="gap">[gap]</span> stood for the direct possession of the city of Wilno by Poland, these small political cliques began to agitate a against the General. From Warsaw they sent out a group of people who fulfilled the wishes of their clique to the letter by surrounding Leligowski with <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. These men were to make things more "pheasant" for him virtually, they instigated all sorts of intrigue against <span class="gap">[gap]</span>in Wilno. However, Zeligowski, if he had Wished to adhere to his own principles, could have <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the dictates of the <span class="page-break">5</span>directors of Warsaw. He could have actually followed his own policies outside the borders of Warsaw, but his patriotism to his country forbade him to do otherwise. Therefore, as a result of these underhanded methods his position in Wilno was cramped. Consequently, the conditions that prevailed in the city of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> were not the fault of Zeligowski at all they were the direct fault of the Polish people, not the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>This last example pertaining to the election and session relative to the territorial dispute was finally brought to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by Zeligowski. But this was the result of the orientation of the two political factions concerned with the Central <span class="gap">[gap]</span> question, which shook the entire Polish nation. The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> cliques took a middle course without mincing words, for they wanted to force through, secretly and by intrigue, their own opinion recommending that the conciliatory election include <span class="page-break">6</span>other territories that already belonged to Poland. This was uncovered at the zero hour and a protest was put into action. Meanwhile, the president threatened to resign if this opinion was not accepted and recognized--the opinion of including a wider territory in the vote. For twenty-four hours uncertainty prevailed, which endangered the new republic. Shortly, however, a compromise was reached upon which the Diet and the president had agreed. Pilsudski withdrew his threat of resigning and stated "that he was not seeking means to hamper the freedom of the inhabitants of the Wilno territory." Meaning that even his eventual resignation was not to be considered "hampering."</p>
   <p>The question--what was it in this respect? If the president of the Polish nation was telling the Diet, which represents the people, if...and if... you will not agree, I will resign without delay, then it could not be taken <span class="page-break">7</span>any other way than as an obtrusion on the freedom of his country and with it the hampering of others. In this instance it would have been the people of Poland and Lithuania, as well as, those of Wilno in which the latter was vitally concerned. Pilsudski was fully determined to back his demands. At the same time all the parties of the Diet agreed to adhere to the former decision of that body and as a result opposed the leader of the Belvedere cliques. It was at the time that this opposition was announced that the characteristic there of Pilsudski was cast. However, this sudden action was not considered a grave matter that would throw Poland into dangerous waters in its wake. After all, there was a time when:</p>
   <p>There was nothing but a green plain</p>
   <p>Where none of our people did reign -</p>
   <p>There will be another green plain.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>There will be a green plain; and if not this one, then another. We are not immortal and a change in the Belvedere personnel would not put the nation in a state of consternation. As it happened, a compromise was reached; the president changed his opinion, and conditions went back to normal.</p>
   <p>This may be a very good thing but it seems that General Pilsudski has threatened too many times to throw Poland into a state of catastrophy by his resignation! As far as we can recall, this has occurred three times. All this does not give much credit to the Polish president. Yet, this is typically a Polish action. We like to speak about ourselves in a euphemistical manner - we call this Polish individualism .... but in reality this is a typical characteristic of saving the country by personal means and ways, and not a recognition of methods and plans of <span class="page-break">9</span>other people and parties. It is also the refusal of using other influential assistance. But actually it is the injection of the superiority of one's ego - ego above anything else.</p>
   <p>Such conditions occur many times. It is true abroad as it is in our own country. Many times at a conference of an organization this situation arises. Everything seems to go contrary to the president's wishes and soon the disgusted officer threatens to resign if all the opposition does not change its attitude - so the anathema. This is exactly what happened in the llno issue. Pilsudski refused to yield and it was apparent that the question would be set aside for some later date. This certainly would have been a happy ending for all our friends in the world, who actually desire to see more of such conditions in Poland - for us it would have meant more news of discredit to the world at large.</p>
