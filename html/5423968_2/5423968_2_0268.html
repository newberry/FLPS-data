   <p>In the August 6, 1892 issue of Nowe Zycie (New Life), I read an article, the author of which is greatly indignant over the "importation" of a teacher from the province of Poznan to the St. Stanislaus Kostka school in Chicago. This author is opposed to reinforcing [the teaching staffs of] Polish-American schools with teachers newly arrived from Poland, or "greenhorns," and says that bringing a teacher from Europe is a definite violation of the law which clearly forbids importation of workers of any kind under contract.</p>
   <p>I frankly admit that this article shocked and exasperated me, a "greenhorn". In reading words that spoke so degradingly of the entire teaching profession, which is highly respected in Europe, I could not believe my eyes [when I learned] that the Poles here regard their teachers on the same level with common laborers. Can it be that there is no difference between physical and intellectual labor here? Does coal mining or wood chopping mean as much in America as the cultivation of the mind and spirit of man?</p>
   <p>If this is your [New Life's] notion of teachers and education, you should at least keep it to yourselves while Doctor Dunikowski is visiting us, lest he carry away the wrong impression of us. You have evidently forgotten that in our own country [Poland], both lay and secular teachers are highly esteemed, and the people, knowing the need for education, fully realize the loftiness of their [the teachers'] mission. But true, I had forgotten for a moment that I am in America, where people value the dollar above education!</p>
   <p>The author of the article in question protests against the rearing of Polish-American children by people newly arrived [from Europe].</p>
   <p>Why? The author is mistaken when he says that the schools here rear our children, whereas European schools teach only academic subjects. Evidently the author has not examined the European school system thoroughly, or he is not at all familiar with European principles of education, if he can make such statements.</p>
   <p>The author goes on to say that even were the teacher the ablest of pedagogues, he could not fulfill his task, and instead of educating the children, he would set them on the wrong course, for education here is based upon different principles. Unfortunately, the author did not substantiate this statement.</p>
   <p>Why should a father, mother, or teacher train a child differently here than in the old country? Is it perhaps because the climate here is warmer, or the temperature more changeable? Are European principles of child training inferior to American?</p>
   <p>Ask any Polish parent, and the answer will invariably be the same: that in the homeland, their children were better trained than here in this free country, where freedom has led them to a point where they no longer respect their elders, parents, priests, nor teachers. Such is the strain on family ties here, such excesses and wantonness to which our children permit themselves as were unheard-of in the old country. The whole blame for this rests with the parents who, because of the different environment, are not raising their children in accordance with the Lord's commandments, which, after all, are the same in both hemispheres.</p>
   <p>Finally, the author says that the parents, having often learned from their own bitter experience, ought to try to arrange that their children receive an education equal in every respect to that of Americans. I presume, however, that Polish fathers, if they are in their right minds, would certainly wish nothing of the sort, since American child training is a hundred times worse than European.</p>
   <p>Since fate has brought us here, it is our duty to retain whatever good we brought with us from the old country; however, it is not right that we should adopt those things which can only do moral harm to our children. In the struggle for the dollar, it is easy to lose the religion and patriotism that are so dear to us! It may be that in the old country, children are taught blind obedience to various governments and to crowned heads, but it does not necessarily follow that we should cast aside the "greenhorns" whose teaching in Europe has already yielded golden fruit, and that we should turn to American public schools, where all children are supposedly taught to be good American citizens. God pity such an advantage! I do not wish to deny that Polish children sent to public schools become good American citizens, that is, become Americanized; but that they will no longer be good sons of our homeland, that soon they will forget the Polish language and customs, that finally they will not only lose their patriotism, but--God forbid--they will lose our greatest treasure, the religion of our forefathers, the near future will show. Let any sober-minded person say whether such American citizens will do anything worthwhile for Poland.</p>
   
   <p>It is my opinion that an Americanized Polish child can become a good businessman, but never a Polish patriot, and will do nothing good for our poor, oppressed Poland.</p>
