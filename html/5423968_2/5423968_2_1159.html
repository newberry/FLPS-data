   <p>Once more we are forced to raise our voice in defense of our paper against the insinuations of Polak w Ameryce. In its issue No. 74, the Buffalo newspaper renews the accusations, previously made against our paper, that we are unfriendly toward the Felician Sisters of Detroit (accusations which we answered at length not long ago) and relates another instance of this imaginary animosity. Because of the ill will evident in this article of Polak w Ameryce and because the accusations may lead some people to false conclusions, we feel that it is our duty once more to say a few words regarding this matter.</p>
   <p>We will discuss it briefly. Some time ago we published an article about the prize awarded to the St. Stanislaus Kostka School of Chicago at the Columbian Exposition and, naturally, we expressed our happiness because of this preference.</p>
   
   <p>Understanding that this was the only prize awarded to a Polish school at the Exposition, we published this fact in good faith. Now, it seems, we were mistaken. Another Polish school was also awarded a prize, namely, the school of the Felician Sisters of Detroit. Our mistake can readily be understood. The information about the prize award was furnished us privately by the school administration, and then from the list of awards to Catholic schools published in the Chicago newspapers and in the official Catholic organ of the Archdiocese. The New World. Endeavoring to convince ourselves if any other school had been awarded a prize, we carefully examined the list and found none except the St. Stanislaus Kostka School. This was, as it now appears, a mistake, but not entirely our fault. In the list of awards (and we possess this copy of the paper with the list) there was no mention made of the Felician Sisters' school, but there was mention of an award to the St. Mary's Insititute of Detroit. Not knowing the exact name of the Felician Sisters' school as it is known in the diocese, and for lack of any detailed description to the effect that this Institute is actually the Felician Sisters' school, it was easily overlooked by us, in the belief that it was not a Polish school. This, then, is the source of our unintentional mistake, which we discovered just now, after examining the official book of awards published by the Exposition authorities, where, beside the name "St. Mary's Institute," is an explanation to the effect that it is conducted by the Polish Felician Sisters.</p>
   <p>We are herewith correcting this mistake and gladly share with our readers the joyful news that, besides the St. Stanislaus Kostka Polish School, an award was also granted to another Polish seat of learning, the Felician Sisters School of Detroit. This fact represents a real honor for the Sisters, and for all Polish Catholic schools in America. Had we known of it sooner, we would have published this information immediately, because this is surely something to be proud of, as it brings honor to the Poles. We would like to note more of such facts.</p>
   <p>The above explanation should suffice, we presume, to prove that Polak w Ameryce's insinuations that our newspaper was aware of the prize awarded the Felician Sisters but did not mention a word about it are absolutely without foundation. It is evident that these insinuations were dictated, alas! by personal animosity, if not to cause trouble and controversy among the Polish-American people. Such action, always harmful, more so today when the Polish-American situation is gradually assuming a certain stable position, is exceedingly destructive. If the editors of Polak w Ameryce wish to continue in this manner, they deserve to be properly condemned.</p>
   <p>In conclusion we wish to announce once again that anything that is good, that is Polish, no matter what its origin, we always support with sincere good will and will continue to do so. The continued insinuations of Polak w Ameryce will not cause us to become impatient and throw us off this rightful path. At the most they can bring to mind the thought that anyone who looks for evil in every human action must, of course, be evil himself.</p>
