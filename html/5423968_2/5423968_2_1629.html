   <p>At yesterday's directors meeting a sum of $100 was voted upon by the directors of the Polish Union Daily, in the thought of the appeal placed in the paper a few days ago in regard to offerings for the former unemployed strikers.</p>
   <p>Labor affairs have always been discussed in the columns of our paper and the workingmen have been convinced that through their conviction we are guarding their cause</p>
   <p>We have not desired and do not want to demonstrate a feigned friendship, as others are doing, but will always stand up and guard their interests.</p>

   <p>The Polish Union Daily employs union labor and pays the union scale. We did not play as demagogues of the type of a doctrinaire editor of a non-union newspaper, but wrote sincerely, caring about the fate of Polish workers, exploited by an unfair capitalist and in man cases a corrupt union official.</p>
   <p>We appeal to our more well-to-do readers to send donations for this cause, and all donations will be turned over to the Welfare Societies of the Polish parishes in the Town of Lake district.</p>
