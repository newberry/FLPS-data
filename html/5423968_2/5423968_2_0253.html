   <p>The presentation of scholastic awards to students of St. Ignatius College was held yesterday at the Central Music Hall. This school, a Jesuit institution, was established in 1869 and in 1870 was given the right to confer academic degrees upon its students. Its courses of study include all branches of Catholic religious teaching, logic, metaphysics, ethics, chemistry, natural sciences, mathematics, rhetoric, style, history, geography, accounting, and commercial law. Latin, Greek, English, French, and German languages and literature are also included. Students have a choice of either a classical or a commercial course. It is a pity that so small a number of Chicago Poles send their sons to this institution. Up to a few years back, St. Ignatius College was attended by a number of Polish students, graduates of St. Stanislaus Parochial School; now there are only a few; it is with real pleasure that we announce that those few are outstanding amongst their fellow-students.</p>
   <p>Among those to receive prizes was John G. Jendrzejek, son of the well-known <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Albert Jendrzejek, who was awarded a gold scholarship medal in the classical courses, high school division (w oddziale gimnazyalnym, kursu kiasycznego); Stanislaus P. Cholewinski and Walter Eichstaedt received gold medals in the academic division of the same courses. Every one of the Polish students attending the school received some kind of award. It makes us very happy that our boys have thus distinguished themselves. They have a wonderful future ahead of them and will doubtless bring great honor to the Poles of Chicago if they persevere in their studies. However, we beg that their parents give them every opportunity of finishing their education, that their parents be more persevering than others who have not permitted their sons to complete their studies.</p>
   <p>Besides the thirty priests who attended yesterday's exercises. His Eminence Archbishop Feehan was also present. Awards distributed among Polish students were as follows:</p>
   <p>John Jendrzejek, a gold medal and three books; Stanislaus Cholewinski, a gold medal and seven books; Walter Eichstaedt, a gold medal and four books; Michalski <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and Kujawski, three books each; Kowalewski, one book. [Translator's note: St. Ignatius College at that time was modeled after European schools. It is now St. Ignatius High School.]</p>
