   <p>The majority of mothers do not realize that young girls should adjust themselves to domestic duties in accordance with their physical ability. Very often we see a small girl carrying a younger member of her family which the mother entrusted to her care, in her weak arms. This is very imprudent because a child cannot properly care for a baby, and very often exposes it to unnecessary dangers. There are many light tasks which young girls can perform instead of caring for babies, tasks that provide them with proper exercise and are not harmful to their health. In Polish families, where a maid would be a luxury, young girls should be taught how to keep the house in order: sweeping, dusting, shining shoes etc. They should also be taught to keep their clothing clean and in order, as well as face and hands.</p>
   <p>These duties, when performed under the guidance of the mother will be of invaluable assistance to her. Furthermore, children who have been trained early to perform such home duties, do not run loose in the streets, endangering their lives and morals; but are under the protection of their parents, assisting either mother or grandmother.</p>

   <p>The English people use the best system for training children, and are to be commended on their practical and rational system of education in their orphanages and benevolent institutions. At English orphanages and boarding schools, every child, when four years old, is trained to arise alone from its bed; is taught how to wash and dress completely; and to make up its own bed. Later as they mature, they are trained to perform the more difficult tasks. Besides knitting and other hand work, girls at these institutions are taught the advanced principles of domestic science.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we are not surprised that women who graduate from such institutions are industrious, good wives, who, as man's life companion, help him to attain success, and rear properly, children of their own. If our Polish mothers knew how to arrange the domestic work for their children, if they did the shopping themselves, and kept their children at home, there would be fewer accidents and less sickness much of which is contracted on the streets.</p>
