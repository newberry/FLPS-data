   <p>The fight between labor and capitalism has finally started. The strikers are battling for their rights, but the police are interfering. As a result, needless blood is spilled upon the streets. The firing of revolvers and the spilling of blood, has caused uncertain alarm among the peaceful inhabitants of Town of Lake. All the saloons in the vicinity of the Yards are closed. Crowds of people, both men and women, from time to time fill the streets from 41st to 47th Streets on Ashland Avenue and along Racine Avenue. The packing house officials have begun to transport beds for the strikebreakers in order to make their quarters more pleasant.</p>
