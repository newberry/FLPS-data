   <p>In order to promote an increase in Italy's birth rate, Mussolini issued a decree which provides numerous facilities for families with many children. Besides, steps have been taken to impose heavy taxes upon bachelors.</p>
   <p>This kind of legislation would be of great value to the United States. Today the birth rate in America is decreasing continuously. We are aware of this tragic situation, but nothing is being done to improve it.</p>
   <p>Most of our young married couples are childless, and in very few instances have they more than one child.</p>
   <p>We don't intend to be cruel, but imagine the despair of a mother when she loses her only child. Certainly, if she has more children, she will find much consolation in her grief.</p>
