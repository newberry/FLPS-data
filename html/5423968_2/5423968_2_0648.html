   <p>If we wish to plant a vegetable or a tree we must have a properly prepared soil and then for a long time,take a good care of it.</p>
   <p>Without a proper care the flower will wither and perish. It is necessary to build a beautiful house. First we must construct a solid foundation; a strong foundation that will withstand all storms and winds.</p>
   <p>Even birds and animals raise their young ones, giving them a good care. They not only supply their offspring with food, but they also teach them how to find food. They help them to stand on their own feet, and take care of themselves without any guardianship.</p>
   <p>Very many people rear their children from day to day in a neglectful way, not thinking at all about their future. The fathers as a rule entrust their children to their mothers; and the mothers think that washing, combing and clothing of children fulfills their duty towards their children.</p>
   <p>In the meantime if you do not provide a good soil for such a valuable plant as a child you will have a dry stalk that has no value, will bear no fruit and may die prematurely.</p>
   <p>If we want to bring up a child as a healthy and beautiful creature, we must cultivate not only its physical body but also its character, that is, supply it with a good moral training.</p>
   <p>Every mother is responsible for bringing up of her children before God, society and her own conscience. More than one mother thinks that she is fulfiling her duty towards her child if she feeds it, washes it and sends it to school.</p>
   <p>When the child comes home from school she does not ask the child about the school work, what did the child learn, whether the child derived any profit from the studies or not. She allows the child to play with other children and some times late at night - not asking the child where, how and with whom it played many times she is even glad that the child is not home for she has less trouble with it.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, what will children learn that are raised on the street? Children,like little apes, like to imitate everything that elder people or morally spoiled children do. Like a sponge they absorb all the evil habits. The children will learn from others how to swear, use abusive language, play pranks, and even steal, smoke cigarettes and drink whisky.</p>
