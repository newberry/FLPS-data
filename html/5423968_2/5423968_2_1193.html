   <p>Last week the New York World published an article which contained the opinions of various outstanding individuals relative to the need or needlessness of banning immigrants from Europe to America.</p>
   <p>Among the leading personages that were questioned was Wilhelm Steinway, a German and a wealthy New York piano manufacturer. He stated that European immigration to America should be forbidden, and that, above all, the ports should be closed to the "Poles," for they are the worst kind of people in the world, slovenly, unproductive and without ambition.</p>
   <p>This abusive attack by a German against the Polish nation in America did not pass without a sharp retort. The New York Kuryer (Courier) took note of the remark and sent a stern protest to the editorial department of the World.</p>
   <p>The result of this was that a representative of the World called at the editorial office of the Kuryer and received considerable information about the Polish nation. With this data as a basis, an article defending the Polish people was published by the English paper. The article refuted all the remarks made by Mr. Steinway and pointed out that the qualities of the Polish people are equal to those of other nationalities. The article also pointed out that Mr. Steinway apparently did not have any idea who the Poles were, for he connects them with Hirsch's fund. This fund, however, is not intended for the Poles but for the Polish and Russian Jews. It is evident from this that when W. Steinway spoke about the Poles he was perhaps referring to the immigration of Jews to America from occupied Poland and Russia.....</p>
   <p>In fact this term [Polish] is used falsely by the rabble of New York. But what is permissible for the common people to use is not permissible for an educated person who desires to give his judgment on public matters.</p>
   <p>Wilhelm Steinway confirmed the fact that he did not have an understanding of the matter, and received a just lesson from the World. Credit for this lesson should go to the editorial staff of the New York Kuryer.</p>
