   <p>St. Mary Magdalene's Church celebrated its annual Forty Hours of Devotion services during November 29, 30, and December 1. Rev. B. Kasprzycki celebrated High Mass to officially open the yearly services. The sermon was given by Fr. John Stoinski.</p>
   <p>The church altars were richly decorated with fresh flowers, palms, and an assortment of candles and candelabrums. All credit for the beautiful decorations goes to the Felician Sisters. Singing by the church choir, under the able direction of Walter Maniszewski, added charm and solemnity to the occasion.</p>
   
   <p>Both young and old attended the morning and evening services. Countless people received the Blessed Sacrament. Many priests of the local parishes assisted in the services.</p>
