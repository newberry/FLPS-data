   <p>Almost every issue of Polish newspapers brings us the news of rowdyism and fighting that takes place at our balls, dances, etc. and, also in our Polish saloons. Can it be that the feeling of good will towards our fellowman is dead within us? The fault for the shaming of our good Polish name is attributed mostly to our saloon-keepers. They not only should forbid the sale of intoxicants to minors and to those persons under the influence of liquor but also dispatch every inebriate home.</p>
   <p>A large portion of complaints and suits in courts is due to drinking. From which only the lawyers benefit from our hard earned money.</p>
   <p>To maintain a normal and moral life, largely depends upon us.</p>
