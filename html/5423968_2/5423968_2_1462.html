   <p>The Poles are sometimes proud of the fact that we live in a country of freedom and equality; where all classes of society are alike; a country where we have a Constitution.</p>
   <p>This great equality about which we speak so proudly and write so much, how does it look when put into use?</p>
   <p>But nowhere is there as much opposition among the different classes as here. It is true that even the poorest worker possesses the same equal rights as the wealthy person--but capital crushes the poor man more painfully than in Europe.</p>
   <p>Nowhere, are the lives and the health of the workers so disregarded as here. A few thousand workers are hurt seriously every year by railroad accidents--a few hundred are killed every year.</p>
   <p>In every town and city in Illinois there is a different statute concerning the <span class="page-break">\2</span>damages of the workers employed by railroads. The grand jury receives many of these cases, and favors in most cases the injured party, many times awarding large compensations for the injuries. In many cases the verdict results in doom for the railroad, every time the jury meets to decide the case and the health of the insured worker.</p>
   <p>At last the court has reached the stage where it will not decide on a case unless the injured party has or is represented by a lawyer. This is now the formality of court procedure.</p>
   <p>In many cases the workers do not speak or write English, some understand it very little, therefore the worker chooses occasionally a poor lawyer to represent him in his damage suit, often resulting in the loss of his case and no damages paid. Should he win his case then the lawyer charges so much for his services that the biggest percentage of the money goes to the lawyer.</p>
   <p>In the face of these facts the workers should consider their standing with <span class="page-break">\3</span>the company, their years of service with the company. Be careful at all times, do not slow down because your friend was injured and mistreated in his court case, but stand side by side and unite in all your work and actions, demand your rights, but let there be no bloodshed. Demand also for the workers the right to vote on different new laws and acts thus determining their attitude in regard to them.</p>
   <p>The Polish workers should strive to learn to read and write the English language, or ask their children or neighbors to help them. Thus they could read the bulletins and know the changes in the wage scale or in the total hours worked and the hourly basis of pay for different classes of work.</p>
   <p>Please take this into consideration, it will help you all.</p>
