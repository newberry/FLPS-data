   <p>Famous are Polish weddings and christenings. Polish wedding celebrations are famous because beer and whiskey are not the only things that flow at these celebrations, but also Polish blood from the bodies of the celebrants.</p>
   <p>The people dance and drink, drink and dance, and when they get weary of dancing and drinking, when their beads begin to swim, then presto! one after the other: battles, disgrace, jail.</p>
   <p>Miniature wedding celebrations are the Polish christenings. Let our correspondent from Natrona, Pa., describe to you how they are conducted. He writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"A certain father gave a christening here with much merrymaking. He invited many guests to this christening, because there was a reason for it. There were twelve kegs of beer and several gallons of whiskey. This was indeed a good time. Oh boy! Oh boy! but now it turned into <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a great sorrow. Every thing went all right at the start. The guests drank and drank, and the father of the newly born child was extremely overjoyed and was already tapping the eleventh keg, and it being the eleventh hour of the night, therefore, high time to start a fight.</p>
   <p>When these warriors really went to work they soon made a "hash" of pitchers, glasses, chairs, stew pans and other utensils: they broke everything into pieces during this civil war.</p>
   <p>The next day they went to the 'squire' so that he would make peace between them, and he, as a penalty, fined each and everyone of them very heavily.</p>
   <p>And do you think this was the end? Not on your life! When Polish 'warriors' begin to play there is no beginning and no end.</p>
   <p>So then, on July 11th and 15th, they sent to court two complaints - now comes the dragging and wandering from court to court.</p>

   <p>To what does the reasoning of a 'drunk' lead one?</p>
   <p>Instead of using one's coin for the needs of everyday life, one throws it to waste. Not stopping to think how hard one had to work for it. And they are those people and these drunkards, habitual drunkards who never go to church, but every Sunday they have whiskey upon the table and pray to it.</p>
   <p>They do not belong to any society nor to the Roman-Catholic Union; they do not contribute to the church collection because they say the priest is a robber.</p>
   <p>Thus they are taught by the 'yellow' press.</p>
   <p>Rehold! Nonsense swallowing up your better judgment. To the church they do not contribute, even if this is the sacred duty of every Pole <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and Catholic, but instead of this they give their church offerings to the 'squire.'</p>
   <p>Shame and disgrace!</p>
   <p>And you, Mr. Editor, print this in your paper so that people might know about these drunks who are bringing shame upon us."</p>
