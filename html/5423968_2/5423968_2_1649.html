   <p>The severe cold weather of recent days has increased the deplorable conditions of the packing house strikers. Many of them are without proper clothing, food, and coal, which is high in cost. Let us remember these poor families and try as much as possible to help them in their plight. Those wishing to make some kind of offering are urged to do so. All contributions should be sent to union headquarters, District Council No. 9, 1700 W. 48th Street. The secretary, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will acknowledge all contributions.</p>
