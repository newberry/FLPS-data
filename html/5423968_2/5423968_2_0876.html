   <p>About one hundred persons, most of them Irish, appeared at the New City Police Station, located at 47th and Paulina St. (Town of Lake), Chicago, where a coroner's inquest was held over the body of Alexander Jarecki, 31 years old, who lived at 4731 S. Rockwell St.</p>
   <p>The report of Dr. Edward H. Hatton from the coroner's bureau, reads that Jarecki's death was caused by a blow on the left temple.</p>
   <p>The witnesses testified that Hurley Kelsey, and Irishman, 33 years old, residing at 4757 S. Rockwell St., and employed by the American Foundry Equipment Company as a machinist, on the 27th day of August, by a powerful blow on the head, knocked down Mr. Jarecki when they met on that date a 47th and Rockwell St. Jarecki fell down from the sidewalk <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>into the bushes and died five minutes later. The Irishman began to run away by, seeing that two girls from the neighborhood witnessed the whole incident, turned back and helped to carry his victim home.</p>
   <p>There were many witnesses on both sides, Polish and Irish. Karol Pawlak, a policeman, and Gertrude Dart, a Lithuanian, were the interpreters.</p>
   <p>Attorney J. J. McDermott defended the accused Irishman. The widow of the Pole who was killed was represented by Attorney J. A. Lasecki. The deputy coroner evidently does not commit "sins of impartiality," for he has allowed the Irish witnesses to testify about some affrays, accusing Jerecki, but he would not allow the Polish witnesses to testify against the defendant about the threats that he had made against Jarecki a few weeks before the fatal incident.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>He also forbade the Polish witnesses to testify about the character and former deeds of the defendant. It is a fact that the defendant had expressed himself in the presence of his landlord hat, "I'll kill that Polak."</p>
   <p>The jury freed the Irishman on account of the alleged indecent remarks made by the deceased about Kelsey and his wife. The widow, however, will take her case to the higher courts, before the grand jury.</p>
