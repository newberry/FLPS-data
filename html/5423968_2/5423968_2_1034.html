   <p>The Chicago school census, published two years ago, created in me a feeling of indignation that Poles were listed as Prussians, Russians or Austrians. The census takers were blamed and accused of completely ignoring the Polish national group by entering the Poles under and incorrect classification. The Polish newspapers, on the other hand, repressed their grievances against the Polish people because they did not list themselves as Poles. Another census was taken this year and again many articles on this topic were printed in the Polish newspapers. The Polish people were again reminded to list themselves as Poles.</p>
   <p>The result, however, was approximately the same, with but a slight variation. This year, because I was anxious to have as correct a count of Polish children as possible, and to convince myself of where the blame for the injustice done the Poles in this respect lay, I succeeded in obtaining the position <span class="page-break">2</span>of census taker. I was greatly disappointed in my expectations. Although I requested Polish precincts, I was given the Swedish Norwegian, Danish or German settlements with a comparatively low percentage of Poles. Despite the fact that I met but a few Poles, I endeavored to list them as having been born in Poland. In many instances I had to persuade them through argument that they were natives of Poland, and not of Prussia or some other nation. Of the number of census takers in the Twenty-seventh Ward, one-third were Poles. These, however, were people who were born in America, who were unable to understand that the Poles have a right to consider themselves as having been born in Poland even though the country has no political independence. Moreover, these census takers considered it wrong to list Poles as having been born in Poland. "Poland?" asked one of the census takers. "There is no such country." From his expression I could tell that he considered me a simple idiot.</p>
   <p>The blanket form of the census had a column denoting the nationality of those interviewed. At the head of this column the word "Nativity" could be found, and below it: "Father born--Mother born--Child born," and <span class="page-break">3</span>somewhat lower there was "write country only".</p>
   <p>Thus we can see that the census taker, after filling the column requesting the place of birth, had no need nor cause to ask about the nationality, an act which was continually perpetrated. Consequently, it is evident that to remind the people, to implore them to list themselves as having been born in Poland, is a useless waste of paper, since a majority of them pay no heed to the requests and pleas. The only possible way to correct this is to endeavor to have a column with the heading "Nationality" besides the present column containing the heading "Nativity." If this were done, then less than one per cent of the Poles would list themselves as other than "Polish."</p>
