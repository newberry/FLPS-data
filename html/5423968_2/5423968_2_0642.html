   <p>The bringing up of girls is a subject of so much importance that we could never write too much about it. Education is one of its constituents. Emancipation has made a higher education for girls, one equal to that of the boys, imperative. We should therefore not forget the school of practical life, which is an essential part of this education. After a little girl, of the age of six years starts going to school, she becomes more like a guest in her home, she shares so little time with her family, and their interests.</p>
   <p>After completing her higher education, at the age of 18, or 19, she is a matured young lady thinking of marriage, and becomes somewhat of a goddess in her home; beautiful and well dressed, who, like a fleeting bird will fly away most any day, never to return. Little Mamie or Sophia leaves her home, with books under her arms, at 8:30 in the morning, returns home for lunch at noon-time and school again in the afternoon; then homework. Some of the girls take music lessons besides. She goes to bed early in order to be fit for tomorrow. The older she gets the more studies she has.</p>
   <p>A young lady of 15 summers, may know all about the capes of Africa and can name historical events in chronological order; but she does not know how to prevent her washing from getting yellow; how to economize on fuel, or how to detect an inferior quality of butter.</p>

   <p>Quite often, there is truth in some of the many jokes referring to the ignorance of the young housewife who ordered her maid to place the eggs in the nest until they were larger; or that a sirloin steak comes only from a certain part of an ox and so on. Indeed, this is not funny, but a very sad fact, which proves how inadequate and impractical the bringing up and education of our young ladies, of today, is.</p>
   <p>An intelligent mother spoke to me once about her daughters in this trend: "When will they learn house-work? I do not know, but I do know that girls of today are not what they should be. Their school life, and social activities outside of their home, has made them indifferent toward faily duties, and has carried them so far away from the restfulness and tranquility of their home that I have the presentiment, they will never be good wives or mothers."</p>
   <p>Our modern young ladies think that house work is monotonous, and not worth the while; and even degrading. They look down upon those foolish "geese" who mend clothes, or use their hands in the kitchen for cooking. A young lady, after graduating, looks for an office job; she would rather work a few hours in an office and come home to eat a canned dinner than to stay home and trouble herself about any-thing in the way of housework. But, after marriage, when the young husband brings his young "Mrs." home, after a honey-moon of a few months, comes the reality of life, and he questions the minus in place of the plus. No matter how many diplomas or even patents a girl has, they are of no import if she is not taught to live her life in a way that will <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>give her the most valuable experience of how to properly care for her home and her husbands earnings.</p>
   <p>If the young housewife is not fitted for the duties of a wife, her life will not be a happy one.</p>
