   <p>"Woman, you vain creature. A vain creature possessed of a miraculous form but a heart filled with evil and perversity."</p>
   <p>Such an opinion about women was given out by Mickiewicz, a Polish poet. He must have written these words while greatly incensed, because it is difficult to assume that he really thought that way about women. Indeed, the heart of a woman is an inexhaustible treasure of goodness, gentleness, tenderness and many other virtues! The heart of a woman only knows one happiness in the world: To love and be loved.</p>
   <p>When God created, as an image of Himself, the most perfect creature on earth - man - He found out immediately that the whole world is not sufficient for a man, that to be a success a man needed something more beautiful, more perfect, and in His inexhaustible goodness, God created a woman as a man's companion and a most beautiful adornment of paradise.</p>

   <p>So she remained forever. The wife is the most faithful and the best companion of the husband - his helpmate, support, and powerful anchor when the canoe of his life begins to totter on the waves of the raging world. Fortunate is he who finds a heart which he can confide in and on which he can rely....a heart full of devotion and love.</p>
   <p>Oh that love! that powerful sensation supreme..."in which throbs the life of the whold world, and which entwines for us the thorns with the flowers...." Love, transforming the desert into paradise and the wild steppes into a charmed land of miracles!</p>
   <p>With love they devote themselves. An unselfish love, pure, noble, whole-hearted! A woman only knows how to love! A woman lives and dies with her love.</p>
   <p>A woman is the right hand of a man and a crown upon his head. Everything that he gives to her she receives with gratitude, she believes in him, <span class="page-break">3</span>confides in him and feels fortunate when she is able to take part in his work and perplexities. Even if she does not understand various dealings as well as he, that born knack in her of easily acquiring the knowledge of things can be of great help to him.</p>
   <p>A woman also is an answer to-a man's honor. She is the sunshine in his home which brightens and warms up everything. She is a careful and economical housewife, the conducting, experienced hand of the entire household to the satisfaction of the husband, children and all the members of the home.</p>
   <p>She must share fortunes and misfortunes with her husband peacefully and without murmuring, and her words of cheer should be the support that keeps him going forward bravely and safely on the thorny path of life. Her hopes should encourage him and fill him with desire to work, her virtues and grandeur of thought ought to be a mirror of his own character and induce him into perfection in all respects.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>A woman is not weaker when it concerns the overcoming of temptations and the bearing of severities. The heart of a woman is then as strong as her love.</p>
   <p>A woman is always inclined to forgive, to make peace, and becomes oftentimes great in hours of suffering. She has an open hand, a word from the heart for the poor and the unfortunate. Arguments and contradictions are disliked by her because they harm the harmony of her soul, and wherever her soft palm rests there peace reigns and quiet fortune.</p>
