   <p>In an article entitled "Pole-eating Insanity" in yesterday's Dziennik Zwiazkowy, we said a few words of truth to a few of "our brothers" the Lithuanian separatists, who are really being carried away by a sort of Pole-eating insanity, doing their best to put the Poles and the Polish cause in the worst light at every opportunity, as if the freedom and future development of Lithuania depended upon it.</p>
   <p>In today's article we are forced to say a few words of truth to "our brothers" the Ukrainians, who are competing with the Lithuanian separatists, and are even trying to outdo them in their "noble work" of discrediting the Poles.</p>
   <p>The predaceous Ukrainian newspaper, Swoboda, incessantly attacks the Poles and slanders them in the basest manner, going even as far as denunciation, <span class="page-break">\2</span>accusing the Poles of disloyalty to this country, of betrayal--saying that Poles have even been arrested for this.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that this sheet gives a true translation of everything it writes to the postal authorities, thus being itself regarded as disloyal, it dares to publish articles directed against the Poles, questioning their loyalty to the United States.</p>
   <p>In an article entitled "Paper Patriotism of the Poles" which appeared recently, such Polish crimes as these were cited:</p>
   <p>"In Brooklyn, New York, a thirty-year-old Pole, B. Ostrowski, was arrested for having said that President Wilson is no administrator, and that the young Austrian emperor could do better. So said a 'patriotic' Pole. In Waterbury, Connecticut, Joseph Zandrowski was arrested for having said that foreigners in the American Army are sent to the battle front, while American-born soldiers stay behind the lines and play ball. In another city, a Pole (?), Karol <span class="page-break">\3</span>Natrebu (?), came near to being stoned for tearing an American flag from a flagpole and saying, 'to h--1 with this country.' Natrebu was arrested."</p>
   <p>The same sheet, Swoboda, organ of those vicious Ukrainians who produced Sicinski, the murderer of Potocki, strikes also at the Polish recruiting stations, urging that the Poles have no right to form their own army. Here the "paper patriotism" of the Ukrainians, of which they accuse the Poles, can clearly be seen. They cannot help the Germans in any other way, for they must remain silent; so they harm the Polish Army by denunciations, which is tantamount to betrayal of the Allied cause, and therefore of the American cause, for the Polish Army is fighting on the side of the Allies--and even for the Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>Swoboda [Freedom] might easily lose its "freedom" by writing this way; it might become acquainted with the laws of this country, especially during the emergencies of wartime. We warn the Ukrainians not to play with fire, and to leave the Poles in peace, for the Poles need nothing from the Ukrainians and <span class="page-break">\4</span>do not reckon with them at all; the Poles did not sell themselves to the Germans as did the Ukrainians in Europe, as was revealed by Krysiak before the war, nor as now, when the Ukrainians surrendered themselves to the Prussian command because they were promised a portion of Polish territory.</p>
   <p>That somewhere the authorities arrested a Pole for a thoughtless remark against the government and laws of this country need not make you so happy, for you yourselves probably have more interned countrymen than we--for the same offenses; we know this, and doubtless you know it even better yourselves. Whoever comes out against this country or its government, whoever tries to support the Kaiser's cause and harm that of the United States and the Allies deserves imprisonment or worse. But do not be so happy, gentlemen of Swoboda, that Poles have been arrested, for, by God, more of your people have been arrested, although there are far fewer of you here than of us.</p>
   <p>On the whole, we Poles have never betrayed the Allied cause, either in Europe, where the Prussian mailed fist held us down, or here in America, proof of which <span class="page-break">\5</span>lies in the fact that instead of uniting with the Germans over there [as the Ukrainians did]. We are forming a Polish Army to help crush the Germans and to wrest not only ourselves, but you Ukrainians as well, from shameful slavery.</p>
   <p>The American government, through its great-souled President Wilson, has granted that Poland must be united, free, and self-governing; we have been given permission to organize a Polish Army that is already shedding its blood on the battle fields by the side of the Allies. Where are you, who hate the Poles so? Beware of attacking the Polish Army, beware of agitating against it, for such actions may lead to prison. If you cannot do more than stage student riots or murder Potockis, then at least remain silent, so that it will be forgotten that you are alive.</p>
