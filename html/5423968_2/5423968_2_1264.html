   <p>A special short session was held last night by the Committee of Fifteen to lay plans for a continued protest against Russia. After a discussion about this program a motion was made to make public a statement acknowledging the fact that there is no truth in any of Jacob Tamillo's articles regarding the protest meeting and Father V. Barzynski. It was unanimously agreed upon.</p>
   <p>The adopted declaration reads as follows: "It is hereby acknowledged that the character of Jacob Tamillo and the nature of his articles have no moral support and therefore should be disregarded as facts. His items in the Nowy Swiat (New World), <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>are contaminated with lies and polemic statements. His attack on Father Vincent Barzynski, who should be lauded for his untiring work in helping our people survive, are nothing but a pack of lies and calumniations.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Tamillo writes that Father Barzynski sprang like a mad tigar and beckoned to the chairman of the meeting to have him taken off the stand.</p>
   <p>"This is a lie along with his other statements for I took away his privilege to speak without the influence of Father Barzynski, at the protest meeting of January 1. I was prompted to do this by his insulting phraseology and the quality of his speech."</p>
   <p>The statement is signed by</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa and twenty-one witnesses</p>
   <p>(Names given)</p>

   <p>The meeting was held at St. Stanislaus Kostkas School Hall.</p>
