   <p>The call for unity and harmony on the part of our countrymen in Galicia must seem strange to us, the more so since the division into two camps there is even more marked than it is here, while the hope of uniting them seems much smaller.</p>
   <p>As we have said on other occasions, the so-called liberal camp here is by no means composed entirely of people who are hostile to the Catholic religion, and for this reason, enemies of the clergy also. On the contrary, many of them are Catholics--devout Catholics. Only the leadership of this movement rests--perhaps with certain exceptions--in the hands of individuals hostile to the Catholic religion; if the others follow them, they do so for the most part in good faith, trusting in the leaders' word that this or that priest is unworthy, or allowing themselves to be blinded by the patriotism of the <span class="page-break">2</span>leaders that most often consists of nothing more than empty speeches and stock phrases. The means whereby this minority gained leadership can easily be understood by anyone who studies their tactics, which depend upon fairly good expression and a noisy eloquence, devoid of deeper meaning perhaps, but nonetheless impressive. Wherever necessary they know how to melt the hearts of honest folk and move them by a recital of their own merits.</p>
   <p>The majority of our people must finally open their eyes; they are gradually doing so, for there is a growing dissatisfaction with these leaders. A few of the more moderate liberals have already made efforts toward reaching an understanding. Their plans have always been upset either by the [so-called liberal]leaders themselves (who want discord), by the passive majority, or, it must be admitted, by certain individuals in the opposite camp.</p>
   <p>Is the situation similar in Galicia? Decidedly not. There each camp is composed of people who think alike; any understanding between the two camps seems impossible and the rift between them becomes steadily greater.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Conditions are much the same in the conservative camp here [as in the liberal]. While we definitely favor the conservatives, we must admit, for the sake of justice, that here also are individuals who prevent any understanding from being reached. In general, the public is opposed to the liberal leaders who have gained the sympathy of a great many people; the public sides with the clergy in gratitude for the good the latter has done the people in this country. This same public desires peace and harmony, provided acceptable terms are proposed. There are conservative individuals, however, who not only prevent an understanding from being reached, who not only upset all plans for such an understanding, but who also harm their own cause by unnecessary vehemence and lack of dignity. These individuals not only condemn the entire liberal camp, but also accuse its members of ill will, liberalism in the worst sense of the word, atheism, and Freemasonry, referring to them as people devoid of faith and honor. What is worse, they use the same tactics as their opponents, often engaging in hot, unsavory personal polemics. In their blind rage, they even stoop to misrepresentation of facts. They are equally vehement against the rational members of their own camp (which <span class="page-break">4</span>is also true among the liberals), and this results in inexpressibly unpleasant internal quarrels. On seeing this, the public loses respect for such individuals, whose principles may be sound but whose methods cannot be condoned. Aided by certain newspapers that gladly accept and publish even the most fiery and controversial articles, these people merely add fuel to the fire.</p>
   <p>Let the [extremist] minority be removed from leadership in the liberal camp, let the [extremist] minority among the conservatives be silenced--which, after all, is possible in both cases and may be effected in the near future--and conditions among us will be entirely different. When such is the case, we shall no longer need to be ashamed of ourselves before [the people of] Poland, and especially, before[the people of] Galicia.</p>
