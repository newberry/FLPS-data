   <p>Solemn rites were performed yesterday at St. John Cantius Parish to mark the introduction of a relic of its patron saint which was received from the late Cardinal Dunajewski of Cracow.</p>
   <p>The affair was an outstanding religious event at the parish. All the church societies turned out en masse, in full regalia. Five priests participated in the celebration services: Reverend Joseph Barzynski, Reverend Adolph Nowicki, Reverend Serafin Cosimi, and two priests of the parish (names not given).</p>
   <p>The introduction services were as follows:</p>
   <p>Reverend Joseph Barzynski, as deacon, escorted by priests and cadets, carried the relic of St. John Cantius from the rectory to the portals of the church. The societies formed a guard of honor.</p>
   
   <p>At the portals of the church Reverend John Kasprzycki, C.R., paster of St. John Cantius Parish, received the relic and, accompanied by Reverend J. Barzynski and Reverend Cosimi, subdeacon, carried it to the altar, while the parish choir sang a hymn to St. John Cantius. Every parishioner received a copy of this hymn.</p>
   <p>After this, vespers were celebrated, followed by a sermon delivered by Reverend Nawrocki. This was followed by the choirs singing "Cor Jesu Flagrans." Then the blessing of the relic took place. When this was concluded, all these present kissed the relic in turn.</p>
   <p>The services were impressive, and all left the church satisfied that the parish has a relic of its patron saint to look over them and remember them.</p>
