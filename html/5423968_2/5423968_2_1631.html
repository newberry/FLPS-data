   <p>Many of our workers, who have been out on strike in the Stockyards, have been re-employed; however, there are still a large number out of work. It is expected that in a short time the strikebreakers will realize that they were responsible for the workers losing the strike, who were only trying to get better consideration for themselves and others, and then they will leave their jobs and go elsewhere. If this happens all the strikers will be back on their jobs and Polish trade will regain its former position in Town of Lake.</p>
