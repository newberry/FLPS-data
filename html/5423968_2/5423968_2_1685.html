   <p>Yesterday, Stockyards' strikers called upon [James J.] Davis, Secretary of Labor, to request that the government take steps to bring about a settlement of the strike. A plea made by C. J. Hayes, president of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers (sic), asked that the pay cut be cancelled and that an arbitrator be appointed to decide the question of the reduction. Other representatives of the union stated that they are doing everything within their power to avert bloodshed in the strike areas, but picketing will continue until the strike is settled.</p>
