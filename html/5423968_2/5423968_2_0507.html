   <p>If we go back a few years, everyone must admit that at that time there were in our midst many more people of better means and almost everyone had a sufficient support for himself and his family. Today those signs are more rare and in its stead are to be found poverty and misery. Everybody, regardless of their social standing, and especially the clergy, should try their utmost to protect the society from its extermination by the threat which comes from that terrible enemy of the human race - drunkenness.</p>
   <p>All the false prophets who put themselves forth as leaders of the people, pretending to be their friends; those who in writing and at meetings foment strikes and urge the peaceful people to participate in them as a result of which many a family is thrown into poverty, would serve society better, and especially the good workingmen if by good example in word and deed, they would try and keep people from drunkenness, so that the one who by the <span class="page-break">2</span>sweat of his brow works for his money, would not be sitting around in saloons, but would use that money to buy bread for himself, his wife and children.</p>
   <p>That drunkenness is demoralizing and causing misery to society, more now than ever, can be proven by the increase in personal debts, the number of judgments rendered by the courts, and the number of fines whose source can be traced to drunkenness.</p>
   <p>He who cares to be still more convinced of this sad picture of demoralization, this sad result of drunkenness has only to ask the judges sitting in our courts, who day in and day our have to deal with matters of this kind.</p>
   <p>Beware of drunkenness.</p>
