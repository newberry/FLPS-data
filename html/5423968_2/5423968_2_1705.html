   <p>It has always been and will be our opinion that in all important matters we should follow reason, not the emotion, for whoever does not know how to control his emotions by reason, such a one always does something foolish, and loses out.</p>
   <p>Common sense should be used in all important undertakings. We should not follow the blind advice given by people whose veracity is questionable. Unfortunately we Poles have a habit of following our emotions instead of our reason. We submit easily to the advice of strangers, and reject perfectly good and sound advice given to us by our friends. On account of this habit we suffer all kinds or misfortunes for which we feel sorry when it is too late. Not long ago the following Polish proverb was formed: "Madry Polak Poszkodzie" (Wise becomes the Pole, after damage takes its toll).</p>
   <p>The incidents of the last few days, connected with the Stock Yards strike, were responsible for these remarks. Indeed, they were very sad and painful <span class="page-break">\2</span>incidents, for many of our countrymen sustained bodily injuries and some of them were jailed.</p>
   <p>Simple, every-day common-sense tells us that there must be a limit to, and justice in everything; our reason tells us that we have a right to defend ourselves and request amends for injustice done to us, but we must not harm others, because this leads to murder, destruction, anarchy and misery to all.</p>
   <p>The American laws do not forbid strikes. If the workers think that they are mistreated and there is no other way to remedy the evil they should go on strike, providing they know that they are strong enough to win the strike. However, a strike should not be compulsory. If someone desires to strike let him do so; but if anyone desires to work he should not be compelled to strike by beating, threatening or any other violence;for such action would be terrorism, a limitation of personal liberty, which is despotism not democracy.</p>
   <p>According to the United States Supreme Court decision, the strikers have a right to picket - that is to watch from a distance how many are working and how many <span class="page-break">\3</span>are not. They are even allowed to agitate among the strike-breakers on the outside of the factory, but this agitation should not be connected with threats and violence because violence causes disturbance, fights and murders, which cannot be allowed by any authority. Such is the law in every democratic country, and this law must be respected by all. As soon as the strikers begin to threaten the strike-breakers with revolvers, knives, fists or any other weapons; as soon as someone starts a fight; the police will have to step in and establish order, arrest the guilty ones, and if they do not wish to give in the police must use physical force. This is what has happened in Chicago. The police, not investigating the actual state of affairs, attacked the throng striking the guilty and innocent. The guilty, usually well prepared, were able to get away in time, but the innocent were killed, injured or crippled. And these innocent ones were the Poles.</p>
   <p>This is not all, for the court forbade the picketing, and the local authorities called out a powerful police detail which maintains strict order in the Stock <span class="page-break">\4</span>Yards district and does not allow the strikers to communicate with the strike-breakers.</p>
   <p>Who suffers most due to this? Is it the owners of the Stock Yards? No! Only the strikers and their families. Therefore we advise our countrymen to be peaceful, to conduct the fight within the limits of the law and avoid disturbance. Follow your own common sense and do not heed the socialistic agitators.</p>
