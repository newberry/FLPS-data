   <p>To Mr. Felka, who considers the article published in Dziennik Zwiazkowy, under the caption "Can We Condemn Parochial Schools in America?", somewhat exaggerated, the author of this article is grateful. He is grateful to Mr. Felka for stating his criticisms, because our purpose in writing is to get the general public to read and to express its opinions, and not to use the unread newspaper for wrapping up lunch to take along to the factory. I have tried to answer my honorable opponent briefly and completely, with all due respect for some of his apt observations.</p>
   <p>1. To Mr. Felka, [praise for] the teaching of the Polish language in the Polish schools appears laughable, because he says that it is the purpose of Polish schools to teach Polish. Mr. Felka contradicts himself immediately by declaring that America is not Prussia or Russia, where children are forced to study German or Russian. Apparently Mr. Felka does not know that even in some states in America, the same battle is being waged as in Prussia or Russia, where the teaching of the Polish language is absolutely prohibited during school hours. How will Mr. Felka answer this? "Sapientibus sat!"</p>
   <p>2. Mr. Felka condemns the Polish clergy and Polish teachers on the grounds that they evidently do not know how to inculcate a love for the Polish language in Polish children, since these children speak English at home, on the street, and even in school. Invent, Sir, a medicine for inoculating Polish children with a love for their own language, and we will acknowledge you the genius of the twentieth century. My colleague was a missionary in England for six years, and presents this picture of how the masses absorb individuals. At Uddingstone, in Scotland, there are more than seven hundred Poles employed in the coal mines, and about one hundred Irishmen. The Irish children there speak Polish more fluently than English. That is not all! The British consul at Warsaw complains that his children cannot speak English, while they do speak Polish fluently. What will Mr. Felka reply to this? Are the clergy or teachers responsible for this? It fills us with deep regret to have to ask--even to beg--our compatriots for money for schools and teachers, in order to bring children up in the Polish spirit. And what is the result of our efforts? A sad one, because the children speak English, feel like Americans, and consider themselves Americans! I know several priests who prohibit the use of English, and punish children severely for using it, but it is of no avail. I know also of priests who give little presents to children who speak Polish, and this too is of no avail. I know also of parents who love their language and sincerely want their children also to speak it, but their punishments and threats do no good. The only way in which the Polish language could be preserved in America would be to concentrate all the Poles in one state, but then we would be separated from the Yankees by a Chinese wall, and the resultant economic situation would be intolerable. The Jews, deeply attached as they are to their religion and language, complain that their children are losing their national identity in such places as Warsaw or Cracow. What will Mr. Felka say to this? Are the parasitic priests responsible for it?</p>
   <p>3. Mr. Felka declares that Polish priests, under pressure from American, or rather Irish bishops, and fearing for their jobs, neglect Polish children. Naturally, we as soldiers must obey the commands of our superiors, but many of our bishops understand the difficulty of our position, and let us make our own decisions. It is true that there are priests who are too much concerned with climbing to a higher position in the church hierarchy; they agree to everything in advance, instead of explaining their position to their bishop, who would certainly show them some consideration.</p>
   <p>4. My critic, Mr. Felka, does not see that the clergy here has done anything for the enlightenment and welfare of the Poles. If Mr. Felka was born in America, to whom is my honorable opponent indebted for the fact that he can read, write, and criticize, if not to the Polish clergy? If by chance Mr. Felka's parents have attended to his education up to this point, he is indeed an exception.</p>
   <p>5. My honorable critic argues further that the Polish clergy as a whole, except for a few individuals here and there, does nothing. He holds up, as an example for us to follow, the clergy in Prussia, who besides Mass and school take an interest in food co-operatives, etc. This is a beautiful, even a miraculous project! Mr. Felka is indeed a Moses, who loves his people. Would that we had more such inventors of projects--we could talk a good Polish nation into existence! I emphasized at the outset of my article that the Polish clergy has done much and is continuing to do much for its beloved compatriots. To whom are we indebted for the fact that parents and especially children do speak Polish?</p>
   <p>[6.] Mr. Felka urges us to institute food co-operatives, loan associations, etc. Suppose that we were to try, do you believe that we could convince you?</p>
   
   <p>Never! Some priests have established orphanages, to prevent Polish children from being sent to Irish or American orphanages, and to keep them from losing their national identity. What do some of our progressive papers call the founders of these noble institutions? They call them businessmen, penny snatchers, etc. Therefore, would they be likely to admit that we were right and worthy of respect if we were to follow your idea and establish loan associations, etc? I am morally certain that you would bespatter us with mud at the very beginning and report us to our Irish bishops. Mr. Felka will surely ask why the priests in Poznan can do these things. Do they not have to swallow the same kinds of false accusations that we do? Are they not called thieves, etc? There is a great difference between the Polish clergy in Prussia and the Polish clergy here in America. There the clergy is recruited from among educated men, who have graduated from higher institutions of learning, whereas, here--better that I break my pen than dare to write about the education of the Polish clergy in America, lest I collide with my confreres.</p>
   
   <p>7. Mr. Felka says that my comparison of the Polish clergy with that of the Irish and the Italians is not fair, because our unfortunate country is urging all Poles to try to catch up with other nations. This is true. But the Irish, Italian, and French priests, though they have done nothing for their people in a national sense, are respected and do not have such epithets as parasites, idlers, etc., hurled at them as we so often do. Do you believe that this sort of conduct toward us will encourage us to make greater efforts? Never! How do our people often show us their gratitude when one of the priests grants them a favor? Most frequently they respond by becoming his enemies!</p>
   <p>8. We here in New England know nothing of imbuing children with hatred toward the Polish National Alliance; an aspersion of this sort is new to us; perhaps some such situation does exist in Chicago. If there are priests or teachers who engage in the useless occupation of dividing us into two camps they should be dealt with severely. Who are the members of the Alliance and of the Polish Roman Catholic Union? They are the same Poles, the same Catholics who hear Mass, partake of the Holy Sacrament, have the same God, and love the same country--Poland.</p>
