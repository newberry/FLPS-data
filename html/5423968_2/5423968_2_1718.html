   <p>After a day of apparent peace in the area of the stockyards, street riots broke the spell. About 4 P. M. yesterday, large crowds began to gather at 44th and Ashland Avenue. Many began to look around for bricks and stones to throw at the workers as they left the packing houses after a day's work. As the workers began to pour out of the plants, they were virtually stoned. The police, under the direction of Captain Carol Atkinson, were unable to control the mob, which tried to seek revenge against the strikebreakers for not joining their cause.</p>
   <p>Rioting started in several places at once. The entire locality from 51st Street to 31st Street and from Wood to Halsted Streets was filled with strikers and riots. Over twenty thousand people took part in the street brawls. Amidst these crowds, women with ruffled hair, torn dresses, and ragged skirts could be seen scuffling with the police as they tried to break up the gangs.</p>
   
   <p>In sympathy with the strikers many workers, such as, copper-smiths, electricians, plumbers, etc., left their work to watch the crowds attack the police.</p>
   <p>When Chief of Police Fitzmorris received news of the rioting, he called out all the police reserves, ordered all saloons closed in the area of the stockyards, and left for the scene of battle. When a mob appeared, chasing a group of strikebreakers, the Chief of Police ordered his men to strike at the attackers. The women who led the mobs with the cry "Beat the Cossacks," threw themselves at the police.</p>
   <p>During this scuffle the life of Chief Fitzmorris was endangered, and it was spared only because the police fired shots at the mob. This caused the rioters to move away from the scene and disperse. The result of this rioting was the loss of many lives, and the wounding of countless numbers of people.</p>
   
   <p>Just as the police succeeded in scattering this mob, reports were received that another riot had begun at 49th and Racine Avenue. Over five thousand persons had gathered here, both men and women. Non-union men were recognized milling about the crowd. A fierce battle ensued, leaving twenty persons strewn about the streets, either killed or severely wounded. During the interim, as the balance of the victory inclined in favor of the police, news came through that over one thousand workers had gathered at 33rd and Fisk Streets, and had begun to attack the homes' of the strikebreakers. This report came just as one of the woman workers, Mary Buczynska, pounced upon policemen Mueller and Jungblut. The crowd dragged them from their motorcycles and beat them severely.</p>
   <p>This incident seemed to have incited the crowd anew, for they began to shout as they attacked the homes. Policeman Mueller, who was wounded, began shooting into the raging mob and as police aid arrived a violent battle took place in the street, which ended when the strikers began to scatter. The police arrested Mary Buczynska and many persons who were non-union.</p>
   <p>After the crowds were dispersed and the situation surveyed, Chief of Police Fitzmorris put emergency measures into effect. Five hundred police reserves, one hundred and twenty-five mounted police, and one hundred motorcycle police were ordered to patrol the stockyards' region in the event of further outbreaks. Detectives disclosed that something is going to be done about planned riots because the radical element held special meetings while demonstrations were being staged by the strikers, which resulted in the above riots.</p>
