   <p>A new election law, for the first time this spring, will demand that the polling booths be at least 200 feet away from any kind of a business. The 7th ward in our city already happens to be looking for a place, in conformity with the above mentioned law, but just can't seem to find any place, because there is not one block in the whole ward where there is not a saloon.</p>
