   <p>The present century is a century of great industrial and commercial development. Industry is a more complicated machine today than any other product of the human mind. And the wonder of it is that this machine, which was once the terror of the workingman, supposedly threatening to take away his head, has become a blessing to mankind.</p>
   <p>With the development of machines comes the general development of human culture, and with the latter comes a great demand for the products of human industry. Thus industry develops and puts to work millions of people in every country.</p>
   <p>But today's industry demands intelligence from the worker; it demands adequate qualifications and specialization in its numerous and diversified fields. At the present time, we are witnesses to a great demand for skilled workmen <span class="page-break">\2</span>and mechanics of various kinds.</p>
   <p>Tradesmen and skilled workmen are paid relatively well throughout the world and especially in the United States, the wage scale steadily rising with the development of industry. We see here high office positions and other specialized lines of work that demand higher (often university) education paying less than skilled labor.</p>
   <p>A good skilled workman has a future before him; his livelihood, if not excellent, will at least be tolerable. The children of a skilled workman will receive an adequate education, and their parents need not worry about their future.</p>
   <p>The tendency of the human being to strive, in this short span of life, toward prosperity, toward progress in every field, toward a brighter ray of good fortune to illumine the daily struggle for a livelihood, is natural. And with the prosperity of individuals, the prosperity of nations advances, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>civilization progresses.</p>
   <p>We Poles stand in great need of this general prosperity, and we shall achieve it if we throw ourselves into commerce and industry. Without necessarily losing any of the characteristics of a nation of thinkers, artists, poets, novelists, and professionalists, we can turn the great remaining mass of hidden, latent energy into commerce and industry, into creative craftsmanship. The material is excellent, and a new future, free and bright, opens before us. But--thoughts and action must be turned upon the right path.</p>
   <p>Proof that this idea has long been with us lies in the existence of the Alliance Trade Institute in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania, alongside the Polish National Alliance Academy. Our Alliance members, understanding the significance of such an institute, ordered the idea to be acted upon, and the result surpassed all expectations; it even managed to reach official spheres in Washington, and to interest the government to such an extent that the Institute was chosen to train soldiers in the mechanical trades, so that they might <span class="page-break">\4</span>become better defenders of our nation.</p>
   <p>This is no small recognition and honor; it is an encouragement and inspiration to greater effort in this direction.</p>
   <p>But the highest gratitude and recognition will be in the hearts of those who have left, and who will leave, the Institute adequately armed with technical knowledge, unafraid of the struggle for life.</p>
   <p>However, even had the Polish National Alliance received no recognition, this fulfillment of a duty, the idea of a creditable action, the thought that every year a certain number of young men is going out into the world better prepared for the life struggle--young men who will earn a decent livelihood, and who will raise the value of the Polish name and add to the national income--this knowledge of having done a good deed, just as, for example, helping someone to attain a higher position, is generous and morally satisfying compensation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>True, these graduates will not be lawyers, doctors, learned men, nor authors spreading wide the fame of Poland throughout the world, but they will be skilled workmen, and skilled labor is just as useful and necessary as mental labor. If someone took upon himself the task of investigating the number of new inventions submitted to the patent office by Poles, and should find out how many of them have been exploited by Americans because of the lack of technical training of the Poles (therefore bringing no credit either to the inventor or his country), he would be astounded at the enormity of the field before us. A great genius for invention sleeps within us, and only a lack of proper direction and technical training prevents the polishing of these diamonds in the rough. You will see what a nation today's free Poland will be if its government will concern itself with the proper education of the people.</p>
   <p>A nation can be likened to an architectural structure. Its foundations are the farm workers, its walls the industrial workers, its style, towers, and architectural embellishments the intelligentsia, the poets, authors, artists, and learned men. The structure may be beautiful, its style excellent, and yet, <span class="page-break">\6</span>in looking upon this masterpiece, concern for its future suggests the questions: How good is its foundation? Of what material are the bricks in its walls? Let us build, and let us create that structural material of the most durable elements.</p>
   <p>Here in America we now have one Polish trade institute. It is, however, but a drop in the ocean compared to our national needs. The convention of the Polish National Alliance will soon be held; would it not be good to consider now the need for and the possibilities of creating more such trade schools, calling them to life by decision of the convention? Let them be branches of the Trade Institute in Cambridge Springs, but let them be placed in the larger Polish settlements, and let our young men educate themselves in the trades, using the evening school system.</p>
   <p>I am fully aware of the difficulties and the costs connected with the establishment of such schools, but without difficulties and expenses, no work can be accomplished. Let us take, for example, the establishment of schools by <span class="page-break">\7</span>the Galician Society for the Enlightenment of the People, and let us get to work!</p>
   <p>What a wonderful field for work lies right here in Chicago, for instance, where there is such a tremendous demand for trade schools! Other organizations could consider the trade school idea, too--for instance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union. Rivalry would be praiseworthy.</p>
