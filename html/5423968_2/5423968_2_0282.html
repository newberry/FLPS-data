   <p>The final exercises of the scholastic year of 1891-1892 in the school of the Venerable Sisters of Nazareth were held in the afternoon of July 2 in the hall located at 112 West Division Street. The downpour of rain, which had continued during the entire forenoon, subsided in time to permit the large audience to gather in the hall, which was decorated in greens and beautiful flowers. The attendance, to a large extent, consisted of the parents of the pupils of the school. The exercises turned out quite well and would have been an even greater success had not thick clouds gathered toward the close, causing the Venerable Sister Superior to eliminate several numbers of a lengthy program. From what had been exhibited we are convinced that the Venerable Sisters possess excellent methods of teaching, and that they are experienced and hard-working teachers. We repeat this with pleasure because we have seen that from the standpoint of the youthfulness of the pupils, the Venerable Sisters have satisfied the most exacting pedagogic demands. The Misses M. Barzynska, W. Wleklinska, Z. Brodowska, M. Schultz, G. Pankowna, F. Daniszowna, M. Makowska, K. Magnosowna, and Z. Waszewska, played musical compositions on the piano with precision and vivacity, bringing real honor to the Venerable Teachers and revealing [like-wise] the ability and the diligence of the pupils. Two of them surpassed the others, and one of these two was nearly exhausted with weariness; but in spite of this she played her music excellently. Who are they? That we will not tell for fear of awakening vanity in young hearts. Maybe we shall divulge their names next year--God willing--if they do not permit others to surpass them.</p>
   <p>In elocution an acknowledgement of priority is due Miss R. Sniegowska, and that from the standpoint of her accent and clear Polish speech as well as the deep emotion with which she recited. The difficult text of the dialogue by Syrokoma, "Jan Deborog," was declaimed by M. Barzynska, M. Wleklinska, and H. Made jowna in a fashion excellent beyond our expectations. Equally good were the German declamation by M. Bardonska and those in English by M. Wleklinska and K. Magnosowna. The Polish declamations also left nothing to be desired; these were delivered by L. Bardonska, A. Nicka, K. Polencowna, M. Skorupa, T. Wleklinska, M. Rura, T. Lewandowska, J. Tafinska, E. Herkowna, L. Marszalkiewicz, St. Tylska, and W. Rozanska.</p>
   <p>The brief plays, partly humorous and partly emotional and serious, were excellently selected and brought real honors to the young actors. Exceptionally beautiful was "The Letter to Our Lady of Sorrow and Joy". We regret that the names of the boys and girls who enacted the plays are not known to us; let them, however, learn and work further, like the proverbial hidden violet.</p>
   <p>Among the Polish priests present were the Reverend Fathers Kobrzynski, J. Barzynski, Snigulski, and A. Nowicki.</p>
   <p>Wishing a joyful vacation to the dear children, we cordially recommend the Venerable Sisters and the truly meritorious English teacher to all the Polish parents residing in Chicago and its vicinity for their conscientious and able work. We recommend the school of the Venerable Sisters of Nazareth as a perfect institution in every branch of Polish education.</p>
