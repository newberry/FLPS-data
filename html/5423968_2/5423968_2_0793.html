   <p>The following news comes from St. Adalbert's Parish: The new brick rectory is already finished and occupied. A roof has been constructed over the new school building and further work will be suspended for the winter, to be resumed after the necessary funds for its completion have been raised. Among other things, the old rectory will house the parish library, which has been developing remarkably well. The library new possesses 500 volumes, and further additions have been ordered.
