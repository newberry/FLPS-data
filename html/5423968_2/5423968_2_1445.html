   <p>The annual coal shortage seems to be living up to expectations. This year seems to be no exception to this already historical threat. The wholesale coal dealers of the State of Illinois issued a "proclamation to the people" concerning the supposedly advancing "coal hunger" which, according to the proclamation, is due to the lack of these black diamonds, to the insufficient number of railroad cars to transport them from place to place, and to the weak activity in the mines, where less coal is being mined than previously. A person would really have to be naive to believe in such tales. The coal dealers, in their desire to dig deeper into the pockets of the consumers, have fabricated the story of coal shortage. This has been done to give them an opportunity to raise the price of coal. At present they hope to unload the surplus they now have in stock, because they know that many will make purchases in greater amounts lest they be confronted with lack of coal. There is no shortage of coal in this country--it is only a fabrication in the minds of mine owners and coal dealers. There are millions of tons of coal now lying in reserve waiting to be shipped and transported, but the coal trust is in no hurry to release it lest there be too much of it on the market, which would cause a lowering of prices. Another example of similar inhuman practice can be seen in the activities of the meat trusts, which have amassed millions of pounds of meat and dozens of eggs in cold storages. These products are purposely withheld from the public market for periods of several months to make them prohibitively expensive. This is a shameful exploitation of the poor working class of people who are unfortunate enough to have to eat and keep the members of their body warm.</p>
