   <p>We want to bring up and later discuss in a series of articles, a very important matter. There will probably be sharp retorts from certain quarters, which will assert that we are meddling in other people's business and that we should not stick our necks out. Therefore we announce in advance that in this matter we are motivated only by concern for the good of our young people and by the desire to raise the standard of our parochial schools.</p>
   <p>We are about to discuss the revision of the textbooks used in the teaching of Polish. We have before us all the Polish primers and textbooks used in the parochial grammar schools in Chicago and outside of Chicago for the elementary teaching of vowels and consonants. We have taken the trouble of examining them carefully, with the result that we have a very poor opinion of these books, which do not answer their purpose either from a pedagogical <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>point of view or from the point of view of developing a broader outlook on life in the child and acquainting it with the various problems arising in today's intellectual, social, and national life.</p>
   <p>The deficiencies and faults of these textbooks will be noticed at once by anyone examining them and pondering a little over their substance, arrangement, and too superficial treatment of all matters on which the child, through living in this country and through observing entirely different surroundings, has already developed his own point of view, which is wholly different from that presented in these readers.</p>
   <p>It should be added that these textbooks are merely revised editions and even exact copies of the textbooks and primers written for the Galician grammar schools, of which it has long been said that they teach children to read in order to kill forever their desire to read, because reading for the peasant man or woman is an absolutely unnecessary and really a very dangerous thing. It will suffice that the peasant be able to count up to a hundred, and to pray with the help of his little prayer book, which until recently was practically <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the only Polish reading material that the peasants in Galicia had.</p>
   <p>We shall prove that this is so by a series of examples derived from the textbooks used by our local parochial schools. In the primer we note the old system of teaching the alphabet by memorizing the spelling of words, which method has even been abandoned in the Galician schools. This old system is in disagreement with the precepts of modern pedagogy, and we shall not find it in use in any English school. One should not try to turn a child into a parrot. It should, by means of its own perception, come to the point of differentiating between the consonants and vowels in the alphabet and not by mumbling words learned by heart, which the child repeats without understanding their meaning.</p>
   <p>In taking up this matter today, and in offering the suggestion that the textbooks be revised, we believe that we are not the only ones who are of this opinion. Many of our teachers and priests realize that such a revision is necessary and must be made for the good of the parochial school itself, upon which every intelligent Pole must look with confidence and gratitude <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>for the work already accomplished. At the same time every Pole has the right to demand that the school improve in keeping with the development of the times, so that it be not merely a tool for bringing up Catholics but an institution for producing good Poles who can think and feel in a Catholic way.</p>
   <p>We know and understand that this is a very difficult problem to solve, but someone must give this matter its impulse by suggesting the idea of revision, an idea which will be laughed at and considered unimportant by some but which probably will be well received by others and which may give rise to the formation of a committee in one of our larger and wealthier parishes. Such a committee, together with the rector of the parish, may take up this matter and announce a contest for the writing of a textbook more in keeping with present school needs. Perhaps this will be done by a group of our more serious priests and teachers. Seeing that the standard of our schools is not as high as it should be, owing to the frequently very grave deficiencies our teaching force displays through lack of financial resources, our priests and teachers must come to the aid of the schools by introducing <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>modern textbooks more in keeping with the spirit and customs of the times, textbooks which will make much easier the task of the teachers themselves.</p>
   <p>Every school is a matter of public importance and should be the primary concern of every community. Our desire to improve our methods of teaching indicates that we are interested in our schools. This is our attitude in presenting this subject today, and we would like to be rightly understood.</p>
