   <p>The members of the Polish Merchant's-Assn. met at a luncheon, at the Avenue Cafeteria last night, to discuss many pending questions of importance. The question of greatest importance was the selection of delegates for an oncoming convention of the Polish International Merchant's Assn. to be held in the city of Warsaw, in the month of May, of this year. Among the many who were present at this meeting were representatives of similar organization units in Chicago, who pledged their whole hearted support on cooperation of this movement.</p>
   <p>A resolution was passed to establish a Central headquarters, from which will emanate an appeal to all Polish Merchant organizations in America, to participate in this event in person or by proxy. The chairman of this meeting was the well-known Polish merchant Mr. W. Sajewski, who also is the president of the Polish Merchant's-Assn.</p>
