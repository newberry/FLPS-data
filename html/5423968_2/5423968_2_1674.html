   <p>Some of our more considerate citizens are making donations to the needy families of the Stockyards' strikers; however, there are many that have not given a kindly thought in this direction. We have been informed that Rev. Frs. J. Obyrtacz C.R., Casimir Sztuczko C.S.C., and Stephan Kowalczyk C.R. have made contributions recently. It is hoped that others will take interest in this kindly cause.</p>
   <p>The strikers have posted placards in the vicinity of the Stockyards which inform the people that the strike is not over. The signs have been printed in English, Lithuanian, and Polish and have been posted on many telegraph poles throughout the packing house area.</p>
   
   <p>Meetings of the strikers will continue to be held daily in the same places announced in a previous issue.</p>
