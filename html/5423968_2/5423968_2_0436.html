   <p>The reformers are resting on their laurels. The red lights in fromt of the "houses" in certain districts have been extinguished. The signs showing a foamy stein of beer no longer tempt the eye of passersby. From the hands of reformers we received morality and temperance. Yet people are ungrateful. They do not feel due respect towards reformers. That is not all. They even dare to say that the work of reformers is common "humbug"; that the reformers removed neither vice nor drunkenness, and that what was public before is going on now just the same, only secretly.</p>
   <p>And the people who dare to say that, loudly, are not just common people. The Chicago city doctor, Dr. Bundensen, made a statement that diseases are increasing very rapidly; that the morality of the young people is very low, and that thousands of children are born dead or blind on account of their parent's sins. The doctor is backing his statements with proofs and is asking for help, because the means provided by the reformers did not remove the evil - on the contrary, it made it harder to fight because now it is secret.</p>
   <p>Something happened to prohibition which was forced on the American public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>From the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans the people are drowning their troubles in the whiskey glass, but instead of the old time relatively non-injurious liquors, they treat themselves with home made poison or with that which is not better - that they buy from the bootlegger.</p>
   <p>The prohibition agents are indeed very active. They go after the violators of the eighteenth amendment so zealously that they violate a more fundamental law of the American people by entering their homes without search warrants.</p>
   <p>Society finds itself in a peculiar situation. On one side millions of people violate the prohibition law, on the other side the officials themselves, who should the example to the people in respecting the law, are violating it brutally. Looking for the violators of the law they violate it themselves. The reformers have been trying for many years to kill our freedom. They shall not do it. The American people will wake up and get rid of all reformers.</p>
