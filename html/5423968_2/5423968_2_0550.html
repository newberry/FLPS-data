   <p>There is a distinction between respecting and observing a holy day of obligation. To us, as Catholics, Sunday is a holy day and we have always supported this assertion with word and deed--with word, by encouraging others to participate in the Sunday church services, to refrain from work, and not to submit to noisy, drunken, or improper debaucheries; and with deed, by abstaining ourselves from attending dances on Saturday evenings, or picnics on Sundays before noon since these amusements lead away from the observance of the Sabbath day.</p>
   <p>However, we do not share the views of those hypocrites who, under the cloak of piety, obstruct others from taking part on a Sunday afternoon in some proper, moral, and useful recreation, since recreation affords a well-deserved rest after the week's work is over. Rather than condemn recreation, we advise the people to have as much of it as possible. Recreation not only affords the necessary rest but it also keeps us from wasting our leisure time in taverns <span class="page-break">\2</span>or in the company of undesirable companions.</p>
   <p>It is for this reason that we are in favor of having the World's Fair open on Sundays, since for people who have to work on week days this is the only day in which they can enjoy themselves without loss in salary.</p>
   <p>We are so mindful of the need of recreation that we are in favor of those workers who demand that their employers do not compel them to work on Sundays. Incidentally, we have not remained silent in the movement to have the stores located on Milwaukee Avenue remain closed during Sundays. All the workers and officials employed in these stores demand this, and justly so. Some of the store proprietors have already agreed on this, and beginning tomorrow many of them will be closed. Some stores, however, will take advantage of this and will keep open on Sundays.</p>
   <p>Such action is improper and undeserving of praise or support. Every one should do his shopping on Saturday instead of waiting for Sunday to do it. In this manner unscrupulous store owners will be convinced that the public does not shop on Sundays and that it doesn't pay to open.</p>
