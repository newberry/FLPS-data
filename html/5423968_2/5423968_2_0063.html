   <p>The school session of the Holy Trinity High School was begun at nine o'clock in the morning. A solemn religious service which was conducted by Reverend Morrissey, the provincial of the Holy Cross Order, assisted by the Reverends J. Gruza and S. Gorka, marked the formal opening of the school. Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, pastor of the Holy Trinity Parish, delivered an appropriate sermon in which he pointed out the aims of the school and its needs. The venerable speaker stated that it was not his purpose to criticize the public high schools of our city and that he sincerely believes that they really develop the body and mind. Despite these benefits, he added, the public schools do not give an additional educational and moral instruction. Since it is the duty of parents to care for the spiritual development of their children as well as for their physical and mental growth, consequently, there is a need for schools of another type for the Polish youth. In addition, the English schools do not teach the Polish language, Polish history or literature, and as a result, the Polish youth is deprived of the opportunity of becoming educated in the national spirit.</p>
   <p>After the ceremony, a large group of citizens congregated in the first classroom of the high school. The new school is located in the building which, for the past several years, housed the publishing firm of the well-known Polish leader, Mr. W. Dyniewicz. The center of the schoolroom was occupied by the students entering into the high school. These are young boys who have completed the eight grades of the Holy Trinity Parochial School. There were twenty-two students present.</p>
   <p>A large group of civic leaders occupied seats at the sides of the classroom. There was a great lack of space but no one paid any particular attention to this.</p>
   <p>The ceremony was opened with a prayer, led by the reverend pastor, which was then followed by an appropriate speech, rendered in both Polish and English. Before this, however, the young boys sang the national anthem. A beautiful oration on the value of education was rendered by the Reverend Doctor Morrisey. The audience was pleased to become acquainted with such an eloquent speaker and with one so well-informed. The following speaker was Mr. T. Siemiradzki, who spoke in Polish; he, in turn, was followed by the Honorable C. S. Cutting, Judge of the Probate Court, and the Honorable Bruggemayer, Judge of the Municipal Court.</p>
   <p>Counselor Louis Pinderski, president of the Alumni Association, made a brief, but sincere speech in Polish. In a more lengthy oration, delivered in English, Mr. John Wleklinski pointed out the benefits that can be derived from higher education. He also wished the newly enrolled students success in the arduous tasks awaiting them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hibner, a member of the school committee of the Holy Trinity Parish, gave a commendable testimony of the high standard of education found in the parochial school of that parish. He expressed his assurance that from such leaders the education in the high school will also bring favorable results.</p>
   <p>Brother Peter acquainted the audience with part of the program of the high school. He thanked all those present for their manifestations of sympathy toward the school.</p>
   <p>With this, the ceremony was closed. May God aid the teachers, as well as the students, in all their endeavors.</p>
