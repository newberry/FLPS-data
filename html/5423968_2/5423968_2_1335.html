   <p>New York, Feb. 14, 1891. (Tel.). General Sherman is dead. He died very peacefully and without suffering at 1:30 P.M. Already before noon, there was no hope of keeping him alive. Thousands of telegrams expressing condolence have been received. The whole city of New York is mourning; the same happens in Washington, D. C., and everywhere.</p>
   <p>Funeral services will be held on Thursday, providing that his son will arrive from Europe. There will be no pompous obsequies in New York, for such was the wish of the deceased General, but in St. Louis, Mo., where his remains will be buried, funeral services will be held with military honors. As in such cases, the officers of the Army will observe the customary mourning, and the banners of different regiments will also bear marks of it for six months.</p>
   <p>There was a telegram from Columbus, Ohio, sent by the Governor of that state, in which he makes a request, in the name of the people of Ohio, that the remains of the famous General be laid in the state in which he was born.</p>
