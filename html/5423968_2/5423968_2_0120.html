   <p>School affairs is such an interesting problem and especially If I mention the affairs of the Polish schools, I imagine I shall call the attention of many a reader upon this subject. A great deal about this affair has already been written. I visited the maindties in America such as Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Erie, Buffalo, New York, Newark, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Reading, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, and at last, the great metropolis of our Polish colony. Chicago.</p>
   <p>We saw a number of Polish parishes, usually in the suburbs, and next to them there stand the Polish parochial schools. In these schools our young children are taught in the Polish and English languages. If you should happen to stand near one of these schools about 12 o'clock noon, or around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, you will hear loud voices and sounds of chatter from our small Polish children, especially the older ones, and then you shall ask yourself the question as to who teaches this youth and in whose hands rests the responsibility of education them? I judge I cannot be far from the truth when I say that elementary schools, public schools, the Polish <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>parochial schools remain, with a very few exceptions, under the guidance of nuns belonging to the orders of such as Notre Dame, Nazareth, Franciscan, Felician, and Resurrection Sisters. So, then, anyone who is prejudicial and distrustful of everything that pertains mainly to a Catholic character should step into these schools, under the supervision of these nuns, where he will notice and see with his own eyes the order and cleanliness in which the class rooms are kept; the neatness of the children, and a smile upon the face of every child.</p>
   <p>So, then, I point out some of these good points of the schools before I recommend them to you.</p>
