   <p>We have pointed out in previous articles that the Republican protective tariff is not based on sound principles. Let us give more details.</p>
   <p>Although the effects of the McKinley Tariff are so complex that it takes a specialist to understand them, we will explain them to our readers that they may understand the claims of the Republicans--claims which should be recognized for what they really are, especially now during the presidential campaign, when speakers from both sides talk so much about the tariff.</p>
   <p>We will not go into minute details but will limit ourselves to the more important points embodied in our previous statements on the matter.</p>
   <p>Among the benefits to be derived by national industry from the Mckinley Tariff, the Republicans cited the manufacture of white tin plate as an example. Before the tariff was put into effect, the duty on white tin plate, most of which came from Wales, was one cent per pound. The McKinley Act raised this to 2.2 cents. It was said that within a year after the tariff would be in effect, all the white tin plate needed would be manufactured in this country, and that, as a result of this new industry, thousands of idle workers would be put to work.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the logic of this reasoning. The business which this country carries on abroad depends upon imports and exports. During the course of a year our exports exceeded our imports by two hundred million dollars. In exchange for our exports--primarily wheat--we must receive either cash or articles we need. Since these articles have a specific value, value for value is given in return. In spite of the fact that we need no silver or good bullion in return, the amount of gold and silver imported is greater than the amount exported. Statistics prove this to be a fact. Therefore, we need articles which we do not have in this country, articles which we do not manufacture, in exchange for others the great abundance of which calls for foreign markets. Why cannot we get in return for our exports goods which are not manufactured in the United States, for example, white tin plate? Why should we develop this industry on a large scale when the same efforts could be exerted to better advantage in other directions? Why cannot we better develop the industries in which we are especially skilled, particularly those whose products are in demand abroad? As to the theory of the Republicans, it is illogical in so far as it has been shown that it does not work out in practice.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the first effect of the McKinley Tariff when it was passed. As it did not go into effect immediately after its passage, nine months elapsed before it could be applied to all imports.</p>
   <p>The moment the tariff was passed, Wales, naturally, began to turn out white tin plate on a mass production scale in order to ship as much of it as possible to the United States before the new tariff would become effective.</p>
   <p>We need from 700,000,000 to 800,000,000 pounds of this metal a year. Before the McKinley Act became effective, that is, during the time between its passage and June 1, 1891, 1,036,487,074 pounds of this product were shipped to this country. Great energy was exerted to produce this amount. The following year, that is, from June 1, 1891, to June 1, 1892, only 418,176,202 pounds were imported.</p>
   <p>The Republicans were triumphant. "Look at the results of the Tariff," they cried, "on the imports of white tin plate. See how much they have decreased since the McKinley Act came into effect."</p>
   <p>These figures were extensively used to befuddle the people. But let us look at these figures, add them, and then divide the result by two. By adding the figures for 1891 to those of 1892 and dividing the result by two, we get a yearly average of 727,331,638 pounds of imported white tin plate, which is pretty close to the 750,000,000 mark previously given. The imports for 1890-91 were so great that in the following year, ending in June, 1892, only 418,000,000 pounds of white tin plate were needed.</p>
   <p>Who gained and who lost by the import of white tin plate during 1890-91 and 1891-92?</p>
   
   <p>Did the government gain anything? In reality, no. As a matter of fact, it lost. If the McKinley Tariff would have gone into effect immediately, the government would have received $28,029,805 for twenty-one months. Instead, during the nine-month period which elapsed before the tariff could be applied, the import of white tin plate was so tremendous that, during the year ending in June, 1892, only $17,758,934 was collected in duties on this particular product. This means that the government lost over ten million dollars.</p>
   <p>Surely, these ten million dollars were pocketed by someone--the people of the United States who need this product, the wealthy importers, or the manufacturers. Who can tell? These manufacturers made a profit not only in the original product but also in the products they turned out therefrom. And who paid for this other profit? Nobody but the people. The price of tin rose sharply as if the new tariff were in effect. The people who needed tin plate had no choice other than to purchase it at the increased price. The government did not receive a penny of the ten million dollars. This sum was divided between importers and industrialists. Yes, it went into their pockets.</p>
   
   <p>This was the first immediate result of the McKinley Tariff. What were the other results? These will be discussed later.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Sept. 24, 1892.</p>
   <p>We have already discussed the McKinley Tariff to the extent of pointing out who benefited and who lost by the increase of duties on tin plate. Now we will direct our attention to the so-called industrial boom that the Republicans promised would occur. They claimed that within one year we would be manufacturing various kinds of white tin plate essential to our needs.</p>
   <p>Twenty-one months has elapsed, much more than a year, and during all this time, as shown by figures, we have imported from Wales an average of 727,331,638 pounds of white tin plate every year.</p>
   <p>It cannot be denied that tin-plate factories were built in this country during this time, but they only manufactured 13,240,830 pounds of this metal in one year, which is far from filling our needs. This only amounts to about two per cent of our actual requirements, and even this small turnout is not actually produced in this country.</p>
   <p>The manufacture of white tin plate consists in immersing black-iron or steel plate into molten tin, a process which is called bleaching. Government statistics reveal that the imports of this black-iron plate are increasing in proportion to the quarterly increase of white tin plate. Along with this, tin, which is used for bleaching the black-iron or steel plate, is also imported in proportion. Actually, nothing is really made here. The only thing done here is the bleaching, for the tin and iron are imported. That is why white tin plate, which is in great demand, is rising rapidly in cost.</p>
   <p>We will not go into further details. In general, the white tin-plate factories, or rather "bleaching shops," employ mostly the lowest paid workers, especially minors. Along with this, we wish to say that the people of the United States must pay $16,000,000 annually for this privilege--the shortage of white tin plate in our country. One can readily see what blissful results the McKinley Tariff brought in this direction.</p>
   
   <p>A man by the name of Peck contends that the Republican claims are authentic and true. The commissioner of labor statistics in Massachusetts gives a report on the conditions of the tin plate industry since the enactment of the McKinley Tariff. His figures are as follows:</p>
   <p>Investment of capital for building factories rose 2.34 per cent. Price of products rose 1.33 per cent. Employment rose 1.72 per cent. Salaries increased 0.9 per cent. Unemployment decreased 0.5 per cent.</p>
   <p>To this report should have been added the increase in price of commodities for everyday use. Being a Republican, he had common sense enough to omit these figures.</p>
   <p>But even these figures do not prove that the tariff is beneficial. That industry has increased by a small percentage in one year is a marvelous thing, but does that mean that it is going to keep on increasing every year? A comparison of the percentages for several years shows that industry is decreasing. Let us compare the figures given by Mr. Peck.</p>
   
   <p>Do they prove that the 2.34 per cent increase in capital investment in industry resulted in the 1.33 per cent rise in the value of produced goods? Or that this invested capital only increased employment by 1.72 per cent? Or that more men were hired in proportion to the value of produced goods?</p>
   <p>Does it prove that the salaries of the workers increased proportionally, if the wages increased 0.9 per cent while the value of the goods rose 1.33 per cent? On the contrary, according to these comparisons, neither the worker nor the manufacturer made any gains. These figures would even show a greater loss if the increase in the cost of the articles were included.</p>
   <p>We do not go so far as to say that these unprofitable figures were caused by the McKinley Tariff. We can say, however, that these conditions do not speak in its favor.</p>
