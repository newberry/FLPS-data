   <p>We received several communications from several small businessmen complaining that the "Big Fish" is destroying their business and that they cannot do anything about it.</p>
   <p>We have no other way to settle this question, only this, we urge all our Polish matrons that instead of patronizing the big stores, to support our small Polish merchants. Our merchants should also unite into one organization, and in this manner in buying their products in a single large purchase they will be able to obtain a better price and in this way they can sell their goods at a lower price in competition with big business.</p>
   <p>The plight of the small merchants we know and understand very well, and that with strong, stiff competition by the department stores in our Polish localities like in Egypt, it is difficult for our merchants to survive.</p>
   <p>Our Polish citizens lack the national spirit of Poland because if they didn't go to the Jews, the Jews then would be forced out of our neighborhoods, but the smell of garlic draws them to the Jew more than the square deal of our Polish merchant. Those of our Poles who have prosperous businesses and live off the Polish people, buy by wagonloads from the Jews.</p>

   <p>No wonder then that the Jews often raise sums of money and donate to many of our good causes and in this manner draw our people to them. We wonder how long a Polish merchant doing business among Jews would exist?</p>
   <p>They would not even buy pepper from us, and we support them. Yes, Yes, in stores of the Jews and of other nationalities there are always a lot of Polish customers, but in a Polish establishment you could not find a Jew even with a lamp.</p>
