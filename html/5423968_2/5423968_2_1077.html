   <p>Dr. Kuflewski, a member of the school board, at a meeting held yesterday, brought the anger of Germans upon himself by shouting, "Why do the Germans want to express their feelings openly about the Poles by calling us show-off Poles?"</p>
   <p>Heinrich Heine, German-Jewish poet, when in Paris at a certain coffee shop, made remarks about the Poles to his friends. Seated at a table nearby, listening to his slander, was a Pole. At the end of his endurance the Pole rose and demanded that Heine take back his words. Heine was surprised at this outbreak, but instead of apologizing made another nasty remark.</p>
   <p>The enraged Pole struck Heine in the face. People in the shop anticipated a fight. Heine did not retaliate. The Pole paid his bill and left, unmolested. To get the score even, Mr. Heine wrote a verse about Mr. Krapulinski and Mr. Wraseklapski, called "Polen aus der Polskei, un die zwei Edlen Polen."</p>
   <p>Ever since then it seems as if in every little argument between a Pole <span class="page-break">2</span>and a German "edlen Polen" comes into play. The Poles remember this episode. They are convinced a Jew will avenge an insult.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung, in today's issue (September 15, 1904), called Dr. Kuflewski "der edle Dr. Kuflewski." Camillo Von Lueze, a professor at the Chicago University, persuaded Mr. Leon Wachsneren, owner of a theater, to allow school children and teachers to be present at daily matinees, to convince teachers and students that this was a good opportunity to learn German.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kuflewski greatly opposed this proposition and demanded that a proposition of this kind be given to the mayor (Harrison), and a special investigation be made before making any comment.</p>
   <p>The German newspapers promptly criticized Dr. Kuflewski and Mayor Harrison for their attitude, the papers being greatly in favor of having the German language taught in public schools.</p>
