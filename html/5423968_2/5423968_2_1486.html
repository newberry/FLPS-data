   <p>The Polish-American Businessmen's Association held a smoker yesterday for its members and their guests at the Polish Women's Alliance Building. The purpose of the smoker was to have the Polish merchants and industrialists get acquainted with one another and thus open the field for organizational work.</p>
   <p>The smoker was attended by about sixty people, which certainly gives a bad impression of the solidarity of the Polish businessmen. There should have been at least two hundred.</p>
   <p>The official (for lack of a better name) part of the evening was opened by the president of the Association, Mr. Alexander Busch, who explained the purpose of the meeting and called upon Mr. W. Perlowski, one of the well-known and energetic Perlowski brothers, to act as toastmaster.</p>
   
   <p>In a rather lengthy speech, the toastmaster directed some sharp remarks against those who had not come to the meeting and deplored the short-sightedness of our businessmen, who do not see that there is power in organization and who prefer to go on alone instead of co-operating with one another for their own good in order to raise the level of Polish business in our city.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was also a well-known Pole and national worker, Mr. T. Helinski, cashier of the Polish bank (the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank), who discussed the topic "What Is Economy." In his long speech, he made many valuable and practical suggestions to our businessmen.</p>
   <p>The third speech, on the subject of "Benefits derived from advertising, and how to advertise," was made by Mr. J. Przyprawa, editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, who proved that our businessmen are losing a great deal by not searching for new ways and means of reaching their customers with lists of articles for sale, and that they are seriously neglecting the advertising side of their businesses.</p>
   <p>The fourth speaker was an American from our neighborhood, Attorney Leech, who spoke about the enthusiasm which every businessman should bring into his business.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Perlowski talked about the power of organization and pointed out the value of consolidating capital and purchasing wholesale, and warned against the danger with which the retailers are threatened by gigantic corporations.</p>
   <p>The last speaker was Mr. N. L. Piotrowski, the spokesman for and organizer of the Polish Fire Insurance Company, headed by Mr. Jozwiak. He spoke of the large profits this company will make as soon as it starts working. The Poles should have had a company like this long ago instead of taking their hard-earned cash to German or Jewish companies, through which only people of other nationalities gain wealth and influence. The Poles should remember their own people and help strengthen their own institutions with their money, because this increases our national wealth, our influence, and our importance in this country. He spoke a long time in English, because of the presence of Mr. Leech.</p>
   <p>Pauses between speeches were made pleasant by Mr. Przybylski's violin solos with piano accompaniment. Pleasant conversations made the time pass quickly, so that the people did not leave until after midnight.</p>
   <p>Should our businessmen hold more smokers such as yesterday's, it is certain that they would begin to think about their interests more seriously and organize themselves strongly. By doing so they could do a great deal of good for themselves and for society in general.</p>
