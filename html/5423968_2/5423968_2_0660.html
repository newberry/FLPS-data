   <p>A remark made by one of the police judges in St. Louis to the Polish societies causes us to burn with shame. This judge informed the Polish people that, almost daily, he examines two, three, and sometimes more, cases of Polish girls who have been arrested for vagrancy, unbecoming behavior, and other moral transgressions. "Try to remedy this," cried the judge, "because not only does this expose you to shame before others, but it lowers your moral plane; these girls are the mothers of your future generations."</p>
   <p>Who can better correct this than the mothers: If the mothers would accompany their daughters, or place them under appropriate care when they go to a respectable party; if they would not allow their daughters to go out in the evenings without a good reason; if they observed their daughter's companions--they would not later be shamed, and their daughters would not fall into <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>misfortune and soil themselves and their Polish names in the courts.</p>
   <p>Mothers should remember that their duties as wives are not merely limited to bearing children and feeding their bodies, but that these duties extend as well to caring for the souls of their children. It is the duty of the parents to see to the moral education of their children. They should teach them to differentiate between what is good and should be done, and what is bad and should be avoided.</p>
   <p>In many cases, the cause of the delinquency of children is the ignorance of their parents. In order to give someone light, one must possess it himself. Parents will acquire the light of knowledge by reading good literature; if then they inculcate in their children an interest in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> word, the problem as to their children's upbringing will be much easier to solve. Their children, having a love for reading, will show moral improvement. They will not have time to wander about the streets and corners; they will not fill police courts, but will be instead model representatives of the Polish population in America.</p>
