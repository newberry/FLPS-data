   <p>The local Abendpost sets as an example for the American people a Polish woman, Mrs. Maciejowa Wisniewska, of the neighborhood of St. John Cantius, a mother of ten living children, whose husband earns $12 a week. Someone abandoned at their house a two week old infant girl, and our friend Mrs.Wisniewska did not hesitate a moment, but took the child with motherly love, introduced it to her children as their new little sister and advised her husband to be a father to the child. She went earnestly in making new clothing for the "new daughter," and started a fight with the police who had to take legal steps in this case of the abandoned child, and to agree on several different propositions in order to satisfy the good will of Mrs. Wisniewska.</p>
