   <p>There is "merchandise" in the possession of which Chicago excells all other cities in the world. This "merchandise" is moral depravity.</p>
   <p>You will find it everywhere--in homes, workshops, department stores, the theater, restaurants, and hotels. But without any doubt it shines forth most triumphantly in the dance halls.</p>
   <p>There you will find men from practically all walks of life. There are clerks, property owners, magistrates, students, and even (though infrequently) the servants of knowledge, the chaplains of literature and art. They are all there, and they all went there in pursuit of inexperienced girls, who no doubt told their mothers that they were "going to their girl friend's home" and instead went to the dance halls.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The reputation of these dance halls has been established for many years, as has the reputation of those who frequent these dens of iniquity, and the reputation of the "veteran young ladies" dressed in plush, velvet, and silk.</p>
   <p>There is not the slightest doubt that these dance halls have always been, and continue to be, harmful to public and individual morality to universal and family welfare, and to the physical development of the "teen-age girls" who, having got out of their homes on the pretext of calling on their friends, can be found on the floors of the dance halls.</p>
   <p>A group of clear-thinking people has decided to put a stop to this. But, unfortunately, they are going to use half measures: instead of completely closing the dance halls, they are inaugurating a series of municipal dance halls in order to safeguard the young candidates for morally depraved women. They expect that after the establishment of this new type of institution there will be an improvement in the moral conditions in Chicago. We believe, however, that the establishment of a society to care for the girls who wander about the brightly <span class="page-break">3</span>lit streets and solicit pedestrians would be more ardently applauded by those who really know life. Efforts to use social energy to provide employment for working girls, to create better moral conditions in their homes--where now fourteen men boarders live with fourteen "women boarders"--and, finally, to create a healthful environment in the factories, would be welcomed with greater enthusiasm. These girls leave the factories in the evenings as though they were escaping from a fire, and they are forced to stand on the street corners in order to get a breath of fresh air.</p>
   <p>Such work would no doubt be more effective and would produce more noteworthy results. But no one seems to want to undertake it because this work is harder than that of opening municipal dance halls. Therefore let us wait patiently for Chicago to become moral with the aid of municipal dance halls, although we are rather dubious about this method of "reform."</p>
