   <p>Gathering offhand a few of the newest inventions and aping the latest Parisian fashions, the average Yankee got the idea that he is a real leader of civilization. The fact that nobody opposes him proves that they don't want to spoil the humor of it all. The self-conceited Yankee is convinced that he is in the lead of all the newest ideas.</p>
   <p>Except on technical development in industry, bluff, and aping foreign fashions, we are far behind the world's progress. We lack the most vital thing; a statute, without which humanity cannot exist; all that which we call law is a useless mixture of archaic conceptions, compared with which the Napoleonic statute, is the newest idea of judiciary system.</p>
   <p>Every case which reaches the public through the press, proves to us that we have no fundamental law and judicial statute. It is ridiculous that just by moving from one state to another all the judicial system is thrown off balance, giving rise to thousands of legal questions that can drag a case to eternity.</p>
   <p>The same thing happens if the case is continued, often twenty or thirty times, going from court to court for years and years. The lawyers consume great amounts of money, the judges sweat, and after a long time, a lawyer "discovers" some "error," a dot not placed over an "i" or some insignificant detail, and all the work is wasted and a court decision void, and the case started anew. This is only a joke of and a jeering at law and justice. All this procedure throws the defendant on the lawyer's and the judge's mercy.</p>
   <p>The statute on which a lawyer builds his case consists of numerous volumes of rulings by the Supreme Court, beginning from the time of Christopher Columbus. If a lawyer finds in them two identical cases which were settled by the Supreme Court, he can continue the case to eternity.</p>
   
   <p>But sometimes they don't drag cases so long; they attend to the case as long as they are able to collect the plaintiff's or defendant's last nickel. All judicial machinery is converted into a press for squeezing out the money of those who were unlucky enough to be forced to lock for justice in the courts. For the average citizen, justice in inaccessible. Even an honest judge can't do much, and an able and smart lawyer can deprive the court of a normal procedure. Those crooked lawyers are earning millions of dollars and are the real rulers of the entire judicial system. With their aid the rich companies are laughing at the Sherman and other laws, exploiting the people mercilessly.</p>
   <p>A rich criminal can escape a penalty, but the common people are deprived of justice if the slightest uncertainty is involved.</p>
   <p>It is a shame, an unforgivable crime against the citizens' rights that such a great and rich country has no universal civil and criminal code to regulate the life of the Nation.</p>
