   <p>Last Saturday night we were passing a hall in a Polish locality where lively music could be heard through some of the windows that happened to be open. We were informed that it was a Polish affair, not a private one, but public, probably a yearly ball arranged by some society.</p>
   <p>We became dumbfounded at this sight, knowing that nearly all of the Poles, especially their organizations, usually have respect for Lent restrictions and abstain from all festivities, balls, dances and drinking during the Lent period. Custom and tradition instruct us that Lent is the time for meditation of Christ's sufferings and not for participation or indulgence in loud and wild parties. The homes, however, as well as the Polish Catholic societies, usually comply with this custom. We cannot condemn all of these societies because there are some which are well known and are extremely nationalistic and indulge in objectionable practices. But there are even those, and they number a few, that indulge in many hilarious drinking parties, choosing Saturday or Sunday for this feast, being unconcerned about <span class="page-break">2</span>attending mass on Sundays, but instead sleeping after a hard night. Catholics don't dance during Lent, that is final, that is the one and only answer toward all invitations to balls during Lent.</p>
   <p>There are other pleasures that we could indulge in, respectable ones that would not conflict with Lent and we must not for one moment think that now, during this whole time, everyone must mortify himself or grieve. No, the Catholic Church knows the weakness and changeability of human nature and it does not request us to deny ourselves of certain pleasures because it knows it would be a difficult task to perform, but it expects and has the right to demand of Catholics to abstain from indulgence in wild parties, dances and revelries. That this kind of life, led during Lent, is out of the ordinary we know it as a fact.</p>
   <p>And so, dear readers, heed these precautions and comply with them, as Catholics of heart and not of a loose tongue.</p>
   <p>Before concluding we shall describe to you an incident that happened <span class="page-break">3</span>recently to a notorious infringer of Lent. This fact may be known to some of you already because this happened somewhere on the Northwest Side, but maybe there still are some who haven't heard about it. Well, then listen, or rather, read:</p>
   <p>In one of our Polish parishes in Chicago there lived a certain citizen, a Pole, owner of a retail grocery store. This person was known as an evil progressive liberal. He very seldom attended church, belonged to the parish for the sake of business, and for this received a presidential nomination in a non-church organization. And so this organization arranged a ball on one of the Sundays during Lent. Our Mr. President naturally went to this ball, closing up his store, while during his absence someone broke in and stole from him $600 and other valuables. His total loss amounting close to $1,000.</p>
   <p>Good for him! If he didn't revel during a Sunday of Lent, maybe he wouldn't have been robbed. He was taught a good lesson. He will be smarter after his loss in the future. We only hope this lesson will impress some of you.</p>
