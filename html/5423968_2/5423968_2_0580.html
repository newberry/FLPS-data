   <p>Only lately has it come to light why the Chicago Polish women had their husbands arrested and jailed by the wholesale, and many times family life had been broken while the Chicago courts of domestic relations were filled with Polish cases. It was found out that those discords in the Polish families were caused by Chicago charitable organizations, to whom our naive women used to go for advice in case of trouble with their husbands. The role of the self-appointed protectors was played by the suffragettes employed as officers and workers of the institutions.</p>
   <p>They incited the Polish women against their own husbands by teaching them about the privileges of women and American freedom. They made the court actions very easy for them. In other words, they acted as solicitors for the courts, or as shyster lawyers. In order to accomplish their purpose and compel a wife to sue her husband, the protectors used to take out the warrants for the husbands, sometimes without any fault on the part of the husband for his idleness. The wife appealed to the charitable organization for help. Immediately and without any investigation, the officer of the <span class="page-break">2</span>institution ran to the police station and had the husband, sometimes a sick man, arrested.</p>
   <p>It is understood that this system was very much practiced by the charitable organizations because it did not disturb their treasury, and because at the same time, it showed their sympathy towards the woman, filling the treasury of the courts with foreigner's money with what was often their last dollar.</p>
   <p>The officers of those institutions did not care whether that family was in poverty, whether its provider was sick in bed or out of employment. Obtaining information by reading descriptions and prejudiced stories in the newspapers about the supposed adventurous lives of the Poles, especially men, all they cared for was to have the hated Poles punished and disgraced.</p>
   <p>On that depends their morality of the Judas type. Not a good example, not a help in a dire need, but finding the guilty one is considered to be the fulfillment of the citizens' duty. During the court proceedings, the protectors were the real accusers. The wife could not defend her husband, even if she felt sorry for him after discovering that she had made a mistake by applying for help to those organizations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Those protectors, not being able to understand Polish, did not try to go into the matter deep enough to understand the condition of the family, because in most cases it was not the ill treatment of the wife by her husband, but lack of employment and hunger that drove the wife to apply for help.</p>
   <p>The protectors of whom we speak tried only to get the hated man, while later on when the husband was serving his turn in jail, his whole family, a victim of that foolish system, suffered hunger and privation, while he turned against his wife. Consequently such cases, caused by impatience of poverty, ended not only in imprisonment but also in the breaking up of a whole family.</p>
   <p>The husband, suffering innocently, upon his return from prison, in spite of his good will, loses the rest of his respect and love for his wife and, fearing that such a disgrace might occur again in the future, sues for a divorce. But the breaking up of the family does not worry the protector. Hundreds of divorce cases, caused by such justice, called the attention of Chicago lawyers. After a careful investigation of the motives which <span class="page-break">4</span>caused the suits, Chicago courts forbade the "ladies" for all time to act as "protectors."</p>
   <p>The results were noticed in a short time for in a few weeks Polish divorce cases disappeared from the courts' calendar.</p>
