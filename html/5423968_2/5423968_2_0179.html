   <p>The question of a Polish teachers' seminary in America is, as we have often written before, one of our most important problems.</p>
   <p>This matter will undoubtedly be brought to the attention of the delegates at the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>But will the Congress decide on a definite plan, and, if so, on what kind of a plan? Will it be able, in view of the great number of important problems before it, to discuss it thoroughly? From what source will the money for the seminary.</p>
   <p>be raised? These are important questions, so difficult to solve that they are rapidly cooling the ardor of those who advocate the seminary.</p>
   <p>The Congress will surely be able to accomplish a good deal for the cause of a Polish teachers seminary, but that it will not be able to organize the seminary itself is obvious.</p>
   
   <p>In spite of all these questions, the seminary will be built, and in the year 1896. That also is a fact.</p>
   <p>It will be built, so we are informed by authoritative sources, through the generosity of private persons. The Most Reverend Deacon Pitass of Buffalo will build it through his own efforts. The entire plan has been thoroughly thought out.</p>
   <p>The Most Reverend Father Pitass has dedicated a building for the seminary on his own grounds. He already has two lay professors and one clergyman ready to teach in it, and is making efforts to secure a competent music teacher. Only the lower grades will be opened at the beginning, and the opening will take place immediately after vacations are over.</p>
   <p>The seminary will undertake to instruct teachers and organists.</p>
   <p>These are facts. In publishing these facts we feel duty-bound, from the journalistic viewpoint, to say that this important problem is solved, thanks only to the efforts and sacrifices of one person, a Polish priest, who deserves to be honored.</p>
