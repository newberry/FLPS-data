   <p>Once again a Pole in political office comes forth with full energy against tax evaders. The evaders in this case are not professional miscreants, but wealthy and influential people who profess to be great patriots.</p>
   <p>Julius Smietanka, collector of internal revenue, declares that many members of the Chicago stock exchange either refuse to pay any war tax or conceal their big transactions in order to avoid paying taxes. The tax is relatively small.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Smietanka demanded that records of stock transactions be presented, suits over authority and the secrecy of transactions were instituted. These suits are being postponed indefinitely. Mr. Smietanka, after conferring with Washington in this matter, has decided to enlist the aid of the federal prosecutor in order to bring the guilty ones to justice. He says that at least fifty capitalists will have to face the grand jury.</p>
