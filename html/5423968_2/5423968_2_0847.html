   <p>A bad habit has entered America: the use of name of our former presidents or nationally known heroes for commercial purposes. Before prohibition the name of Washington was used in advertising the various liquors, neckties, stockings, etc. prominent names were even given to dogs, for example, such as that of Admiral Dewey. Mrs. A. O'Neill, 6541 Woodlawn Avenu, protests against this.</p>
   <p>She has done a justly thing in protesting. She affirms that the arrival of this habit in our country will exclude all respect towards out heroes - that is, if we keep on using their names for advertising purposes. In Poland they never use the names of our heroes for these aims, but here they have even used a few times the names of Pulaski and Kosciuszko in ward politics. It is time that this should end.</p>
