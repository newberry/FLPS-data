   <p>The drive for the $200,000 school building, the only Polish High School in Chicago is still on. Those desiring to contribute should do so at once. It is not how much you give, but the fact that by giving, you approve of the idea of higher education for the coming generation of young men of Polish extraction.</p>
   <p>The various teams are out working in their respective fields and interviewing prospects for donations. If you are approached by any of the workers, do not turn them down, but listen to what they have to say and then contribute your mite. Every little helps. The cause is a worthy one and we heartily recommend it to you. When sending your contribution, mention the News. This is your last chance to help this worthy cause.</p>
