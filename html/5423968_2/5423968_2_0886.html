   <p>"To the Polish Ministry in <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, D. C.</p>
   <p>"Prince Lubomirski</p>
   <p>"Your Excellency: We are informed that Your Excellency has negotiated with the United States Government for a loan to your country. In addition to the hundred million dollars which have been leaned to your nation by the United States Government, and also to the additional fifty million dollars which were loaned to your people by the private American investors, Your Excellency is asking for another and much larger sum."</p>

The victims were people who loved and had served Poland in peace and war, whose <span class="gap">[gap]</span> <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a><span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
