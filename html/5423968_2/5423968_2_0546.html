   <p>In order to protect beneficent institutions, and amongst them one of the best Catholic schools for girls, the City Council passed a law, day before yesterday, regulating night clubs, especially in the neighborhood of Cottage Grove avenue, Evans avenue, 50th street, and many others. Vincent J. Jozwia-kowski voted for this law and Senator-Alderman Stanislaw Kunz voted against it.</p>
   <p>In passing this useful law, protection is given the Catholic school, St. Francis Xavier, located on Evans avenue, between 49th and 50th street. The nuns worked and looked forward to this law being passed, and send their heartiest thanks and blessings to those who supported this act by voting for it and bringing it into being.</p>
