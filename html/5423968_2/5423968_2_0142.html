   <p>In all countries of the old and new world, school discussion is drawing the people closer to the Catholic schools and religion, which is their chief aim. Judging from the discussion we can distinguish what appears to be two classes.</p>
   <p>The private Catholic work is primarily to protect the health of the youth, and secondly the education of youth, to strengthen their efforts against non-Christian schools.</p>
   <p>The first indications limit us to private initiative, which is the root of our work against non-Christian schools.</p>
   <p>We very seldom write about it, still it is the main ambition of the Catholics to fulfill this vow. It is sufficient to bring to the eyes of the Catholics a few facts of the strength of this movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Not long ago a group of priests gathered in New York to start a new statistical survey of Catholic schools, and their fast growing system.</p>
   <p>The government statistics, taken two years ago, showed the attendance in Polish Catholic schools, but failed to mention the names of the schools; this was asked of the government in behalf of all Catholics in the city of New York.</p>
   <p>In New York alone, 87,621 children attended parochial schools in the lower grades; and 4,422 girls and boys attended the middle and higher grades. The upkeep of these parochial schools amounted to almost six million dollars. It is true that the American method of teaching cannot be compared with that in Poland, and neither can the attendance, although one-ninth of the Polish people living in the United States are of the Catholic faith.</p>
   <p>In the old continent, especially in Italy and France, private schools of an acknowledged creed are rapidly multiplying. Greatly interesting <span class="page-break">\3</span>is the development of these schools in France. The first systematic organization of this act was enacted in Lille in 1879. The large central committee has its seat in Paris, and with it are connected the diocese committees, of which there are 52 in existence. In 1891 there were 13,315 private Catholic schools with an enrollment of 1,271,388 pupils.</p>
   <p>The sum of money for the upkeep of these schools and for the establishment of new ones were approximately 60 million francs. The government naturally does not look favorably upon private Catholic schools, leaving them entirely in the hands of the clergy, who are pleased with the constant increase of the pupils attending these schools, while at the same time the attendance of the public schools shows a decrease.</p>
   <p>From May 1, 1896 to May 1, 1897, the number of pupils attending the middle grades of the public schools had decreased from 85,814 to 84,839, while the parochial schools had an increase from 80,243 to 84, 569.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>One wonders why the government does not look further into the cause of this evident fact. Surely it is not lacking in liberals who, while viewing soberly the development of French schools, fail to determine the real cause of this unsuccessful operation of public institutions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Michel, in an article found in the liberal monthly L'Economiste Francais, states, Considering the vast sums expended by the Republic of France toward the education of the public in a civilized country bears little fruit and proves that some politicians are making a grave mistake when they claim that the increase of the school budget alone should suffice to improve knowledge. Facts collected with a deep sense of consideration point out plainly that this is not happening. The author attributes the mediocre and insufficient benefits derived from public education to the mistaken idea that such education alone is sufficient to the uplift of the soul and mind of generations. He gives credit particularly to the great philosopher M. Fouillee, who recognizes that it is necessary to add to the education of the mind the inevitable necessity of the study of morals and religion, even if in <span class="page-break">\5</span>the undertaking of such studies lies a mistaken idea about religion being just an added subject while truly it is the soul of a complete education.</p>
   <p>As new evidence that the government has unfortunately not yet recognized this age proven fact, is that beginning the first of this month the senatorial commission has framed a resolution asking Congress to enact a law demanding a licensed diploma from all directors of private middle grade schools. This would undoubtedly be the cause of a temporary handicap, as the priests with their various spiritual duties to perform would not very easily find time to prepare themselves for higher examinations. The fact that these private schools are not at so low a level is often proven by the excellent averages of many of their pupils in examinations. The Catholics also do not forget about a higher education of their women. An individual institution was established in the past year in Paris. Mgr. d'Hulst took an active interest in establishing same and it is successfully expanding.</p>
   <p>Presently, when so much is being said about the highest will of the people, more attention should be given to such manifestations because they serve better as evidence of the true will and ability of the people than all elections, which stand so easily under the influence of temporary vehemence and intrigue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Meantime the requests of Catholics meet constantly with strong opposition in various parliaments, and only after heavy struggles, step by step, do they acquire the enactment of laws that are beneficial to them. In only one state as far as we know, and that in the smallest, Luxemburg, has there been declared a few months ago a school law sincerely Catholic, demanding that the teacher should cooperate in religious teaching and that he should be governed by a local advisory board, composed of three members, one of whom should always be the local pastor.</p>
   <p>A small step forward was recently taken in the Lower Austrian Congress, when on the 3rd of February, it accepted a resolution of the government that religion should be a compulsory subject in professional high schools. Until recently in Corinthia and Lower Austria, where the liberals ruled undividedly, none of the professional high schools have had any religious instruction.</p>
   <p>Not to dwell any longer on topics relating to parliamentary laws, we wish to call your attention to the determined liberal opponent of this law enactment. Dr. Philippovich. He says "If the teaching of religion so effectively <span class="page-break">\7</span>influences the development of mental faculties of our youth as our previous speaker Card Grusza claimed, why should it end in high schools, about the time that the presence of mind has caught sight of the deeper understanding of religious problems. For this reason the speaker foresees that the Catholics logically not satisfied with their new gains, will demand a higher religious education in the universities (which is indeed an urgent need at the present time).</p>
   <p>We must admit that Dr. Philippovich more accurately comprehended the thought of religious education than he himself imagined.</p>
