   <p>A meeting of the Polish Masons and Bricklayers Society was held on September 29, 1910, at John Petlak's Hall. During this meeting the members decided to become affiliated with the Polish National Alliance as a group. Acting upon an invitation extended by the president of the society, Mr. Edward Labendz, the following representatives of the Alliance spoke: Mr. Michael Kmieciak, director of the central administration and Messrs. S. Orpiszewski, John Nowak, and J. Kosmowski. Each of them elucidated the aims and purposes of the Polish National Alliance to those congregated, the necessity of uniting under one banner, and the merits and benefits to be derived from belonging to a greater organization. The words of the speakers found their mark: they convinced those present. Without a single word of protest or doubt, the members of the group unanimously voted to enroll in the national organization, so that they might be able not only to erect temples of the Lord and other gigantic edifices, but also to build the edifice of a free Poland, through their activity and sacrifices. While <span class="page-break">\2</span>the business of filing applications was in order, a score of members enrolled. It is anticipated that a greater number will file applications for membership at the next meeting, which is to be summoned especially for that purpose. Dr. Malachowski was selected as medical examiner of the group. In the very near future the Polish National Alliance will welcome into its fold a new division of tireless workers.</p>
   <p>Thus far 112 members belong to the Polish Masons and Bricklayers Society, and only a few of them belonged to the Polish National Alliance. Messrs. Labendz, Dzwonkiewicz, Baum, and Petlak, and others have been instrumental in affiliating the Society with the Polish National Alliance. It will be the first group of Polish masons and bricklayers to come into the Alliance.</p>
