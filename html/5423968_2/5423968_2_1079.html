   <p>Last week, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, there was a convention of an organization known by the title of Organized Poles in America.</p>
   <p>The resolutions that have been accepted and approved by this organization are as follows:</p>
   <p>As Poles and Catholics, we join with those who honor our old heroes, especially Kosciuszko and Pulaski. As a tribute, there will be monuments erected of these patriots in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Washington, D. C., and Chicago. Even now the Americans can see that this nation which has been erased from the map has a great part to play.</p>
   <p>Poles here afford to give their children an education, so that later on they may become good citizens, not only as workers but also achieve responsible professions such as the priesthood, medicine, law, and business and in this way help our nation.</p>

   <p>We should always remember to speak our Polish language. For then the Americans will hold a greater respect for us when they see we respect our native language.</p>
