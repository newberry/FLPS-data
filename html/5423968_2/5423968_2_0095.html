   <p>The dedication ceremonies will be opened by Archbishop Quigley, with the assistance of many priests. The police will be summoned to keep law and order, due to the fact that so many thousands of people will be present and all present will try to get to the front to witness this dedication; to avoid injuries to the women and children the police will be there. Following Archbishop Quigley's speech, Mr. A. J.
