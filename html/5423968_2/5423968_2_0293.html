   <p>The school question in the United States, which is of especial and vital importance to us, and which has been made a political football by a number of parties, has been discussed many times by exhaustive articles in the Dziennik Chicagoski. Even the brochure of Father Thomas Bouquillon, who is taking great interest in this question at the present time in Washington, has been given full consideration, including the part played by Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul.</p>
   <p>This question is so vital that the European press has devoted considerable space to it. Every important periodical has given the school problem consideration, especially the Catholic papers. We are including the following article which was published in Warsaw in a recent issue of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Przegladu Powszechnego (Universal Review) and was written by Father John Badeni:</p>
   <p>"In the United States the school question is being handled in an interesting manner by a number of Catholic groups. This struggle for education is only possible on American soil. Two weeks before the annual conference of American Archbishops at St. Louis the pamphlet of Father Thomas Bouquillon, professor of <span class="gap">[gap]</span>oral theology in a Catholic University in Washington, made its appearance under the title of 'Education: To Whom Does It Belong?' Who should should and control education? 'The State, the author states, particularly a minor one, either Christian or non-Christian.' In conclusion, as if frightened by his own thesis, the author submits the following proviso: 'I realize that such a theory will meet many difficulties in practical <span class="page-break">\3</span>application, but the spreading of these difficulties is not my problem; it is that of the people created by God over the State and the Church. Several comments have been made about Bouquillon's pamphlet in a few Catholic papers and periodicals. Bishop Chatard also mentioned it in an article. The matter would have been completely forgotten if the brochure had not reflected an attitude of Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul. At the Archbishops' conference in St. Louis, Archbishop Ireland came to the aid of the principles set forth by Bouquillon, and when he could not find one supporter, he sought the help of the press to support his ideas. It was after this that a bitter battle was fought pro and con in many journals that contained interviews, editorials, and feature articles. It would be too involved to delve into the details of this fight, but it should be <span class="page-break">\4</span>sufficient to say that in the St. Paul diocese some of Archbishop Ireland's adherents left the country, who would never have been prompted to leave under different circumstances.</p>
   <p>"Several facts, gathered by an American correspondent for Rome's publication La Civilta Cattolica, will answer to a better extent theories that are popular in free America relative to the compulsion of public ownership of all schools. During the time that Archbishop Ireland entered into the picture, the United States Government was compelled to hear charges against 500 public school teachers who were accused of many disgraceful crimes. In the year 1890, over 737,000 children were attending parochial schools, among whom were 567,000 Catholic children. Besides this, 753,000 attended private schools. There are 637 girls' schools and educational centers <span class="page-break">\5</span>operated by Catholic orders. The Jesuits' alone operate 27 educational institutions with an attendance of 6,538 students, with an average annual increase of 500. At the Catholic University in Washington 260 students are taking a course in philosophy, 255 in law, and 100 in medicine. What reason would the Catholics have', concludes the correspondent of the Roman newspaper, 'to establish and support with generous contributions all these institutions and schools? What special reason would the countless religious families have, namely Lutheran, Presbyterian, etc., who often send their daughters moreso than their sons, to Catholic schools regardless of expenses, if the public schools would cater to all of their desires and guarantee a good, virtuous education'?"</p>
