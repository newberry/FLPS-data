   <p>The same motives that underlie the projects of a new daily, Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily), and a new Immigration Home have undoubtedly influenced the bosses of the Polish National Alliance to propose that certain individuals be appointed to "seek suitable places for Polish Colonization."</p>
   <p>Every would-be official, every candidate for such office, every ex-official, and every would-be patriot who out of virtue makes this his career is at the same time a real estate agent. Everyone of them has organized and is organizing various kinds of Polish colonies under a legion of names, such as Posen, Cracow, Warsaw, Czestochowa, and Pacanow. Whether Czestochowa or Ryczywol, the name does not matter. The fact is, however, that these names were given for sentimental reasons to worthless colonies (and we are not telling everything<span class="page-break">2</span>). The agents, using these established Polish names coupled with a hundred fancy lies, have confused and tricked the people, setting them up on sandy plains, marshes, and pathless tracts where wolves howl from hunger. By exploiting the people's naivete and goodness, the agents only succeeded in jeopardizing their own reputation and credit. Some of them have disappeared from the American scene, while others who stayed on have lost their prestige and no one believes what they say, even though they boast of the title of ex-censors and hire halls during national exercises sponsored by the Polish National Alliance to further their aims.</p>
   <p>The credit of the agents has been damaged beyond repair; however, not all have followed in the footsteps of those [who left] Chicago, Buffalo, Milwaukee, and other cities for Canada, London or Johannesburg--some are still vegetating in our midst, even if they no longer can make money from their gold-<span class="page-break">3</span>giving farms. It is the opinion of some of the Polish National Alliance leaders that the former should come to the rescue of some of the agents.</p>
   <p>Therefore the Polish National Alliance has strapped on its insurance organization another load: the building of Poland on Pacanow or Ryczywoc [proposed Polish colonies]. A beautiful picture is going to be painted: the railroad companies are going to supply service to these colonies, which are not far from large cities. The truth, however, is that these barren fields have never been inhabited by man, that the colonizing commissioners are going to be paid from the Polish National Alliance treasury, that they are going to receive rich rewards from the railroads for providing slaves, who are going to be promised free grants for the little effort of cultivating them. Under this new veil of pseudo patriotism we cannot see anything in this large scale organization of Polish colonies but individual gains, which has nothing in common with the general idea.</p>

   <p>Let us admit that we are blinded by pessimism and that we err. Furthermore, let us assume we favor this undertaking, that all the proposals of the censor are important and possible. Let us also assume that the Dziennik Narodowy, once it begins to be published, will support itself; that the Alliance Immigration Home will also be self-supporting once it gets started, and that the Polish colonizers, after great difficulties, will gather a handful of people willing to settle on Alliance colonies.</p>
   <p>How much will these experiments cost? The Dziennik Narodowy alone will swallow $15,000 for the first year. The Immigration Home will take twice as much, while the colonizing venture will take as much as the newspaper scheme.</p>
   <p>From where is the Polish National Alliance going to get these sums unless it taps the insurance funds? These funds are being exhausted now that the veteran members are dying off and new blood from the youth is difficult to recruit as a result of high premiums.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This latter predicament is not so dangerous, since there is still money on hand and the Alliance headquarters are not mortgaged. A crisis could be stemmed if one arose. But what of the Dziennik Narodowy, the Immigration Home, and the Alliance colonizing Agency during a crisis? Are they going to represent assets which will serve as collateral for loans?</p>
   <p>If this is your judgment, then you are playing with a worthless enterprise which will not be of benefit to anyone, but will endanger the Polish National Alliance morally as well as materially--with inevitable bankruptcy.</p>
