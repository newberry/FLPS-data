   <p>The political campaign for mayor and aldermen of Chicago is just over. Naturally, the campaign was under the influence of alcohol in saloons, where they have the meetings and different party candidates made their speeches.</p>
   <p>They were recruiting their people and votes by the trade in liquor. No wonder in the period of the campaign drunkenness increases; there are plenty of arguments, still more fights, swindling, and grafting.</p>
   <p>If the campaign is always mixed with alcohol, we are never going to have an honest administration.</p>
   <p>Saloons should be closed during a political campaign.</p>
