   <p>The graduation exercises of boys and girls attending the Sisters of Nazareth School, were held yesterday in a hall that was crowded.</p>
   <p>The program was excellent both in numbers and in execution.</p>
   <p>We would have to mention the names of all the students if we wished to give proper credit for their performance. The "March of Flowers" was beautiful, the "Hymn To Our Blessed Mother" was enjoyed, and the new cantata "The Little Gipsy" were particularly fine. The entire performance was exceptional.</p>
