   <p>I did not think it necessary to answer the falsehoods and attacks of the libelous and scurrilous Dziennik Polski, but when the Zgoda, the official organ of the Polish National Alliance, repeats the false and libelous story that I, a Catholic priest and a son, had beaten up my own mother, I feel it my duty publicly to protest against such unprincipled conduct. I wish to state that those guilty of this libel will be punished in a suitable manner.</p>
