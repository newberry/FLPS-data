   <p>We have just learned that Mr. C. J. Bielinski has filed a suit for damages (No. 15,208) in the Circuit Court against the directors of Pulaski Hall, asking $25,000 damages for a "protest" signed by them and published in various papers, which presumably attacked him. The matter is interesting.</p>
