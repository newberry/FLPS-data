   <p>The parade arranged by Mayor Thompson and his political machine in honor of Mr. Hearst was a failure.</p>
   <p>Instead of 150,000 screamingly proclamed greeters who were supposed to welcome Mr. Hearst, there were only 50,000 at Soldier's Field, and when the program started that number diminished to 150,000 (sic). It was predicted that there would be 5,000 automobiles at that parade and there were only 838. Where were supposed to be 20 banquets and only 5 took place.</p>
   <p>And who were the greeters? They were Germans, city hall workers, political workers, police, school children, We chars who were forced to come, and throngs of curiosity seekers who quickly disappeared, not showing any interest in the program. The influential Americans did not take an active part in it. The enemy of Poland and France received a cold reception in Chicago and that is fine.</p>
