   <p>Once again I have the pleasure of exchanging views on the matter of parochial schools in America with a member of the Polish National Alliance. From his article I can only judge that I am dealing with a good Pole and a zealous Catholic. God give us more such people, who are actively interested in faith, enlightenment, and national causes in general. We need such people in order to awaken our sleeping compatriots. The honorable member of the Alliance sets an excellent example for our brothers as to how to spend their free evenings--in reading good books and good papers, and not in saloon brawls, etc. Surely a laborer cannot experience greater pleasure than that of reading a good paper for spiritual relaxation after a day of hard physical labor. If our brothers would only take this example to heart, surely ignorance, drunkenness, court suits, disharmony, etc., illustrations of which are furnished us daily by Dziennik Zwiazkowy, would no longer prevail among us.</p>
   
   <p>And now we will give our views on the very important question of parochial schools, which all of us have at heart. It is better for us to discuss these vital questions now, while we can still remedy the sad state of affairs, than at some time in the future when it will be too late. Let the sad example of the Irish, who have lost their beautiful language, constantly ring in our ears: Poles, love your gift of God--the Polish language! The Irish spend millions of dollars in this tremendous effort to exhume their buried language, but it is too late. The English dragon has swallowed them. Our task is scarcely easier, because we are poor, with very scanty funds at our disposal. Therefore, not wanting our future generations to disturb our graves for having lost the Polish language, let us try to speak it, and to inculcate it in our young. It is for this purpose that the Polish National Alliance exists, and it is for this reason that we build parochial schools.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us try to explain our viewpoint on this subject.</p>
   
   <p>1. The honorable member of the Alliance does not want to believe that the Polish clergy is the wall and foundation of faith and of the mother tongue. I, on the contrary, do believe this and will not retreat an inch from my conviction. The unfortunate part of all our disputes is that we judge the entire Polish clergy by the actions of a few individuals!</p>
   <p>Mr. Felka made similar accusations. Please glance at the last issue of Dziennik Zwiazkowy for my answer. I myself emphasized in my first article that we have had, have, and always will have, individuals who depart from the general rule. This rule for the Polish clergy is the spreading of faith in God and the inculcating of a love for the homeland. We know well that there are individuals among the Polish clergy for whom light beer, cards, trips, visits, etc., have a greater appeal than the spending of several hours with Polish children in the schoolroom. No one will deny this, because in numerous instances it is quite obvious. But let us go through our 374 Polish parochial schools in America; let us observe how the Polish clergy watches over the children, teachers, and order in the school; let us sit down among the children and listen to their answers--then we will change our outlook. Human nature is so constituted that it is difficult for us to tell the truth, but it is very easy indeed for us to criticize, to ridicule, and to bespatter with mud.</p>
   <p>Good heavens! Who are these Polish priests? Are they Chinese that they are so ashamed of their sacred duty and their native tongue? Are they admirers of Muscovites, who, in order to receive the baptism of Moscow, are being dragged toward Russification? Are they not the children of those whose bones still lie scattered in Siberia? Did not hundreds of bishops and priests die in Siberian tortures for their faith and their country? Did not high officers, like Cardinal Ledochowski, serve prison terms in Prussia? Did not the heart of the late Archbishop Stablewski break at the news that Polish children were beaten and abused for saying their prayers in Polish? Do Polish priests cease being the sons of the great Polish nation in taking their holy orders? No! You have innumerable examples that they are the servants of the one God, but they are also patriots as their fathers were and are. Is not your misfortune our misfortune?</p>
   
   <p>Were I to maintain that there were no exceptions to this, then, my friend, you could chastise me as much as you like, but I do not maintain it, nor would I dare to do so. On the contrary, I myself will give you an illustration from which you can convince yourself that certain individuals force their way into God's vineyard in order to live a life of card-playing, drunkenness, etc. I know a rector who has a parish of about four thousand Poles. In this parish there is an ordinary church of no architectural style, resembling rather an Austrian barrack than a temple of the Lord. There is also a magnificent rectory, resembling the palace of a reigning prince.</p>
   <p>"And do you, Father, have a school?" I asked this magnate, who has at least fifty thousand dollars in the bank. </p>
   <p>"No," replied the astonished shepherd, "Why do you ask me about a school?"</p>
   <p>"I thought that you would have a large school, having so many Poles," I replied.</p>
   <p>"I do not have a school because the bishop will not permit it," said the "considerate" spiritual father.</p>
   <p>"And why is that?" I asked.</p>
   <p>"Bcause there is still a debt on the church, a small one, only a few thousand dollars," he answered.</p>
   <p>"That is strange! Other priests in the same diocese have debts amounting to several thousand and several tens of thousands of dollars, and they erect schools yet you, Father, with only a debt of a few thousand dollars, are not permitted to build a school? This is worthy of consideration! About how many children are there here?" I continued.</p>
   <p>"More than two hundred and fifty," he replied.</p>
   <p>"Two hundred and fifty children without the Polish language, and lost to the Polish cause!"</p>
   <p>My colleague guided me to a tremendous telescope. "Through this telescope I count the stars in the sky," explained the astrologer.</p>
   <p>I thought to myself, "You, sir, gaze at the stars through a telescope, while Polish children look upon you with indifference. Oh, what a comfortable screen the bishop is for priests of this sort! Instead of spending $120 a month on nuns or teachers, how simple it is to tell his little lambs: 'the bishop does not permit the building of a school!' Does the bishop permit the ordering of a barrel of Hungarian wine? Does the bishop permit the losing of $500 at poker? For things like these, one does not have to ask for permission!"</p>
   <p>Where will the Polish children of this parish learn their native language, in view of such actions on the part of the rector? The poor father works all day in a factory to support his family; the mother is busy with housework; and the children should be looked after by the priest. Our first teacher, Jesus Christ, told our ancestors, and through them us: "Go forth and teach!" And so we go forth and teach these children who are to be the foundation of Poland's future.</p>
   <p>My honorable opponent clearly sees that I am impartial in the matter of parochial schools, and I grant my honorable opponent that there are priests who neglect their sacred duty, but I will never agree that the majority of the Polish priests do nothing. You, sir, will not condemn them all, or be scandalized by the fact that certain unscrupulous individuals are found in the Lord's vineyard. That is something which cannot be avoided.</p>
   <p>2. The member of the Alliance informs the public that, were there no Poles in America, there would likewise be no Polish priests here. That is obvious!</p>
   
   <p>Were there no noses, there would be no snuffboxes or snuff. No one will deny this.</p>
   <p>3. My honorable critic praises the Polish National Alliance to the skies. You do well and justly, sir! Most of the Polish clergy does the same, if not publicly, at least in private. Indeed, the Polish National Alliance deserves respect for its battle with the states for the cause of the Polish language in the public schools, for the Immigrants' Home, for aiding young students who wish to become enlightened people, etc.</p>
   <p>If you members of the Alliance want us to praise you and to pay our respects to you publicly, present your motto sincerely and clearly: "God, Country, and Enlightenment," and we will sing your praises and proclaim the attributes of this worthy Polish national organization. When the motto of the Polish National Alliance is clearly defined, I guarantee that its membership will be doubled, if not tripled. We ourselves earnestly wish to see this organization grow and attain the highest point of development.</p>
   <p>Why in the world should we be divided into camps and subcamps, parties and sub-parties? Every one of us understands that divided and disunited we can bring no good to our mother country. Should we, here on American soil, emulate the example of our oppressors, who divided us into three camps? Away with disunion! Away with divisions! Long live unity and, through unity, strength! Long live the Polish clergy together with the Polish people! Long live the United National Alliance! One God, one faith, one beloved nation, and one Polish National Alliance, one Polish clergy with one Polish people!</p>
   <p>The Polish clergy must take one step forward and the Polish people must also take one step forward--then we can shake hands as brothers, and can all stand together as one man under the banner of the Polish National Alliance, under which, in the presence of [Paul,] Bishop Rhode, we will make our vows of faith, unity, and brotherly love. Our famous Jagiellonian University, in Cracow, under the watchful eye of the Catholic clergy, has turned out hundreds of men who are brave, learned, and good Catholics. I believe that our clergy here on American soil will be crowned with similar success.</p>
