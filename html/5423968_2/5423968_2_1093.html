   <p>The local Germans are making representations to the Board of Education not to require the examination from German teachers for the teaching of German in our schools.</p>
   <p>This is more than a bold demand because Germans are not better than their American colleagues who must pass such examination. In our opinion the City Council and the Board of Education would do best if they threw all this Germanism out of schools. All the nationalities and most of all, Poles must pay for it, which is unfair to all of us. If Mayor Harrison is such a strong believer in equality let him add to the pensions of the teachers of English in parochial schools. Germans are no better than other nationalities that pay municipal taxes.</p>
