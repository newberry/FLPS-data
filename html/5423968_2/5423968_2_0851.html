   <p>An article has been received by the editorial staff which expounds the ideas supported by this department. The purpose of this article is to create a greater feeling for an issue that has been of discussed in the Dziennik Chicagoski; namely, the need of creating and fostering direct and constant unity of information between Poland and our people in America, and unity of opinions of the organs that serve the Polish interests and that of our people equally.</p>
   <p>It reads as follows:</p>
   <p>Nowhere else is the public opinion so great and powerful as in the United States. It is so great that it has become the center of attention throughout the world, and dominates the interest in all walks of international life. As a result, all civilized countries take advantage of this public opinion. At the same time, great empires and small countries are continually <span class="page-break">\2</span>spreading an increasing amount of propaganda, not stinting any money or effort, as long as America would incline favorably towards their political and economic postulates.</p>
   <p>But this cannot be said of Poland. Her communications in this respect were and are relatively small and completely inadequate.</p>
   <p>One must take into great consideration the fact that the sympathy extended by the United States to Poland during her crisis after the war is not increasing, but is becoming smaller. There are two causes for this: (1) The well-planned and intensive spread of agitation by our enemies. (2) In a great measure our own indifference which, of course, could be justified not because of the great difficulties the young Polish country had to face, but which should not be tolerated any longer.</p>
   <p>Because of the great attention this problem has received in recent months, The Society of Polish Technologists and Merchants of America, whose most <span class="page-break">\3</span>important aim is to facilitate Polish-American relations, has considered methods of a better understanding between the United States and Poland.</p>
   <p>A plan has been carefully prepared, embracing a large field. It is supported by the knowledge of conditions in this country and the understanding of the psychology of American people along with the contemporary consideration of our own culture.</p>
   <p>Before a plan of this kind could be introduced even in part, the present form of indifference which exists among our people in America must be broken. An introduction of a superior form of Polish propaganda in this country will not be effective unless American propaganda in Poland is changed. It is undoubtedly true that Poland does not know America, and that she under-estimates her importance. In the eyes of a majority of Polish people, America is something of an exotic country from whence come the greatly desired dollars of high value.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Unfortunately past experience shows an unbroken chain of blunders in this direction. It is enough to point out that they did not know how to go about obtaining some of the great reserves of savings from the Polish immigrants in this country and its patriotism for the purpose of creating production within Poland. As it happened many times, the hard-earned money of the Polish-Americans wandered into the pockets of ingenious swindlers and then disappeared. It is easy to recollect the frequent number of financial enterprises entrusted to persons who were completely unfit for the purpose. These individuals were either not known at all in American life, or had a very bad reputation. The services of such men has undermined the credit and the good name of Poland, and greatly weakened the confidence of the Polish immigrants. It is only natural that they considered such treatment an insult.</p>
   <p>Appeals for help keep pouring in without interruption. Private individuals, public institutions, educational organizations, churches, city magistrates, welfare societies, and political parties add their voices to this flow. In their requests for money, they negligently state "after all a few thousand <span class="page-break">\5</span>or a few hundred dollars is only a small amount in the United States." .....</p>
   <p>In general, the Polish immigrants react sincerely and liberally to these appeals. In instances when it concerns the Polish government, for example, the crisis in Upper Silesia, the Polish people in America show great respect for the native youth for their contributions reach the farthest borders of Poland. But it also must be considered that these stored-up savings are being continually tapped because of the prolonged period of unemployment. This condition is indeed a critical period for the immigrants. And if the mistreatment by the pseudo-delegates from Poland is added, one can hardly blame the Polish element in America for not reacting more favorably to any further requests for aid.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that the contributors would at least like to get a general statement as to the disposition of the money. It is also true that the amount of responses from Poland can greatly influence the number of donations, and vice versa. The latter condition is being felt greatly <span class="page-break">\6</span>at the present. It is high time that the Polish nation becomes acquainted with America.</p>
   <p>One of the best ways of solving this situation is through thorough discussions on this matter in the general Polish press. Because of this fact, an appeal is made to all the papers to take this into consideration and devote some space to it. The public interest could be greatly aroused and its opinion influenced. Dilettantism in American affairs has practically become a disease. A disease which must be cured quickly.</p>
   <p>It is not the purpose of this article to consider all phases of this important problem, for it embraces nearly all walks of Polish and American life. However, it does demand an exhaustive discussion.</p>
   <p>Attention is called to one very important fact: It is expected that there will be an immediate improvement in Polish information service.</p>
   <p>How does America get information about Poland? All the exclusive stories <span class="page-break">\7</span>practically come from our enemies' sources. Abroad, the Hearst press is working arduously to flood the minds of Americans with the belief that Poland is an imperialistic country--a nation that is harboring one thought: how to disturb the peace of Europe; that the Polish people are not fit for any creative work for they only know how to quarrel internally; that Poland perhaps, after many years of servitude, gained freedom for one purpose, and this is to oppress the peoples that have become a part of Poland; that the only industry in Poland is the printing of valueless marks; and finally, that the Polish nation is completely bankrupt, therefore, it does not deserve any credit. Whenever any unpleasantries occur in Poland, they are immediately spread throughout the world by 'our dear friends,' many times padded and distorted. As a consequence, all creative work, various kinds of noble efforts and deeds performed by the Polish people are either suppressed, get a few lines or none at all, or issued late for the sole purpose of gaining circulation.</p>
   <p>It is well understood among our people that Poland at present must count every penny in order that she can limit her expenditures, and not <span class="page-break">\8</span>spend lavishly and foolishly. Yet, frankly, this is not being done purposely. Credit for this frugality is not expounded by the American press, resulting in a change in American public opinion--much to Poland's disadvantage.</p>
   <p>But all this does not seen to delay the progress of Poland. Despite all these obstacles, Polish life is heading onward.</p>
   <p>Advancement has not only enveloped the farming, mining and manufacturing industry, but also the educational field.</p>
   <p>Let the world become familiar with these endeavors. Let news come from all sides of these centers by telegraph, not occasionally, but continuously and systematically. Let every calumnation thrown at us by our enemies be energetically supported by documentary evidences and published.</p>
   <p>Should we, because of the expenditure of a few hundred dollars per month, permit American opinion to continue to be influenced by the information <span class="page-break">\9</span>issued by our foes before news reaches us from Poland? After several weeks of travel, is it possible to clarify this opinion, if it is not too late? Has the public lost interest in these matters because it is watching some other event?</p>
   <p>News from Poland relative to the problem of Upper Silesia reached our shores after the League of Nations had definitely set up certain steps, and at a time when no one could even think of starting any agitation against the proposals. In the meantime, all attention was centered on the outcome of the borderline fixation and the kind of additional limitations dictated by the League to Germany and Poland. These additions were awaited amidst great tension, especially by the Polish immigrants, who have given so generously to the Upper Silesian cause. Dispatches came from many sources, but none eminated from Poland. It seemed as if this question concerned some far-flung corner of the world and not the Polish nation. Examples of this nature can be given in large numbers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>One thing is certain, that is,all the money expended for organizing an adequate, authoritative and properly conducted bureau of information, which will primarily be concerned about the activity in Poland,will be repaid not in one way, but in many.</p>
   <p>Experience has taught us that official memoirs brought to proper authorities do not bring benefits because they must pass a mass of government routine and in this respect are burdened by official censorship.</p>
   <p>As a consequence, we are turning to the public to back this proposal. Let the entire Polish press and all institutions interested in Polish-American affairs support our appeal. And when this information about Poland once has begun to function properly, a betterment in the understanding of Poland will be brought about shortly.</p>
   <p>This appeal is made in the equal interest between the republic of Poland and <span class="page-break">\11</span>the sister republic of the United States for a better feeling of understanding. A like appeal has been sent to Poland.</p>
