   <p>The adherents of temperance are meekly trying to disprove the accusation that their petitions, demanding placing on the ballot of the question, "shall the saloons in Chicago be closed or shall they continue to operate unrestrained," contain fictitious names.</p>
   <p>In the past few days, convincing evidence in this matter has been brought to light. Now we feel justified in openly condemning the tactics, that are being resorted to by the prohibitionists.</p>
   <p>Filling of false petitions, even in the interest of the most noble ideals, is a violation of public morals, and cannot be condoned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>How can we assume that people, just because they are inspired by lofty ideals, are building on a moral foundation?</p>
   <p>How can they claim for themselves the right to correct and reform the habits of the public?</p>
   <p>It does not make a bit of difference, that the moral standard of the patrons of the Chicago saloons is not what we think it ought to be; in any case you cannot hope to reform people overnight, particularly with lies, which are bound to be found out sooner or later.</p>
   <p>The reformers who are using such deceitful tactics in promoting their program, cannot hope to accomplish anything but shame and ridicule for themselves and their cause.</p>

   <p>Nevertheless, this work, if carried on with <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and without fanatical <span class="gap">[gap]</span> very beneficial to the public.</p>
