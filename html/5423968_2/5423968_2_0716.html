   <p>It is worth while to look back on the life of the South Chicagoans of three years ago. Great changes are now noticed at every step. Three years ago, anyone familiar with our social and economic conditions could see at a glance, even from the worried expressions of the people walking along the streets, that something was wrong.</p>
   <p>We all know well that large cities are composed of workers, and that employment is the foundation of city life. In South Chicago almost all the people--workers as well as businessmen--depend on the steel industry. When there is a large demand for steel everything buzzes as in a beehive, hammers pound incessantly, and the air is so full of smoke that breathing becomes difficult. Of course, what's a little smoke when one's pockets are full!</p>
   <p>Three years ago things were very bad in South Chicago. The streets were full of men wandering about aimlessly, and a day did not pass without <span class="page-break">\2</span>several men making the rounds of all the businessmen, asking for charity. In fact, these men had no money for bread, and at home there was a wife and a mob of hungry children. It is terrible even to think about it, but this was the truth. Even the clothing and shoes of these people gave evidence of their poverty. Today things are entirely different. When you do see someone on the streets, he has a satisfied expression on his face, is well dressed, has his pockets full of money and a ten-cent cigar in his mouth--a real sport.</p>
   <p>After all, why should he think? He is much more comfortable without thinking. The thing is to live well while the work lasts. A dollar spent needlessly here and there is a mere trifle which one needs not consider today, because there will be more tomorrow. That is how things are today and how they will continue to be for a while, because we are having good times and they will continue to be good for the next few years. People, stop and consider: What is the source of power, comfort, and even fame? I believe everyone will answer: Money! That is quite true. We here in <span class="page-break">\3</span>South Chicago are now having very good times, even in spite of the high cost of living. Therefore, every man who is now working for his living should use his head and think about his future. Today every one of us could save a dollar a day and have at least three hundred dollars within a year. In a few years one could have a nice sum, and having money anyone can get along.</p>
   <p>If at any time in the future bad times should come back again, one will not have to wander about the streets humbly asking for bread. It would be a shame and a proof of his lack of ambition for a man to fall so low through his own fault. Look at the Germans, our worst enemies. They never suffer poverty, they always have plenty of everything, even though many of them earn much less than we do, which is proof that they know how to manage.</p>
   <p>Let us wake up now and start to live wisely and sensibly, and the poverty which we witnessed three years ago will never return. People have now the opportunity of saving if they want to save, but there are many <span class="page-break">\4</span>weak-willed people who do not listen to reason or do not know how to go about this business of saving. When they have money, it just goes. They do not believe in banks because banks go bankrupt, even though this is not quite true, as there are many banks which will never go bankrupt. At any rate, if it is the safety of their savings that worries them, let Polish savings go into Polish hands and into Polish industry. Let these savings circulate among the Poles and we will all benefit.</p>
   <p>We already have three building and loan associations in South Chicago, where three years ago there was only one. We can save our money there, a little each week. To save is not difficult at all and it has the advantage that in case of need, especially during a depression, one can go with pride and dignity to withdraw one's money, instead of humbly asking for bread and arousing pity. Show the world that you will never again lower yourselves. What we say in this article is the truth--the very same truth you would hear from anybody else.</p>

   <p>In the meantime, let this suffice for today. In the future we will write some more for you.</p>
