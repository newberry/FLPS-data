   <p>Prohibition is needed as much in America as a fifth leg on a dog; in spite of that, however, the prohibitionists are making plenty of noise, as if the entire Congress in Washington had nothing else to do but care for the comfort of drunkards. Why this is happening we all know very well. When the masters of prohibition aqueeze out from distillers and brewers such tribute as they long for, they will all go in the best of harmony for a drink of whiskey.</p>
   <p>If the people would only know what these moralists and puritans really are, they would get rid of them in a hurry. Now it is known that usually the prohibitionists, who furiously are fighting the demon alcohol, are being recruited from old drunkards (has-beens), whose livers have swollen from "Schnaps" and therefore they cannot drink any more. The most incorrigible debauchers and revellers are in the end made moralists and puritans, but only when their heads get bald and their knees begin to bend.</p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile these bawlers are wasting our valuable time. They retard the work of Congress and tie up the President's hands in one of the most important moments of America's history.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, however, President Wilson is not paying much attention to these fools; as a good farmer does not care much for the cows which low the most but he does not send them to slaughter because he does not want to do away with the cause for good humor and a laugh.</p>
