   <p>It has been said with truth that there is no institution or establishment for rearing of children, which could equal a good family home. In an institution or school we get education, but at home we improve and mold the character of a child. How great a responsibility do the parents take upon themselves, and, at times, what little effort do they devote to their own self-development.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary for parent to be educated to properly raise their children, but, on the other hand, an education would be very beneficial. The children should be trained to love and respect others from the time they are capable of understanding, and most of all they should have respect for themselves. It is a very sad sight to have children show disrespect for their parents. It makes parents very unhappy when the children do not take care of their clothing, which are purchased with the hard earned money by the head of the family. Such children become boastfully conceited, keep themselves apart from their playmates, and finally become outcasts of society.</p>
   <p>Parents cannot command the respect and love of their children by catering to them nor by application of strict discipline. This should be gained by setting a good example. Every child should look to his mother as a deified person, and to his father as a man of noble character. However, it is apparent that a different condition exists.</p>

   <p>Father or mother drinks to a state of complete intoxication, and the result of it is wondering of children on the streets, committing various crimes, because of this gross negligence. Lacking self-control, they have no control over their children. A case of such nature was given to the Polish Welfare Association,</p>
   <p>A few days ago a request was made to the Polish Welfare Assocaition for aid in securing a release of a youth 18 years old, who has been arrested for stealing a large quantity of steel. This boy was on the verge of despair, not because of his fate, but because of conditions at home, particularly because of his mother and the younger children. The case worker noticed the unusual behavior of this youth, and through her efforts he was released temporarily. Later the home of the boy was investigated. It was found that the father had deserted the mother and six children. This act was caused by excessive drinking of his wife. During the inquiries the mother was absent. From another room however, whispers of the younger children could be heard, who were shielding their mother to avert an arrest. The case worker promised to return the following day hoping to find the mother in a better condition to talk the situation over. However, that evening some of her friends came and they proceeded to drink some more poison alcohol when the mother of this family was stricken with alcoholic insanity, the police were notified and she was locked up in a prison cell.</p>

   <p>What were the results of the investigation by the Polish Welfare Association in the above mentioned case? They found the father of this family, they found new quarters for this family away from the mother's drinking lady friend, they induced the mother to pledge to abstain from alcohol, they found employment for the eldest son, they settled the boys case in court, the younger children were all clothed with donations of generous people, who cooperate with the Polish Welfare Association. Each week the case worker visits this family, and is greeted heartily. There is no doubt that the most important part of social work in our society, is the work of preventing deliquency and directing the parents and children on the straight path. The time to save a possible criminal is not after a penalty was imposed to satisfy justice for a crime committed, but to check crime while it is in its early stages.</p>
