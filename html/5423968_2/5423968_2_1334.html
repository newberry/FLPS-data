   <p>St. Louis, Mo., Feb. 21, 1891. General Sherman was buried today in St. Louis with great ceremonies, as the whole city mourned and all business ceased.</p>
   <p>The funeral train, which arrived at about 8:30, and for which many representatives of the city were already waiting at the station, was received with a salvo. The coffin was laid on a specially prepared gem carriage drawn by six bay-horses, and the funeral march started at 11 A.M. The gem carriage was headed by the 12th Infantry Regiment from Fort Leavenworth, after which followed the General's bay horse in full military regalia. It was a very solemn affair; the streets were filled with people that showed great respect. No greater homage was ever paid to any national hero.</p>
