   <p>An article under the title "The Polish Nation and How We May Help it," reprinted from the Examiner, No. 3, New York, an American newspaper, appears in the last issue of Zgoda.</p>
   <p>Why was this article published in Zgoda? The editors of Zgoda evidently share the opinion expressed in this article; otherwise they would make some comments about it. The editors of Zgoda are discrediting again the Polish National Alliance, an organization which they are supposed to represent. Not content with the very unpatriotic article published in Zgoda a few weeks ago, in which this paper tried to prove that it is not right to bring up our children as Polish patriots, the editors now publish another article, without comments, in which they try to prove by distorted facts that Catholicism has always been and still is the cause of the "degradation" of the Polish <span class="page-break">2</span>nation, and that the Poles will not be able to advance till they cease to be Catholics.</p>
   <p>Is this really the opinion of the Polish National Alliance whose organ is Zgoda? When we stated some time ago how badly the editors of Zgoda are discrediting the Polish National Alliance by publishing a nationalistic article without any remarks about it, the editor of Zgoda mentioned in the next issue of his paper that he did not share the opinion expressed by us. Now, if we ask the editor of Zgoda whether he shares the opinion expressed in the article, that "the Roman-Catholic Church still follows the old oppressive system" (and this does not mean only priests, as the editor might say trying to evade the question), he probably will say that he does not. If so, then why does he publish such articles?</p>
   <p>How else can the Polish National Alliance prove the assertion that it <span class="page-break">3</span>follows its constitution, that it is patriotic, that it never was and is not now against Catholicism or Catholic priests, if not by articles published in its organ Zgoda?</p>
   <p>Let us suppose that someone who does not know anything about the real situation will take in his hand that issue of Zgoda in which the article of Mr. T. W. on the school question appeared. What would be his impression of the patriotism of the Polish National Alliance? Let us suppose that he will also take in his hand the last number of Zgoda. What conviction will he have about the respect for the true Catholic Priests?</p>
   <p>It is no wonder that journals hostile towards the Polish National Alliance, journals which are a black spot in the life of the Poles in America, are profiting by the incapability of Zgoda's editors. Would it be a bit strange if Dziennik Chicagoski, which is not yet hostile towards the Polish National <span class="page-break">4</span>Alliance, would be forced to adopt an antagonistic attitude towards it especially if its directors continue to allow the editor of Zgoda to publish articles whereby they admit that they share his opinion?</p>
