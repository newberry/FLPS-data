   <p>Because persons of other races are establishing their homes in the township of the Town of Lake, a special meeting is to be held by the Fourteenth Ward Citizens Club, under the auspices of the League of Associated Citizens Clubs of the south side, on Sunday, January 15, at 2 P. M. at Pulaski Hall, 4831 South Throop Street. The gradual arrival of other races has depreciated real estate. Because of this development, many important issues will be discussed.</p>
   <p>Property owners in this locality are requested to weigh the problem carefully and to attend the meeting, which should interest everybody.</p>
