   <p>The initiation fee for new members in the Polish Painters' Union, Local Number 7, has been lowered for the entire month of March, by special permission from the central board.</p>
   <p>Brother painters, this is a good opportunity to join the Painters' Union at a reduced cost. The initiation fee during this month has been cut in half; that is, from $15 to $7.50. This concession has been given only to the Polish local.</p>
   <p>All those interested are urged to attend the meetings which are held each Saturday evening at A. Lisztewnik's Hall, 589 Dickson Street.</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
