   <p>Thanks to the efforts and care of Reverend John Piechowski of the Congregation of the Resurrectionist Fathers, the St. Stanislaus Kostka College is continually expanding. It can be truthfully said that this institution can compete with any similar institution existing for years already and supported financially either by the government or by private persons.</p>
   <p>There are fifty students enrolled at present, and there is hope that, by a continuation of the same educational program, this number will shortly reach one hundred in view of the numerous applications from new students.</p>
   <p>I became greatly interested in this institution, because I am a Pole, and still more so because it is managed by the Polish Congregation of the Resurrectionist Fathers, which gives us hope that it will become the strong foundation of a sensible national and Catholic spirit among the young Polish people in America. Being curious, I visited the College and spent practically half a day there.</p>
   <p>I was struck by the genteel and polite behavior of the young students; and their spirit of patriotism and sincere catholicity filled my heart with gladness. It is difficult to find and keep alive a true Catholic spirit among the young people of today.</p>
   <p>After examining the boys, not only as to their knowledge but as to their characters as well, I left the College's building with a conviction that is truly a balsam for my soul. When I listened to their correct and sensible answers, especially about religion; when I saw their evident love for the Catholic Church and their country; their independent and in no way forced sense of duty; and especially when I discerned deep in their souls the love for a moral Christian life, I quietly told myself: No, these boys will not become outcast sons of Poland; this youth will be true citizens, helpful to the Church, nation, and country; these boys, taught in the immutable laws of the Catholic faith, upon leaving this institution will be adequately prepared to weather any storm threatening their morals. They will be true citizens in every sense of the word.</p>
   <p>The educational program does not in the least vary from that of other colleges. The boys are taught not only modern languages, but also physics and physiology, the history of their own and other nations, Polish literature, etc. etc.</p>
   <p>An Irishman, Mr. McEvoy, who teaches the principal subjects, is, as much as I could analyze, eminently capable and a good Catholic, possessing all of the attributes of a college teacher.</p>
   <p>Mr. McEvoy is devoting himself wholeheartedly to the willing boys, and having become acquainted with their characters, has become fond of them and they of him. I can truthfully say that, under such tutorship, our boys will become educated and will not be ashamed to appear anywhere.</p>
   <p>If anybody, however, would wish to make a personal visit to this College, I advise him to take special notice of the artistic ability of the students. Mr. Ignatius Kowalski is their teacher, and to him alone goes the credit that their talents for drawing and painting, with which God endowed them, are being so wonderfully perfected and improved.</p>
   <p>The drawings by the boys, generally speaking, are really good and, considering their youth, excellent. Some of them excel in this subject, and there are a few who may in the future become artists. The youthful Kwiatkowski and Kalinowski show exceptional aptitudes, and if they, God willing, should some day occupy a niche in fine arts, then the Poles in America will owe it to Mr. Kowalski. Mr. Kowalski is striving; at the expense of personal sacrifices and without remuneration, to improve these talents and to prepare them, if opportunity presents itself, for further study in an intensive manner in the schools of fine arts in the old country.</p>
   <p>I was also present during one lesson of gymnastic exercises by the boys of the College. Although it was only the second or third lesson, I was astounded by the precision with which they executed the various exercises. Mr. Kowalski, who instructs them without pay, is a master of gymnastic exercises. Exhibition regulations are strictly followed, and the routine of the boys' exercises is truly military in form. Mr. Kowalski deserves the highest praise for performing such a wholehearted and difficult task among the boys of St. Stanislaus Kostka College.</p>
   <p>Reverend Piechowski is also endeavoring to give the boys a musical education and has already made preparations for it by inviting an Italian, Reverend Seraphin Cosymi, a very talented musician, as professor of music.</p>
   <p>It in worthwhile also to visit the College's library, which consists of about two hundred books. The boys do not limit themselves to the instruction given, but they come to the library and acquaint themselves more thoroughly with poetry, the history of our nation, and educate themselves and improve their characters by reading the stories of our most renowned authors. The boys do not lack the desire to read but apply themselves with evident love and enthusiasm. The library, although not very large to start with, is excellent, thanks to the devoted labors of Reverend Piechowski, to the assistance of the reverend Fathers of the congregation, and to a priest who donated many of the books. The library has grown practically at the expense of the Resurrectionist Fathers. There is hope that it will soon contain one thousand volumes, as Reverend Piechowski and other priests, as well as the students, are all energetically working toward this goal.</p>
   <p>As much as I doubted in the success and expansion of the College, because of innumerable difficulties encountered by Reverend Piechowski, so much the greater is my astonishment at the masterful manner in which he has displayed his ardor and energy. Thanks only to Reverend Piechowski that this institution exists and is prospering, althogh its continued existence is growing more difficult. It is our hope that the head of the College and the eminent professors do not let anything stop them; let them remember that they labor for their countrymen, for God, and for the nation; and, above all, let them remember the words of our poet, Niemczewicz: "Not he is wise who while traveling along loses his bravery through fright: the greater the thorns, the sweeter the victory.</p>
