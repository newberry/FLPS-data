   <p>The Polish people are industrious, hard-working, frugal and honest not only in their private life, but also in politics and business.</p>
   <p>Much already has been written in various languages and by many authors of the wonderful spirit possessed by the Polish people. We were told that the Poles, great warriors though they are, do not know what hate is. They know what it is to be resolute, persistent and persevering; they have such unusual vitality that even the greatest sufferings cannot down them. They do not know what it is to hate, or to have their oppressors.</p>
   <p>Truly, the Polish spirit is wonderful.</p>
