   <p>The word "pogroms" is becoming as popular as 'bolshevism' or 'style.' Wherever a person just turns around, he hears the word pogroms. Until a short time ago we heard only of Jewish pogroms, but today we have a new expression, "pogroms of negroes."</p>
   <p>Where did this all come from? To what can one attribute this? why are such barbarian expressions and acts becoming popular in civilized countries? For whar reason are they beating the Jews in Europe and the negroes in the United States?</p>
   <p>There is a reason, perhaps deeper than it appears. They are beating Jews because they have earned it. Why, it was Jews who for hundreds of years</p>
   <p>made (efforts) towards materializing the world. The Jews have cultivated <span class="page-break">\2</span>usury; they lived in wealth while the Christians died of hunger. The Jews betrayed and cheated the Christians; they depraved their spirits. In return for that, man deprived of everything, deprived of faith and of a feeling of personal dignity, is taking revenge on the Jews.</p>
   <p>No government, no honest individual will justify this, but the one who hates the Jews justifies that within his own soul, because he feels that he was harmed by the Jews.</p>
   <p>The same can be said about the pogroms of negroes which took place recently in St. Louis, Washington and Chicago. The negroes are attacking white women and girls. The negroes have wrenched work from white Lands in many cities. The whites feel hurt, although not always through the fault of the negroes.</p>
   <p>Besides the above causes of pogroms, there is still one more, a very important one about which we cannot forget. In the pogroms of Jews, as <span class="page-break">\3</span>well as in the pogroms of Negroes, it is proper to catch sight of the German-bolshevik hand. The Germans have easy access to the Jews through money, to the Negroes through ignorance! The Jew is equally as hungry for money as the Negro is ignorant. Among such individuals, the Germans, find a ground for calling out revolutions in countries with which they have conducted a war.</p>
   <p>However, we Poles should behave peacefully in the presence of all this. Let there not be any of us among those staging the pogroms.</p>
