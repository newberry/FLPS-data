   <p>There exists in Chicago a girls club called the "Flappers." The Polish definition given to them is "blockheads of the highest degree," because they are persons opposed to dignity and respect. They wear very short skirts or dresses and want everyone to speak of them. Our clergy preaches a great deal about them, degrading their style and cautions Polish girls to shun those "blockheads." Finally, the Protestant priests were even censoring them. The "Flappers" were offended by this criticism and went to the mayor of the city, to have him prohibit further use of it. It seems that they aren't very logical if they think that painted faces and dressing in very short skirts or dresses is very suitable and becoming.</p>
