   <p>The Constitution of the United States provides that the President may, from time to time, impart information to Congress on the state of the nation and at the same time point out the shortcomings in legislation which he considers it advisable to correct. From this provision of the Constitution there developed the so-called message of the President to Congress. These are reports combined with directions and counsel. They are not orders or motions based on the strength of some right of initiative, such as executives possess in other countries. They may contain counsel, petitions, praise, and blame, and quite often they present political programs.</p>
   <p>Former presidents made their messages brief, even when they concerned matters of utmost importance. The historically famous message of President Monroe, which assured independence for the republics of South America and put an end <span class="page-break">2</span>to intervention of European powers in American affairs, did not occupy more than twenty minutes of the listener's time. The great Emancipation Proclamation of Lincoln occupies little space in writing, although it decided the fate of several million people.</p>
   <p>With time, however, these documents, coming regularly from the pens of Presidents, grew constantly until today it requires some three hours to read one of them in Congress, and whole volumes to reproduce them in print.</p>
   <p>The most recent message, for example, requires eighty-four pages for the original text and eighteen pages for supplements. That can really be considered a whole book.</p>
   <p>We are not going to enumerate here everything which President Taft considered it necessary to talk about in this book. There are several points, however, that might interest a wide group of citizens. For instance, the Panama Canal will be completed in the early part of 1915, and it will cost $375,000,000.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>That is very satisfactory, and the cost is not excessive for a thing so important to commerce. Less pleasing is the recommendation that two fortified bases be constructed on this canal. They will cost about $100,000,000, perhaps more. Yet it is necessary to fortify the canal, because when we have a canal connecting two oceans we cannot permit the Germans to take it from one end and the Japanese from the other simply because they want to do so.</p>
   <p>That the new tariff is inadequate is admitted indirectly by the President himself. This, after all, is not surprising, since the creators of the tariff law were overwhelmingly defeated by the people. The President, however, is not in favor of changing the whole tariff law immediately, because he fears that this would cause considerable confusion in the financial world. He therefore recommends a gradual correction of the tariff, point after point, beginning where experience indicates the tariff to be most detrimental. We doubt that the new Congress will be of the same opinion. If the tariff is bad, perhaps it would be better to change it all at once and be rid of this nightmare than to patch it and suffer for years.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The President is perfectly justified in pointing out to the people our lack of a merchant marine. American products travel over the entire world under all flags but the flag of this country. It can be seen, therefore, that a considerable proportion of the profit from trade falls into the hands of alien merchant ship owners. In addition to that, a large merchant fleet is priceless in the event of war, which requires many transport vessels. What, then, should be done in order to create our own merchant marine?</p>
   <p>The President has his own cure for trusts, which irritate everyone and which today every person is willing to fight. The Sherman Anti-trust Act, now in force, is good. But in order to facilitate the Government's enforcement of the law, it is necessary to compel all companies engaged in interstate commerce to become incorporated in Washington.</p>
   <p>That is just and practical. At present, companies have only state charters. The suits the Federal Government brings against them are long and expensive, and the Government usually loses in the long run. But if companies had Federal <span class="page-break">5</span>charters, the Federal Government would always be able to curb corporations with the threat of rescinding their charters for the slightest transgression. This would naturally give great power to the Government, but it is better to choose the lesser of two evils and put ourselves under the care of a Government selected by the people every four years than to remain under the pressure of trusts, who hold elections among themselves.</p>
   <p>Postal savings banks, legal provision for which was made by Congress some time ago, have not as yet been established; much time was required to work out the best system for them. At present, the President assures us, this system is ready, and in a short while we shall be able to deposit our savings with the Government, which always fully guarantees its bondholders and depositors.</p>
   <p>The president deserves praise for dealing with the parcel post question after he settled the matter of the postal savings banks. The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy discussed parcel post several months ago and added that extending it is the only way to put a stop to the exploitation carried on by the <span class="page-break">6</span>powerful and wealthy express companies.</p>
   <p>The President recommended that parcel post be introduced on all rural routes and that eleven pounds be stipulated as the weight limit on parcel post packages. That is not much, but, in comparison to the present limitation of four pounds, it is evidence of considerable progress.</p>
   <p>The President noted also one subject on which many articles have appeared in the press, namely, the abuse of the franking privileges granted to various officials and congressmen. Postal officials and the press have long complained against congressmen thoughtlessly and wastefully sending out thousands of copies of various speeches, reports, and books. No one ever reads these things and the post office incurs a deficit on account of such thoughtless practices.</p>
   <p>We cannot praise the President for his stubbornness in the matter of increasing the postal rate on all weekly and monthly periodicals. This matter provoked much bitterness last year, and it appeared then that the press was victorious <span class="page-break">7</span>for all time. Now this same question crops up in the Presidential message.</p>
   <p>We still adhere to our opinion that the Government would do best to leave the newspapers in peace and make certain that the railroads cease to exploit the post office as they have been doing. The railroads of England carry mail at one fourth the rate that the Government here pays, and yet they show a profit on the business.</p>
   <p>As a great attorney and a judge of long standing, President Taft could not help noticing two terrible shortcomings of American judicial procedure, namely, its expensiveness and the unnecessary postponements it involves. Gratitude is due him for pointing out these errors and recommending their correction.</p>
   <p>"Under the present system" the President writes "a poor man is powerless in court in the presence of a wealthy opponent or corporation. Reform is, therefore, necessary in all the courts of the nation."</p>
   <p>Equally good is a paragraph of the message on the role of the Supreme Court.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>This Court was created to interpret the Constitution, not to listen to appeals in all kinds of cases that might come under its jurisdiction. Processes should be conducted in the lower courts and appeals should be carried to only one higher court. Flooding the Supreme Court with numerous cases of lesser importance is harmful to the parties and to the entire nation.</p>
   <p>Many things could be said on the interpretation of our Constitution by the present Supreme Court. It is well that the executive authority is beginning to notice and understand the abnormal state of affairs that has been created by constant appeals of wealthy people to the Supreme Court, which was never intended by the framers of the Constitution to hear these appeals.</p>
   <p>At the present time, the President does not look too deeply into foreign policy. He is justified in this, because there is nothing on that horizon which arouses great interest. He does, however, mention that today China is the place to which the attention of the whole political world is turned with greatest seriousness. On this occasion the President expresses the desire that the <span class="page-break">9</span>amount of American capital should surpass that of other nation's in the development of railroads in China. There will be something to build in China for a considerable length of time, and hence American rails and locomotives, as well as American engineers, will be of use there.</p>
