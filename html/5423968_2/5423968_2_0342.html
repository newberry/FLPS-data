   <p>Trr!! Trrrr!........</p>
   <p>Hello! Who's there?</p>
   <p>Is this the main headquarters of the American chauvinists?</p>
   <p>Yes. And who's there?</p>
   <p>This is Bismarck, at the bottom of hell, your teacher and brother.</p>
   <p>Bismarck .... from hell? ... And what do you want and why do you call yourself our brother? You were a despot, bureaucrat, and we free Americans, from whence then this relationship?</p>
   <p>Take it easy Mister, take it easy! I was a bigger chauvinist than a <span class="page-break">\2</span>despot and bureaucrat, and all those bureaucratic principles grew out of my chauvinism, and whereas you are also <span class="gap">[gap]</span> therefore your chauvinism will push you to persecutions and bureaucratic governments, and from this comes our relationship.</p>
   <p>We are not as extreme as you were. You forbade many things which are permitted by us. We desire that everybody at home and on the street should use the English language; that they should read only English newspapers; that they should attend only English schools; that they....</p>
   <p>Yes, yes, that they .... and for that reason you fall upon that which is dearest to every nation, its language. I wanted to accomplish this and I made a mistake. Because look what my chauvinism has done. Today my beloved Germany is a ruin, infamously beaten, and the acquisition of all my work went for naught. Oh! if I could only live a second time I would do otherwise!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>And then you admit that you were a stupid fellow, when you were in this world?</p>
   <p>Oh yes, I was a complete fool. Today I would do otherwise. Today I would not force the Poles to accept any laws that would be offending to them or directed at their national welfare. They would have complete freedom, but in return for that they would be requested for compact unity with us. We would do likewise with other nations and with their support we would not have to fear England and their allies, and win the present war. And so when everything was fragile with us the Poles caught us from the rear by the pantalcons and today enclosed us from the East.</p>
   <p>My corpse from despair is howling in the grave and is turning on all sides, and I, from despair, have run to the bottom of hell itself in order to forget about that misfortune.</p>
   <p>But what has that in common with our situation?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Very much. You want to bring about the same kind of ruin for your country, as I brought about in my country. Do you think that your tongue is holding your people together? Not the tongue, but the principles of liberty and justice. These forged the people into one family, which stood in this war as one man to battle. Those which did not speak English loved your country better than you chauvinists who tried to extricate yourselves from the army.</p>
   <p>You lie and defame us.</p>
   <p>I do not lie. I am a spirit and I am looking on your hearts and I see what is in them: <span class="gap">[gap]</span>gotism and folly. Your great leader, Washington, is turning over in his grave from anger, for you are destroying that which he accomplished. Your chauvinism will bring upon your country disasters and hatred of not only those who are in Europe, but of your own citizens. These citizens, angered at you, will conduct a struggle <span class="page-break">\5</span>with you. You will not bear the losses, your country will. Do not follow in my foolish footsteps. The entire development of your country depends on those incoming masses of humans which were drawn to your country by the principles of freedom. These immigrants have built for you homes, roads, bridges, cities.... They are bringing up for you defenders and new citizens... Take a walk through the settlements of these immigrants, for the most part Catholics, and you will see them abounding with little children who are being reared by those immigrants. And what are you rearing, you wealthier Americans? In your sections one cannot hear the laughing of children, in your windows can be seen signs that you let out your dwellings only to families without children. Dogs and cats you can have, but not children. Therefore, if you will persecute these immigrants, they will return to Europe, and you will decline and your chauvinism will destroy you completely and give you up under foreign influence.</p>
   <p>Hm!! So you have grown immensely wiser, Mr. Bismarck. Perhaps this is <span class="page-break">\6</span>good advice, but what has caused you to give us such a lesson?</p>
   <p>What? I see the terrible results of my earthly chauvinism and due to that I am approaching madness. I do not wish humanity to suffer from this cause, and that is why I advise you to desist from these attacks on the language of your immigrants. The children of these immigrants make use of the English language, and poverty in Europe frightens them from departing, when on the other hand the principles of Washington will continue to protect the arrivals. Many of these arrivals will stay and will undergo a natural Americanization. On the contrary, against your action there will begin among the immigrants a powerful reaction which will be supported by European governments, from which can arise a dangerous quarrel with Europe. And about what? About the foolish chauvinists, such as I was, and such as you are.</p>
   <p>So you think that you and we are fools?</p>
   <p>Yes, the biggest boobs in the entire world, and you will be still <span class="page-break">\7</span>greater ones, if you will not desist from your words. Everybody thinks this way about you; everybody predicts that you will bring misfortune upon your country with your unwise action.</p>
   <p>Oh! if I could live a second time and mend my foolish practice with the Poles... But it is too late, my Fatherland is in adversity and I am going mad in despair... and the old body cannot lie down peacefully. If it were not for that caused chauvinism, my Fatherland would have been great and other nations, like the Poles, would live with us in peace: they and ourselves fortunate... Oh! but I am unfortunate!! I say goodby to you!</p>
