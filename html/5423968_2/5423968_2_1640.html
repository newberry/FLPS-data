   <p>After two months of a hard struggle by the strikers of the Chicago stock yards an end of the strike has been declared under the conditions of the owners of the packing houses.</p>
   <p>The end of the strike does not yet mean return to former occupations, because the question that comes into consideration is whether the packers wish to accept the former employees back to work. The workers went out on strike because they were forced to it. The pay which they received for hard work in foul-smelling dark holes was not sufficient to feed a good sized family. It was not even sufficient for a single man to keep himself decently, and here again we receive the information that the pay will receive further cents. The workers have felt a terrible injustice caused by the owners of the packing houses, and have resolved to ask for their rights. They endeavored to present to the meat barons their unpleasant predicament, but all of their complaints received no <span class="page-break">2</span>response. Nothing else was left for the workers but to go out on strike. They went! Unfortunately, they did not assure themselves as to the certainty of coming out victorious. They were not told that other unions would not join their strike and that they were going out on strike on their own strength. Today, after two months of want, the Polish workers were told that they could call off the strike. We saw our fellow countrymen strikers yesterday as they waited at the employment bureau of Swift and Company; we saw how hundreds of them walked away from the window after being turned down, with no hope of receiving a job in the future. That is the tragedy of our ignorant Polish workingman. The Polish community ought to do something to make things easier for these poor souls. Through the columns of our newspaper we appeal to people of good will and to the hearts of the merciful about donations for the poor, unprotected families of the strikers, who probably throughout the whole winter will not find work. We beg that all donations be sent to the office of The Polish Union Daily, and the amount and name <span class="page-break">3</span>of the donors will be placed in the columns of the newspaper.</p>
   <p>The money collected will be sent to the welfare societies which are in every Polish parish in the Stock Yards district.</p>
