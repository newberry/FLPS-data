   <p>If you wish to and must marry a person of another nationality you must be cautious.</p>
   <p>1. Remember, you must honor and love your faith, because - as a Catholic - God will not recognize you without your religion.</p>
   <p>2. Pray for the will to abide by the laws and traditions of the Holy Church.</p>
   <p>3. Love and honor your church and heed its requests, such as fasting during Lent, attending church every Sunday, etc.</p>
   <p>4. Remember that God grants you children, and wishes you to rear them for his heaven - and the only path that leads to heaven is the Catholic church.</p>
   <p>5. Respect the matrimonial sacrament.</p>
   <p>6. In your actions be directed not by what the public thinks you should do, but what God demands from you.</p>

   <p>7. Do not seek the earthly pleasures, but strive for the eternal and everlasting joy.</p>
   <p>8. Live piously - as a Catholic does.</p>
   <p>9. Ask God's will whom you should wed for your life's companion.</p>
   <p>10. Before you marry, ask him or her who that person is; how was his conduct, rearing, etc.</p>
   <p>11. Stay away from widows or divorcees if possible.</p>
   <p>12. Marry only a person that you know something about, who is a good Catholic, a sincere person.</p>
   <p>13. Choose a person of your own class.</p>
   <p>14. Before taking steps toward the sacrament of matrimony, consult your parents and your priest.</p>

   <p>15. Never before such an important selection, should you celebrate it with drinking or dancing.</p>
   <p>16. You must be aware of sin; sinning before marriage curtails your blessings from God.</p>
   <p>17. Be sincere to your companion at all times.</p>
   <p>18. Note, on the other hand, if it isn't for your money that the person marries you.</p>
   <p>19. If you happen to know that ill-faith and misfortune will be with you when married, don't marry.</p>
   <p>20. Choose a person rather poor, but energetic, than a rich person who is lazy; rather a faithful person than an elegant brute, rather a sober workman than a drunken master.</p>
