   <p>We have the honor of announcing that the Polish owners of cleaning and dyeing establishments have organized and have their own local. For the time being, meetings will be held every Monday, at 8 P. M., at John Gala's hall, corner of Augusta and Noble Streets, in order to give all those who have not yet done so the opportunity of joining our organization. We invite all the tailors who belong to the main local to join us, as we will thus have more votes in the main administration, and people of some other nationality will not be able to act independently. We wish to improve our living conditions, since in recent times the tailoring business has fallen so low that it is practically impossible to make a living at it. As everyone knows, the prices of merchandise have soared. Wholesale dyers and cleaners have raised their prices in proportion to the cost of labor and materials, so that our prices have had to increase. Therefore, colleagues, join our local, because, as you know, in union there is strength.</p>

   <p>Besides, the good of all demands that reasonable and standard prices be established.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held at Gala's hall, corner Noble and Augusta Streets, on April 2, at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Committee:</p>
   <p>Gorny</p>
   <p>Gabryszewski</p>
   <p>Zarnowski</p>
