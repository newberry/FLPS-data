   <p>Our description of the Polish-Lithuanian exercises held yesterday at Pulaski Hall in St. Adalbert's Parish will be short. The reasons why they were held and the noble aims of the Union of Lublin Society, Group 578 of the Polish National Alliance, have already been extensively described. In fact, we shall further discuss this matter in future articles; and so, for the time being, we shall merely submit an account of what occurred at the exercises, of the scandalous behavior of the Lithuanian socialists and the praiseworthy reaction of Polish-Lithuanians and Lithuanian nationalists, and, finally, the result of the exercises.</p>
   <p>The exercises opened shortly before eight o'clock in the evening with the hall filled to capacity. W. Billnski, who opened the exercises, called upon W. Kraszewski to act as chairman and upon Dr. L. Szumkowski to serve as secretary. The writer arrived at the hall about an hour earlier, in <span class="page-break">2</span>order to talk over a few points with both sides, points, that, once raised upon the floor, might create a disturbance. To his own wonder, he discovered that the hall was being filled with a radical Lithuanian element, hostile toward everything concerning Poles and Poland. They were a collection of the lowest type of people, who gathered in groups for spirited discussions, casting hostile glances the while. Many of them carried canes, or had clubs hidden underneath their coats. One glance at these groups, which reminded one strongly of Bolshevik henchmen, was enough to make one understand that there was trouble in the air, that an attack was planned, the more so since in the hands of many of them could be seen copies of the Lithuanian Bolshevik newspaper Draugas [Comrade], which in its latest issue had scandalously attacked the Poles.</p>
   <p>NEAR RIOT IN HALL</p>
   <p>There were to have been two speeches in Polish and two in Lithuanian, but only <span class="page-break">3</span>one of each was delivered. The first speaker was the Polish recruiting officer, L. Haduch, of Omaha, Nebreska. Although he spoke with great warmth, he did not touch upon the Lithuanian question, and discussed general subjects only. The Lithuanians behaved themselves, although voices of protest were raised at every mention of the Polish Army or the Poles. The next speaker, the Lithuanian lawyer Kodis, also spoke in general terms, for he knew what was up and did not want to touch off the storm. It broke, however, immediately after Chairman Kraszewski severely rebuked one of the Lithuanian Bolsheviks for an impolitic remark. Without waiting for the program to continue so as to permit a proper discussion of the purposes of the gathering, Bolshevik Lithuania reared its ugly head. The attack first came in words: Lithuanians need not rise when the Polish national anthem is played! Immediately thereafter, someone arose with a prepared resolution condemning Poland; amid shouts and threats and the [singing of the] Lithuanian national anthem, this was adopted by the mob that had been herded into the hall by Muscovite or Tilsit-Berlin Prussian leaders. When the Poles and sensible Lithuanians protested violently against <span class="page-break">4</span>this proceeding, chairs were lifted in the air and clubs came into view. It would certainly have come to serious bloodshed had it not been for the dignified behavior of the Poles and right-thinking Lithuanians, who looked upon the seething Bolshevik mob with pity. Their leaders, fearing the consequences of a riot, likewise called upon their followers to leave the hall.</p>
   <p>CONCLUSION OF THE EXERCISES</p>
   <p>When Bolshevik Lithuania had left amid shouts and threats, the remaining Poles and Lithuanians concluded the exercises with tact and dignity.</p>
   <p>Editor H. Lokanski spoke in Polish in behalf of the Polish National Alliance, and Peter Misiewicz spoke in Lithuanian. W. Bilinski and S. Rokosz, former president of the Polish National Alliance, also spoke. Bolshevik Lithuania was condemned, and a counter resolution (to appear in tomorrow's issue) <span class="page-break">5</span>protesting against the resolution forced upon the gathering was passed. A collection for the American Red Cross netted $26.24.</p>
   <p>Public testimony that the outbreak was planned was given by Leonard Piront, Miss Helen Kraszewski, Alphonse Swirski, J. Romanowski, and Joseph Zelnia. All of these persons understand and speak Lithuanian well, and they heard how plans were made to throw the Poles and Lithuanians from the platform and settle with them. Because of this, the right-thinking Lithuanians felt the riot the more painfully and were the more respectful to the Poles present. And they were the more earnest in singing "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland] and "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" [Poland is not yet lest] to conclude the exercises.</p>
