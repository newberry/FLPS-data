   <p>The correspondence we have received will not be answered, for it mostly concerns our support of another political party. Such criticism is negligible to our cause. Our purpose is to appease and heal, and not to irritate and pollute. No one was ever influenced by abusive attacks. Polak W Ameryce (The Pole in America) has been using this method for five years. Can anyone truthfully say that it did the people or the Church any good? Did it reform any of the people?</p>
   <p>The Reverend pastor of St. Albert's parish is held in high regard by his <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>parishioners for his hard work and no amount of biased attacks will change that opinion. The many articles filled with calumny and slander in the Nowem Zyciu (New Life) will not discredit the pastor's work one iota. You write that there are among you rogues, wretches, etc. What surprises us is that the number is so small, because they have in the Nowem Zyciu a diabolical haven, which condemns the Christian soul.</p>
   <p>As to the inquiry about the purpose of our society, we gladly cite the following:</p>
   <p>"Every member of Our Lady of Sorrows Society, according to its constitution, is obligated to make an effort to become a citizen of the United States. On April 3, it was agreed by the members of the society to get the assistance of the other societies of the parish to organize a Polish Catholic political club."</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The society, according to the above statement, has the right to induce other fraternal organizations of St. Albert's parish to take the suggestion under consideration.</p>
   <p>The aims of this political club will be as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To help the members secure their citizenship papers as quickly as possible.</p>
   <p>2. To support faithful and Polish candidates who run for public office.</p>
   <p>3. To warn the Polish citizens before election time about the unfaithful candidates.</p>
   <p>4. To elevate the good of the club and the name of each Polish citizen.</p>
   <p>Signed by the officers of Our Lady of Sorrows Society:</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Ignacy Makowski, president</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Andrezejewski, vice-president</p>
