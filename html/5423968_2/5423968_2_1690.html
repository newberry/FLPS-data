   <p>Saturday, union directors dropped plans for peace negotiations relative to the strike in the packing house industry. This decision was reached at a special session of union officials in the office of Dennis Lane, one of the head directors of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers Union (sic).</p>
   <p>At the same time, two hundred and fifty people were being sworn in before the Deputy Superintendent of Police as special deputies to patrol the Stockyards territory.</p>
   <p>According to C. J. Hayes, president of one of the local unions, negotiations for peace will only be taken up when the officials of the packing houses take the first steps in this direction. Federal and State mediators, upon hearing the news of dissension between workers <span class="page-break">2</span>and employers, offered to take a hand in the affair. However, the employers stated that the company officials up to the present time did not show any willingness to arbitrate. The strikers will demand the cancellation of the ten per cent cut in pay and the appointment of Judge Alschuler as arbitrator, when a conference is called.</p>
   <p>Besides the upsetting of a loaded wagon of meat belonging to Wilson and Company, and the attacking of a worker Francis Kruszka who refused to join the strikers, no other outbreaks took place Saturday.</p>
   <p>Nelson Morris, president of Morris and Company, revealed a record of the production of his firm before and after the strike. Figures show that 33,312 head of cattle were killed last week. 38,487 the week before; and 25,969 the first week.</p>
   <p>Of the crowd of workers gathered last night about the Yards, eight were <span class="page-break">3</span>arrested and fined from one to twenty dollars. Twenty-eight others were released, pending a trial, while seventeen were set free.</p>
   <p>Rioting was expected in Kansas City Saturday when union leaders announced that they no longer were able to control the strikers.</p>
   <p>Dennis Lane announced that 22,500 are out on strike, while packing house employers said that conditions are normal in their plants.</p>
   <p>Both sides made further preparations to see who would be the victor. The strikers turned for aid in their cause to other unions represented in the packing houses, which up to now have not been approached. Strong agitation has already been started. R. E. Parker, president of the organization of Negro workers, American Unity Labor Union, was reported to have said that all efforts of the companies using strikebreakers will bring them to no good. Strikers have strengthened those places, which <span class="page-break">4</span>in the opinion of strikebreakers, are forbidden to them. General mass meetings of Negro workers were to have taken place Saturday.</p>
   <p>The Mayor of Kansas City Harry Burton turned to President Harding with a plea to intervene, when union leaders refused to negotiate with company officials. It was rumored that the secretary - cashier of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workers Union (sic) together with the president Cornelius J. Hayes, was to be called to a conference in Washington. This report was not confirmed Saturday. The attorneys believe that the agreement of Judge Alschuler was cancelled at the conference in Washington, at which many of the workers' representatives were present.</p>
   <p>The union leaders stood by the demands of 50,000 workers who had delegated them as representatives. They contended that in spite of the decrease in wages, no proportional drop in the prices of commodities, including meat, had taken place. The workers stated that they are prepared to <span class="page-break">5</span>resort to rioting in the event that their demands are not met.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated Food Workers Union is to decide today whether or not they will go out on strike in sympathy with the Stockyards strikers. A majority of them represent the retail trade. The Food Workers (sic) have a representative membership to 4,000.</p>
   <p>Francis Justian, one of the strikebreakers, was struck on the head with an empty bottle by one of the strikers yesterday for declining to join his group.</p>
   <p>General opinion has it that the strike will end this week. A report was received today that stated that Dennis Lane, secretary - cashier of the Union, had left for Washington to present his grievances to President Harding. He believes that the President will call officials of the packing house industry for arbitration. Cornelius Hayes, president of the union, left for New York to confer with local unions. He is also going <span class="page-break">6</span>to Washington to see the President.</p>
   <p>It has been said that the employers are sorry now for having said that they did not want to negotiate with the strikers. Five mass meetings were held yesterday on the South Side by the strikers.</p>
   <p>Demonstrations in Kansas City resulted in a conference of the strikers and city officials. Mayor Burton warned the union leaders with the statement that if the rioting continues steps will be taken by the city to have the union dissolved.</p>
