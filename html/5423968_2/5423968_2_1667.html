   <p>The Stockyards strike is entering its sixth week with no apparent change in conditions. The strikers are adhering firmly to their original plans. They have firm belief in their leaders who say that victory for them will be within their grasp shortly.</p>
   <p>A large number of women, who are employed in the Stockyards, attended a meeting held especially for them at 10 A. M. today in Slowacki's Hall, 48th and Paulina streets.</p>
   <p>The police are still patrolling the streets in the packing house area. Many times throughout the day, officers could be seen on both sides of the streets.</p>
   <p>Over a hundred complaints have been received at the New City Police <span class="page-break">2</span>Station relative to the breaking of windows in the homes of strikebreakers.</p>
   <p>Those who have not as yet made any donation toward the fund for needy strikers are urged to do so. Contributions can be sent to Slowacki's Hall, 1700 W. 48th Street in care of W. Bakowski.</p>
