   <p>Yesterday, June 17, was a most auspicious day for the Parish of St. Michael's on Warsaw. In spite of numerous efforts during many years this parish got a spiritual pastor only in the last few months, in the person of Reverend Adolph Nowicki. As the Dziennik has already reported the local orchestra has conducted a serenade in honor of the Reverend Father.</p>
   <p>On June 17, Rev. Barzynski of Chicago, officiated in the exposition of the Holy Sacrament at 9:00 A. M. in the morning for the success of the celebrant and the youthful parish. The choir under the direction of Mr. Wiedemann, sang the Holy Mass in Latin very beautifully.</p>
   <p>The parishioners, all of whom are hard-laboring people, took a day off and took part in the festivity. The Knights of St. Casimir participated <span class="page-break">2</span>in the festivity in body.</p>
   <p>The parishioners presented the celebrant with numerous gifts.</p>
   <p>Among the guests were: Rev. Barzynski, Rev. Sullivan, Rev. Van Delart, Rev. Zylla, Rev. Ratz, and Rev. Kobylinski.</p>
