   <p>The so-called intelligentsia mentioned in yesterday's article could have rendered very worthy services to our immigrants, had they come to this country with other intentions and ideas than the ones they have expressed so far. The majority of our so-called intellectuals is composed of adventurers and people extremely presumptuous. At this time, we shall omit the adventurers and dwell on the presumptuous.</p>
   <p>The latter, having a better training because they had a little schooling, upon arriving here considered themselves too superior and too well educated, especially among the former peasants and common laborers, to stoop down to enlighten the ignorant. They did not even care to adapt themselves to their new environment or to the living conditions they were about to face. Neither <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>did they attempt--unless it was for the sake of showing off--to effect a change in the peasants they expected to find here.</p>
   <p>In an overestimation of their own wisdom, they believed they were the chosen ones to keep culture and knowledge alive. They knew that the priests had something in common with the people, yet they wanted to make us believe that besides prayers the priests have taught nothing else. Regarding themselves even superior to prayer, they set out to enlighten the people in their own way.</p>
   <p>However, the common people turned out to be entirely different from what they had imagined. With little or no schooling at all--because a time never came when they could avail themselves of book learning--the peasant and the laborer had become American citizens; their minds were more developed; they had clear ideas, and their outlook on the world, as free citizens, was the outlook of an equal among equals. A change had taken place; the peasants and laborers were different. The allegedly "learned" had underrated the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>"ignorant" people, who, in turn, saw through them, looking down on them because they lacked the knack of settling down, as the earlier settlers had done, and because their only endeavor was to impress the public with their knowledge and studies. Among them were many adventurers who, unable to earn an honest living, resorted to different schemes and abused the confidence of others with dishonorable tricks, thus exploiting the gullible public. As a result, a certain distrust developed toward these "propagators of culture." The clergy would not give them any support, because they, too, had been victimized. Consequently, the distrust harbored between the two resulted in dissension. To begin with, these "intellectuals" depended on the priests for help and support. Obviously, they promised to mend their ways and took recourse to every conceivable move that would ingratiate them to the clergy, in the hope of gaining their support and help. But when, on account of their behavior, they lost the confidence of the clergy, they became their secret adversaries.</p>
   <p>All other avenues to the gullible closed, they decided to get to them through <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>their weaker side--patriotism. They concluded that their claims to higher learning would not accomplish anything and decided to advance through a new road, safer and certain.</p>
   <p>A year of preparation for this struggle--which by now takes on a definite scope--furnished them with important and effective material.</p>
   <p>Above all, to redeem public confidence they have sought legitimate means of earning a livelihood, a fact which we do not hold against them. This was not as difficult as it may seem, since anybody willing to work will undoubtedly find employment in America. Thus, they turned over a new leaf, and became apparently decent. The adventurers either remained as such, disappeared, or else met with ill fate.</p>
   <p>Endowed with the ability to speak fluently and write well, it was not long before they found friends among the people. At patriotic events--then mostly conducted by priests--they were allowed to address the people, soon <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>becoming well known. Having thus gained their popularity, they began to sponsor various national events on their own initiative, so as to inculcate in the people the belief that patriotism is a thing aside from religious sentiment. Not wishing a clash with the religious feelings of the people, in their speeches they pretended to be interested in religion, mentioning now and then the Polish Shrine of Czestochowa, the piety of our ancestors, and their reverence for the church. In spite of all these assertions, their real task was to instill gradually in the people the belief that the Church has no business in affairs of the state. At the same time, they made use of the reputation of certain priests to further their cause. In fact, among the immigrated clergy there were some who were actually setting bad examples to the public. So these great patriots scrupulously uncovered these matters, presenting them to the public in glaring colors, in the form of an outburst of rage, or disguised with crocodile tears under a mask of pity for the transgressors. To complete their wicked preparation for the struggle with the clergy, they succeeded in gaining new allies, partly from among the less worthy clergy, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>and partly from among the worthy ones, who were too credulous and could not foresee the ultimate purpose of the dissension--to separate the public from religion. Instead of seeing the truth, these clergymen let themselves be trapped with sweet-sounding words of pretended patriotism and a written guarantee of reverence for the faith of our fathers.</p>
   <p>Thus were influenced a vast number of people, who didn't suspect they were being weaned from religion, and who believed that by turning their eyes to patriotism they were on the way to rebuild Poland. And so it was that the movement to keep the Church out of patriotic affairs gained its momentum--so it was that faith in these "great leaders" and distrust toward certain priests developed.</p>
   <p>As the forces of this faction increased, the distrust of certain people toward the priests, even the most exemplary, became worse. It was not long before the priests--the original propagators of culture, founders of churches, schools, and societies--were visited by people who had <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>their own personal interests at heart. The widespread defamation did the rest. Even monks without any real estate or other possessions were accused of accumulating wealth, of exploiting the hard-working class, of being a lot of hypocrites, and of a thousand other vices. The clergy--regarded in the past as upright, patriotic, and beneficial--became despicable to many people, with the result that the ranks of their opponents grew bigger every day.</p>
   <p>The opponents became bold, made their appearance in the open, without reserve. Their ranks reinforced, they at last decided to throw away their masks. Their first move was to get rid of the priests; the very same priests they pretended to regard as indispensable before were now to be put aside.</p>
   <p>Finally, the eyes of some in the ranks of the opponents opened to the truth. For some, however, it was too late to leave the ranks, as by so doing they would forfeit all benefits promised to them when they joined the ranks. Others who liked the new doctrine have adopted it, so that their conscience is clear.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Still others remain with the opponents because they don't know any better; their lack of reasoning power being the only thing that keeps them there. As the time passed, the intentions behind the masks of these leaders became more and more discernible. Soon they began, in their newspapers, to slander the clergy--the priests who were beyond reproach as well as the others. Some of their articles urged the Poles to send their children to public schools instead of parochial schools. Other articles intended to prove that only a minority of Poles profess the Catholic religion, and that religious indifference is essential to true patriotism. All in all, these articles were written for the purpose of instilling, maintaining and spreading hatred toward the priests. Those at the head called themselves the choice of the national will and called the priests obtruding leaders. Setting the latter aside, they strove to retain the monopoly of patriotism for themselves. Eventually, it was revealed that these leaders belong to secret associations forbidden to Catholics, or else they are Jews or Calvinists--in a word, enemies of Catholicism. There is no other explanation for this struggle against the Catholic clergy, since <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>most of them are good patriots who, since the very beginning of the immigration influx, have given many proofs of their patriotism.</p>
   <p>It is not true that the majority of the immigrants, as stated in the Emigration Review, [published in Poland] is entrenched against the clergy. Of this we shall write tomorrow.</p>
