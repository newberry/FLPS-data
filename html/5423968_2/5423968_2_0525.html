   <p>Alderman Kunz' Opinion</p>
   <p>Interrogated this morning concerning his stand on cabarets and the proposed reforms, Alderman Stanley Kunz said:</p>
   <p>"The type of cabaret that we have in Chicago has been the cause of many a domestic drama, and has likewise been the cause of many dramas in the lives of young men and women. If it is abolished, I am sure that it will be a beneficial reform in the sale of liquor. Naturally, I cannot say that all cabarets are evil, but it is my opinion that a great many of them abuse their privileges and the law. No exceptions can be made and no one can be said to be better than the next. For this reason, it seems to me that it would be best to abolish entirely this type of cabaret in Chicago."</p>
