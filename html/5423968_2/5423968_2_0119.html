   <p>An article appearing in the Thursday edition of the Wilkes-Barre Leader tells about the Polish people collecting to build a Polish High School at the cost of $50,000. Too bad that only the English press knows the system used by the Poles to procure money for this school.</p>
   <p>The architects are planning to make this school one of the best, that is the reason why the press does not print much about the plans. But as soon as the necessary information is given to the committee in charge, it will appear in the Polish newspapers, so that the Poles will be informed as to the progress shown in this great movement.</p>
   <p>Wilkes-Barre will have the honor of being the first city in the United States to have a Polish high school built at a cost of $50,000.</p>
