   <p>Attempts to organize a Polish bakers union in Chicago has not come to an end, because at the last meeting March 5th at Greenwall's hall at Blackhawk and Holt Avenues were many bakers, who were in favor of such an organization. This union was finally organized March 19th at Greenwall's hall.</p>
   <p>Only bakers are entitled to join as members, with the exception of Mr.W. KARLOWSKI, who is an honorary member.</p>
   <p>It is the intentions of this organization to join with the knights of labor to make this labor group stronger. If this went through, it would make it the fourth local of the knights of labor in Chicago. They are striving to have one more local join this union, if five locals were joined as one it would require permission from the other unions, before any matter would be taken up. This is something that the Polish people should take into consideration, do their utmost to see this in reality.</p>
