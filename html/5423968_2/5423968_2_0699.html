   <p>Almost all the newspapers are filled with unpleasant news about crimes committed by very young offenders.</p>
   <p>The most deplorable thing is that among the offenders appear Polish names. Who is really to blame? Fathers and mothers! If such young boys break any law, you, not they, should be punished. Remember that you still have control and influence over them. Unexplainable indifference and carelessness are the real causes for these conditions. Parents do not know what their children are doing. Parents! For such negligence you shall answer before men and God. Remember that a young child, like a small tree, can be bent - but try to bend a large tree and you will break it. Bend them while there is time.</p>
   <p>Remember what Christ said, "It is better to tie a millstone to your neck and drown yourself than to give bad example to little ones."</p>
