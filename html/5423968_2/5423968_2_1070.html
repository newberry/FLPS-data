   <p>The services of Kosciuszko and Pulaski, rendered for this country, were so great that the government of the United States erects monuments to the glory of these heroes. The hands of our working people toil in excavating coal mines, in forests, steel mills, but still they are not avaricious, they contribute vastly toward this cause. Beside the discovery of Kopernik America also profits with the whole world through other notables such as Modrzejewska, Kochanska, Paderewski and Sienkiewicz, and the Americans know this fact better than any one else.</p>
