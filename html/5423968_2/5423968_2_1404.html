   <p>According to the calculations of experts, the cost of mining a long ton of coal in Pennsylvania is $2.13. A long ton of coal weighs 2,300 pounds, sometimes more. When the consumer buys from a dealer, the "long" ton becomes "short", that is, it is equivalent to 2,000 pounds, provided, of course, that the dealer is honest, for it is a well-known fact that sometimes, it weighs only 1,800 pounds. The coal is often soaked with water in order to make it heavier.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago, at the retail outlets, one must pay eight dollars for a ton of coal, so that transportation and the middleman's profit amount to $5.87 on each short ton.</p>
   <p>This is an unheard-of extortion, and it is surprising that neither the law <span class="page-break">2</span>nor the people in general oppose and put a stop to it. If the mines and the railroads were government property, that is, if they belonged to the nation, as the post office department now does, there would be no more "long" tons for the laborers and short ones for the purchasers, but one weight and a just price. Railroads under Federal control would not charge such exorbitant prices for the transportation of coal, and Federal warehouses could sell this necessary fuel at cost or at a slight profit. Then there would be no multimillionaires here, but neither would there be poverty. Government ownership of all public utilities and mines is the only way in which to crush monopolies and put an end to the high cost of living.</p>
