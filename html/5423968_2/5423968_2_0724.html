   <p>"Seed to seed there will be a measure," says the proverb. If our forefathers, besides praiseworthy thrift for charitable purposes, were not also the spendthrifts, if they had remembered that the deepest well runs dry, we would not complain today about our poverty.</p>
   <p>The land flowed with milk and honey. Our country not only supplied the needs of her people, but also exported her goods, Kings, princes and the rich, bought everything they needed outside of their country, they overpaid for the goods they bought in foreign countries. For this reason trade could not develop. They lived with their families for years in foreign countries, many of them did not even know how much land they owned nor where it lay. This still would not be so bad, but worse yet, they spent more than they possessed and led a luxurious life. Gradually the country became poor and with it came financial ruin and downfall. We spent the money, and the enemy took our lands. The Germans today are buying out the bankrupt aristocracy, the Russians do not allow us to buy land, and the aristocracy and peasants in Galicia are nothing else but tenants of Jewish bankers and pawn brokers.</p>

   <p>It was not good times that brought us to America. Practically all of us came here for bread, and all of us must fight for it.</p>
   <p>In spite of hardships of life and expense of keeping our families, our immigrants have contributed generously for charitable purposes. This is proven by our schools, churches, hospitals, homes for the aged and orphans.</p>
   <p>Today we are lifting ourselves out of material helplessness and have won a high position. We should go onward upon this road. The best way to this is thrift. We should be first in line, and train our children likewise. They will inherit after us, and if we do not teach them thrift, they will not know how to keep what their parents worked for.</p>
   <p>Our mothers often pay their children for small services and give them money for useless things. It is no wonder we see an adolescent without shoes and a torn coat but smoking a cigarette and swallowing sweets by the handful.</p>

   <p>Daughters whom we do not wish to hurt earn good salaries in shops, but of this only a small portion or nothing is saved for a dark hour.</p>
   <p>Everything goes for clothes and all sort of nonsense, without which they could very well get along. Sometimes we see a shack bending to the earth, and we think poverty is quartered there, then we see coming out the shack a perfumed and rouged daughter, dressed in silks and satins in the very latest fashion.</p>
   <p>Such ladies are the future thorns in domestic life. Not knowing thrift no matter how much they have later it will never be enough.</p>
   <p>We Poles need to be thrifty because only by thrift can we bring our communities to a higher place. With money thrown away in a year for children's caramels and other sweets, a child could be clothed. Dresses, hats, etc. bought at cheaper prices would detract nothing from the beauty of our Polish girls.</p>
   <p>A Polish girl although dressed less expensively is more charming than <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>an American with an elongated face from chewing gum and feet that resemble the runners of a sled.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget that by saving we form the national wealth. We should not throw the money away because that ruins us and living beyond our means pushes us into the arms of poverty.</p>
   <p>A thrifty child will be a thrifty housekeeper and mother.</p>
   <p>"Seed to seed and there will be a measure."</p>
