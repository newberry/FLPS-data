   <p>When in the entire country the voice of ever-increasing protest and indignation is being raised against the extortionism of the robbing trusts; when finally the Government, under the pressure of public opinion, has begun court investigations and brought legal action against some of the larger hydras; when even the courts, having recognized the knavery of all sorts of corporations and monopolies, are dissolving them and are placing fines on their creators, then the very creators and fathers of the trusts take the floor and give their "friendly" advice.</p>
   <p>Such tardy advisers, and, one can say, false friends of the general public, turn out to be, among other financial potentates and creators of trusts, Andrew Carnegie, the creator and protector of the steel trust, and Elbert H. Gary, president of the trust called the United States Steel Corporation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The first of these advisers, the millionaire Carnegie, published an article in the North American Review, in which he advises the government not to dissolve completely all sorts of corporations which do not even violate the antitrust laws, but proposes that they be placed under government control and that an interstate commission be formed to regulate the prices of all agricultural produce and factory products. Carnegie maintains that just as a judge cannot judge himself in any matter whatever, so the farmer and factory worker should not fix the prices of their products, but that these should be decided by an impartial commission, which will figure the costs of the producer, how much profit he should make, and at what prices agricultural produce and factory merchandise should be sold.</p>
   <p>Further, Carnegie advises the creation of an "industrial court," which would deliberate the recommendations of the interstate commission and would finally set the obligatory prices, harming neither the producers nor the purchasers. In this vein, more or less, Mr. Carnegie, who now, naturally, no longer cares what the nation and the Government do about the trusts because he has already <span class="page-break">3</span>gotten enough money out of the nation and can now play at being a moralist and well-wishing adviser, gives his advice. But why did not this creator and father of the steel trust proffer such advice and recommendations before? Why was he so late about this, when already others have taken up this matter who will know what to do about the trusts and how to correct the conditions, which at present are unbearable, without his help?</p>
   <p>In the same general vein as Carnegie, another director of the steel trust, Elbert H. Gary, president of the most powerful corporation in the world, offers his advice. Before the Interstate Commerce Commission, he said that in his opinion the Government should definitely take control of all the commerce and industry in the country, and should itself, through appropriate commissions, regulate the prices of all products. Pretending to be a great friend of the masses, so impudently exploited by all kinds of trusts, he expresses his indignation against the exploiters and recommends that they be gotten after by the law, which would put an end to these robberies, which Mr. Gary has at last deigned to notice.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>But, like Carnegie, Gary does not advise the Government to dissolve the large corporations, declaring that this would be a severe blow to the nations commerce and industry, and that as a result many firms, honestly conducting their businesses, would have to go bankrupt. In his opinion, Government control of corporations will be sufficient to put an end to extortion and abuses.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the advice of these gentlemen comes too late and does not in every respect agree with the truth. After all there is in existence today the severe Sherman Antitrust Act, but it has not been put into practice. Courts also exist which are supposed to be the guardians of this law and of justice, but the trusts go on doing mischief unpunished, robbing the masses, and American justice chooses not to see this knavery.</p>
   <p>Therefore, there can be no certainty, even under the cloak of Government control and guidance, that the robberies will not continue, until the head of the trust hydra is completely hacked off. After all, this Government is composed in a large proportion of these creators and directors of trusts and their backers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Therefore, existing lawless corporations should be dissolved, and all public utilities should be Government-owned, just as the Post Office is Government-owned, and then the workers will not be discriminated against, the cost of living will not be exorbitant, and farmers will not be exploited. There will then be no half-rotten products lying about in refrigerators for several years at a time, no artificially produced stagnations in business and industry, no closing of banks or other things which bring billions of dollars to certain individuals and poverty to other millions of individuals.</p>
   <p>Gentlemen, then, such as Messrs. Carnegie, Gary, and their ilk can keep their belated advice to themselves, because the awakening nation will know, all by itself, what to do with the trusts and how to remedy today's unbearable conditions.</p>
