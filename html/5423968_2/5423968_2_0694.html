   <p>One hears more often about our adolescents causing disturbances and fights on the streets. All local Polish newspapers are urging the parents to give more attention to their children, but the evil seems to be growing daily.</p>
   <p>Such negligence of the parents in the supervision of their children is not found even among the savages. It is a shame and disgrace to our name. After closing of the corner "dens of vice" everybody expected the young people would stay home more, but instead one sees the groups of young rowdies insulting and assaulting the passers-by on the street.</p>
   <p>We received also complaints about places of vice and gambling run by private individuals where scantily dressed young girls entertain the boys. Gambling and drinking go on till late in the night. The adolescents should be home at the lastest at 8 P. M., either reading or doing something useful.</p>

   <p>What is such a mother worth who does not know where her twelve year old daughter is at night?</p>
   <p>We advise the more frequent use of the rod on the disobedient children. It is much better to make the children cry than for the parents to weep on account of their children.</p>
