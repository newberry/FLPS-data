   <p>Reverend John Piechowski, pastor of St. Hedwig Parish, has opened a kindergarten school. Many parents are delighted with the idea. Over one hundred children were registered the first day. The object of this school is to protect these innocent children from evil associates and the bad example of the children of certain Independent parents.</p>
