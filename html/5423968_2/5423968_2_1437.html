   <p>The Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, in its article treating the results of the 1910 elections and the decisive victory of the Democratic party, expressed its hope that one of the first effects of this would be a lowering of the prices on food. The newspaper did not base this hope upon an overwhelming conviction that the result of the election was due to some exceptional civic virtue of the Democratic party. It must be remembered that Republicans are not as black as some would think them to be and Democrats, on the other hand, are not as white as some would surmise after having the doubtful honor of listening to the speeches of the victorious candidates and their agents during the political campaign.</p>
   <p>If prices really did start to drop after the elections, the credit for this is due not to the victorious Democrats or to the defeated Republicans <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but solely to the people themselves.</p>
   <p>The people have showed that they are dissatisfied, and, whenever people show their indignation, fear begins to creep into the hearts of the sinners, irrespective of the party with which they are affiliated.</p>
   <p>If the Democrats had been the governing party during the recent years and the people during the election had shown them as decisive a reversal of feeling as they now have (shown) the Republicans, the result whould undoubtedly have been the same. It is a psychological law that when one transgressor is being chastised, the other, whom the chastisement has not as yet reached, immediately and instinctively commences to feel the less protected parts of his anatomy and makes serious efforts to cover them. It is in this that the corrective power of every punishment lies. A punishment directed at one automatically awakens thousands to a desire and an intention to correct their errors. True, that is not a sincere desire or a sincere correction, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>but the people are interested not in making a saint out of a confirmed sinner but in bettering their own condition. They (people) are concerned about results, not mere beginnings. Such, undoubtedly, was the case with the high cost of food.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy has written on frequent occasions that the principal cause of the high cost of living is the trusts' overestimation of the limits of human patience. Prices have been raised and people have cried, but they have paid. Let them pay as long as they can afford merely to cry and complain to newspapers. Let the millions of tons of meat, butter, and other food stuff remain in storage or be exported abroad, and let the shearing of the lambs of this locality continue as long as possible. Their only concern is to increase the dividends of their shareholders.</p>
   <p>But now the lambs have roared and have shown horns. This was indicated clearly during the November election of 1910. "Why, that is something else", states the huge mass of capital, which never had the word "courage" in the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>catalogue of its virtues, but instead always used the terms "caution" and "insight".</p>
   <p>"As long as you are sore, and seriously at that," says capital to the people, "as long as you have shown that you know how to be sore, we can also show that we know how to sell everything at lower prices and still show a profit on it."</p>
   <p>To this the people reply, "There is no reason to argue; let everything become lower in price and let there be peace."</p>
   <p>And, hence, everything is lowered in price. In order to save its face, capital advertises itself in newspapers and states that people were not responsible for the drop in prices because they cleaned out politicians, but that all credit for this is ascribable to the merciful God, Who, this particular fall, sent an unusually copious crop of corn. It is a known <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>fact that when there exists an abundance of corn, the farmer is able to feed his cattle and fowl more often and, hence, he sells his hogs and cattle at a low rate to the various trust barons.</p>
   <p>All this sounds very beautiful. But it seems to us that, even if there was such an abundance of corn, people would continue to pay exorbitant prices for meat, had they not shown that they know how to be indignant.</p>
   <p>The ability to be, and the art of being, sore is a very necessary thing. But that is art and knowledge and not mere imagination. It is necessary to know how, when, and at whom to be sore.</p>
   <p>The only person who can never be indignant is he who already is lord and master of everything; such a lord and master is heard and obeyed whenever he petitions. But he who does not possess such power over people--and today no one possesses it--must know how to bare his teeth, from time to <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>time, in defense of his good cause.</p>
   <p>It is possible, and advisable, to argue, instruct, convince, petition, and appeal to the goodness and sincerity of an opponent, if one is dealing with a good, noble, wise, and sincere person, who merely does not know how to stand on the right side. It is improper to be sore at such an individual, but, on the contrary, this knowledge should be imparted to him, and then everything will be all right. But if, on the other hand, one has to deal with a Sly and unscrupulous scoundrel, who knows where truth lies and tends purposely toward harm because it suits him best, then the best applicable method is to down him immediately so that he will lose all desire to do evil. In order to down one effectively, it is necessary to have strength. Then, too, it is necessary to have brains to knock down the individual who actually needs such treatment and to prevent an error from occurring as to the identity of the guilty person.</p>
   <p>From this we might evolve a great lesson applicable to all--to the individuals as well as the entire human society, that it is necessary first to become <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>strong and wise and then to be indignant at those who deserve to be treated thus.</p>
   <p>The American people have proved, at the election of 1910, that they possess this strength and brain power. Their strength was manifested in their unanimity and their brain power reported its presence in their proper selection of victims.</p>
   <p>At this time a political faction has fallen which, because of its many years of success, was of the erroneous opinion that it could govern and rule forever and ignore everyone. This downfall, a punishment to the defeated, was at the same time a lesson for the victor and a warning for the future that neither party in untouchable. We have the result before our eyes. The doors of stores in which the trusts had imprisoned food in order to raise prices every two weeks were thrown wide open. Meat suddenly found its way out of cold storage and to the market, regardless of whether the majority of the share-holders of some trust were Republicans or Democrats.</p>

   <p>The tactics of American people could well be applied by the Poles--especially by members of the Polish National Alliance. They could be applied to every type of post who attacks the organization and attempts to harm and obstruct its development. It is advisable to show less courtesy to such gentlemen. Tell them the truth to their faces, evict them, do not waste time on arguments with those who know beforehand that they do wrong, and there will be less impertinence from various dissenters from the cause of national unity. Instead of patiently listening to such gentlemen, who constantly find fault and criticize the Polish National Alliance, the best thing to do is to tell them briefly but definitely, "Get out!"</p>
