   <p>Mr. John F. Smulski, noted Chicago banker and president of the Polish National Department of America, issued the following statement tonight from the Polish Bureau, at Washington, relative to the Jewish demonstration:</p>
   <p>"As an American citizen in my individual capacity and officially as president of the Polish National Department of America, an organization representing 4,000,000 citizens of Polish origin, in the United States, I cannot allow to pass unchallenged, the Jewish demonstrations against the new Republic of Poland, as made in many American cities and in New York today.</p>
   <p>"Appreciative at all times of our obligations as American citizens and of the fact that this is America and not Europe, we have during the four years of the war and in the face of many attacks of the Jewish people, refrained from uttering any statement which in any way may even lead to an estrangement between the Polish and Jewish peoples in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"We have felt our common bond of citizenship with the Jewish people in America made the creation of racial antagonism an act of disloyalty to the United States. In the face of many temptations, as president of the Polish National Department, with the loyal support of the Polish people, we have stood abuse and misrepresentation and attacks on the Polish aspirations for the creation of a united and independent Poland.</p>
   <p>"Time and time again during the past two years and particularly since the sitting of the peace congress, Jewish leaders of importance, in the United States, men occupying official positions have cabled attacks upon the Polish people and their national desires. Yet in the very face of these attacks within the week we furnished to the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, 1,000 tons of space on the relief ship, Westward-Ho, which the Polish National Department has cleared from New York to Danzig, and although this cargo, or the greatest bulk of it, was contributed by the non-Jewish people in the United States, it was consigned to Mr. Hoover with direct instructions that it should be distributed to the destitute.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Jews and Gentiles alike, without any distinction. Even when, in the official Jewish organ and in the daily newspapers, we found that this relief ship, secured by me from the authorities at Washington was heralded as a purely Jewish undertaking, we remained quiet, feeling it was a matter of poor taste to quibble over an act of charity.</p>
   <p>"The sacrifice which we have made in refraining from arguments in the face of this constant persecution, our remembrances of our American obligations, threatened to become unavailing however by reason of the infamous advertisements printed in the New York newspapers yesterday, and by the demonstration held in New York. For years the Polish and Jewish people in this country have lived side by side in amity. The gentlemen of distinction who issued the advertisement under consideration must realize that companionship, real common healthfulness, is made impossible by such tactics. As an American citizen, I brand that advertisement as one dangerous to the welfare of the American nation, as one which will inevitably create antagonism where there is none existing.</p>
   <p>"The Polish people in the United States, have given 200,000 of their sons to the <span class="page-break">\4</span>American army, they have contributed ten percent of the casualties and from the men not eligible for American services, they contributed 25,000 men for the Polish army in France.</p>
   <p>"In the last Liberty Loan campaign in the New York district the Poles by themselves took 100,000,000 of the Liberty notes. They are Americans in their aspirations and to the American people they appeal against this slanderous campaign."</p>
