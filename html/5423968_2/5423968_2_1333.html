   <p>This association, which misrepresents itself as Christian, has caused a misfortune in Des Moines, Iowa. Mr. Wm. Protzmann, one of the followers of the sect, was stricken with typhoidal pneumonia on Dec. 17. Despite his critical condition, he was not allowed to have a doctor or use any medicine. When his relatives protested, the patient was taken away "for the purpose of removing him from the influence of the blind and unfaithful." It took the poor fellow sixty-one days to yield; evidently, he had a very strong constitution. Finally, he yielded, when he died.</p>
   <p>A coroner's jury gave a verdict of "death as a result of Christian Science." The case will go before the jury, but it will be very hard to bring a regular charge because the deceased was a member of the sect.</p>
