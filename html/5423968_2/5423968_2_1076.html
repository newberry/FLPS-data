   <p>From South Chicago comes the news that the management of the steel trust has in mind the idea of dismissing from the plants of the Illinois Steel Company all Slavs, particularly Poles, and fill these places with Negroes. Superintendent W. A. Bably confirmed this report, explaining that the directors of the factory are not motivated in this instance by race hatred, but by the fact that the Poles have not sufficiently mastered the English language, and do not understand the orders given out by the foremen and are in danger of fatal accidents, exposing the company to losses. An experiment has most likely been made with Negro help and it has resulted to the disadvantage of the Poles. We hope that somebody will do something in behalf of our countrymen in South Chicago and prevent Mr. Balby from carrying out his threat.</p>
