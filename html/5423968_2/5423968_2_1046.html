   <p>The convention of Polish Buyers and Industrialists, which took place in Chicago, brought to light the good points as well as the gaps that are to be filled by Polish dealers. This is not only true in Chicago's metropolitan area, but also throughout the entire country. The handful of Polish representatives that attended the convention were refreshed with the best of suggestions. However, they do not have the understanding nor are they familiar with the requirements of their business. They lack the enterprising spirit of other big business groups and will never be able to build or organize any lasting institution. Although Polish trade and industry are spreading at the cost of great efforts, they are still in their infancy when compared with progress made by other nationalities. Our development has not branched out on a great scale, since several hundred taverns, and a few score of meat markets and grocery stores cannot be very well called big business; yet, a thorough understanding is required in order to make these minor establishments function on a profit basis so as to meet the competition of the better developed trade of the English, German, Swedish and Jew.</p>
   <p>John F. Smulski brought out, at the Polish Buyers' meeting, important facts relating to the management of business. He has a broad knowledge and an understanding <span class="page-break">2</span>of the business world, being at the head of a banking institution in Chicago, a position which requires experience, acumen, and energetic activity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smulski pointed out that an organized group of Polish buyers would need their own agents to obtain goods wholesale. The Italians have set a good example. They monopolize the fruit market and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> from this field. Commodities purchased without the medium of a middleman could be obtained direct from the wholesalers at great savings. These in turn could be distributed to the merchants, thereby saving them thousand of dollars and helping them develop a larger clientele. It is useless to complain about our Polish people buying goods from other <span class="gap">[gap]</span> since they are ontitled to the most for their money. We cannot meet their demands because we must pay higher prices for the same goods.</p>
   <p>A merchant purchasing commodities in small lots, pays more. The bulk of the profit goes to the agent. If a merchant is to sell at a profit, he must charge more for his goods, whereas if he had his own wholesale agent the difference could be pocketed by them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Is it any wonder that our merchants are working at a loss when they are not organized or willing to cooperate with one another? If all the Polish merchants belonged to the Polish Business and Industrial Association, instead of being grouped in small numbers, then it would be possible for them to meet competition, establish a reputation, and gain a substantial control of American business.</p>
   <p>If but only twenty members in one of the branches would organize and make direct wholesale purchases, they would be able to earn thousands of dollars in profits yearly. Not only that, but they would be able to face the keenest competition This is the system followed by other business men. It is in that manner that they control vast interests and reap large profits, while our business, in turn, becomes weaker, never to be able to get out of the rut, unless the merchants reorganize and systematize their business methods. One merchant cannot utilize to his advantage wholesale carloads of goods as ten or twenty could.</p>
   <p>Take for example the Italians, or the Jews. The former purchases carloads of fruit from California or shiploads from Italy. They are so well organized that they handle these products at a minimun cost and a maximum profit. The Jews in the textile industry follow the same procedure, thereby having half the cost and making <span class="page-break">4</span>double the profit. This shows the advantage of buying direct. Middleman profits are eliminated. In order to be successful this policy must be strictly adhered to and followed by all merchants. This requires organization and cooperation.</p>
   <p>If all the Polish business men in Chicago belonged one hundred percent to the Buyers' Association, an organization started by a small group of ambitious men who carry out the interests of all concerned to the letter, without hesitation and in a short time, a foothold would be gained in the commercial field. From the beginning a few large department stores would open for business. After having gained a name, several larger ones would follow in their footsteps. They would be able to profit where now the Jewish concerns are making all the gains.</p>
   <p>Both sides of the situation must be studied, just as any other question in business or elsewhere. The individual who completes a business course at college and spends a few years in practice is in a better position to help himself than the one who has picked up the rudiments of business by the road of hard knocks. Although one may have enough capital, one can easily lose everything if a knowledge of and a training for business is lacking. The person with the background and foresight gained by both theory and practice, can easily forge ahead with only a small sum. The latter is a typical example of John Smulski. If all parents could give their <span class="page-break">5</span>children the same training, the same education, them the position of the Polish businessman would be on a sounder and firmer foundation.</p>
   <p>Just as the doctor, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and the other professional men, the businessman must gather his knowledge and experience by a definite plan of study. If he desires to be a success, and not a failure, he must follow the procedure of the professional man. "He who knows not how to count, knows not what to pay for his goods, and knows not how much profit he will get, will sell at a loss or go out of business because of the exorbitant prices he is liable to charge for his wares."</p>
   <p>Cooperation and strong organization is, therefore, of vital importance. It would be a happy moment for the Polish people and the Polish businessman to see the day when all are organized under one banner. There is no <span class="gap">[gap]</span> why this cannot be possible, no reason why Polish merchants cannot improve their standing in the business world.</p>
