   <p>Thanks to the efforts of Reverend E. Sedlaczek, the St. Hedwig Parish school will be opened Monday, April 29, in the church building, for all children of the parishioners.</p>
   <p>Bishop Feehan issued a letter of permission to this effect which reads as follows: [quoted verbatim]</p>
   <p>"The Rev. Father Sedlaczek, C. R., is hereby authorized to open St. Hedwig's School next Monday, April 29, under the direction of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. </p>
   <p>"P. A. Feehan, Archbishop of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Chicago, April 26, 1895"</p>
   <p>Hope is expressed that all members of St. Hedwig Parish will welcome this news <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the opening of the school, and will see to it that the school program continues without interruption. The children of this parish have long been without lessons and exposed to the influences of the street.</p>
