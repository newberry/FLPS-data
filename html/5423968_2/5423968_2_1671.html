   <p>Reports and complaints are made daily to the New City and Stockyards Police Station, both in the neighborhood of the packing house industry, that windows in the homes of the strikebreakers are continually being broken. Whoever sees any person guilty of the act should report it to the police. The police department blames the work on the strikers.</p>
   <p>The fifth week of the Stockyards' strike has passed and the situation still remains the same. Organized workers are adhering to their original plans; signs of returning to work are remote. At the meetings union officials present a picture of the strike situation in the best light to the workers. They are confident of victory because the employers have had more than enough of the work of Negros and other strikebreakers.</p>

   <p>Rioting has subsided because the workers have learned a lesson from the first few days of the strike and now keep at a safe distance from the packing houses.</p>
