   <p>The German propaganda is gaining ground in America.</p>
   <p>Senator Borah, president of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, declared himself for the revision of the Versailles Treaty and particularly for the revision of the Polish-German border. In Senator Borah's opinion both the "Polish corridor" and Pomerania should belong to Germany.</p>
   <p>This is certainly a very eager wish. Germany would like to have also Silesia and Posen; and even all Poland if they only could. But they cannot, because the borders of Poland are guarded by our brave Marshal Pilsudski and his three million army, ready to defend.</p>
   <p>The German money which is being spent on that kind of propaganda is nothing but waste.</p>
   <p>Mr. Borah, after a conversation with the French premier, Laval, has learned that his pro-German projects are but fantastic dreams.</p>

   <p>In connection with Senator Borah's assertion, the Polish public opinion, believing that a similar attitude had been adopted by President Hoover and his cabinet, became very much alarmed and sent notes and letters of protest to the White House.</p>
   <p>But the President did not even think of proposing the revision of the Versailles Treaty. In answering the telegrams of the Polish National Alliance in America and the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America, the President said as follows:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen, you may definitely announce that the assertion you mention in your telegrams is not true. The President neither wishes nor can intervene in that kind of European affairs and did not express any opinion in that matter." Signed: Theodore G. Joslin, Secretary to the President.</p>
   <p>This is an example of how much our Polish politicians know of the tendencies that prevail in Washington. It would not harm them if they knew a little bit more.</p>
