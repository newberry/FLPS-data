   <p>The effrontery of our Chicago Independents is unendurable and exceeds the limits of human patience.</p>
   <p>Just the other day we published a news item about a brutal attack on a typesetter, Mr. L. Francikowski, and his brother. Today we are forced to report another unprincipled action by one of them.</p>
   <p>It is well known that the head of the Independents, the excommunicated priest Koz, was arrested for disorderly conduct a few days ago on the complaint of a certain lady, and that his case is to be heard tomorrow by Judge [J.] LaBuy. Besides this, another much more serious storm is brewing over his head....</p>
   <p>In order to divert attention from Koz, and with the evident desire to besmirch the good name of Reverend John Piechowski, pastor of Saint Hedwig Parish, an exemplary and generally respected priest--some of the Independent leaders resorted to an evil scheme to embarrass Reverend Piechowski by having him arrested.</p>
   <p>One of these leaders, a certain Joseph Kowarzyk, filed a complaint before Justice of the Peace Kildred against Reverend Piechowski, as publisher of the newspaper Przyjaciel Ludu (Friend of the People), accusing him of libel.</p>
   <p>A warrant for the arrest of the priest was obtained by the complainant on the strength of a false translation of an article in Przyjaciel Ludu.</p>
   <p>In his complaint, Kowarzyk claims that he has been libeled in the newspaper published by this priest by being called a thief and a robber.</p>
   <p>In fact, this is a deliberate lie. The name Kowarzyk is not mentioned in the article. Furthermore the words "robber" and "thief" do not appear anywhere in the article, and only in one particular paragraph mentioned by the complainant, is there a reference to a certain driver hoodlum (not Kowarzyk)--a reference which has nothing to do with the case.</p>
   
   <p>In other words, the complaint is false, based on a false translation.</p>
   <p>In order to prove this more thoroughly, we shall reprint the entire supposedly incriminating article tomorrow.</p>
   <p>We wish to note in advance that a complaint of this type cannot be successful, and will most likely turn to the disadvantage of the complainant himself.</p>
   <p>The purpose was to arrest Reverend Piechowski at night and have him appear before a judge to file a bond. And this purpose was partially accomplished.</p>
   <p>But, we advise the Independent gentlemen not to think they have won a victory.</p>
   <p>The law is patient, but it cannot be misconstrued and misrepresented all the time. Anyone who knowingly swears falsely to an affidavit soon finds out that he will have to suffer for it.</p>
   
   <p>This case will be hears next Wednesday, when everything will be thoroughly explained.</p>
   <p>Naturally, Reverend Piechowski is a free man.</p>
   <p>We wish to add that the attack on this respectable priest was engineered by the well-known shyster, Rawicz, who has become well acquainted with the criminal courts. He, at least, should realize that there is a law in America, that severely punishes conspiracy.</p>
