   <p>Sad indeed for the Poles and Lithuanians in Chicago was the bankruptcy of the two Jewish banking houses of Kopperl, one on Canal Street, the other on Washington Street. These bankruptcies we mentioned briefly before. They are heart-rending. Many of our brethren (especially on the Northwest Side) will lose the money deposited in the Kopperl banks; some will lose money deposited for the purchase of steamship tickets, or to be sent to the old country. These losses are quite large. We were told of two Poles who will lose several hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>We hope this sad lesson will benefit them and convince them, finally, that they do wrong when they fill the pockets of strange, unknown persons, who <span class="page-break">\2</span>give no guarantee of safety, and, by so doing, ignore their own countrymen, respected and tested.</p>
   <p>Our Poles seem to have a special weakness for Jews. Is there a shortage, among us Poles, of agents, businessmen, doctors, druggists, lawyers, etc.? No, not at all! We have many experienced persons among us, persons who have been recognized by others, and who have worked among us for many years, sincerely and honestly.....Do we give them the right support? Not in the least!</p>
   <p>But let a Jew get busy among us....we rush to him as to a fire! We buy steamship tickets from him, we go to him when we are sick, we trust him with our money, and he then cheats us, profiteers and robs.</p>
   <p>As living proof of this, witness the Kopperls and others like them!</p>

   <p>How often has the Polish press warned our countrymen. "Haven't you your own Polish businessmen? Haven't you your own building and loan associations, and how about the bank on Milwaukee Avenue, where four Poles are directors? Why seek strange and, at that, Jewish gods?"</p>
   <p>And still the Poles do as they please. And you see what happens--tears and gnashing of teeth!</p>
   <p>This is a very important matter.</p>
   <p>A Pole should, first of all, support a Pole. Let this be firmly understood. He will thus benefit himself and his fellow countrymen. He should not chase after strangers, if he can benefit his own. If we do not support one another, who will support us? A Jew surely will not, nor will anybody else.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Once more we repeat: "Learn your lesson from the Kopperl affair."</p>
   <p>Let us chase away this Jewish "love" for us once and for all. Stay united and help each other, and we will be better off than we are today. Otherwise, it will be just too bad--and that's that!</p>
