   <p>"By their fruits ye shall know them."</p>
   <p>These words can readily be applied to the efforts of the Sisters of Nazareth, for the demonstration on the Holy Family Academy stage by their charges last night was evidence enough.</p>
   <p>The children from the kindergarten as well as those of the higher grades took part in this program. All the performances were excellent. This was a good example of the ability of the nuns to train the children and should encourage all Polish mothers to send their children to this school.</p>
   <p>The small children's chorus and older girls and boys also rendered a number of Polish and English songs. Declamations, recitations, and drills followed. Piano numbers for two and four hands were played by the musically inclined <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>pupils. A short sketch, "The Dream of John Kochawowski," convinced the audience of the Polish spirit of the youth.</p>
   <p>There was no indication that either our native tongue or English had been neglected by the pupils. The proper enunciation and pronunciation were given to every word, whether Polish or English. All classes are conducted in such fashion as to teach the school children how to speak and think in Polish as well as in English.</p>
   <p>Last night's performance truly demonstrated the type of fruit that can be cultivated by earnest work.</p>
