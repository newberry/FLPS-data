   <p>The work of planning the distribution of vacant lots to the people so that they may raise vegetables is moving forward.</p>
   <p>Our readers are acquainted with the general idea of these gardens through previous articles, since we have frequently informed them that within the city limits there is quite a number of vacant lots which, if properly cultivated, can be made to produce enough vegetables to supply the needs of many families.</p>
   <p>Vacant lots in all districts of the city have been up to now completely ignored, since it never before occurred to anyone that they could be turned over to a useful purpose. Only this year--when the people are groaning under the yoke of exorbitant prices caused by food speculators, when the black ghost of poverty is casting its bloodshot eye toward the <span class="page-break">2</span>dark cottages, and when the laborer, driven to despair, is beginning to complain about the high cost of living--did the question of giving the people the vacant lots lying fallow from times immemorial enter the heads of the city administration.</p>
   <p>Everyone has answered this proposal in the affirmative, everyone has admitted that this is an excellent idea.</p>
   <p>Work has already begun. After several discussions, the City Council has appointed a Garden Commission consisting of some of the most influential men in the city. This commission has been entrusted with the task of listing all the vacant lots and distributing them among the people for garden plots. Mayer Thompson, Dr. J. D. Robertson, as well as all members of the City Council and many citizens well known throughout Chicago, have been asked to co-operate. Mr. P. H. Hulden, a well-known agriculturist, has been elected president of the Garden Commission.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Mr. Hulden announces to those interested that, as soon as spring begins, many lots will be ready for distribution among the people for garden plots. Germans, Italians, Irishmen, Jews, and others are filing their applications already. Where are the Poles? So far as we know, no Pole has as yet filed his application. Will the Poles always lag behind others? If Germans, Irishmen, and Jews take advantage of this opportunity, why do not our country men follow their example? After all, the Garden Commission announces that needy workers will have the preference when the plots are given out. Inasmuch as there is a high percentage of needy workers among the Poles, it would not be amiss for them to file their applications for these lots as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>We advise our countrymen to take advantage of this opportunity. Let everyone look about him to see if there are vacant lots in his neighborhood. If there are, he should apply for one of them at the Garden Bureau, Room 507, City Hall. Mr. Hulden, or one of his assistants, will tell the applicant how to obtain the plot and how to cultivate it. If the applicant cannot <span class="page-break">4</span>obtain the lot he wishes, Mr. Hulden will try to secure another one for him. The telephone number of the Garden Bureau is Main 447.</p>
   <p>We believe that many of our compatriots will follow our advice and apply for a garden plot. If our countrymen do this, if they do not neglect this opportunity but get to work at once, they will free themselves in part from the yoke of high prices which oppresses them.</p>
   <p>Apply for your vegetable plots. There is still time today. Tomorrow it may be too late.</p>
