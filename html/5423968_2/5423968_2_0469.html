   <p>The aim of this periodical is to spread propaganda against alcoholic beverages and drunkards. Our idea is to spread the war against alcohol, in hope of the best results.</p>
   <p>We will write scientific and popular articles, discuss the alcoholic habits and ruinous results to individual persons, family and society. Also there will be articles and advice on how to fight against alcohol, and we will picture everyday life novels and give examples illustrating our lamented fate and problems of alcoholic and ethical nature.</p>
   <p>Also we will write news of the progress against alcoholism in this country as well as in Europe.</p>
   
   <p>Please send to us news about the matter of abstinence. We declare open war on alcohol. We feel deeply that it is our sacred duty from which we cannot step aside. We believe in this and that our work will bring good results.</p>
   <p>We ask the Polish clergymen for their moral and material support. Next we ask our intelligent classes to cooperate with us, and we ask the same of the Polish people and hard working laborers, men and women; for them we especially work and sacrifice this periodical to save them and show them the open way to success, knowledge and morality.</p>
   <p>Now we are calling the attention of young men and women. We are especially interested in this class of the young generation, because they are not as yet victims of alcohol and are much better material to understand our idea than the old people.</p>
   <p>We wish everybody, any groups, trade or commercial, to join us and the whole society to fight against alcohol. We ask the cooperation of the Polish press.</p>
