   <p>We received the following report about the review presented by the students of St. Stanislaus Kostka College the day before yesterday:</p>
   <p>"On Reverend Vincent Barzynski's birthday, St. Stanislaus College held a review which surpassed all our expectations. The program consisted of twenty four numbers.</p>
   <p>"A group of priests from outside of Chicago, as well as a number of laymen, listened with great interest to the exercises of the boys. There were speeches in Polish, English, and Latin; recitations and violin solos, varied by beautiful singing, testified to the dean's energy and the diligence of the students.</p>
   <p>"Among others, student A. Kalinowski distinguished himself by [delivering a] <span class="page-break">2</span>speech in Latin and [by his] beautiful drawings. Jaworski's recitation about the battlefield of Raclawice brought tears to his listeners, and M. Czajkowski thrilled [the audience] with his violin music.</p>
   <p>"It would be almost impossible to ignore A. Kwiatkowski's drawings, which deserve special attention. If Kwiatkowski would only pay more attention to this subject, he could win great success.</p>
   <p>"Every number of the program was executed with great precision, and for this reason all performers were greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>"The results obtained by our youth, and which we witnessed the other day, bring credit to the whole American Polonia.</p>
   <p>"The children of well-to-do parents should benefit by this college, for it is just as good as any American institution. Polonia is growing, and so does the number of the students every month. We wish this institution success.</p>
