   <p>Mr. T. Pawlowski has submitted the following letter for publication:</p>
   <p>"A new Polish Carpenters' and Cabinetmakers' Union has been organized recently in St. Adalbert's parish. The first meeting took place at Budzbanowski's Hall, corner of Paulina and 17th Streets. The next meeting will take place at the same hall on Monday, April 24, at 7:30 in the evening. We ask all of the Polish carpenters in Chicago to attend, so that we can work together for our common good. At present, the initiation fee is only two dollars per person; in two weeks, it will be raised to fifteen dollars.</p>
   <p>"There is still time for our brother carpenters to become members of this Polish union and reap the benefits of solidarity."</p>
