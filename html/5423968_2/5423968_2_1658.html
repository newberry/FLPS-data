   <p>Because conditions in the stockyards do not warrant the emergency police patrol, Chief of Police Fitzmorris has ordered 250 officers taken off the beat in this area. Although no signs of settlement are within sight, the strikers are adhering to their original plans with the same determination.</p>
   <p>The strikers, after a mass meeting at Slowacki's Hall, staged an orderly demonstration. They marched about the local streets without the aid of music. Quiet and orderliness prevailed because the police did not interfere.</p>
   <p>The Painters Union,local #435, has given a hundred dollars from their reserve fund to help the stockyards' strikers. The Society of King Casimir, the Great, No. 955, donated ten dollars. W. Ziarkowski made a collection of fifteen dollars. We need more of such contributors!</p>
