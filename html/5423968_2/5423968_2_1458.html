The workers marched upon the office in so great a number, that the doors had to be barred to avoid trouble. After the police quieted the workers, an office employee said, "there is enough work for all those willing to work at the new scale."</p>
   <p>The workers were paying to some agents as much as 1 to 3 dollars who promised the workers, that they would receive better jobs and more pay; they claimed they were company agents. The police had all they could do to restore peace and order after this new outbreak.</p>
