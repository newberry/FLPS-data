   <p>A course in home economics and one in the English language will be conducted for Polish mothers by Miss Helen Baranowski. The first class will be held on Tuesday, July 24, at 1:30 in the afternoon at the Wells Public School, 936 North Ashland Avenue. Italians, Lithuanians, and women of other nationalities are already benefiting by such courses established by the Board of Education. Should Polish women be backward and not benefit by this excellent plan, thus broadening their knowledge in these fields? They can do this entirely without cost to themselves at the public school buildings, with the benefit of all the equipment supplied for this purpose by the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>"What sort of course is this?" many will ask. Our answer is: Any Polish mother who takes advantage of the course will learn many things about household economy; she will learn to prepare nourishing, inexpensive meals; she will learn how to substitute for meat, which today is high in price, food equal in nourishment; or, if she wishes, she can learn the English language. The choice of what to study is voluntary. She may choose one thing or another.</p>
   <p>Miss Helen Baranowski was appointed director of these courses for Polish mothers. The Board of Education has instructed her to prepare the Polish courses.</p>
   <p>Miss Baranowski expects to organize several such schools [in various neighborhoods]. Each class must consist at least of twenty to twenty-four women. In order to make it easier for the women to take advantage of this opportunity, a kindergarten teacher will be assigned to each school, who will take care of the children whom mothers may bring to school with them; that is, mothers will be permitted to come to school with their children.</p>
   <p>The first gathering of Polish mothers who desire more education was held last Tuesday at the Polish Women's Alliance Building, where a number of women registered for the school. The first class, however, will be held next Tuesday, July 24, at the Wells Public School, Ashland Avenue near Walton Street. Women who desire to register for the above-mentioned courses may come directly to Wells School next Tuesday at 1:30 P.M. Polish mothers should take advantage of this in the greatest possible numbers.</p>
