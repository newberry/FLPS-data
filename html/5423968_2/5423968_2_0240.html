   <p>The whole future of the Polish nation in America depends upon the new generation, upon those children who are now attending the parochial schools. These children will be whatever the parents, teachers, and priests make them. Whether today's children will one day be good Catholics and Poles, or whether they will be lost to the faith and Poland, will be answered for before God, not by the children themselves, but by the parents, teachers, and priests.</p>
   <p>Not business, not money, but his children ought to be the primary concern of every good Polish Catholic. Every parent will answer for his child before God and his own conscience, before his motherland and society. Our main business is our children. They are our gold mine, the future of the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>A parent who accumulates money but neglects his child will find that the latter will squander his hard-earned money or spend it in evil ways. On the other <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hand, a poor man who brings up his child in a godly manner will find that although the latter lives on bread and water he is a credit to his parents and his country, for truth and honesty always rise to the top. We need not linger on this subject, however, for every parent and educator knows the importance of an upright education. What the parents do is their own affair; they alone will answer for it.</p>
   <p>The directors of the schools, that is, the priests and teachers, understand their task and would like to take a step forward in the matter of education. Toward this end, the Association of [Polish] Teachers and Organists was formed during the last convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. Further aims and advantages to the members of this organization will be enumerated in its constitution, which will be published next month in Wiara i Ojczyzna, the Union's official organ.</p>
   <p>The Association [of Polish Teachers and Organists], which was organized on the third day of the convention, August 24, 1893, is headed by Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek, president; Boleslaus Straszynski, a Milwaukee teacher, vice-president; Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, secretary; and A. Kwasigroch, treasurer. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>preparation of the constitution was entrusted to a committee of three--Father Siedlaczek, S. Zahajkiewicz, and I. Kowalski. It was also decided that the members would pay no dues during the first year.</p>
   <p>Those members who are in the position to do so will arrange for theatrical performances and recitals for the benefit of the Association's treasury.</p>
   <p>Thus, no one need delay joining the Association because of hard times or because of the initiation fee. In order to become a member and enjoy the benefits of the Association, all a teacher or organist has to do is to submit his name and address to the secretary.</p>
   <p>Theatrical performances for the Association's benefit have already been promised by the parochial school teachers of Chicago, by B. Straszynski, of Milwaukee, by Mr. Riech, of Manistee [Michigan], and by Mr. Kaminski, of Grand Rapids [Michigan].</p>
   <p>The Association of [Polish] Teachers and Organists has a future before it; its purpose is an important one.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Almost a score of priests have already become supporting members of the Association, thus showing the teachers and organists how highly they value this organization, whose aim is the development of education. It is our hope that before a year is up, all natural guardians of the Polish parochial schools and children, that is, the priests, and all Polish teachers and organists will be members of the Association.</p>
   <p>We request all those who have not yet joined but who wish to become members of the Association of Polish Teachers and Organists, to apply to the secretary.</p>
   <p>Reverend E. Siedlaczek, president.</p>
   <p>B. Straszynski, secretary.</p>
