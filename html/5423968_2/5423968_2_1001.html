   <p>The 'monk's stupefier,' Dziennik Chicagoski, informs us that Mr. Piotrowski, an attorney for the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, lives in a magnificent palace which has colored windows that cost $4,500. There are beautiful mirrors and $2,500 tables, also Oriental rugs that cost $1,250 each, etc.</p>
   <p>Hm! We are not surprised at all that Mr. Piotrowski lives in a palace, that he buys luxurious furniture, rugs, etc. The more law-suits the Polish Roman Catholic Union has, the bigger the hole in the treasury of the "Pious Organization," and the more expensive shall be the furniture of Mr. Piotrowski.</p>
   <p>That is the natural outcome.</p>
