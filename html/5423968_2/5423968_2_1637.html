   <p>There has been no decided change in employment during the west few days in the Stockyards. Hundreds of workers have returned to ask for their jobs but only a comparative few were hired. Hundreds are still out of work because the strikebreakers occupy their places.</p>
   <p>In the Town of Lake and Bridgeport families are found penniless because of the strike. Many are still conking for aid to the union headquarters at 48th and Paulina Streets; however, the numbers have decreased somewhat. But still there are many in dire need.</p>
