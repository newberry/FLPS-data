   <p>Over four hundred and fifty Polish men and women working in tailor shops have already joined the Polish Union of Tailor-Shop Workers.</p>
   <p>The majority of the owners of Polish tailor shops have not as yet signed up with the union, and do not show much sympathy for the strikers.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian and the German workers have already joined the Union. We sincerely hope that the Poles will do likewise, and that complete peace and harmony will ensue between the tailor-shop owners and workers. It will benefit both sides. When the large shops are forced to raise prices, the workers and the owners are benefited by it.</p>
   <p>We wish to remind those interested, that a meeting of Polish unionists will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, March 24, in Hall No.1 of the school building on Bradley Street. Read the advertisement of the meeting on another page.</p>
