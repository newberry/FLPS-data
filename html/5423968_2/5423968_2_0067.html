   <p>Every Pole has undoubtedly heard of the Holy Trinity parish in Chicago. The early growth and development of this religious institution were hindered because of hostility and animosity. Nevertheless, the parish overcame all obstacles, and within a short time it found the means to erect a new church, one of the most magnificent edifices in Chicago, where there is no lack of large and splendid churches.</p>
   <p>This parish is composed almost exclusively of members of the Polish National Alliance. At present, there are twenty-there groups of the Alliance within the parish, and new ones are constantly being formed. Hence, the Holy Trinity parish, one of the largest in the United States, presents perfect proof that it is possible for people to be true Catholics, staunch parishioners, as well as good members of the Alliance. It is a veritable fortress of the Polish National <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Alliance in Chicago, and serves as an example to all other localities.</p>
   <p>The elementary school of the Holy Trinity parish, under the leadership of its greatly respected pastor, Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, has been considered one of the best Polish parochial schools, if not the most outstanding, in this country. The graduates of this school are accepted into the Chicago high schools without being compelled to pass entrance examinations. This was ascertained by several parents when, at the end of the vacation period, they took their boys directly from the parochial school to [public ]high school.</p>
   <p>Then, at the advice of its pastor, the parish decided to extend the scope of education offered its pupils by erecting its own high school. A building close to the church was purchased for that purpose. This building, which had housed the publishing business of W. Dyniewicz for a number of years, was transformed into a school; a [dedication] program was arranged, and the formal and festive opening of this new Polish edifice of knowledge took place yesterday, that is, Thursday, September 8, 1910.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Only one class is being held for the time being, and twenty-two students, all of whom are graduates of the Holy Trinity parochial school, have enrolled. Further details of the opening of the new school are presented in the columns dealing with local news. The curriculum and the method of instruction will be given some consideration here.</p>
   <p>The school will offer two courses: a classical and a commercial course. The first will require four years; the second, three years. The following subjects will be taught in the first year of the classical course:</p>
   <p>1. Religion. 2. Latin--etymology and the first principles of syntax, four hours each week. 3. English, four hours each week. 4. Polish grammar, with oral and written exercises, three times each week; Polish literature--the works of Mickiewicz, Slowacki, Odyniec, Sienkiewicz, Prus, Reymont, Orzeszkowa, Konopnicka, Zeromski, one hour each week; composition, one hour [each week]. Thus, five hours each week are devoted to the Polish language. 5. Ancient history--Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Media, Persia, Greece, and Rome, two hours <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>each week. 6. Mathematics--review of arithmetic, and the study of algebra to the stage of quadratic equations, four hours each week. 7. Natural science--physical geography, two hours in the first semester; physiology and zoology, two hours in the second semester. 8. Manual arts--wood craftsmanship. 9. Bookkeeping and accounting. 10. Penmanship.</p>
   <p>The curriculum, as we can readily see, is extensive and has been very carefully selected. A close, intelligent application to this curriculum will provide the student with a very profound knowledge in his very first year. The efforts extended in the acquisition of this knowledge will develop the mental powers of the pupils and will prepare them for future educational endeavors.</p>
   <p>The study of Greek, plane geometry, and botany will be added in the second year to the foregoing curriculum. The Middle Ages, up to and including the Crusades, will be studied in the history course.</p>
   <p>Course in solid geometry, trigonometry, modern history, physics, and French <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>or German (the choice to be made by the students), will be included in the third year.</p>
   <p>The fourth year will contain courses in chemistry and political economy, together with more advanced work in the previously mentioned subjects.</p>
   <p>The vocational courses, will include carpentry, to be taught in the second year; copper work, to be offered in the third year; and iron work, in the fourth year.</p>
   <p>The commercial courses does not differ from the general or classical course during the first two years. This is deserving of great praise, since those taking the commercial course will also acquire the general knowledge essential for the well-being of every citizen. The students will be taught stenography, commercial arithmetic, and bookkeeping, in addition to the subjects in the classical course, only in the third year of high school.</p>
   <p>In reviewing the curriculum in greater detail, we fail to find the history of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Poland offered as a separate subject. To be sure, every course in medieval and modern history includes the history of the Polish nation, but the fragmentary knowledge of the history of our motherland acquired in this way by our Polish youth is not sufficient. Moreover, the knowledge of Polish history acquired by the pupils of the elementary school is also inadequate. It is the opinion of Dziennik Zwiazkowy that a more detailed course in the history of Poland should be included in the curriculum as a separate subject for one hour each week during the entire four years, or for two hours each week during the third and fourth years. At any rate, no curriculum should be considered fixed and unalterable. Experience will always show where a deficiency or an excess of courses exists, and the school administration can improve the curriculum accordingly.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, allow us to thank our fraternal members of the Alliance belonging to Holy Trinity parish in Chicago for their participation in this very important step toward the education of our youth. There can never be an overabundance of knowledge, and the more opportunities there are for acquiring <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>an education at home, without the necessity of going far afield, the better for all.</p>
   <p>One of the greatest attributes of this new high school is that it offers a complete program of education for all. The system of instruction is closely related to that practiced in European countries, and the adoption of this method by the secondary schools of America is a very commendable accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy takes this opportunity to wish the members of the faculty, as well as the student body, all success possible in their endeavors.</p>
