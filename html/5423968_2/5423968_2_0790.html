   <p>Last Saturday, October 20, the Saint John Cantius Parish celebrated the feast of Saint John Cantius, its patron saint. This feast, observed once a year, is known as Parish Day.</p>
   <p>Special services were held at Saint John Cantius Church during the three evenings preceding the feast. On Friday evenings, that is, the vigil or the feast of Saint John Cantius, Reverend Florian Matuszewski celebrated the first vespers. On the feast day proper, at seven o'clock in the morning, a number of women from the Holy Rosary Sodality received Holy Communion.</p>
   <p>One hour later Reverend Alexander Lipinski of Saginaw, Michigan, celebrated the first High Mass, and Reverend Anthony Kozlowski, assistant priest of Saint Hedwig Church delivered a sermon appropriate to the occasion.</p>
   
   <p>Immediately after, at ten o'clock, Reverend John Radziewjewski, pastor of Saint Adalbert Parish, celebrated High Mass with the assistance of Reverend Anthony Kozlowski, as deacon, and Reverend Seraphim Cosimi, C.R., as subdeacon. Reverend John Kasprzycki, pastor of the parish, was master of ceremonies, and Reverend Alexander Lipinski of Saginaw, Michigan, delivered the main sermon. Vesper service was also celebrated by Reverend Lipinski.</p>
   <p>In the evening, before the church service was over, all church societies and fraternities appeared at the church en masse. The pastor of the parish celebrated the Complin, and Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, delivered the afternoon sermon, which was followed with a procession inside of the church. Toward the end, the parishioners were blessed with the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
   <p>The altar was beautifully decorated with flowers by the Sisters of the parish. Reverend Adolph Nowicki of South Chicago also participated in the feast.</p>
   
   <p>I wish to thank all those who participated in the feast, and especially the clergy, for their valuable assistance.</p>
   <p>Reverend John Kasprzycki, C. R.</p>
