   <p>Did you ever realize that churches and other church buildings in America erected with Polish money and estimated at a $7,000,000 value, are owned by the Irish and Germans? That we, Poles, who actually erected these church buildings, have no legal right to claim them? That we are rather despised, branded as wild Hottentots even by the high Roman officials?</p>
   <p>Three hundred thousand of honest Poles have perceived that condition perfectly. They took the situation in their own hands and, being convinced that God under stands Polish as well as any other language, decided to praise God in their own, native language and in their own, Polish National Catholic church.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Catholic Church is the only outpost and place for every good-thinking Pole</p>
