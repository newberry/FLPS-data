   <p>The World's Fair committee for distributing awards published the list of educational institutions to which prizes were awarded. It is with great pleasure that we find the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parochial School of Chicago in this list. We heartily congratulate the directors of the school, the teachers, and the nuns on this distinction.</p>
   <p>We were certain that our school deserved recognition, for it occupied a very important place among the other Catholic schools at the Fair, but we were not sure that the committee on awards would recognize the Catholic schools in general.</p>
   <p>The list of awards is very interesting. Of the ninety-five awards to schools in the State of Illinois, forty-eight were given to the public schools, private schools, medical and pharmaceutical schools, and so-called business colleges; the forty-seven remaining awards were received by parochial schools. This is a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>great triumph. Although there are incomparably more public than parochial schools, they received fewer awards. Let the public school advocates and the enemies of parochial schools draw their own conclusions. Certainly the World's Fair committee on awards cannot be accused of being opposed to the public schools, nor can it be said that the committee was bribed by the Catholics!</p>
   <p>Our own Polish opponents of the parochial schools, who often delight in writing newspaper articles proving that nothing is taught in parochial schools and that only the public schools spread enlightenment, should at last be silenced. How many attacks were there on our Polish schools! How many times was the St. Stanislaus Kostka School especially attacked! The very parents of the children who attend this school sometimes allow themselves to be misled and lose their faith in it.</p>
   <p>This is a result. It will be a most fitting reward to the nuns and lay teachers of St. Stanislaus Kostka School. To us, it is one of the most important results of the Chicago World's Fair.</p>

   <p>Once again, we congratulate the directors of the school, the teachers, and the nuns of St. Stanislaus Kostka School from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
