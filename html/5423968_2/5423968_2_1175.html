   <p>Unexpected news has been received from the capital that President Cleveland has appointed Mr. Washington Hesing Postmaster at Chicago, and Mr. William J. Mize Collector of Internal Revenue in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The appointment of Mr. Hesing was unexpected, but it solves the puzzle as to why Mr. Hesing was not a candidate for Mayor. Whether the choice was fortunate or not remains to be seen. We cannot detract from Mr. Hesing's knowledge and ability, but this high office, to which he has been appointed, may prove to be quite troublesome to Mr. Hesing on account of his German patriotism. He is, so to say, too ardent a German and looks down on other nationalities with contempt.</p>
   <p>As the publisher of the Staats-Zeitung, he has shown many times in his articles that none but the Germans, in his opinion are educated, cultured or worthy of respect. While he occasionally condescends to praise the Poles, generally around <span class="page-break">\2</span>election time, his attacks have often offended them and made it necessary to bring him to his senses.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Lawler, who expected the appointment, is naturally quite disillusioned, and time will tell whether his appointment would not have been more fortunate. We shall see.</p>
   <p>Mr. Washington Hesing is a Catholic, but his motto has always been "Deutshland Uber Alles," and his paper has been more particularly the organ of the Lutherans, and partly of the Jews, who are most numerous among the Germans.</p>
   <p>He was born in Cincinnati in 1849. His father, A. C. Hesing, moved to Chicago with his family when Washington was only five years old. Young Hesing studied at various institutions until 1861, then sailed for Europe. When he returned he attended St. Mary's of the Lake University and the University of Chicago, and finally in 1870 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree at Yale. The following year he finished his studies of literature and German law in Europe. He <span class="page-break">\3</span>returned to Chicago after the great fire of 1871, and from that time on he devoted all his time to the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, first as a worker, then as manager, and lastly as publisher. In 1880 he became president of the School Board.</p>
