   <p>A group of Polish bakers have decided to organize a Polish bakers' union. The organizers invite all their countrymen employed in the bakery trade to attend a meeting scheduled for March 11.</p>
   <p>We consider this a very worthy idea. However much we condemn all anarchistic and socialistic activities, we believe that the workers' tendency to organize for the purpose of legally securing and protecting their rights is praiseworthy. And so it is with real pleasure that we welcome this new labor union, which aims at the good of our Polish workingmen.</p>
