   <p>As we are informed by Miss Helen Baranowski, director of the courses for Polish mothers, the school [for Polish mothers] is progressing admirably. At present, two classes have been formed, one in home economics and the other in English language. The first lesson was given on Tuesday, the second on Thursday. Depending upon further enrollments (apply at the Wells Public School, Ashland Avenue and Augusta Street, 1:30 P.M.) other classes may be opened.</p>
   <p>Classes are held every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:30 to 3:30 in the afternoon. Mothers can bring their children to school with them. A kindergarten teacher has been assigned to care for children during the time mothers are in class.</p>
   <p>Polish mothers should take advantage of this opportunity. The school offers free courses in home economics, more efficient and less expensive cooking, the care of children, and English language. Only one subject can be taken.</p>
