   <p>From olden days up to the present time the Poles were and are now hospitable people.</p>
   <p>Old sayings are: "When the hut is rich, then it is filled with happiness." "Guest at home - God at home."</p>
   <p>At the present time there is in Poland that same old hospitality, with the only difference that the present hospitality very often misses its aim.</p>
   <p>Whenever we do something we should have some aim, also hospitality should have an aim or purpose, or some interest.</p>
   <p>Entertaining people with whiskey and other drinks containing alcohol is not good for health and also after one excessive drink there might be an argument and a fight. The hospitality should be to the same extent.</p>

   <p>From a logical point, hospitality is pastime and comradeship and there is no place for any arguments.</p>
   <p>Alcohol does not give you this. By an excess of alcohol comradeship and friendship do not increase, so intoxication does not bring any good result.</p>
   <p>Everybody likes a wedding to be quiet without alcohol or punch. Alcohol leads you to hell, and this way to hell is full of abuses and curses.</p>
   <p>Some people might say that it is no wedding if there is no whiskey. We answer this: whiskey is poison; how much trouble, embarrassing memories and deaths are caused by alcohol.</p>
