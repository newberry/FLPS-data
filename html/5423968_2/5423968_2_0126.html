   <p>About the school children taking part in stage plays in the schools from the moral and pedagogical viewpoint. The working class in Europe as well as in America are justified in demanding shorter hours of work because even a machine made of the best material must wear out through constant use. Man in the prime of life, with the best of care and nourishment, will decline and deteriorate if he does not give his body enough rest at the proper time.</p>
   <p>A child needs the major part of the day for rest. It cannot develop normally, if for weeks and months it is forced to rehearse during and after school hours; and because the childrens' time is too occupied with their studies for the reason that children, and especially the boys, are permitted to go to school only 4 years, at the very best, they should not be kept in school longer than their time strictly alloted for studies. Returning to the question of safety it is our opinion that no child is safe during the stage plays in the evening. The light materials of girls' dresses easily catch fire on the stage from the <span class="page-break">\2</span>stage lighting. The fire itself could be easily localized and extinguished with small losses but the tragedy is caused by fright and panic of the audience. This was the cause of the tragedy in Quincy, Illinois. The same thing can happen in Chicago or in any other place.</p>
   <p>This article has ended the discussion of the theatre in parochial schools. In future articles the attention of the public will be called to other matters in parochial schools needing immediate improvement or correction.</p>
