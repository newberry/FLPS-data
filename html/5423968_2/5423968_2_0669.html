   <p>In order to have the family remain at home the housewife should try to encourage her children to do something constructive, especially during the long winter nights.</p>
   <p>She should not forbid the young ones to play on Sundays or holidays, but teach them games. From time to time, let them entertain their friends, because youth likes to be happy. If this is taking place at your home a watchful eye it will be gracious and useful. On the other hand, take those who are deprived of entertaining their friends, they will seek pleasures on the outside behind the backs of their parents and evil can only result.</p>
   <p>A prominent Polish woman, who for some years has been paying us a visit in Chicago, says:</p>
   <p>"For a long time I couldn't understand what was the cause of so many casualties <span class="page-break">2</span>in marriage, above all, divorces. After familiarizing myself with morals, or manners, of this country I came to this conclusion: That the fault of this bad luck in marriage and in families is due to a lack of careful breeding of the children, especially the daughters.</p>
   <p>"It astonishes men, and even to this day I wonder, how the mothers can permit their daughters to go out with suitors, alone, to theaters, dances and other amusements.</p>
   <p>"A young miss going out be herself with a gentleman, not only compromises herself, but also censors her respectable parents, thus preparing a loss for herself in the future, because in marriage she shall not become acquainted with the peacefulness of home and she will quickly lose her hope and attractiveness toward it--that which is the most essential in married life. Everything that is valuable and dear in future life is lost beforehand. After marriage there is created disgust, indifference and in return a lack of ambition, all resulting in divorce.</p>

   <p>"And so then, my fair ladies, don't let gentlemen woo you who later leave because they enjoy themselves at your cost and laugh at you, but lead a normal life, recognize and respect your parents in order that you can, too, achieve this respect."</p>
