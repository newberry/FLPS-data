   <p>One of the most influential American monthly magazines, Century, worthily representing the opinion of people unbiased and sensible, published in its last issue, a very interesting article, entitled "Mischief of the A. P. A."</p>
   <p>In this article the A. P. A. sect is emphatically condemned because of its anti-American spirit.</p>
   <p>Century sharply criticizes the intolerance of the A. P. A. (American Protective Association) and its attacks on the religious freedom in this great republic.</p>
   <p>The article reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The affair of the Father Marquette statue is an example of bigotry, which should bring a blush of shame to the countenance of every American.</p>
   
   <p>"That this great French priest was a brave and noble person, nobody will deny; that his work among the Indians was one requiring the greatest sacrifice, nobody doubts; that we owe to him the discovery of the upper region of Missouri and the opening of the great Northeast to civilization, is witnessed by our history.</p>
   <p>"And yet, because he was a Roman Catholic priest, this 'patriotic' society wants to refuse to allow this state, which is most intimately connected with his work, the right to honor this man by erecting a statue to his memory!"</p>
   <p>Century considers this outrageous. It also points out many other illogical actions on the part of the A. P. A.</p>
   <p>The following excerpt is especially worth noting:</p>
   <p>"There are certain matters that can be decided behind closed doors, but not matters of a political nature. A. P. A. members are endeavoring to control our politics in a secret manner by an astounding usurpation of power. It is a misinterpretation of the republican form of government, which was successfully perpetrated in some parts of the nation, without attracting much attention to it. In this matter a great number of our newspapers are as silent as a tomb, and thousands of the Protestant ministers are even helping in this fatal work."</p>
   <p>The bravery shown by Century, which is widely read by the Protestants, in condemning the participation of the Protestant clergy in the A. P. A. agitation or tolerating it, is certainly worth noting and deserves the highest commendation.</p>
