   <p>A great number of children have signed applications to attend the Polish Roman Catholic schools. This year we expect to receive about $100,000 in tuition fees from the 120,000 children enrolled to date.</p>
   <p>At the present time we are confronted with a predicted shortage of parochial schools. We must appropriate money to build at least three more schools.</p>
   <p>The greatest attendance is recorded at Polish parochial schools. Proportionally, very few Polish parents send their children to public schools. They still believe that their children should first learn the Polish language which is their native tongue; the English language is taught in parochial schools as well, and they can improve in this language while at play with other children.</p>
