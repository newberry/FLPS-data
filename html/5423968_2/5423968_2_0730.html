   <p>Washington, D. C. - The bishop's marble throne intended for the cathedral of Immaculate Conception in Portland, Me., has been detained by the United States Custom House because the custom house duty was not paid. The custom house collector of Boston, Mass., refused to admit it as an altar, which is free of duty.</p>
   <p>There is poverty in the country and while the faithful have no bread the bishops are importing expensive marble thrones from abroad.</p>
   <p>The writer of this article is informed that a certain Chicago bishop has spent $30,000 for a private throne installed in his residence.</p>
   <p>Pride, the mother of all sins, overpowered these unfortunates. They lost heart, disregarding the fate of the suffering people, amusing themselves with kingly thrones and other playthings in order to satisfy their pride. How long will God allow such conditions?</p>
