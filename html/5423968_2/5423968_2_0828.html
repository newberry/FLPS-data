   <p>Several bills against foreigners, whom some congressmen regard as the cause of economic depression in this country, will be introduced during the next session of the United States Congress.</p>
   <p>Congressman Cable of Ohio, member of the Congressional Committee of Immigration and Naturalization, intends to put through a bill which provides for registration of foreigners. That bill has been introduced in Congress las year, but due to some discrepancies was not voted upon.</p>
   <p>In Congressman Cable's bill there is a clause which recommends the taking of fingerprints of all foreigners.</p>
   <p>These bills are being manufactured in order to discourage the foreigners and by that way compel them to leave the United States.</p>
   <p>But our legislators should not bother about it at all. If the economic situation of the United States does not improve the foreigners will flee our country without any pressure whatever.</p>
