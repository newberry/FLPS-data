   <p>Everybody knows that our Polish churches and our Polish parochial schools are the bulwarks of our religion and of our nationality in America, and that in them our children are taught to be good Poles and Catholics. This is undeniable, and the truth of it is self-evident.</p>
   <p>The public schools, although they are excellent for Americans, are not adequate for Polish children. First of all, they are irreligious. Religion and Catholic morals cannot be taught to our Polish Catholic children there. Furthermore, the atmosphere of [American] public schools is permeated with the spirit of Protestantism. Catholic children cannot be educated in such schools. On the contrary, it is the religious duty of all Catholic parents, a duty regarding which they should be admonished by Polish Catholic priests, to send their children to Catholic Schools, where they may be taught the fundamentals of religion and prepared to perform that very important act, the first Holy Communion.</p>

   <p>And then again, the public schools are strange to us in so far as the spirit, the language, and the juxtaposition of various nationalities are concerned; in fact, those schools are in every respect alien to us.</p>
   <p>Even if the Polish language were taught in the public schools, the child educated there would not grow up to be a Pole. The surroundings would deaden his Polish national spirit and would make him an average American. How can a Polish child learn the history of Poland there? Who will teach him to honor Polish heroes? Who will inculcate in his breast the true Polish spirit and the fervent love of our fatherland? Nobody....</p>
   <p>So everybody understands that if he wishes his child to become a good Pole and a Catholic, the child should be sent to a parochial school; if he wants him to become an American, indifferent to religion, oftentimes without any sense of duty, let him send the child to a public school.</p>
   <p>The question is clear. The choice is not difficult.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>And even the most liberal of our superpatriots, the fiercest foes of the Church, if they wish to appear reasonable in their patriotism, should not defend the public schools, if only for the reason that their children must inevitably lose their nationality there.</p>
   <p>Of course, sometimes we hear Polish voices raised against Polish parochial schools openly and without fear. But the underhand work against them has been going on for years. Continual and usually uncalled-for criticism of the lower grades of the schools, continual complaints, biting criticism of the teachers, rousing the parents of the school children against the schools, protecting and praising the public schools, and finally viciously attacking the parochial schools--these are everyday occurences among us.</p>
   <p>Whether these attacks are secret or open, they should not weaken our faith in the parochial schools. There our children will remain Catholics. There they will grow up as Poles.</p>

   <p>We can give them supplementary education in the high schools of the city (especially if no Polish high schools are available); but this preliminary groundwork in their Polish Catholic training should not and must not be kept from them. Depriving them of this, we are committing a sin against our religion and neglecting our patriotic duty.</p>
   <p>We have felt obliged to make these statements, especially in view of the happenings in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where a bitter fight has been conducted by Mr. Kruszka and Mr. Thaddeus Wild and a few others (naturally under the banners of patriotism and education) against Polisn Catholic schools and against the priests who on account of their priestly conscience and their deep sense of patriotic duty are defending them.</p>
   <p>This battle, begun by these gentlemen for the ostensible purpose of teaching the Polish language in the public schools, should not deceive anybody by its patriotic phraseology.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>All that they want is to get the children to go to the public schools, where with a few hours of study of the Polish language they will [also] acquire an anti-Polish and an anti-Catholic spirit. With this idea in mind [we see that] from the standpoint of patriotism these gentlemen commit an unpatriotic act. The truth is the truth. Even though it may be bitter, it must be told.</p>
   <p>This form of attack is,after all, no novelty. Today the activity is carried on in Milwaukee. Five years ago exactly the same thing happened here in Chicago. At that time Zgoda and its editor, Mr. Thaddeus Wild (the same Mr. Wild who is at the present time the promoter of the whole thing in Milwaukee), vigorously advocated the idea of teaching various languages in the public schools of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The defenders of parochial schools thoroughly understood that it was an attack on them.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Only then Mr. Wild was franker. He wrote, in number six of the Zgoda in 1891, as follows:</p>
   <p>"Emigration, impelled by the desire to improve their welfare, will inevitably cause a loss of nationalistic ideals."</p>
   <p>And further:</p>
   <p>"It is unwise to attempt to educate the children to become Polish patriots because that is impossible, and it is contrary to the natural order."</p>
   <p>These words, published on a similar occasion, will best serve as an illustration of the present activity; let them explain what are the actual reason and motive of Mr. Wild and his friends in Milwaukee.</p>
