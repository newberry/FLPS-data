   <p>In the newspaper Record-Herald there appeared an article by Attorney N. L. Piotrowski, consisting of an answer to a writer, Curtis. The translation of the answer in the Polish language we hereby present:</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 18. To the editor William E. Curtis, in one of his letters published in the Record-Herald, wrote as follows:</p>
   <p>"The second largest number of immigrants is made up of Poles and Slavs from Austria and Russia, the greater part of whom make up the class of undesirables, for the reason that they are not progressive and contribute nothing to the development of the country. The greater part of them are satisfied just to become laborers. They save their earnings and live most modestly with the hope of returning to their own country and buying a small farm."</p>
   <p>In this same letter, he nevertheless praises the Syrians and Greeks, "because," he says, "they begin their careers at street selling of <span class="page-break">\2</span>shoe laces, suspenders and pencils; afterwards they get a wagon and finally a fruit stand."</p>
   <p>I do not think ill of the Syrians and Greeks, because they deal in shoe laces, suspenders and pencils, but it is not clear to me that for such a reason they are considered more desirable than the Poles, who because they happen to work in mines, factories, in forests, on railroads, on farms, indulge in not only the hardest work but also the most honest.</p>
   <p>If there cannot be found some other objection to the Poles, to which nationality I belong, than that which is found in the letter of Mr. Curtis, then his conclusion must be false.</p>
   <p>This country in reality needs more people working in mines and factories, building railroads, and tilling the soil, than persons who sell shoe laces and pencils.</p>
   <p>May be Mr. Curtis will make objections to the Poles because they save their earnings and are living most modestly, with hope of returning to their country and buying a small farm. In other words, because they <span class="page-break">\3</span>are collecting money which they have earned. There would be some reason if this claim were true. Even if it were so indeed, they would still be left here more as a result of their work than the amount they received in wages. Although it is unjust to take away money from this country, you still should not blame the poor people, compelled to work so hard for $1.25 or $1.50 a day, so much as you should our millionaires who year after year squander millions in Europe.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless I object to the statement that the Poles, as a class, leave this country after making enough money to buy a farm in their native land. Polish immigration to this country is comparatively young. Prior to 1870 comparatively few Poles came to this country. However, in the last 30 years many Polish colonies have been started. Let us consider that in Chicago Polish population reaches the 150,000 - 200,000 mark. Milwaukee, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Toledo, Buffalo, Pittsburg, Philadelphia and New York, average each 50,000 Poles. Besides that, smaller cities like South Bend, Winona, <span class="page-break">\4</span>Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn.; Grand Rapids, Bay City and Manistee, Mich.; and small towns in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and in the New England States, the Poles have a great number of settlements, more than we can enumerate easily.</p>
   <p>And again let us consider how many Polish farmers settled in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and in the Dakotas. Then let us go through these Polish settlements in the various cities. Let us see what significant percentage of them own their own homes, around the churches and schools which they built and maintain. I can boldly say that you will not find so great a percentage among the working class of other nations, of people owning their own real estate, as you will among the Poles. It is remarkable what hard work, thrift and good management can accomplish where there are such small wages.</p>
   <p>It is true that the larger portion of the Polish immigration has no higher education and that very many of them do not know how to read, but they are honest and good workers. You will not find among them <span class="page-break">\5</span>kidnapers and gamblers and very few are criminals of any description. They become in a short time tax paying citizens. The reason that so many of them engage in manual labor is that very few of them are in a position to speak the English language. But we certainly must have people occupied in hard and lower types of work. We cannot all be professors, lawyers, doctors, clergymen, editors or capitalists.</p>
   <p>Should we define a man because he is a common laborer and call him and undesirable?</p>
   <p>We have read letters of Mr. Curtis with the greatest of pleasure for a good many years and found them to be very interesting and instructive. But it is unpleasant for me to say that his information regarding the Polish population must have come from a wrong source. The appearance of such statement in a letter that is read by thousands of people, has caused, I can see, an unusual injustice, undoubtedly involuntary, to about 2,000,000 people of my nationality living in this country, and <span class="page-break">\6</span>for that reason I judged it my duty to write this in our defense, and those who are acquainted with the Polish people in this country will admit that I am justified in what I have written.</p>
   <p>N. L. Piotrowski.</p>
