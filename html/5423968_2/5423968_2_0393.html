   <p>According to statistics 125,000 Poles living in Chicago have no citizenship papers! Whose fault is this, if not yours? A school of "citizenship" has been conducted for a number of years and what an insignificant number of Poles take advantage of this school.</p>
   <p>Now is the time to enroll in the school course for citizenship and endeavor to get citizen papers so that at the next election we can show those of other nationalities that the Poles constitute a power in Chicago.</p>
   <p>For a number of years, at Northwestern University Settlement, corner of Noble and Augusta Streets, there has beenconducted especially for the Poles, a course in citizenship. Already this year over 300 Poles have benefitted from the lectures and there is room for 3,000.</p>
   <p>The lectures are given in both Polish and English languages. Lectures take place every Thursday from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM.</p>

   <p>In Pulaski Park at Noble and Blackhawk Streets, every Monday from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM.</p>
   <p>The lectures are given by Mr. Joseph Gagol, and are free.</p>
   <p>Therefore, fellow-countrymen, do not delay but enroll with this school in as great numbers as possible.</p>
