   <p>Many specialized workers have found employment in the Stockyards and it is evident that the officials have sent for them. Because of this the strikers are having a difficult time getting their old jobs back again. Many are turned away, although they have applied for work.</p>
   <p>Lodge No. 80, of the Polish National Alliance, has delegated a committee to make a collection for the needy Stockyards' strikers in Bridgeport. M. Gniatczynski and S. Stuczgnski, who were elected collectors, made a good showing in their early efforts. Over 123.50 was collected from various businessmen and private individuals in Bridgeport.</p>
   <p>The following unemployed Stockyards' workers have received assistance: S. Kokoszka, $15; M. Kordula, $15; Chojnacki, $15, J. Krawczyk, $10; S. Mazurkiewicz, $10; 1. Pierczynski, $10; S. Mrawczykowski, $15; and J. Kozierski, $15.</p>
