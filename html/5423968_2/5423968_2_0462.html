   <p>Unfortunately, we do not possess statistical data on the extent of the plague of alcoholism among Polish immigrants in the United States. That drunkenness, however, is one of our most dangerous vices is demonstrated by the number of saloons and taverns, sometimes decorating all four corners of the street intersections, in the Polish neighborhoods. Police records also show this. No less do our Polish parties, which cannot get along without a bar, illustrate this fact. Abstinence has no champions among our people. It is time to think about some defensive action, because this enemy is dangerous.</p>
