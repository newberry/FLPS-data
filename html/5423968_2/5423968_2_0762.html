   <p>After four weeks of preparation, the girls at Saint Stanislaus Kostka School, under the guidance of the Sisters of Notre Dame and the direction of Reverend Francis Gordon, C.R., finished their instructions for confession and first Holy Communion. The last eight days had been spent in recollection so that they could prepare not only their hearts but their minds as well for the initial partaking of God under the mantle of the Blessed Host.</p>
   <p>The desire of the innocent hearts was fulfilled today. Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of Saint Stanislaus Nostka Parish, officiated at the first Holy Communion services at 7:30 A.M. Two hundred and seventy school girls marched from the school hall and filled the pews before the altar.</p>
   <p>Mass was celebrated by the pastor, with the assistance of Reverend Gordon, as deacon, Reverend A.Spetz, as subdeacon, and Reverend S. Cosimi, as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>acolyte.</p>
   <p>Before the Holy Communion ceremony, the pastor delivered a sermon ap-propos to the occasion. It concerned the salvation of their virgin hearts and the preservation of their virtue and purity of their souls for the rest of their lives.</p>
   <p>This was also the wish of all those who attended the services.</p>
