   <p>St. Stanislaus Kostka College of Chicago, which was founded five years ago, is gradually developing, and if it were not for the opposition of a certain portion of the local Polish society the College would be one of the largest of its kind.</p>
   <p>It is characteristic of our people to find fault with what is ours and to extol that which is not. We do not always send our children to such institutions, where there is concern about the preservation of national culture and religious training, because we do not place any stock in these principles. This Polish College has the same plan as those of the American colleges. It has capable professors and, in addition to the following basic plans of the public high schools, it offers courses in the Polish language and in religion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Those who are opposed to the Polish College say that a youth learns more in the American schools. This conception is erroneous. Several students left the Polish College during the course of the year and entered American schools where they took examinations. In every instance each student was permitted to enter one semester higher and in some instances two semesters higher.</p>
   <p>This evidence plainly indicates the high level of our school, contrary to the general opinion. It is only the lack of faith that causes our failure to recognize the position of the Polish College. Everyone can convince himself of this standing, by simply taking the time to check up on it. If they will do so they will see for themselves that our school lacks nothing by comparison with the American schools; it even stands above them.</p>
   <p>The completion of a course of study in this school is essential to our youth at the present time. It will facilitate their getting official positions and offers a better means of earning their daily bread. Besides this, the Polish people at large benefit because the youth becomes familiar with Polish history and <span class="page-break">\3</span>literature and does not become denationalized. There are further benefits, for the youth learns to respect the religious training it receives, and this training becomes imbedded and later protect the religion for which the Poles have spilled their blood.</p>
   <p>The Polish College took upon itself the duty of preparing the Polish Roman Catholic youth for the priesthood, (one student, J. Piasecki has left for Rome to complete his studies in this field, and a few others are preparing to leave next year), business and industry. Lectures in the school are presented in English and in Polish.</p>
   <p>The College has three departments of study: 1. classical, 2. scientific, 3. business; next year a course in philosophy will be offered.</p>
   <p>1. The classical department prepares the students for theology, law and medicine. It comprises the following studies: Latin, Greek, Polish, German, English and French languages, physiology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>2. The scientific course prepares the students for engineering, geodesy, architecture, and pharmacy. It also offers the continuation of the first course, plus higher mathematics.</p>
   <p>3. The business department, which prepares the pupils for the business world, includes the second course, and also teaches bookkeeping, higher mathematics, law, business forms, and formal and business writing.</p>
   <p>These departments are conducted along the same lines as those of the American schools, the only difference is that the Polish language and religion are added. Singing, sketching and painting are free courses. There is a special free for musical instrument lessons.</p>
   <p>Tuition fee per student is two dollars per month. This low fee enables the parents in poorer circumstances a chance to give their children a higher education at a nominal cost, thereby preparing them for the future.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The College administration has made an effort to induce large business firms to employ those students who have completed a course of study in their particular field of learning, thus relieving the parents of this responsibility.</p>
   <p>Further information can be had by writing to the rector of the College, Reverend John Piechowski, C. R.</p>
   <p>Enrollment of new students will take place during July and August.</p>
   <p>On July 7 the students of the college will give an exercise to which all are invited to attend. There will be speeches, declamations, songs and a play arranged and presented by students of the school.</p>
