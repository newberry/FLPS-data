   <p>The New York Commisioner of Penal Institutions is very indignant, because of the widespread circulation of information, regarding the supposed discovery, of a hidden whiskey still in one of the city prisons. The discovery, by a prison guard, of three, one-half-pint bottles of whiskey, in one of the inmates cells, led to the spread of the above news.</p>
   <p>The Commissioner considers these as ridiculous rumors, and says that it would be impossible to conceal a still in a prison. The truth of the matter is, that the Anti-Saloon League is assuring the public, that it is becoming more and more difficult to obtain whiskey, in fact so much so, that even the sad and lonely prisoners, are able to obtain a bottle of cheer, without any difficulty. The Anti-Saloon League assures us that things are not quite so bad.</p>
