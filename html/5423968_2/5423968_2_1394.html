   <p>The Federal Government, for the third time, is battling the wholesale meat packers in Chicago. This time it has instituted <span class="gap">[gap]</span> investigation of the alleged conspiracy to raise the price of meat while the European powers are at war.</p>
   <p>Prosecuting Attorney <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ilkerson is conducting the investigation, and a Federal Grand Jury has today begun examining the evidence submitted by the Prosecuting Attorney. The evidence gathered against the "trustors" is said to be so strong that the jury will not spend much time <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ing over this case but, as the Prosecuting Attorney asserts, will uphold the charges against the "meat kings." Federal detectives have been gathering evidence against the accused companies for several days. If one can believe the detectives--and there is not the slightest reason for doubting them--the wholesale meat packers have raised the prices on meat in the last few days to such an extent that, on the merchandise on which they made one cent before the war, they are now making five cents.</p>
   
   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span> these who <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ill be held <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are Armour and Company, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Company, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Company, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Packing Company and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Gulsberger. [Translator's note: the last is now known as Wilson &amp; Co.] Officers of the five firms mentioned above <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ill be summoned before the Federal Grand Jury as witnesses.</p>
   <p>For the third time the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of "trustors" is the object of the governments particular attention. In the first case they were <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ble somehow to evade punishment and to get by with only <span class="gap">[gap]</span> official reprimand. The second time they were freed. Now they are caught for the third time, and this time they will not be able to get out of it quite so easily. It is noteworthy that not more than three days ago one of the "honorable five," namely, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>orrison, [sic.] publicly announced that the wholesale dealers had not raised the prices on meat. In the near future it will be demonstrated that <span class="gap">[gap]</span> assertion was calculated to pull the wool over the eyes of the press and the public.</p>
   <p>The exploitation and robbery practiced by the trusts causes great hardship to the poorest class of people, and it is high time that this be ended. Prosecuting Attorney Wilkerson is known for his energy and determination, and if he succeeds in forcing the "trusters" to stop their practice of robbing, he will undoubtedly have earned recognition from the people, who are crushed under the blows delivered by this or that trust. The people will be grateful to Prosecuting Attorney Wilkerson for bringing the guilty ones to justice. Attorney Wilkerson, if he accomplishes what he has set out to, will have done an inexpressibly great service. Although holding the "trustors" responsible is an important thing in itself, yet, for people in general, it is still more important to the disgraceful exploitation by which every one is victimized, with the exception of a few millionaires who do not feel the high cost of living.</p>
