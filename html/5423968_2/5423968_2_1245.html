   <p>Whoever among the Poles in America has contributed to a more complete union of his countrymen, be it through the organizing of an association or through the successful development of an activity already organized, that person deserves due credit. Several young Poles belong to that group who have succeeded in their attempt to improve the Cadet organization, instituted by Rev. Mahoney at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church. These Poles have rejuvenated this organization and returned it to its former glory. Mr. John Lama also belongs among these young and active Poles; on May 17 he married Miss Frances Milkowska, a Chicagoan.</p>
   <p>The groom, 22 years of age, an organizer and captain of the Cadets, a member of the famous parish choir, was born in Upper Silesia, at Wielkie Stawiszcza, a mile distant from the birthplace of our esteemed City Treasurer, Mr. Peter Kiolbassa.</p>

   <p>The parishioners of St. Stanislaus had the opportunity to witness the parade of the Cadets, who arrived at the church to assist at the ceremony of their beloved captain. Three detachments, led by the Zuavs, stood at attention before the presbytery. The breast and musket of each cadet were decorated with flowers and larger garlands ornamented rifles that were fixed in groups.</p>
