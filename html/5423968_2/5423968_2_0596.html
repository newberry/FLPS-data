   <p>Poland, as well as other nations, has maintained a very old marriage custom, which provides when people marry, regardless of the financial standing of either bride or the groom, there must be a big feast, called wedding. Quite often the parents of the bride contract a debt for their daughter's trousseau and the wedding banquet, which, in reality is not absolutely necessary and in many cases even harmful, not only because of the expense involved but because of the indulgence in intoxicating liquor which is harmful to health, besides paving the way for dissension, gossip, and in many cases bloody fights.</p>
   <p>The groom, desirous of making a favorable impression, even the is not financially prepared to furnish a home, runs into debt. Such debts are great burdens and must be paid in small installments over a long period of time. Many parents furnish a big wedding feast, when they marry their first daughter, to encourage the marriage of the remaining daughters. Because of these observations, which are taken from real life, the question arises, whether it would be better, in the face of hard and economical circumstances, to limit celebrations to our means. Would it not be better for both, the parents and the young couple, to save this money for a rainy day, instead of spending it for an ostentatious purpose?</p>

   <p>A young married couple should have at least a little capital with which to start a home; and the money so frivoulously spent would come very handy. Yet, our youth does not heed this example; the result is that there are many young widows with children who have been left peninless.</p>
   <p>These suggestions, however, are directed towards those individuals of lesser wealth who need assistance. People, not possessing much wealth should be careful of their money as the future holds a great secret for every one.</p>
