   <p>The Polish membership of the Chicago Federation of Musicians, Local #10 of the American Federation of Musicians, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, is now 400. Evidently this professional organization has something to offer, or its membership would not be growing.</p>
   <p>These members are accomplished musicians who have devoted their lives to the study of music; and are constantly striving for greater perfection in their profession. All the Polish lodges and organizations in Chicago have been invited to co-operate with the Federation, when selecting an orchestra for a dance, concert, or the various festivities or events, by engaging a union orchestra at all times.</p>
   <p>The Polish members of this organization are requested to notify their headquarters about all contracts which have been received, so that these agreements may be given publicity in the various Polish papers and the Federation News. Through this publicity our members will be given an opportunity to patronize those who patronize them. Members are requested to send all requests for publicity to the Chicago Federation of Musicians, 175 W. Washington St., Chicago, Ill., Box B, #3.</p>
