   <p>Yesterday afternoon, in the Municipal Court, a very unusual law suit was in progress. It was interesting because both parties were Polish, and the closing of the saloons on Sundays was involved in the case. Mr. Josef Wojtyla rented his premises at 30 Kosciustko St. on a 5 years lease to Mr. Michal Wojtyla. Several months ago the question of closing the saloons of our city on Sunday was raised. Mr. Josef Wojtyla had in mind to break the lease and gave Michal Wojtyla a notice to vacate the premises in ten days otherwise he would be complelled to file suit. But Mr. Wojtyla, acting on the advice of his attorney, did not move from the premises, a law suit was then filed, charging him with selling liquor on Sunday.</p>
   <p>The case was tried yesterday before judge Burgemeyer, who decided that selling intoxicating liquors on Sunday did not constitute sufficient reason for Mr. Josef Wojtyla breaking the lease. This question was of great importance, because it involved 4500 saloon keepers here in our City of Chicago. If the court, however, had decided in favor of Josef Wojtyla much embarrassment would have resulted, because of other saloon keepers in the same situation. Clever arguments presented by the leading attorney defended Mr. Michal Wojtyla, won the case for him.</p>
