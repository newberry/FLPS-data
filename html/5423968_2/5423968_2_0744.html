   <p>During the period November 25-December 1, Forty Hours Devotion was observed at St. Casimir's Parish. The services were officially opened last Tuesday by a High Mass celebrated by the pastor, Rev. A. Farman.</p>
   <p>More than twenty visiting priests, many of them from out of town, took part in the services. Rev. Walter Kruszka of Milwaukee was one of the guest speakers and Fr. Raphael Chrzaszcz of Benson, Michigan participated in the services.</p>
   <p>Thanks are extended to all the visiting priests, to the parish nuns, and to W. Ziolkowski, choirmaster, for making the services a pleasant success. Exceptionally large throngs attended the morning and evening services. In the afternoons school children offered prayers and songs to the Lord.</p>
