   <p>Yesterday, at St. Adalbert, children were confirmed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. There were even <span class="gap">[gap]</span> people <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, which a good number, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the bad weather we had. At <span class="gap">[gap]</span> clock, the precession start from the rectory to the church. First paraded the little boys dressed in white, followed by little girls <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> colored dresses; following the little girls came the priests of this parish and priests representing other parishes with the Rev. Father <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Symon at the end. The procession marched down the center aisle up to the altar, where <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Symon, dressed in his confirmation <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>During the confirmation <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Archbishop Syman was <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Rev. Fathers Robakowski and Bobkiewicz. The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> was displayed by Archbishop Symon.</p>
   <p>During the confirmation the church choir song beautiful hymns and Miss Anna Muchowska, member of the choir, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> several <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>It is important at this time to say that Archbishop Symens did not either before or after the confirmation ceremony, speak the gospel, or the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> words of confirmation to the congregation because he was suffering with <span class="gap">[gap]</span> pains due to bad teeth.</p>
