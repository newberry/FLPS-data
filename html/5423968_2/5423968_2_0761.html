   <p>Yesterday, at St. Adelbert, children were confirmed at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. There were over 350 people present, which is a good number, considering the bad weather we had. At 4 o'clock, the procession started from the rectory to the church. First paraded the little boys dressed in white, followed by little girls dressed in rose colored dresses; following the little girls came the priests of this parish and priests representing other parishes with the Rev. Father Archbishop Symon at the end. The procession marched down the center aisle up to the altar, where archbishop Symon, dressed in his confirmation robes officiated.</p>
   <p>During the confirmation ceremony Archbishop Syman was assisted by Rev. Fathers Robakowski and Bobkiewicz. The Holy Sacrament was displayed by Archbishop Symon.</p>
   <p>During the confirmation the church choir song beautiful hymns and Miss Anna Muchowska, member of the choir, rendered several solos.</p>
   <p>It is important at this time to say that Archbishop Symens did not either before or after the confirmation ceremony, speak the gospel, or the Godly words of confirmation to the congregation because he was suffering with terrible pains due to bad teeth.</p>
