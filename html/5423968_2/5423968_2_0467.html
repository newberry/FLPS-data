   <p>The Circle of Resurrectors is the first brotherhood of teetotalers and was established three years ago in the parish of St. Hedwig by Professor Vincent Lutoslawski, who came from Poland.</p>
   <p>On the invitation of Rev. John Piechowski, he came to Chicago in April 17, 1908, and in April 19, 1908, he established the above mentioned association.</p>
   <p>This new organization gained twelve members.</p>
   <p>After Professor Lutoslawski left us, the association gradually started to disappear, but it was reorganized by the Rev. W. Kwiatkowski and was accepted under the name "Circle of Resurrectors." They made and adopted the constitution for the above association. Rev. John Piechowski proved himself a very benevolent patron, whose interest and help is greatly appreciated by the circle. In the future we will publish in detail an article about this circle.</p>
