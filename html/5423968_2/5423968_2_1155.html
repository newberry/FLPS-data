   <p>Kosciusko's year--which began with such beautiful promises--is ending tragically.....Dissension has sprouted again, and base slander is raising its impudent head once more. The patriotic work which was started, and which was so much benefit to the public is being trampled down by wicked intriguers and slanderers. Will we ever come to our senses and abandon this terrible road? Will we ever establish order and punish this outrageous wickedness? If we can not accomplish all this, we will be disgraced. Let us subdue our passions at least now that the sad centennial anniversary of the partition of Poland is so close at hand. Let us put selfishness aside for a while. Let us condemn every attempt against national solidarity and start once more our work for Poland.</p>
