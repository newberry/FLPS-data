   <p>For many years the enemies of the Roman Catholic Church have been conducting a systematic war against Catholicism. Taking advantage of the freedom of speech and of the press, they find their strongest weapons in the anti-Catholic press and in public lectures. Such newspaper articles and lectures have begun to appear more frequently in recent times.</p>
   <p>They find their most active warriors among people who once were or still call themselves Catholics. Hence, lectures pour out under such titles as "Why I Left the Catholic Church," or "By a Catholic," etc. Our editorial office possesses copies of invitations from various cities to this sort of lectures. And if it so happens that a Catholic priest is suspended because of misbehavior, or detaches himself from the Church for some reason of his own, such a man is paid great sums to appear in public lectures that are filled with the most terrible calumnies and with so-called revelations. Such a lecture by an excommunicated priest, William Rudolph, created a riot in Lafayette, Indiana, last week.</p>
   <p>And again, in the same city, a Methodist pastor heaped such insults upon Catholicism that even Rudolph's lecture looked mild. Throughout the whole city there is unrest that may flare again into riots.</p>
   <p>These unfortunate manifestations testify to the mental state of some people in America. Honest intelligent opinion ought to condemn it severely.</p>
