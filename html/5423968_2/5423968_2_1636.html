   <p>The labor situation at Crane's is improving steadily, and more people are finding employment there. The company has reduced wages ten to fifteen per cent. The Crane Company is located on South Kedzie Street.</p>
   <p>Work in the stockyards goes on at normal pace. Hundreds of workers apply at the employment offices begging for work, but not all who worked there before the strike have got their jobs back. Hundreds of workers are still out of work because during the strike the companies hired scabs, and they are still holding the jobs of former workers.</p>
   <p>In the Town of Lake and in the Bridgeport district there are a great many families who because of the strike in the stockyards are absolutely penniless. Donations are still arriving at the union headquarters in Slowacki Hall, 48th and Paulina Streets, but alas, in reduced amounts. And the need is still so great!</p>
