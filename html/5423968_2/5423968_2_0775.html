   <p>At 6 A. M. Sunday, July 7, a bugler placed his instrument to his lips and sounded the reveille at the portals of Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>In and about the large hall the movement of soldiers, who already were gathered there, could be heard. The commands of officers penetrated the air, and in a short while the constant shifting changed into complete order as the soldiers stood in file in the hall. Shortly afterward the various companies with their delegates marched to the St. Adalbert Church to attend Mass. The Corps' band led the soldiers to the tune of a Polish march.</p>
   <p>After the services were over the entire group marched back to Pulaski Hall where the order "at ease" was given by the officers.</p>
   <p>At 8 A. M. the stage of the auditorium was occupied by the delegates, and the members of the various companies were seated below. In a few minutes the marshal of the Corps, S. Behnke opened the First Convention of the Second Corps of the Polish Armies of America by giving a short informal address in which he urged the delegates not only to take interest in the proceedings but to take an active part in them, for the benefit of the entire organization.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the constitution a chairman must be elected to preside over the convention and Francis Jurkiewicz was elected to this position. Mr. Jurkiewicz, after taking the stand, requested the assembly to choose a recording secretary. Delegate M. Malinowski nominated Francis P. Danisch, who was unanimously elected.</p>
   <p>After the role call had been taken by the secretary, the marshal appointed a credentials committee; namely, M. Malinowski, W. Zimny and I. Morzynski, to make a report. The marshal also appointed W. Kaptura, C. Konieczny and John Nowakowski to make a report on the books of the administration.</p>
   <p>By a request of the delegates the marshal asked the representatives of the Tenth Regiment of the Krakus Volunteers and the Polish Scythmen Division of St. Hedwig Parish, Casimir Adamowski and John Wachowski, whether or not they wished to join the organization. They informed the marshal that they wished to become familiar with the matters of this military group and probably will join after hearing the report by the representatives of the convention.</p>
   <p>The credentials committee then presented its report. According to its findings the following military societies were represented by legally recognized delegates:</p>
   <p>1. St. Gregory Krukuses: I. Morzynski and Anthony Gorecki.</p>
   <p>2. The Krakus Volunteers of South Chicago: Casper Konieczny and Andrew Aremski.</p>
   <p>3. St. Casimir Knights, Division I, of South Chicago: F. Jurkiewicz and Martin Kusnierz.</p>
   <p>4. St. Martin Hussars: F. Herek.</p>
   <p>5. Fourth Regiment of the Polish Ulans: W. Kaptur.</p>
   <p>6. St. Onufry Knights: B. Rafinski.</p>
   <p>7. Pulaski Volunteers: F. P. Danisch and John Nowakowski.</p>
   
   <p>8. St. Michael Archangel Krakuses: W. Zimny.</p>
   <p>9. St. Florian Krakuses: Stanislaus Behnke and Andrew Nowak.</p>
   <p>10. St. Casimir Knights: M. Malinowski and F. Kaminski.</p>
   <p>11. Polish Krakuses of St. Hedwig, Company II: N. Michalski.</p>
   <p>12. St. Casimir Knights, of Lemont, Illinois: W. Lasinski and Peter Madaj.</p>
   <p>13. St. Paul Ulans: Anthony P. Janiak.</p>
   <p>14. Second Corps Band: R. Henzel.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Second Corps informed the assembly that the corps from St. Louis and Nanticoke have delegated him and Mr. Schmidt to represent them at the convention.</p>
   <p>At this time the secretary of the Corps, I. Przymorski, read the minutes of the regular meetings and those of the administrative body. They were accepted.</p>
   <p>The secretary then read the annual statement of the Second Corps which showed that from July 1894 to the end of June 1895 the income was $223.16 and the expenses $199.65, leaving $23.51 in the treasury; this did not include the money taken in during the past few days. The organization, according to the report, had 307 members.</p>
   <p>The committee that examined the books found them in good order.</p>
   <p>After a fifteen minute recess the meeting was resumed.</p>
   <p>At this time the secretary read the correspondence. The first letter was from the First Corps of the Polish Armies of America, of Jersey City. In this letter the First Corps extended good wishes for a successful convention, but regretted to inform the assembly that unexpected business matters prevented the sending of delegates to Chicago. This was greeted by applause. The second letter was from the Censor of the Polish National Alliance, T. M. Helinski, who sent his regrets for not being able to attend the convention, but he urged the Poles to join the Second Corps because it was an organization that was not only necessary but was a patriotic one as well. Applause greeted this letter also.</p>
   
   <p>A Motions Committee, consisting of Malinowski, Zimny and Morzynski, was then appointed by the marshal. Proposed amendments to the constitution were also to be turned over to this group.</p>
   <p>At this time a motion was made to adjourn the meeting until 1 P. M., and the motion was carried.</p>
   <p>The chairman opened the second session at 1:15 P. M.</p>
   <p>The Motions Committee reported that it was ready, and Delegate Morzynski read the report.</p>
   <p>The first motion: That the cost of a copy of the constitution shall be reduced to twenty-five cents. This motion was made by the Pulaski Volunteers and the motion was carried. A motion to lower the entrance fee of the cadets to one dollar was not carried.</p>
   <p>The St. Casimir Knights of South Chicago made a motion to appoint a Polish priest as chaplain, however, no action was taken and it was set aside until the next convention.</p>
   <p>The St. Casimir Knights from St. Adalbert Parish made a motion to have the Corps institute a death benefit fund, out of which the sum of five hundred dollars would be paid to the wife of a member on his death, and two hundred and fifty dollars to a husband in case of the death of his wife; with the reservation that no one shall be compelled to take part in this fund. This motion brought about a lively discussion in which the following delegates took part: Nowakowski, Morzynski, Przymorski, Kaminski, Nowak, Gorecki, Zimny, Rafinski and Danisch. The motion was carried over until the next convention by a motion made by delegate Danisch.</p>
   <p>The motion made by the Hussars Society to have a part of the Corps Band at the head of each brigade was defeated. This same society made another motion to have the Corps committee work out drills in handling arms in the event of attack. It was agreed to turn this question over to the staff.</p>
   
   <p>S. F. Adalia Satalecki, president of the Polish National Alliance, who was present, was called upon by the chairman to take the stand. He spoke to the diet in brotherly terms, urging all to work zealously for the good of the fatherland just as the Irish do. The speaker was generously applauded.</p>
   <p>The secretary read a congratulatory letter from the Polish Youth Alliance of America and it received warm applause.</p>
   <p>At this time the chairman requested the following invited guests to come up on the platform: Clement J. Belinski, Joseph Napieralski, Poszwinski, Bobowski, S. Slominski, Stephen Napieralski, Joseph Belinski, F. Wolowski, Leon Schultz, and others.</p>
   <p>The St. Casimir Knights, of Lamont, Illinois, presented Joseph Frelichowski's motion to have the Corps pay death benefits. The motion was carried over for action at the next convention.</p>
   
   <p>The Motions Committee proposed that a financial secretary be added to the civil administration, but the motion was defeated.</p>
   <p>Delegate Przymorski made a motion that the convention should do something for the Polish National Fund of Rapperswyl [this was a fund to help the Polish cause. It was established by the combined efforts of the Polish national societies in America. A museum was built and the fund was started in the free city of Rapperswyl, Switzerland. Time founded as yet not established]. Delegate Danisch proposed to send fifteen dollars from the Corps' treasury. This was opposed by delegate Kaminski, who suggested that the Corps invest in stock of the Pulaski Hall. Delegate Gorski supported this move, suggesting that two shares be purchased. Heated debates resulted. Finally Sigmund Schmidt improved upon Kaminski's suggestion by making a motion that ten shares be purchased. A vote was taken and the motion was carried by thirteen votes to eight. One share of stock costs ten dollars.</p>
   <p>In an election of civil officers Mr. Stanislaus Behnke was elected president. The voting was as follows: Mr. Behnke, 9 votes; Mr. Gorecki, 5 votes; Mr. S. Schmidt, 2 votes; messrs.<span class="gap">[gap]</span> Jurkiewicz, Danisch, malinowski and Nowakowski received one vote each.</p>
   <p>On a motion made by delegate walinowski, Anthony Gorecki was elected vice president.</p>
   <p>Mr. Przymorski was elected secretary by the following vote:</p>
   <p>Mr. Przymorski, 18 votes; Mr. F. Danisch, 2 votes; Mr. Zimny, 1 vote.</p>
   <p>Francis Kaminski was unanimously elected treasurer when delegate Gorecki made a motion to that affect.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Nowak, Malinowski and Herki were chosen for the Ways and Means Committee by a motion introduced by Mr. Danisch.</p>
   <p>Once again C. Schmidt was chosen unanimously as commander of the Second Corps. Mr. Schmidt thanked the assemblage for the honor it bestowed upon him and pressed it to greater work and accomplishment during the next year.</p>
   
   <p>The following were chosen brigadiers: F. P. Danisch of the Fifth Brigade; P. Labonski of the Sixth Brigade; F. Kaminski of the Seventh Brigade and V. Zimny of the Eighth Brigade.</p>
   <p>The rank of adjutant went to J. N. Przymorski.</p>
   <p>An oath was taken by all newly elected officers.</p>
   <p>When the elections were over a telegram from Mr. Helinski of Duluth was read.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Adolph Nowicki, pastor of St. Michael Parish of South Chicago, gave the closing speech, and then terminated the convention with the Lord's Prayer.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the close of the convention Commander Schmidt gave an order to have all military units fall in line in front of the hall. Then a parade was staged through the principal streets of St. Adalbert Parish. This indeed presented a beautiful sight.</p>
   
   <p>After the parade, an entertainment program was given at Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>The opening number was presented by the combined Halka and Maniusko choirs. Then the president of Polish Sokols Alliance, Casimir Zychlinski, garbed in a new uniform of the Sokols, gave an interesting speech based on the need for military and sokol organizations. He said that these organizations build the body in physical fitness and give preparatory training for the protection of the fatherland. He urged the Second Corps to establish a branch for Polish youth because it is not known when the fatherland will call for help [applause]. The Irish, he continued, are doing it. They are strongly preparing in America to defend their country.</p>
   <p>"Why cannot we follow their example?" asked the speaker. "We must be prepared! Perhaps our country will need us tomorrow. Did we think that China and Japan were going to war last year? No. Therefore we ought to be cautious", Mr. Zychlinski concluded.</p>
   
   <p>His speech greatly impressed the audience, which was unsparing in its applause.</p>
   <p>The Halka and Moniusko choirs, under the direction of Professor R. Hensel, then sang a number of lively Polish songs. Then Mr. Slominski spoke warmly to the members of the military groups. He was rewarded with loud acclaim.</p>
   <p>For the third time the Halka and Moniusko choirs sang a patriotic song, which had to be repeated.</p>
   <p>Clement J. Belinski spoke about the work of the Second Corps and wished that organization success in obtaining over a thousand members.</p>
   <p>After mass singing, Commander Schmidt thanked the audience for its kind co-operation and support.</p>
   <p>A dance took place after the program was concluded and continued into the late hours.</p>
