   <p>The yearly Forty Hours Devotion services were held on November 29, 30, and December 1 at Holy Trinity Parish. During the entire services devout parishioners filled the church to capacity. A large number of school children set a fine example by their attendance, and hundreds of people went to confession and received the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
   <p>All the sermons during the services were delivered by the renowned Rev. Dr. Thomas Hisicki of Williamsport, Pa. His brilliant command of Polish brought <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>more listeners each time he spoke. He will be remembered for a long time to come, for he is a true son of Poland.</p>
   <p>Among the many visiting priests were: Rev. Anthony Zubowicz, C.S.C., pastor of St. Hedwig's Parish in South Bend, Indiana; Rev. A. Kadziela, assistant at St. John de Kanty's Parish in Indiana Harbor, Indiana; Rev. F. Jagielski of East Chicago, Indiana; and many others.</p>
