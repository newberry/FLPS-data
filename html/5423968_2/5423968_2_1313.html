   <p>It was indeed a great pleasure to describe the first two sketches--the "Self-made Man" and "Lucy"--because they represent persons of whom Poles in America may be proud, for such individuals bring credit to the Polish element in this country, for which they are respected and loved by our countrymen. And yet--I have been assailed on account of it, and it brought me unpleasantness because several persons discovered their own features in these sketches [and] came to the editor of Dziennik Chicagoski and demanded a correction, stating that a certain particular was not true, that this or that feature was false or omitted, that this detail was not stressed enough or that that one was stressed too much, and the result was that the editor, in reality, jumped all over me.</p>
   <p>But these visits at the newspaper's office and these objections only prove that I have sketched typical characters, and that these sketches were taken simultaneously from different persons.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>With fear, I am going to describe the next sketch, because it is impossible for me to back out now, since I have already announced it and promised Dziennik Chicagoski Verbum Nobile Debet Esse Stabile. I am approaching this task with fear, for I am afraid that I will infuriate not only a few but many angered little damosels who will recognize themselves in this sketch. I am fortunate that they do not know me, especially Annie, whom I will try to sketch.</p>
   <p>Please do not, after reading this long introduction, think that Annie is an unsympathetic person or what would be worse wicked, very bad, or worst of all ugly, unpleasant. On the contrary, she is a very charming person, and if I were a historian or a novelist I would say something about her carmine lips, blue eyes, pearl teeth, luxuriant locks of hair, pleasant personality, delightful manners, and other qualities. It would be impossible to describe all particulars in a sketch, therefore, I beg Annie to forgive me if I will see her in a different light than I saw her in the past, a light in which many of her admirers probably see her today. And I look upon her with pity, for she ought to be different from what she is in reality if she desires to belong to the Polish element in America.</p>
   <p>It is not entirely Annie's fault that she is different; her father, like Lucy's <span class="page-break">3</span>father, is an ardent and well-known patriot; her mother is a Polish woman to the extent that she instilled in her daughter an attachment to the Polish nationality, but she was Americanized to the extent that she preferred the English language to Polish and used it at every opportunity, for she had learned it well during childhood, and for the same reason she used the other language unwillingly.</p>
   <p>This circumstance of neglecting the Polish language was responsible for the Americanization of Annie, which was almost complete.</p>
   <p>The father took good care of his sons' upbringing and education, and therefore had no time to worry about the education of Annie. Recognizing the necessity for his children also to know the English language well, he did not object if his daughter spoke English to him. Later on, very late, unfortunately too late, he became aware that his daughter had acquired a good knowledge of the English language but knew almost nothing about her native tongue; that she used it unwillingly and very seldom; whenever she was obliged to do so, she butchered it unmercifully.</p>
   <p>Annie's father discovered this once when she was fourteen years of age, just <span class="page-break">4</span>before she enrolled in high school. He was disturbed by this discovery and decided to rectify it as far as possible, but could not accomplish much for it was too late. Annie was obliged to attend the public school, where the English language is used. Nothing could be done because at that time there were no Polish institutions of learning in America. Instead of that, Annie's father engaged a Polish choir teacher, who could not speak English, as instructor. Besides this, her father had arranged for evening receptions at which all conversations, recitations, and singing were held in Polish. Father encouraged Annie to take active part in Polish amateur plays. The beautiful English prayer book was replaced by a Polish one. Children were instructed to converse in Polish, and mother was also obliged to observe this procedure, at least in part.</p>
   <p>Annie, just like Lucy of our last sketch, thought now and then about it and at times she even tried to overcome the difficulties, but this was only at times and gradually less often, because this task was already too difficult for her. She was at the age when a girl likes to make a good appearance and be admired by her associates, in which, unfortunately, she was encouraged by her mother. When it was necessary for her to converse or express herself in Polish, she lost her humor, self-assurance, and ease. Although they lived among Poles, Annie and her mother did not participate in Polish activities and amusements, which had a <span class="page-break">5</span>great influence upon Annie's mind and heart. They frequented English concerts, receptions, and theatrical plays which were sometimes very indecent, and read only English or rather American novels and storybooks because they were so diverting--Polish books were not understandable. They imbibed that which was harmful and disregarded that which was good. This unhealthy effect manifested itself in a short time through Annie's whole behavior, through her attire, her appearance, and everything.</p>
   <p>Annie had ceased to be a Polish woman at the age of eighteen, though she might have thought that she still was. Reading cheap, unhealthy American editions, attending theaters which were also improper, accomplished the rest. Annie lost completely the characteristics of a Polish woman. The object of her life was to be attractive, but only externally and not by the good qualities of mind or heart.</p>
   <p>Her attire, manners, conversations, jests, and even her performances as an amateur actress on the Polish stage, where she tried to imitate American actresses, were not Polish, and when it occurred to her that perhaps she did not act in the manner of a Polish actress, it was too late to change.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>A time also came for Annie to choose a husband, and she also had many suitors, perhaps more than Lucy. There were many kinds among them, but was there any one who would love Annie for the qualities of her heart or mind? Hardly, for she did not possess these qualities any more.</p>
   <p>In the presence of these circumstances and at such an important moment, Annie once more became aware of her Polish nationality and thought that she should choose a Pole for her husband.</p>
   <p>And she did in reality choose a Pole, but a Pole like herself, and this was quite natural. Her future husband was also educated superficially by reading light literature; he also took life lightly, knew very little about Polish, and had a good knowledge of English. It is not strange that her heart longed for him.</p>
   <p>They were married and in a short time the Lord blessed them with a little son.</p>
   <p>And a thought occurred in Annie's mind again--this is a Polish child, born of Polish parents, will he be a Pole? But who will teach him Polish?</p>
