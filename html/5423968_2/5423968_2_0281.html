   <p>Not knowing definitely the addresses of many societies, we invite all the Polish associations, to whom the education of the Polish youth in America is important, to take part in the dedication of the cornerstone of the home of the congregation and school of the Sisters of the Holy Name of Nazareth Order. The dedication ceremony will be conducted by the Right Reverend P. A. Feehan, Archbishop of Chicago, on July 31, 1892, at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>S. M. Laureta,</p>
   <p>Sister Superior of The Holy Name</p>
   <p>of Nazareth Order.</p>
