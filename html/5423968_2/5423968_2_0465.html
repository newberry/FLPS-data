   <p>On Milwaukee Avenue on the Northwest Side life is running freely. In this location are a few Polish and Jewish saloons in which things go on which are worse than that in the underworld. Gambling with dice and cards proceeds openly. At the tables are sitting and drinking very young girls. Everything goes on so openly and publicly, looks as if all gentlemen saloon keepers belong to the same protectors as our glorious police.</p>
   <p>That action has enraged everybody against saloon keepers in whose places all kinds of criminals are carrying knives and commit murders, but much worse than the criminals are those in the saloons who are killing our young generation morally.</p>
