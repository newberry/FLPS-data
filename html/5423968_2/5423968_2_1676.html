   <p>Walter Damowicz, 4405 So. Honore Street, a non-union packing house worker, barely escaped a mob of strikers and strike sympathizers yesterday. The mob followed him to his home and made an attempt to break down the closed doors. Damowicz fired a shot into the crowd from a window. Mrs. Sophia Wyka, 4408 So. Wood Street (sic), was wounded while passing across the street.</p>
