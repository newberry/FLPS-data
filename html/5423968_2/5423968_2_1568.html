   <p>"Dear Brothers: We have organized a branch union of the Painters' Brotherhood for all our co-workers of the painters' profession. Those smaller independent painters, who have not as yet joined, are invited to come to our meeting, March 3, in Lisztewnik's Hall, 589 Dickson Street, at 7 P. M. The initiation fee is so small that everybody, no doubt, can pay it; it is only two dollars. After the next meeting it will be raised to ten dollars. So take advantage of this opportunity, and come to the meeting and sign up.</p>
   <p>The Administration.</p>
