   <p>For a long time we have felt the absence of a Polish hotel in our city of Chicago. A vast number of our fellowmen who arrive in our great city, mainly these not knowing the English language, are forced to wander through the night about our city, which is a great inconvenience. Toward these many discomforts two prominent Poles rush to our rescue. Mr. S. Rokosz and W. Jaworewski decided to establish a big hotel at 732-34 Milwaukee Avenue. The present building will be constructed. Work upon this structure is already in progress. May 20th will be the grand opening. The structure will receive the wonderful name of "Wawel Hotel". The two above-mentioned citizens hope that their fellowmen will joyfully welcome this great news, - the news of a new and respectable Polish enterprise, and above all won't abstain from supporting it. Everyone will be serviced quickly, courtecusly and in Polish. </p>
