   <p>A timely reminder to the public in the approach of the deadline for the income tax returns. Not many weeks remain. The days slip by, and before anyone is aware of it, March 15 will be staring him in the face.</p>
   <p>Every businessman having a turnover of five thousand dollars or more, or if single persons earn at least fifteen hundred dollars a year, or married persons earn three thousand, five hundred dollars, as well as corporations, all are compelled by law to fill out and send in income tax return blanks, whether they have means to pay or not. Violators are subject to a heavy penalty as designated by law.</p>
   <p>Many among the public, especially small businessman, are under the impression that they do not have to file returns because they have a turnover of ten <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>thousand dollars and an expenditure of nine thousand dollars a year, leaving them one thousand dollars net profit, or perhaps may have a deficit. In this respect, although they are not subject to pay anything, they must make out the returns. The same applies to a married individual who has children, who are minors, and earns at least three thousand, five hundred dollars. This also applies to home owners, who receive upwards from five thousand dollars income from their property a year. Despite the fact that after paying taxes, interest on mortgages, etc., the profit is below the stipulated sum, he must file his claim, according to law.</p>
   <p>Penalty for not complying with the law is severe. Not only is a heavy fine imposed, but also a prison sentence. It does not pay to be negligent in such an important matter. It is much better to engage an attorney or an accountant to take care of the tax filing.</p>
   <p>Many small businessmen are also under the impression that they do not have to keep any books, and as a result they try to fill out their tax blanks from memory. Although the law does not prescribe any particular method or system <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of keeping books, every <span class="gap">[gap]</span> must keep <span class="gap">[gap]</span> kind of record, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> order to safeguard himself in the event that a Government tax inspector calls to check the tax return blank with the books. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> also under the impression that the Government is <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and as a result they do <span class="gap">[gap]</span> their tax returns. But they are under a false impression. This may <span class="gap">[gap]</span> out for the first, second, and third time, but sooner or later they <span class="gap">[gap]</span> pay for this tenfold. The Government has thousands of inspectors who are specialists <span class="gap">[gap]</span> uncovering the falsity of statements and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> tax <span class="gap">[gap]</span> caught in the net, he pays a heavy penalty for all the years.</p>
   <p>Having been in a Government office for five years, and finally as a chief in a Chicago tax department, I came across many cases where the dodgers paid and paid. From actual experience, I know that it does not pay to neglect the filing of Federal income tax returns. I know of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> person in particular who overlooked or neglected to do this and believe <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, this person not only paid heavy penalties, but had to engage an expert accountant and attorney to get things cleared up.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>I wish to stress one more fact. There are many people who wait until the last minute to file their tax returns. The best time is right now. Although the Government tax blanks are not yet in the mails, I see no reason for delay. Now is the time to prepare and take account of earned incomes. Now is the time to have your accountant or bookkeeper assist you. He has the time now, and as a result, he can prepare a comprehensive statement. With this assistance, one can easily fill out the tax blanks. Later, he may be so busy that it will not be possible to go through every detail. Because of the scarcity of time to meet the deadline, mistakes can easily be made.</p>
   <p>For the convenience of the public, I have opened a bureau in rooms 1420-1422 of the Marquette Building, 120 South Dearborn Street, telephone Franklin 5436. I maintain a staff of competent bookkeepers under my supervision. They are experts at filing tax returns, claims, and filing various other financial papers in Government matters.</p>
