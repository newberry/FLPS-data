   <p>Slowly, very slowly humanitarian ideals spread among the larger part of humanity. Through pages of history like a black thread runs a futile struggle of our pioneer humanitarians for a complete abolition of corporal punishment. Legislative bodies of many civilized communities, in accordance to their broadening views, in regard to transgression, application or corporaral punishment in general especially whipping, at first made exceptions to persons of certain social standing, later of certain age, etc.</p>
   <p>In many countries whipping or flogging has been abolished entirely. In the very complicated task of bringing up of young generation, corporal punishment, unfortunately has not yet been universally condemned. On the contrary, there are advocates that without corporal punishment, it is impossible to bring up children; that in many cases the fear of physical and shame connected with it may act as a deterent for the child against improper behavior, but is it really so? Above all in bringing up children we are confronted with something unusually complicated, enigmatically changeable, and that is the sould of the child.</p>
   <p>The soul of a child is like a sea of unfathomable riddles and mysteries. Psychometrio studies, investigation in pedagogical pathology, observations of pedagogs and psychologists lifted an edge of the mysterious curtain which veils the child's world. Seldom do we obey voices urging us to individualize character and abilities of the child, to build welfare homes for feeble-minded or morally undeveloped children. We prefer to settle the matter by corporal punishment instead of applying other measures. Do we show through that signs of laziness, and unfitness in dealing with children's conduct?</p>
   <p>Apparently it seems to be the quickest way of settling the problem but not the best. It is easier to cut the knot than untangle it. Indeed, we should care for a whole thread of that wonderful yarn which is the sould of the child. It is easier to induce the baby to sleep by rocking it than to take such care of it that it should fall asleep by itself. That simple process of settling children's transgressions by means of corporal punishment; some try to justify by overcrowded schoolroom, shortage of teachers or lack of time; struggle for daily bread on the parents' side. But we can not explain our faults that way. Whipping is above all a sign of brutality, the law of might. The advantage of the strong over the weak, the desire to defeat the second by the first; which together with our egoism constitutes our moral texture and with which training struggles with great intensity. The child notices the physical supremacy. It is worthy of notice that in a country where the law "of the fist" (faustrecht) had been cultivated and maintained.</p>
   <p>A guide book on hygiene had been published. In the last edition by Professor Baginski of Berlin, Germany we find instructions as to how and where we should strike the child. The child is indeed not indifferent to corporal punishment. We should realize that the person administering corporal punishment may in case of anger cause a serious injury to the child.</p>
   
   <p>Not having the regular whipping rod or other instrument of punishment in use anything that we can lay our hands on. The famous psychiatrist Professor Kraft Ebin in his Sexual Pathology states that "teachers of Psychopathy, while administering whipping and causing pain to the children, experienced special feeling of sensual satisfaction."</p>
   <p>Moll in Seitschrift for Padagogische Psychologie states "that whipping on the buttock caused in some children sexual irritation with sexual satisfaction."</p>
   <p>We do not care so much about the physical injury of the child; but his mind is also affected in its fundamental make-up. The child's pride and self-respect is also affected. The child will react on suffering. In nay case the child will not return love for punishment. In Berlin, Germany, I say many times bulletins posted on the streets; asking the runaway children to return home. "Haenschen, Kaehrezurick Alles Fergessen." The cause for leaving home was whipping. Sometimes whipped children even commit suicide. Dealing with children we should realize that we might be dealing with great beings whom we are not able to understand; therefore we ought not to try such experiments without expecting a punishment for it. We also have to take under consideration that whipping affects not only the whipper it also affects the whipped. It subdues in him gentle feeling, awakens his lower animal instincts; with which culture had been combating for centuries. Therefore we feel sorry for a community (society) whose educators resort to such measures as whipping, and whose pedagogs are not broad-minded and cannot look into the heart.</p>
