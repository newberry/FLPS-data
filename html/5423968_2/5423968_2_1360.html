   <p>Political intercourse with our neighbors to the south, the Latin republics, is of great significance to the United States. Therefore, it is necessary that we guide and conduct all our actions in a most friendly and non-provocative manner. The recent Nicaraguan incident, which was brought to light by the department of commerce, was not a very friendly gesture. Our trade with the Latin republics was, by far, greater than that of Europe; for instance, in the past year, our trade with Mexico amounted to $169,000,000., exceeding by $17,000,000, our trade with France. Our trade with Central America amounted to $48,000,000; or, it was four times greater than our trade with Russia. Our trade with Cuba amounted to $250,000,000., exceeding our trade with Germany by $52,000,000. Our trade in the West Indies amounted to $307,000,000., or, was four times greater than with Belgium. Our South American trade amounted to $567,000,000.</p>
   <p>Our government, in its intercourse with our neighbors to the south, is perpetrating political blunders that lead to the loss of markets for such great quantities of goods, cannot expect gratitude from its people.</p>
