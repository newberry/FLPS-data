   <p>I attended the last meeting of the Polish Patriotic Organization on May 29, with the definite intention of discussing a certain project. Against these strong resolutions there stood yet stronger opposition. The members held a discussion regarding certain suggested improvements relative to some proposed changes to be made in the activity of the well-known Dramatic Circle at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>These are important matters, I thought, and seeing that by a lively debate, things were beginning to take a turn for the better, I sat peacefully. The late time of the evening caused the adjournment of the meeting at ten o'clock; hence, nothing remained for me to do but to dream of reviving a once-proposed <span class="page-break">2</span>project. Nature endowed me with an abundant perseverance, and, because of this, silence for a duration of a month might prove detrimental to my health. I am therefore requesting the Dziennik Chicagoski to extend its courtesy to me by announcing my future appearance at this same organization. It will be then that I shall call the previously proposed project to the attention of the members. I also ask of them to express their opinion and also to make known their future debates.</p>
   <p>My particular interest is in recalling the project of conducting regular programs, whether for the members of the Polish Patriotic Organization or for a more extensive audience. The committee on education was entrusted with this activity, but this young group gives little evidence of life, due, perhaps, to the rains and.....cold weather. Public programs are, nevertheless, of great importance and of proven benefit. They were introduced among the Germans of Chicago and are patronized considerably. They are held in the Polish societies <span class="page-break">3</span>of our homeland, in Upper Silesia. The Polish newspaper, Faith And The Nation, informs us that programs have been given in the Polish Merchants' Society, in Wroclawa, Poland, for the past thirty years and this activity has been maintained even to the present time. The Poles in America are in need of enlightenment based upon sound education. Lack of time does not permit everyone to acquire an education. Not every hardworking laborer, burdened sometimes with large families, can afford to purchase educational literature. Everyone, however, has at least a half hour of time per week in which to attend a program. After each such narrative, written in an understandable manner and, if need be, clarified in sketch form on the school's blackboard, different debates of a more difficult type could be developed. Even if only two or three new facts were learned and remembered after each such program, it is only natural to believe that a great deal more would be known in a period of a year than was known at the time these programs began. A person could submit one question, in writing, after every lecture, an answer to which <span class="page-break">4</span>would be given at the following meeting. The program itself could suggest the material for such questions. Articles found in the newspapers which are not too clear may also serve as excellent material for such questions.</p>
   <p>Personally, I am not in favor of holding these programs in a close hall after spending an entire week in a humid shop. We could go en masse to Humboldt Park, for example, where every flower, every tree offers a topic for an excellent educational discussion or for a regular composition. Who will sponsor these programs, these discussions? I do not doubt but that those interested in the social affairs of our people will willingly sponsor such activities, whether they be dramatic productions or patriotic programs.</p>
   <p>The Polish Patriotic Organization has people who are interested in educational affairs. Would they refuse to "break bread" with their younger brethren?</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>There can be no doubt of their willingness and I know that they want us to turn to them. A request is, therefore, made to the members of the Polish Patriotic Organization to express their opinion on this measure, to state sincerely their views on the revival of this project.</p>
