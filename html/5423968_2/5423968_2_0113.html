   <p>Reading from time to time we meet the whole truth, and our attention is called to the question of education. Education is of great significance to our community; therefore, it brings forth a great deal of discussion and exchange of ideas on this subject. I hope that I may be permitted to give my advice on this question, the good of Catholic schools, and what the Roman Catholic church stands for, and what are its aims.</p>
   <p>For what reason can we demand Polish parochial schools? In these schools only, are we able to build a strong hope and prepare the growth and progress of our younger generations; this is the main object of all parochial schools. The first thing we ask is - What is a school of confessed creed? To build up comprehension the Catholic schools must first learn what religion is, particularly the Roman Catholic religion. The Catholic religion is not only the sensible persuasion and collection of teachings and writings, but it is constituted by Jesus Christ, the originator of the Catholic church. We Catholics are classified as citizens of two great movements, the church and the state, each of which has its own function. From these two authorities we often have trouble and discussions.</p>
   <p>Children are brought into this world in the midst of Christianity and they gain guidance and care from three sources - the church, and the state; the third source is, naturally, the parents. This is followed by schools: the first is the public schools; then follow the Polish elementary schools, where the children are educated and guided naturally, by the three sources mentioned above. The law demands that the parents should choose their children's schools with consideration and not let the idea of education be broken down by the children.</p>
   <p>In the present state of civilization, it is strictly a necessity for children to carefully respect religion; to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic. The parents often refuse the children an education and the state has to take drastic steps to force the parents to abide by this law. The second important matter is that it is up to the state to see that there are enough schools, thus avoiding bad feelings among the people; to seek the moral support of these people in the upkeep of the schools; to teach the children to respect their government; and to attend school regularly.</p>
   <p>The third important fact is the church and the upkeep of Catholic schools: the parents becoming members of the parish, supporting all its movements, attending its bazaars and picnics, thus helping financially in their upkeep; their children attending Catholic schools; learning the teachings of Christ from the Bible, learning the catechism; and to read and write their native Polish tongue.</p>
   <p>The morals and intelligence of the children are brought before the eyes of the people. Morality is supported by religion, and religion was God's kind thought. All combined forms the foundation of the church.</p>
   <p>The children who are sent to Catholic schools from early childhood are the children that realize what the meaning of religion really is and are taught the meaning of morality and are constantly under the strict guidance of the sisters and reverend fathers. This is also true of the Catholic boarding schools, where the children are left for a year at a time and only after this period are they allowed to visit their parents. These schools cover only eight grades because of their tremendous expenses; they cannot expand enough to cover the four years of high school but it is the one ambition of all Roman-Catholic priests, sisters, and parents to see that this vision will some day become a reality. This is why the church is so strong and persistent and is working faithfully to see that all Polish Catholic children will have the same opportunities as those of the public schools.</p>
   <p>What are the Catholics striving for? Is it to show the state that the Pope, representing the Catholic religion, wants absolute control of these schools? The state never thought that religion would expand to such an extent that it would receive recognition from all other branches of learning. The church is the organizer of parochial schools. It teaches about suffering, mistreatments, and the good and evil of people living during the time of Christ, and this in turn is taught to our children attending parochial schools.</p>
   
   <p>What is the reason for Catholic schools? Are the more intelligent people in favor of these good intentions for our nationality? The teachings of prayer and the saying of the rosary are very essential, even to the non-believes because in the hour of death, they call to Almighty God to help them. This proves that although the non-believers denounce the Catholic religion, there comes a time in their lives when they pray to God for peace of mind.</p>
   <p>I am asking of you - Who among you knew and understood the method and system of continuing the teachings in our schools? Who strove to take it upon themselves to contribute to the upkeep of these schools that stand as a credit to humanity?</p>
   <p>The editors and publishers find it an easy task to complain and criticize the mistakes made in these schools, when they have nothing else to write about. Who among these so-called intelligent editors and publishers ever visited a Catholic school between the hours of 8 A.M. and 4 P.M., to study our system and method of teaching? The schools that the Polish National Alliance intends to build will have the best equipment, the highest grade of books, the best teachers, and will eventually surpass the public elementary schools. This will be done so that the eyes of all American people will be focused upon our progress, and our hearts set at peace for our great accomplishments.</p>
   <p>The church demands Catholic schools, not because the Pope or the priest demands them, but that clean-minded Catholic people are supporting this movement. This is also the reason why Catholic schools of different nationalities are being built in the United States. The money is donated by people who can see the good of continuing this sytem of education. May God bless all the people for their support and kind contributions to the needy cause - Christianity.</p>
