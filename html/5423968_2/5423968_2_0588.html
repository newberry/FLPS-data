   <p>More and more often we find in our Polish-American press, articles with a heading such as this: "Mrs. J. called her husband into court to get a divorce."</p>
   <p>"Mr. X. took into his home a boarder and now is going to court for a divorce."</p>
   <p>"Mrs. Y. disappeared in an unknown direction, taking with her all the money earned by her husband."</p>
   <p>And what does all this information prove? Nothing more than the fact that Polish men and women are being Americanized also in regard to divorce.</p>
   <p>Slowly but steadily, indissolubility of marriage is becoming lax, and because of this we write a few words using this as a theme.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>There are two essential properties of marriage. The first is unity which excludes polygamy and polyandry, that is, the plurality of wives or the plurality of husbands, and accordingly free and loose love. The second is indissolubility of marriage, so called because a valid marriage is lasting until death, be it on the one side or the other. If sometimes on the basis of a verdict of the church the two principals in marriage become divorced, this means that the church found in this case a marriage did not even exist, in other words, the marriage was invalid from its beginning.</p>
   <p>And again it is as if there were two columns of indispensable rules for a correct and successful marriage and these are: exclusive and mutual love, and loyalty. These are catechismal truths, based on the law of God; from these the church will never retreat because it cannot retreat nor can it compromise.</p>
   <p>There are many Catholics in name only. They are not acquainted with the true Catechism, or they know it but do not live up to it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But knowing a law and observing it so that you may derive benefits from it are two different matters. He who disagrees with the dictates of the church or his conscience does so without law and contradictory to law, therefore, you will always have exceptions. For this reason the thing for society to do, especially Polish society, is to hold on to principle. One should heed the Lord more than the people.</p>
   <p>The religious motives should be sufficient for a good Catholic and it would be very sad if one would have to appeal to innate motives in order to induce him to observe religious tenets. And what finally could be said if even these natural causes would not change his convictions.</p>
   <p>Now you know that there is no lack of such causes. Let us finally become convinced that the fulfillment of God's laws is for us an indispensable foundation for success in family and social life.</p>
   <p>If such things creep into married life, as for instance, lack of love, infidelity, unfounded suspicions, doubtful paternity, the famous triangle, flirtations, etc...can there be any talk about the personal success of married couples; about a successful home life? Bah! But society is made up of families that each year comes a smaller number of properly reared persons.</p>

   <p>It is a fact that wherever the theory of Malthus dominates knowingly unknowingly, the nation is gradually dying off. The nations had their brightest eras during the time when their young virtuous women were not skillful in disguising themselves, or were cynical salon courtesans; when their wives were as faithful as Penelope. The words of the covenant, "There was no good fortune in the home because there was none in the nation" will be still truer if we reverse them and say, "There will be no good fortune in the nation if there is none at home."</p>
   <p>The French people arrive to this conclusion in a way that is not according to catechism but nevertheless is a sensible way. One of their thoughts reads: "We sink in greater numbers if we are undermined; we will be saved by a pure indissoluble monogamy. Let us uplift the family and we will have peace in France."</p>
   <p>Do we wish our nation to be powerful in number and character? If so, let us remember the foundation of the nation is the family and marriage that is indissoluble and bound with love and loyalty.</p>
