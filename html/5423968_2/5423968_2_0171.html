   <p>There is a lot of excitement going on in the College.</p>
   <p>The examinations will be held in a few days, and on June 29 graduating exercises will occur. A public entertainment will be given by the students in the evening, consisting of singing, recitations, and speeches.</p>
   <p>Two short comedies will also be presented, one in Polish and one in English. We hope that as in years past our friends will attend these exercises. A detailed program will soon be published.</p>
   <p>Tickets at 50 cents, 35 cents, and 10 cents may be purchased from the College students.</p>
   <p>We also wish to announce that St. Stanislaus College will be considerably enlarged for the next school year. Boarding facilities will be made available for out-of-town students by Mr. Ignatius Kowalski, a teacher, and several new professors have been engaged for the College.</p>
   <p>The rector, the Reverend John Kruszynski, will remain in the same position. A professionally trained teacher, he gives the greatest assurance that this institution will continue to expand.</p>
