   <p>"The article reprinted in yesterday's edition of Dziennik Chicagoski from the Omaha Bee forces me to explain that I cannot be held responsible for all newspaper exaggerations in respect to the beet-planting project with which I am associated. Everybody knows the methods pursued by the American press--in order to 'boom' a certain matter, newspapers excite the imagination of the people and then publish the most fantastic ideas.</p>
   <p>"Personally, I am usually responsible for what I sign, and at the moment my activity closes with the appeal printed in the Kuryer of Milwaukee, entitled 'An Appeal to the Polish Farmers,' which was also a subject of editorial comment in your Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>"At any rate, it is true that I received an invitation from the Chamber of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Commerce to appear in Omaha at a meeting sponsored by the Nebraska Beet Sugar Association, to be held on Monday, December 18. And because since childhood I understand the planting of beets and the manufacture of sugar from them, as the members of the committee are convinced from conversations held with them previously, therefore I was invited by them to speak at this meeting to urge the American farmers to plant beets on a wider scale.</p>
   <p>"At the proper time I shall also visit another section of eastern Nebraska with a committee of colonists, to consider the proposition made to them to purchase land for beet-planting purposes. It is therefore evident that the project is progressing, and if it does not please somebody's fancy, then I judge, the simplest thing to do would be not to engage in it.</p>
   <p>[Count] Henryk Lubienski."</p>
   <p>Endeavoring to explain the matter in all ways, the above article by H. Lubienski still is not entirely satisfactory. Simply to blame the press <span class="page-break">\3</span>for exaggerating is a brave thing to do but is not convincing. Even exaggeration has a source. We are convinced that the American newspapers would not willingly publish falsehoods, and in this case the exaggeration is based on the appeal issued by the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>eet Sugar Association and the words of Commissioner Utt. As to the advice of not engaging in this matter, we feel it is the duty of a newspaper to take an interest in every public affair that touches upon the public welfare. This matter will be closed next week, when we will publish our final judgment based on material gathered by us.</p>
