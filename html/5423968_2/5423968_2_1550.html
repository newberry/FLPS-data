   <p>The union situation throughout the world is not a pleasant one, and the situation here in America is no better than elsewhere. Here, also, all sorts of opposition groups spring up in the trade unions. In fact, scarcely two weeks ago in Chicago the case of several "sluggers," whose sole occupation was attacking laborers of the opposite group and beating them mercilessly, came up in the courts. Some of the opposing sluggers were killed. This illustrates the savagery and actual criminality of those who want to rule the laborers secretly. When they cannot convince with words, arguments, or promises, they resort to revolvers, bloodshed, and crime, in order to force the laborer by means of threats and fear into absolute obedience and submission.</p>
   <p>Unions are a great thing--they are the laborer's wall of defense against ruthless capitalism; but there should be no disharmony in the unions, there should <span class="page-break">\2</span>be no mutually antagonistic groups. The strength of organized labor is needed for the battle with its real enemy--capitalism--and should not be dissipated in internal dissension, since this weakens the organization. The capitalists rejoice when laborers fight and kill one another; it is decidedly to their advantage, and frequently they bribe all sorts of agitators to sow discord among the laborers and to break up their organizations. Only in the complete solidarity and unanimity of the laborers is there any hope of conquering all-powerful capitalism.</p>
