   <p>The leader of the American Slavic medical expedition to Serbia, Dr. Rudisjicinsky sent a report, on the day when the expedition entered Serbia, to the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) on the activities, to the end of last year, of the physicians, Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky, Dr. Guca, Dr. Kara, and the nurses, Mrs. Guca, Miss Hampel, and Mr. Klepal.</p>
   <p>The group took care of 205 wounded and sick in the Engineers' Barracks in Dzevdzeli from November 12 to 16; 525 in the Grad Hospital in Skoplja from November 16 to December 31, in addition to 282 sent to the Engineers' Barracks from Bitolje during the same time.</p>
   <p>Only 63 of their patients died during the whole time, a comparatively small <span class="page-break">2</span>number if we consider that the sick and wounded usually arrive in a very serious condition. The physicians performed, during that time, 261 serious operations and a large number of minor ones. Among the most difficult ones were 3 trepanations, 4 resections of the tibia--two patients died--10 amputations of limbs attacked by gangrene--two patients died--many other amputations, drainings, 156 settings of simple and compound fractures, etc.</p>
   <p>The report says that the expedition took along from America 2,737 dinars' worth of materials, apparatus, and bandages.</p>
