   <p>Bohemians at a mass-meeting in "Telocveine Jednoty Sokol" (Gymnastic Society Sokol) Hall, selected a committee composed of Mr. J. Padecke, Klenhy and Kozak, to solicit and receive contributions for the benefit of Southerners stricken with Yellow Fever. According to the report, it will require at least $1,000,000 more to care for those now stricken by the fever.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that the Bohemian people will gladly contribute to this cause; all contributions will be publicly acknowledged.</p>
