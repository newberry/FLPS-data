   <p>In these days of mounting prices, it is advantageous to live in a neighborhood where it is possible to partly escape the high cost of living. There are fertile patches of land in Brookfield which are being sold in half-acre lots by Anton Vanek, 3707 West 26th Street, and J. F. Pavlicek, 6145 West 22nd Street. The lots are situated along the Desplaines River, and may be reached by the La Grange streetcar. Vegetables can be grown there and poultry raised.</p>
