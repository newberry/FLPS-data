   <p>The meeting of noncitizens, held last Friday at the Farragut Public School, was very interesting. More than three hundred of our countrymen came to hear the representatives of the Naturalization Bureau who explained the reasons why citizenship papers were not issued and still have not been issued to the Bohemians. Inasmuch as there are many of your readers who were not able to attend this meeting and yet are anxious to be informed upon this subject. I shall bring to your attention the main points of the explanations given by the chief inspector of the Naturalization Bureau of Chicago, Mr. F. J. Schlotfeldt, who explained why at present the second citizenship papers are not being issued to our countrymen, and who also answered many questions from the audience.</p>
   <p>The matter was explained as follows: Originally, no citizenship papers were issued during the war to foreigners from Austria-Hungary and Germany. Afterward this regulation was changed to the effect that those persons who took <span class="page-break">\2</span>out their first citizenship papers more than two years before war was declared against the country of which the applicants were subjects could obtain citizenship papers. This means that a Bohemian who took out his first citizenship papers before December 15, 1915, can obtain his second papers now just as before the war. But a countryman who took out his first papers after that date cannot receive citizenship papers now, but must wait.....</p>
   <p>At this opportunity I call the attention of your readers to the citizenship classes held in the Farragut Public School. After Friday's meeting, fiftyfive of those who were present registered in these classes, but we still have room for more of our countrymen. Last year more than two hundred of our countrymen attended these classes, and we hope to have at least as many now. The classes are free and are held twice a week. The teacher, Miss Marenka Hajek, teaches every Tuesday and Friday, and the writer of these lines teaches Fridays only. The English language and political forms of American government are taught. Besides, we help everyone fill out his application for secend citizenship papers correctly. Those who wish to apply for second papers should <span class="page-break">\3</span>bring their first papers this Friday. The classes are held from 7:30 to 9:30 P. M. at the Farragut Public School, Spaulding Avenue and 24th Street. Whoever wishes further information and explanation about citizenship is invited to come to our classes any Friday evening, and I shall be glad to furnish the necessary advice and help.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Bohumil Kral, teacher.</p>
