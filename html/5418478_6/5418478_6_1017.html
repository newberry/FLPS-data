   <p>The Vzdelavaci Spolek Ceskoslovenska Republika (Czechoslovak Republic Cultural and Educational Society) has made arrangements for a splendid national ball in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>The ball is to take place next Sunday, October 29, in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and Albany Avenue. It will be a festive entertainment in every respect, and we are sure that the friends of this Spolek will attend it in the greatest numbers possible. The Spolek has been very active since its foundation....and deserves to be patronized by our people. Mr. J. Bezemek's orchestra will furnish the dance music....Doors open at 3 P.M.</p>
