   <p>Chicago had its pilgrimage yesterday. It was different from the pilgrimages known in the old country. Those who went yesterday were either in deep sorrow, for relatives lost in the catastrophe, or in warm sympathy for those who lost their dear ones.....</p>
   <p>Due to the interest and kindness of Mr. A. J. Cermak, the Chief Bailiff of the City of Chicago, a Bohemian section was set apart in the Armory and will remain so until all corpses are identified or as long as there are any missing in the families or our countrymen.....</p>
   <p>Whoever wishes to communicate by phone with the Bohemian Section in the Armory should call "Haymarket 6000, Bohemian Section". There will always be <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a Bohemian-speaking countryman on duty there.....</p>
   <p>Mr. A. J. Cermak and Alderman Jonn Toman of the Thirty-fourth Ward have done a great deal of very useful work helping the bereft all day yesterday and today.....</p>
