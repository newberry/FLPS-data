   <p>The club Ceska Vlast (Bohemian Home) held its annual banquet on New Year's Eve in Ledecky's Hall, 26th Street and Springfield Avenue. This was a private party, but all those who attended were glad that they came. Although the club arranges several entertainments every year, everybody looks forward to the annual banquet. The committee took care to have only the best food and drinks served.....The instrumental and vocal numbers on the musical program were considered very good by all those present.</p>
   <p>After the banquet, the committee took up a collection for the benefit of the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). The sum of eighteen dollars, which was collected, has been deposited with us.</p>
