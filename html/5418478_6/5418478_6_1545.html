   <p>At 9 A.M., the erection committee and the architect gathered before the monument, also Messrs. Sedlacek, Polivka, and Benes. The chairman of the West Parks Commissioners, Mr. William Kolacek, was also present. Each of them spoke a few ardent, patriotic words. Then the box containing copies of various books and publications (list given) was placed into the pedestal, and the members of the erection committee placed the first trowel of mortar on it.
