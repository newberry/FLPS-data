   <p>It is true, we can be great Bohemians and patriots upon pompous occasions, but are we such in minuteness? Indeed we are not, let us say it to ourselves candidly. For instance, we maintain Bohemian schools, we send our children to them, wishing that they shall, learn to read and write Bohemian. This is praisworthy, to be sure, because it is not only our national duty but it may serve as a practical advantage for our children at sometime. That man, who is better educated than the other, is always better off and more respected. With what pride heaves the breast of that father, who at some time visits the school and hears his child reading Bohemian. Often this father is a respected businessman, and has his countrymen to thank for his material success. Now let us examine his place of business; we begin on the outside, by reading the sign-boards. Sometimes it almost staggers a person the way our Bohemian is murdered on them.</p>
   <p>It is a shame, actually a shame and to good Bohemians it serves not only as ridicule but often is insulting to their feelings. And if we enter a place of business, a genuine Bohemian place of business, we must be prepared to hear every other language spoken, except Bohemian.</p>

   <p>Only after we announce ourselves as Bohemians, are we spoken to in Bohemian, but how! To be sure, this only concerns some of the business places, not all of them, but it should not be thus anywhere. Or when we attend a Bohemian entertainment, what language do we hear spoken there? Only the old people speak Bohemian among themselves, but the young people, their children? Well, go and listen to them, surely you will admit the truth of the assertion, that our youth speaks mostly English at these entertainments. This is not right, decidedly not. The old people should advise the youth and impress upon their hearts that they should entertain themselves in their company in the language of their parents, then we could call ourselves true patriots. Let no one have any fear, that because their child speaks good Bohemian it will not learn English. There is no need to be apprehensive on that account because the child will more easily learn the English language and will never forget it.</p>
