   <p>There are very few business houses or stores where coupons for the contest sponsored by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) are not obtainable now. Some of the merchants even give two coupons instead of one with every ten-cent purchase.....</p>
   <p>We regret to have to record that some businessmen, although they have shown their good will by buying large numbers of coupons from the Association, are nevertheless not eager enough to distribute them among their customers. Instead the coupons are left in the drawers. Yet, these businessmen could do a great favor to some of the purchasers by presenting them with the coupons, for there are beautiful prizes to be distributed..... It is the intention of the Association to spread the movement for the contest among all of our people.....</p>
