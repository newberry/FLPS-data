   <p>We have never doubted that the Czech Catholics are not sincere American-Czech patriots, neither that they ardently desire to see the old homeland liberated, and that they are ready for any sacrifice to help towards that end. If there be anyone who takes a skeptical attitude to this statement, he would have convinced himself in the mass meeting of the Czech Catholic Alliance in the Pilsen Park pavilion last night.....Over two thousand men and women thronged the hall.....Czech national and folk songs reverberated through the air.</p>
   
   <p>The resolution by which the Catholics gave expression of their willingness to cooperate wholeheartedly with the Czech National Alliance shall forever be a glorious page in their history.</p>
   <p>Monsignor F. Boubal, honorary chairman, opened the meeting, and after some introductory words on the purpose of the gathering, he presented Mr. Jan Straka, a well-known Czech Catholic patriotic worker, who urged those present to support our aims with all their power. The Reverend Oldrich Zlamal, of Cleveland, Ohio, was the main speaker. His subject was "Our actions for liberation." His patriotic work is appreciated by all Czechs of America, among whom he travels and preaches all over the country.</p>
   <p>"The stress which I lay upon the unification of all Czech organizations of America as an absolute necessity would have been viewed as radical but six months ago; close cooperation among those societies would not have been considered attainable. Many attempts in this direction have come to naught, and the idea of united action never took root. We are people from diverse camps, and of heterogeneous thoughts," the Reverend Zlamal began, "nevertheless we are the children of one nation, and we harbor the same national ideals in our hearts--the longing for freedom and independence. This ideal takes on different hues, according to the atmosphere in which each of us moves.....</p>
   <p>"As long as the United States kept outside the European conflict, and entertained diplomatic relations with Germany and Austria, the pursuit of the work for the liberation of the Czechs and Slovaks proved very difficult.....By the declaration of War, the situation was suddenly and essentially changed, and with it our movement steps into a new phase. At that time, the American-Czechs were looking towards London, Paris, and Petrograd (Petersbourg) for help. But at this instant, however, we are turning towards Washington. Now we are upon our own ground. President Wilson has declared that there can be no peace before the rule of the two bloodthirsty Kaisers is overthrown, and their countries will be governed by men of democratic principles.</p>
   
   <p>"Washington looks upon our movement today as a revolutionary one.....The President, himself, is deeply concerned, and informs us of his personal opinion about our aims. He shows a deep interest in them. The more insistent we grow about our rights, the more welcome are we in Washington, for the Czechs and Slovaks are together with the United States in the combat against Germany. They are even more conscientious in their intentions than the Americans themselves, for they have an additional cause--the liberation of their old homeland. The primary causes for our readiness to fight are: First, our American citizenship, the other, our effort to win back the motherland.</p>
   <p>"We should like to see martial law established against all persons who try to damage our cause.....We ought to make this law stand above ourselves. Let us put on record every one of our newspapers, whether issued by churches or by freethinking societies, and also the actions of all our civic organizations. Let all of us go on record and declare frankly whether we wish united political action, whether we are willing to avoid partisan or factional friction, whether we are ready to do all this for the sake of the rights of our old homeland. If we are a wideawake nation, instead of a mass of brainless people, we have to introduce discipline into our national life, and show the healthy core of our nation. We have to find the Czech newspapers, associations, men from the intelligentsia, priests, ministers, and leaders, who will be able by the aid of our own martial law to smother all restive elements, and who will set the mark of Cain upon every one to whom petty quarrels are dearer than sacred national harmony."</p>
   <p>The speaker quoted Jaroslav Vrchlicky, the Czech poet, who said in essence that "everyone should march behind his own plough while keeping covered in his bosom whatever creed he may have."</p>
   <p>The speaker continued: "Our political actions must be coordinated. There are bills to be submitted to Congress now, demanding that the liberation of the Irish and the Polish people be made a condition for peace in future negotiations. The Czech question will also be dealt with. What impression, I ask you, would it give Congress if one day a delegation from one Czech organization, 'in the name of seventy-five per cent of the Czechs', came to ask for consideration of our Czech national rights--and the next day another delegation from a different Czech organization, also 'in the name of seventy-five per cent of the Czechs', appeared to request the identical recognition? It would mean a shameful admission of our own disjunction. I, therefore, appeal to you that while keeping your diverse partisan organizations intact, you may undertake political action in one united body only. This body should be governed by a National Council, which alone should represent it officially.</p>
   <p>"Let me touch upon a painful subject now, about the collection of funds. A few months ago, I found in the list of donors for the Polish cause an item of $135,000, the gift of an unnamed Polish patriot. This is an enormous amount. ....That Polish patriot knew what aid meant to the destitute populace of burning villages in his old homeland. Happy is the nation to whom was given a man of pure and tender feeling as he! There are not as many Czechs in America as are Poles, and they may not be as rich. Yet there are a number of America-Czechs whose fortunes are estimated from a million down to several thousand dollars. None of them has made an appearance yet, none of them has donated one tenth of his fortune for the starving women and children in the old country. Our forebears look down upon them with shame in their hearts. Our wealthy men have not given anything worthwhile as yet. The money donated by them for the sake of the good cause is not worth mentioning. They have not given as much as they waste in one single week on parties and entertainment for their friends.</p>
   <p>"We have little hope to obtain money in thousands from anybody. We must, therefore, rely upon canvassing among whose who earn their living by the sweat of the brow.....Every country in Europe has become the object of sympathy. Only our impoverished people, ransacked and pillaged by the Prussians, have not found their benefactor as yet. Instead of helping, we American-Czechs dismiss and abandon them with cruel words: 'Serves you right; it was almost impossible to get along with you in Bohemia!' They have sinned, these poor unfortunates, true enough. But we American-Czechs, with our stomachs well filled, also sin against God and our neighbors!</p>
   <p>"....Your have read of the indescribable misery in which hundreds of thousands of our poor children are living and perishing, of abandoned wives, tottering old men, and young ones maimed in the War. You have read recently in the St. Louis Hlas (Voice of St. Louis) a true report of the cruelties perpetrated by a barbaric soldiery against Czech women and maidens, of the War loans squeezed from the pockets of the Czechs by force. You have read hundreds of private communications, published in our papers, depicting the unexampled starvation of the laboring class in Czech cities, the lack of clothing and medical care, and the fields that are barren now. Yet, there are people among us who dare say: 'I won't give anything; I don't know what is in store for me right here in this country'. We do not know what may seize upon us, indeed, but we are sure that the direst possible want in this country would be called prosperity in Bohemia now!....</p>
   <p>"....I call on you, wealthy Czechs! Give your hundred dollar notes, and you, small workingmen, give your nickels and dimes. I call on you, Czech Catholics to follow the example of Cleveland where the Czech community has decided to donate at least $5000 to be shared by the National Alliance of Czech Catholics and the Cyril and Methodius Fund....We should collect from Czech settlements more than $100,000. Then we could find the courage to look into martyred face of Jesus Christ, knowing that we are beginning to live up to His words: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself: So help us God!'"</p>
   <p>After this appeal by the Reverend Zlamal, another address, no less moving and permeating of genuine patriotic feeling, which was directed to the gathering by Mr. Hynek, editor of the St. Louis Hlas. Since the beginning of the World War, he has been working for the liberation of the old homeland. He began:</p>
   
   <p>"....I have been given the task of explaining to you whether or not the Czech nation has a right to liberty.....An enslaved nation does not really live. It is nothing but a toy in the hands of its overlords, and a source of gain for the other, the free nations.....We can observe this in the oppressed nations, and especially in our own Czech nation which is being beaten down, tyrannized, and enslaved by our terrible enemies and murderers, the Germans. Like Prometheus, we are shackled to the rock, while ferocious black eagles are eating out our eyes, tearing out our hearts, and slowly torturing us to death. Only the hope of the Czechs--that downtrodden people that they may see a day of resurrection, keeps a spark of life in them.....</p>
   <p>"Yet our nation is highly cultured, assiduous, gifted, filled with enthusiasm, and ardent admiration for everything good and beautiful. Its right place is among the really free nations only.....</p>
   <p>"'Was Rome or Hellas,' asked our poet, Svatopluk Cech, greater than our Czech homeland'? And have other small nations like the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, or Belgium more right to freedom than we? There are many among them who cannot compare in any respect with the achievements of the Czechs. Nevertheless we are happy in the fact that we do not have neighbors such as the Prussian and Viennese slaveholders. The selfish, tyrannical Germans, who guided by one of their philosophers; namely, Friedrich Nietzche, continue to shout 'Higher, still higher, superior people! God is dead, long live the German superman!'</p>
   <p>"The nation which has an overbearing, despotic neighbor is unhappy. Such a nation is the Czech nation, and for this reason it cannot ever enjoy real liberty.....we welcome, therefore, the opportunity offered by the World War for the liberation of our people. The Allies and President Wilson have promised to help us toward this end. A thousand thanks! With this promise, a new epoch in the history of the Czech people has begun.....</p>
   
   <p>"The Czech nation has a full right to liberty and self-determination. Like the Poles in Germany, the Czechs were forbidden in the so called 'closed German districts' of Bohemia to say the Lord's prayer in their language over the grave of a Czech mother.....God gave us the right to liberty, but the Kaiser, who defies God is robbing us of this right.....</p>
   <p>The last speaker of the evening was the Reverend Jan Rynda, archepiscopal councillor of St. Paul, Minn., a priest known all over the United States, and who, for twenty-five years has been guiding the destinies of the Czech settlement in St. Paul. The subject of his address was "The duty of the American-Czechs toward their new homeland". He enumerated the many benefits within the gift of the United States, reminding us at the same time of the gratitude we owe to this country, and admonishing us to show it now by loyally fulfilling our patriotic duties.....</p>
   
   <p>For lack of space this address will be printed in the next issue of this paper.</p>
   <p>An orchestra and a male sextet, directed by Professor Pribil, filled the musical program, and an apotheosis of Bohemia and Columbia was presented. All of these numbers contributed in a great measure to the dignity of the event, and to the patriotic atmosphere which pervaded the assembly.</p>
   <p>Toward the close of the evening, a resolution was passed unanimously in which was emphasized the necessity of cooperation between the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. Close contact in matters political and national was advocated. To achieve this end, a committee of six is to be formed, which will henceforth be called The Czech National Council (Ceska Narodni Rada) of which three members shall be of Czech National Alliance (Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni), and three of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics (Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku). They are to meet weekly.</p>
   <p>The resolution demands that "the foremost and only effort of the Czech National Council be bent toward a way for united action in all matters concerning the liberation of the old homeland". The transactions of the Council are to be published in all Czech papers.</p>
   <p>A telegram voicing the loyalty of the Americans of Czech extraction was sent from the meeting to President Wilson. Byvali Cechove ....(Bohemians there were once....) sung by the sextet, and America by the entire assembly, closed the evening.</p>
