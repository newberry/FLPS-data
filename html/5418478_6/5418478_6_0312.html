   <p>A meeting for the purpose of organizing a permanent committee for the relief of the unfortunate victims of the Saturday catastrophe is called for 2:30 P. M. today, in the hall of Sokol Pilsen on Ashland Avenue and 18th Street. Among the victims are a large number of our countrymen, and some families have lost their providers or supporters. There will be collections organized throughout the city of Chicago for these victims, and our nation, to which a large percentage of the victims belong, must not lag behind other nationalities. Therefore, it is the purpose of the undersigned to gather together at this meeting and discuss the steps that should be taken for the relief of our countrymen who are affected. All countrymen are invited who are willing to help us either by donations or by work. In most cases, financial help will be needed, but in others legal assistance, etc., may be required. Let all those who consider it their national duty to help in this emergency, come and bring with them their friends.</p>
