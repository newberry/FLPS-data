   <p>The contest held under the auspices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Czech Benevolent Association) has received an effective stimulus from the Spolek Obchodniku Jihozapadni Strany (Southwest Side Businessmen's Association). This body is composed of merchants from the Czech district around Blue Island Avenue and West 18th Street. In a recent meeting held at Mr. Vilimovsky's house on Blue Island Avenue, they resolved to back the contest being conducted by the Czech Benevolent Association, the proceeds of which are to be used for charitable purposes. Business associations from other districts, as from West 26th and 47th Streets, are expected to follow this example.</p>
   <p>The assistance promised by the business interests assures the success of this charitable enterprise. The contest is a competition among customers of the businessmen for prizes which were donated to the Benevolent Association. One ticket is given away with every ten-cent purchase.</p>
