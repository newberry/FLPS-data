   <p>December is a month in which social activities are usually on the upswing. In reality, however,. this is only partially true. Leaders of our organizations are complaining that members show insufficient interest even when the time comes to elect their officers. There was a time when being elected to an office was considered an honor and not a burden of duties which the majority of members prefer to shirk.</p>
   <p>In the early days of our social activities the annual election meetings were crowded; they were considered important events. Members vied with each other for the prestige of being chosen, and frequently contests of this sort resulted in temporary antagonism. These competitions nevertheless served only to stimulate the members to increased activity. Election to an office was an ensign of confidence.</p>
   <p>Recent years have presented a different picture. Some of the annual meetings have not had enough members to constitute a quorum.</p>
   <p>Decrease in membership can be traced to the indifference of members; often enough to laziness on the part of the officers themselves. There is no reason why these conditions should not change for the better. If all members will duly attend the meetings this month and elect the right men, it will have a salutary effect upon our social activities throughout the year.</p>
