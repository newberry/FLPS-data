   <p>There were a great number of festivities in our city yesterday arranged in honor of George Washington's birthday. Among them, the celebration arranged in our John Huss Memorial deserves honorable mention. Because the month of February offers an opportunity to honor two national heroes--Abraham Lincoln and George Washington--the board of directors of the John Huss Memorial and the Matice Skolska (Council on Education) combined their forces to give an appropriate expression of the reverence in which we hold these two historical personalities. The celebration took place in the upper hall of the John Huss Memorial and began at eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
   <p>The program was opened by the thirteen-year-old pupil of the Maticni Skola (Council on Education School), Master Splichal, whose piano playing was well received by the audience. This was followed by student recitations, consisting <span class="page-break">\2</span>of both humorous and serious pieces.....</p>
   <p>The speaker of the evening was Mr. V. Petrzelka, who is also the spokesman for the Svobodna Obec (Free Thought Community). In a brief but lively address, Mr. Petrzelka described the periods in which the two great Americans lived; he drew an analogy between their times and ours; and, as is usual with Mr. Petrzelka, he took advantage of the opportunity to administer a few digs at the hypocrisy of our times. [Translator's note: The editor refers to prohibition by the above remark]. His speech was rewarded by prolonged thunderous applause, which proved that Mr. Petrzelka's words found a ready echo in the hearts of all who were present.</p>
   <p>In the front part of the hall near the motion-picture screen, the portraits of the two great Americans--Washington and Lincoln--were hung. The motion pictures, too, were appropriately chosen; they depicted scenes from the lives of the two Presidents. Other pictures showed scenes from the Yellowstone National Park. Commentaries on these pictures were given by Mrs. Marie Zeman, <span class="page-break">\3</span>who teaches in the Maticni Skola. She deserves mention for the great effort she expended in preparing the program. Everything went smoothly and that was certainly due to her work.....</p>
