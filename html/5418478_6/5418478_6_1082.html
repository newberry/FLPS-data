   <p>At the great meeting on Monday called by the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America), all those who were present, except three, authorized us, the Legionnaires, instantly to take steps together with the Sokols, toward the reorganization of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni Americe. In order that this may be accomplished, we publicly ask the executive committee of the Americka Obec Sokolska (American Sokol Union) and all of our leading groups of women, benevolent, and free thought associations having their headquarters in Chicago, to elect two representatives each and send their respective names to the secretary of the Legionnaires, J. Vosatko, 2225 Dayton Street. As soon as the names are received, a meeting will be called and further progress determined.</p>
