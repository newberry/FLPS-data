   <p>The Beseda [get-together] held last evening by the educational section of the Chicago group of the Sokol Community of America will long be remembered. The gathering met in the Sokol Chicago Hall, Kedzie Avenue near 24th Street. The affair was a gathering of friends and entirely informal as far as the Sokols were concerned. The public was invited for the purpose of enabling the Sokols to further their ideals. The Sokol organization, like all our organizations, must resort to publicity and propaganda to keep their ranks intact by acquiring new members, for their numbers are subject to depletion because of the abnormal conditions of the present times.</p>
   <p>For this reason the educational section devised a method by which members and visitors may enjoy an evening that offers educational values and entertainment, and also serves as an inducement for prospective members. A series of these gatherings will be held.</p>

   <p>The program consisted of popular music played by Mr. Husa's band; a talk by Dr. Jaroslav S. Vojan, who spoke in a reminiscent way of the city of Prague, Bohemia, his hometown; and an address by Dr. Rudis Jicinsky who told of the impressions he received at the All-Sokol rally, held in Prague in 1912. Moving pictures accompanied his talk as a splendid illustration of that grandiose Sokol meet. The evening was a pronounced success in every respect.</p>
