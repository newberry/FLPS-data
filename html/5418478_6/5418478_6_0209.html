   <p>Our fellow-countryman, grand old man, Mr. Frank J. Nemec, of Mt. Tabor, Wisconsin, undertook a collection in the name of Cesko Slovenska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society) which netted $126.20. The money will be contributed to the funds for the liberation of our old homeland.</p>
