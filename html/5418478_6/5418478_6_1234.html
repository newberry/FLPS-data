   <p>The establishment of the "Zupa Chicagska" (Chicago Group) of the "Americka Obec Sokolska" (American Solo Community), took place last Sunday afternoon in the hall of the Solo Chicago; authorized delegates of both the male and the female Solo organizations who formerly made up the dissolved "Narodni Jednota Sokolska" (National Solo Union) and the group Fuegner Tyrs, accomplished the formation of the Chicago group under the leadership of Anton J. Cermak, recently elected head of the American Solo Community. The Chicago Group represents one of the five main divisions of the American Solo Community. There were thirteen delegates each from the former National Solo union and the Group Fuegner Tyrs. The transactions took place in a smooth manner, and unanimity prevailed throughout the discussions.</p>

The four other divisions are the Eastern, Southern, Western, and the Pacific. All these are in principle governed by the supreme decisions of the American Solo Community.</p>
