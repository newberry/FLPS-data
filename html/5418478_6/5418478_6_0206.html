It would be desirable if another Czech group, one from the Liberal [Freethinkers'] camp would donate an equal amount to the Czech National Alliance. The amount might be even larger. Such a patriotic competition between the two camps would surely find the approval of every sincere Czech.</p>
   <p>[Translator's Note:- The Catholic and Liberal groups had been rather opposed to one another and did not have a common cause until the outbreak of the War in America, April 1917.]</p>
