   <p>p. 1.--Hardly a day passes without an inquiry in our office about the steps which must be taken to obtain citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>Before the enactment of the new law it was comparatively easy to become a citizen. Now, however, many an applicant is rejected simply because he has failed to comply with the regulations, and then he believes that he has been treated unjustly.</p>
   <p>In order to spare our countrymen such disappointments, we print a thorough explanation of the new law and also some of the most important questions which may be asked of the applicant.</p>
