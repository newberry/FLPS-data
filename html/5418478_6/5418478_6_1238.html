   <p>The executive committee of the American Solo community held a meeting in the home of Solo Chicago last night. The election of a successor to John Siman, who passed away last week, was the main issue to be considered. The session was opened by vice-president Dolezal who pointed to the services rendered to the Solo organizations by Mr. Anton Cermak and proposed him for the presidency. The election was unanimous. Mr. Cermak said that he hoped that the brotherhood among Sokols would not be a mere by-word, but that it would be upheld, in which endeavor the executive committee should be an example worthy to be followed. The president looks for enthusiastic support and not obstacles, as had been thrown in the path of the late president, Mr. Siman, who was hampered not only by lack of co-operation but actual opposition in his efforts. Not until after his death have John Siman's merits been <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>appropriately appreciated; the members should forever treasure his memory. Mr. Cermak admonished his brother Sokols.</p>
