   <p>P.2--A year ago several of us, Bohemian professional women, formed a group for the purpose of self-education in important matters of the day. We dared not appear before the public before we had decided upon the method whereby we shall achieve our goal. To-day we present our aim and our method to the Bohemian public.</p>
   <p>In the first place, we are concerned with self-education, which we seek to accomplish by research and by lectures which are sometimes delivered by members, and sometimes by specialists in those matters which we are interested in.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, we consider a hearty spiritual union among Bohemians as important, and this is made possible for us by Slavie, the women's study club, which has aims similar to those of our club, Snaha.</p>
   <p>This educational work is to prepare us actively to assist our brothers and sisters in their work in the Bohemian social life of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Being women, we are especially interested in the youth, which requires so much care and effective love, and we will cheerfully assist at all times in questions concerning youth.</p>
   <p>Finally, by inserting brief reviews of Bohemian life in the English newspapers, we hope to acquaint the general public with the best characteristics of our people.</p>
   <p>Progress is our goal, truth is our method.</p>
   <p>The meetings, which will be of interest to the general public, will be announced in the daily papers.</p>
   <p>For the Snaha Women's Club,</p>
   <p>Klara Kvaus, president</p>
   <p>Alice G. Masaryk, secretary</p>
   <p>Address: A. G. Masaryk, 4638 Ashland Avenue.</p>
