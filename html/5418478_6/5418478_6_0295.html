   <p>Cicero, which has suffered the greatest losses [from the "Eastland" disaster] has been in the deepest of mourning these last two days.....</p>
   <p>There were twenty bodies in the Polish Catholic Church yesterday....and following the burial ceremonies, there was a long procession to the limits of the town where they separated and proceeded on their way to the respective cometeries....</p>
   <p>It should be mentioned that the Chief Bailiff of the Municipal Court, Anton J. Cermak, sent men from his office to Cicero also yesterday where they were needed to maintain order. Thanks and an expression of full recognition are due to Mr. Cermak for all the work he has done and has had done for those left behind by the victims of Saturday's catastrophe.</p>
