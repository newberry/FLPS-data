   <p>How great was our pleasure when we heard that--after a wait of almost fifty years--the Bohemian national anthem had been adopted as an anthem of an independent nation into the songbooks used in the schools throughout this country! The importance of this achievement will be more fully appreciated if we can imagine the feeling of disappointment among Bohemian children who were made to sing the Austrian, Russian, German, and French anthems, and also anthems of smaller nations; but the anthem of their own nation was not included in their books....</p>
   <p>This achievement was brought about by the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) after an effort of a comparatively short duration; and, it proves that this national body is rapidly gaining reputation and influence in the public life of our city....</p>
