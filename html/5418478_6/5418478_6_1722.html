   <p>As in years gone by, so also this year the Svobodna Obec (Bohemian Free Thought Community) of Chicago celebrated the memory of the Bohemian reformer and martyr, John Huss. The celebration was held yesterday in the Husuv Jubilejni Dum (John Huss Memorial Hall), 4236 West 22nd Street. In spite of the fact that hot weather prevailed, a sufficient number of true admirers of John Huss attended the celebration, and with piety listened to the dignified program. The celebration was started about three o'clock in the afternoon by the chairman of the board of trustees of the Husuv Jubilejni Dum, Mr. John Pecha, who, in his remarkable speech, pointed out the various mistakes occurring in the free thought movement and made several proposals as to how these could be removed. The speaker was loudly applauded and everybody in the audience expressed a wish that all those mistakes be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Following Mr. Pecha's speech, Miss Blanche Tichy played a piano solo that was <span class="page-break">2</span>well received. Miss Marie Zeman, school teacher and a zealous worker for the free thought movement, recited a poem written by the late Bohemian-American poet, Alois Janda; following this recital, Miss B. R. Tichy and Miss Libuska Hudecek played a piano duet. The program continued with a speech by Mr. A. Janda, a poem recited by Miss Blanche Foucek, and a piano solo by Miss L. Hudecek who is the daughter of the treasurer of the board of trustees of the Husuv Jubilejni Dum and a zealous worker for the free thought movement.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Jurka then recited the poem, "Chodska," written by Eliska Krasnohorska. Everybody in the audience listened breathlessly to the recitation of this beautiful poem because Mr. Jurka recites excellently.</p>
   <p>The speaker of the Svobodna Obec, Mr. Vaclav J. Petrzelka, spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Year by year this fateful and dark day in Bohemian history returns, and still it is not useless for us to continue to observe it. The event commemorated on this day is and always will remain one of everlasting pride to the Bohemian <span class="page-break">3</span>nation, and those events which followed will always make the brightest pages of Bohemian history.....The memory of John Huss is the memory of an ideal Bohemian who lived and died as he preached, and in that spirit he should be remembered."</p>
   <p>The final number of the program was the singing of a Bohemian song, "Hranice Vzplala Tam na Brehu Ryna" (The Pyre Burst into Flames Upon the Shore of the Rhine).</p>
   <p>Following this song, the chairman, Mr. Pecha, thanked all those who were present for their participation and expressed a hope that the next celebration of the memory of John Huss will be attended by more people.</p>
