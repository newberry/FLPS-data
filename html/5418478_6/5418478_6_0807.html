   <p>The property on the northeast corner of Ashland Avenue and 18th Street, which, up to the present time belonged to the old settler and former tailoring contractor, Mr. Frank Kvapil, was sold for $20,000 to Mr. L. Bomash. The new owner of the present building will build an addition and remodel the structure at a cost of about $30,000. Stores and offices will be arranged in the building, and it is certain that this part of our Pilsen will be improved thereby. The transfer of this property was carried out by Mr. Frank J. Petru, real estate broker, at 1441 West 18th Street. Mr. Petru will manage the building and handle the rental thereof.</p>
