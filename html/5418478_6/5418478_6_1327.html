   <p>The end of the picnic season has brought out complaints as to its extreme meagerness, and so we are looking forward to the dancing, theater, and concert seasons to make up for what the outings and the picnics failed to do. We hope that we shall not be disappointed in that expectation, but it is quite within the range of possibility that when next spring comes, we shall be complaining about the winter and hoping for a successful period of outings and walks under the shady trees in Lyons or around the Narodni Hrbitov ([Bohemian] National Cemetery). Of course nobody would like to see it happen that way, but it is conceivable, particularly when we know that the last few years were far from profitable in that respect. Of course all that we talk about is the financial success of our parties and entertainments, [for financial success] is expected of every association dance, picnic, or theater performance. People are always saying that on such occasions having a good time is the principal thing, and that, perhaps, is very true. But on the other hand it is also true that the members of our associations are having anything but a good time when they hear the committee responsible for the affair report that there was a deficit which has to be made up out of the treasury. It is so much better when the committee is able to report that everybody had a "swell" time, and that a bit of money was made that will come in handy when another association asks us to buy tickets for its affair, or when the time comes to donate a "fiver" or a "tenner" to some good cause. We hear, however, that such pleasant reports are now rather the exception among our associations; therefore it is quite natural that they all should be looking for chances to make up for this in the future, hoping that conditions will change.</p>
   <p>In the past also there have been "fat and lean years," but there used to be fewer lean ones, and people would now hardly believe how much money could be made in the various entertainments which our societies used to arrange. Of course we are far from implying that every dance or every picnic brought in hundreds of dollars, but there used to be many at which good money was made. Let us recall just the outings to the Narodni Hrbitov, which used to be the most important affairs of the year. The gardens around the Narodni Hrbitov used to attract people from all over Chicago, and there were such crowds of people there as could hardly be assembled now at a single outing that offered really nothing unusual, although there are twice as many of us in Chicago now as there were in those days. But the point was that everybody thought that he must be there and considered it his patriotic duty; he went even if it rained cats and dogs. If a present-day picnicker were expected to walk from the Irving Park station to the Cemetery, he would politely say "thank you" for such a hike and stay at home. But years ago the outing to the Narodni Hrbitov was a "must," and since it was a "must," it was attended, and there was nothing else to do about it. Now, talk about "lively business" at the bar! Just recall those outings, and you will remember how you hardly could get to the tap and were happy to get a stein after endless waiting. Those outings made money, not in hundreds, but in thousands, and it is no secret that they used to be one of the principal sources of revenue of the Narodni Hrbitov in its early years. We are much inclined to doubt that an outing of that kind could take place today, and with the exception of the Decoration Day crowds nothing could get our public out in such huge numbers to the Cemetery.</p>
   <p>Other important organizations also used to have outings very profitable financially, and they were not so easy to put over because we did not have our present-day conveniences. To almost every picnic you had to take a train. Street-cars would not take you much farther than to [Bohemian] California. Riverside, to which now the Bohemian settlement almost extends, had to be considered a distant picnic ground because you had to take a train, but now the street-car has brought it almost into our back yard. Of course, on a rainy day, with two trains standing ready at the depot, the organizing committee were hardly in the mood to talk about the beauties of a trip into the open, but given favorable weather, the outcome of the picnic was, as a rule, satisfactory.</p>
   
   <p>Another kind of "doings" which our associations used to organize were the so-called "bazaars" or "exhibitions".</p>
   <p>Most of them were yearly affairs, but now we have almost none at all. The Patronaty (patrons, that is, boards of trustees) of all our association buildings used to organize yearly bazaars, which were successful almost without exception. The committee used to receive many objects of all kinds as donations to be raffled off, and money was made through various prize contests. Many of us used to consider it our sacred duty to attend the bazaars and "drop some money there so that people would not talk". A business man would go to a bazaar with a pocketful of money, and as a rule he did not get much farther than the entrance before he had to stop and begin to buy "chances," keeping it up for a whole hour. When he got through with that, he would go and try his luck at a "wheel of fortune" and then invest a few "Washingtons" at the bar, and after that he felt free to go home, knowing that he had done his duty. We all thought it had to be that way, and so it was. Small wonder, then, that a bazaar would bring from two to three thousand dollars, while now, when there is one, its organizers are happy when it earns as many hundreds. Perhaps bazaars are now antiquated; perhaps there is not enough money among the people; perhaps there are not enough people who like to sign their names in books of chances; but whatever may be the reason, it is a fact that much has changed since the days of profitable bazaars and outings. The same may be said about dances and amateur theatricals and all other types of entertainment. Now we are disappointed when we realize that the huge Bohemian Chicago is hardly able to support the two theatrical companies that play for us every Sunday. Years ago, there were Sundays with two or even three simultaneous shows, one on Taylor Street, one on DeKoven Street, and sometimes another one in Pilsen. When a holiday season came around, our enthusiastic amateurs threw in a matinee or two for good measure so that the people would not complain of having nowhere to go on a holiday. Even these amateur performances usually made some money in spite of a mere twenty-five-cent admission. Not till later did our amateurs dare to charge thirty-five cents, and then fifty, over which limit they never have gone. Of course we must not forget that years ago the handbills used to read "dancing after the show," and that between the acts there was lively business "over the bar" which also made a profit. And finally, to put on a dance or a show used to be much less expensive than it is now. Of course, the cost of living in general is much higher now. Taking all this into consideration, it is easy to understand that the theater and the ball seasons have been rather lean these last years, and that even with very decent audiences not so much money is being made as would have been considered an average profit many years ago.</p>
