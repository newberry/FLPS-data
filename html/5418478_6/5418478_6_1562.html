   <p>The May social given by the Cesky Lev, a sporting and benevolent club, was successful in every respect. The dance was held in the Bohemian Slavonic-American Hall on 18th Street. A large audience made a rendezvous there, and enjoyed itself until early morning.</p>
   <p>The arrangements committee, Messrs. August Novak, Joseph Kratochvil and Frank Blecha, had everything in readiness with which they could please the public. Frank Kratosky's band played, and its music contributed to the success of the affair and to the fullest satisfaction of the public.</p>
