   <p>Alderman Anton J. Cermak introduced a resolution at the meeting yesterday of the City Council which provides that the Council authorize the Chief of Police to offer a $500 reward for the finding of Ella Paroubek. The resolution was accepted and turned over to the finance committee.</p>
   <p>There is not the least doubt that the committee will take favorable action in the matter, and the reward for the discovery of the missing girl will then amount to $1200. The Bohemian Charitable Association has subscribed $500, the State has subscribed $200, and now the Council has subscribed $500.</p>
