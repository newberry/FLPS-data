   <p>The Cesko-Americka Jednota (Czech-American Union) will not miss a single opportunity to show that it stands in the front ranks, and to prove its patriotic sentiment and loyalty. It has been extremely active not only in the national, but also in the humanitarian field. It has agitated among the Chicago Czechs of all walks of life to support the second war loan. Its Grand Lodge bought $3,000 worth of Liberty bonds in the first issue. The membership consists mostly of Czech immigrants, young and old; but they do not forget that this country has become another mother to us. They are making preparations for an extensive and intensive campaign among themselves in order to prove their gratitude toward this country.</p>
