   <p>Hardly a day has passed in which the English language papers, morning or evening editions, have not carried an item concerning the Czechs, our well founded grievances, and the just demands and hopes of the Czech nation.</p>
   <p>These items are not mere news notes, but regular editorials and comments which bear considerable weight. They must naturally fill us with sincere joy and gratification. This joyful feeling becomes all the more intense when we consider how long it really took us to gain due recognition from the medium which shapes public opinion and which should have given some attention to us long ago. In the first place, we ourselves must be blamed for this lack of attention.</p>
   <p>Czech life in America dates back many years. But if we compare our life now <span class="page-break">\2</span>with what it was before, we must admit that our earlier life was somewhat peculiar, repressed, and forced within the confines of a narrow frame of ridiculously small proportions.</p>
   <p>We are ready to admit that the reasons for this were circumstances peculiar to immigrant life. On the other hand, it is certain that, to some extent, it was our own fault. We have always been too retiring and bashful. If we ever pointed to our achievements, we always did it in the wrong places and before uninfluential people. We lived among and for ourselves. We never paid attention to our neighbors and did not attempt to attract their attention. We were colonizing and forming Czech islands for ourselves, thus remaining unknown in the midst of this vast complexity of foreign elements, and especially among the native American people who are, after all, the important decisive factor.</p>
   <p>It is good and just if we can preserve our national characteristics, true enough, yet the necessity for merging and assimilating in some manner, without becoming <span class="page-break">\3</span>estranged from one's original kind, exists. We can assume American traits without losing our own if we point to the latter and have something worthy at which to point. The most effective means of accomplishing this were the contacts with the people by whom we were surrounded. However, we never tried to establish these connections, partly because we were too comfortable, and partly because we were too bashful. While other groups lived in our vicinity, we were satisfied merely to vegetate.</p>
   <p>We lacked people who were able enough to make and maintain associations by which our life, as we really live it--living it for our own sake only--could have become better known. Our life has benefited only us; it has benefited individuals, and in a materialistic way at that. We cared little for the moral development of our community and its people.</p>
   <p>We neglected the opportunity which was offered to us by our history--a history which is great and glorious. Our Czech history, even the tragic part of it, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and geography of Czech lands are "all Greek" to most Americans from the ranks of the professionals and the intelligentsia. In brief, the Americans know absolutely nothing, or very little, of our life or the life of the Czech nation. They knew nothing even of the life of the American branch of our people, and, consequently looked down upon us, so to speak.</p>
   <p>The English language press paid little attention to us, and if they did, they exhibited a woeful lack of information in every article.</p>
   <p>Conditions have changed in our favor to some extent, but not before Czech art, and especially music, cleared its victorious path throughout the world. Later on, other factors began to exact a decisive influence. The American and the English press began to gather more information about us so that it really became interested in our affairs. Finally, there came this gigantic World War, which is being pursued by America and the Allies for beautiful ideals--for democracy of all nations and equal rights for all nations, small and great.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The Czech question, i.e., the question of the fulfillment of the demands of the Czech nation, has found a place before the international forum. The essence of the Czech question is the demand for the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state.</p>
   <p>It was the unceasing work of the Czech National Council and its subsidiary, the Czech National Alliance, which urged the English language press to break the wall of ice which stood between it and the Czech people. The success became obvious. We are at last gaining the recognition that has been due us for a long time.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that Masaryk has done the lion's share toward this achievement. No one can, and no one must, underestimate his ability. If, however, the ice between the Anglo-American press is finally broken, we must work with all our might to retain our self-consciousness, our pride, and continue our audacious efforts to which we now point at the proper time. If these thoughts guide us, <span class="page-break">\6</span>the American and the English press will devote still more attention to us, not out of sheer kindness, but out of a sense of duty.</p>
