   <p>The Red Cross received $37, the remainder of the proceeds of the celebration held by the Czech Ladies' Club on the occasion of the raising of a service flag on Springfield Avenue, between 26th and 27th Streets. The section lies in the Thirty-fourth Ward. Mrs. Pechan handed the money over to Auxiliary #421 of the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Relatives of our soldiers from this block, and also from Avers Avenue, between 25th and 26th Streets, may send in applications for knitted socks, sweaters, etc., to the Ladies Club. The section on Avers Avenue donated $30 to the Red Cross. This was a surplus from their own service flag celebration. The money was delivered by Mesdames Krizek, Jezek, and Krajicek.</p>
