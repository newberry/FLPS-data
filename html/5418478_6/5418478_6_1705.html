   <p>During the month of February, within a few days of each other the birthdays of two of the best and the greatest men of the United States of America--Abraham Lincoln and George Washington--are being celebrated. These men, by their nobility and their honesty, have gained undying glory in the hearts of their countrymen. Various organizations remember these two men every year with dignified celebrations, and among them is the management of the John Huss Memorial, which, together with the Matice Skolska (Council on Education), is making preparations for that purpose. The program will contain, among other features, recitations by the children who are under the tutelage of the Matice Skolska. The children are being coached by Miss Zeman. The main speaker on the program will be Mr. V. Petrzelka who is also the official speaker for the Svobodna Obec (Free Thought Community). Motion pictures will follow Mr. Petzelka's address.</p>
   <p>The evening promises to be very interesting and should be attended not only by <span class="page-break">2</span>the friends of the John Huss Memorial and the Matice Skolska, but also by every sincere Bohemian-American. By attending this celebration, we shall give a new impetus to the enlightened work the children are doing and thus help to improve the Czech school system, which, if we are faithful to our ourselves, is indispensable for the maintenance of our institutions, societies, and our nationality in general.</p>
