   <p>"Soud Lidu" (The People's Judgment), a Play depicting the life of a seaman, by Ivo Conte Vojnovic, and translated from the Croatian language, was the histrionic vehicle of Mrs. Otilie Splavec, who is one of the best known actresses of the Chicago Czech community. She had selected this play for her benefit performance. The affair took place in the hall of the Sokol Chicago [gymnastic society], 24th Street and South Kedzie Avenue, last night. The performance was given by the troupe of Frantisek Ludvik, dean of Chicago Czech actors and director.</p>
   <p>The appearance on our Czech stage of a theatrical piece from the Croatian literature was something of a novelty. Mrs. Otilie Splavec played the role of the suffering mother, wavering between her honor as the mother of her child, and love for her seducer; the part represents a character excellently suited to set forth her remarkable skill and profound conception of woman's soul.</p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Otilie Splavec's splendid acting was rewarded by repeated and enthusiastic applause, and by floral offerings and gifts of appreciation.</p>
   <p>The rest of the cast did its best to emulate Mrs. Otilie Splavec's efforts, and the evening may justly be called one of the most enjoyable of the season.</p>
