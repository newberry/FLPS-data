   <p>The evening to honor the memory of Jaroslav Vrchlicky [foremost Bohemian modern poet] organized by the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) in co-operation with the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) and the Umelecky Klub (Artists' Club) was held in the hall of Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol) last night. But our public did not attend in as large numbers as we had expected.....Perhaps this can be explained by the comparatively long lapse of time since Vrchlicky's death.....</p>
