   <p>p. 4--Lately our Bohemian-American life has been subjected to severe criticism, several newspapers taking part in the debates. A thing of this kind does no harm. However, we did not hear one entirely sound opinion voiced during these debates.</p>
   <p>On the one side it was all idealism, on the other plain materialism. Much can be written about the life of American-Bohemians, very much; but the question of their life will never be solved. In spite of the fact that idealists tell us, that we should remain Czech patriots, our fate is sealed--we shall disappear in the sea of another nation.</p>
   <p>Whatever the ideals may be of those people who reproach us, we did not come to America with the thought of founding a new Bohemian, but to assure ourselves a decent living.</p>
   <p>It will be our pride, if we can continue to regard ourselves as Czechs for as long a period as possible.</p>

   <p>We do not fear, however, that any changes, either political or of our language, will be forced upon us. This is impossible.</p>
   <p>The idealists forget this fact, and this causes them to misunderstand our attitude and to subject us to unduly severe criticism.</p>
