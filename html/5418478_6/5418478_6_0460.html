   <p>In the second report on the progress of collections conducted by the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) published last Sunday, we reported the receipt of $2,322.96. This week the fund has grown to $3,184.87.</p>
   <p>The largest contribution was $466, which came to us through the Daily Svornost. Of this, the largest individual contributions were $186 from the Kryl Band and $100 from Mr. F. Spinar.</p>
   <p>We repeat that the Pomocny Vybor guarantees that the money collected among our countrymen will be distributed in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, so that the most needy Bohemians will receive help. Our money will never get into the hands of an Austrian government agent, employee, or officer; therefore the objection of those who button up their pockets with the excuse that they do not know where the money will go has no foundation.</p>

   <p>Furthermore, we hope that those who have placed obstacles in our way and have impeded our collections since the beginning because of fear that our soliciting will damage collections of their own, will finally be recognized as people who are selfishly damaging a sacred national undertaking, and that those who still have some apprehensions will become convinced of the sincerity of our efforts and will join hands with us in our common work toward the fulfillment of our national duty.</p>
   <p>[There follows a full column of names and amounts collected on every one of the collection sheets--which are numbered--by the individual solicitors. Also, the names and amounts returned by individual volunteer collection organizers are published.]</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the results of these collections will inspire more and more of our countrymen to charitable collection work. According to news reaching us from abroad, there is a real need beginning to be felt in Bohemia, and Bohemian-America wants to help with a gift and not with alms.</p>
