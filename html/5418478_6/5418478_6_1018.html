   <p>The Zabavni a Spolecensky Spolek Ceskych Vlastenek (Social and Benevolent Society of Bohemian Patriotic Women) has made extensive preparations for a splendid evening of entertainment to commemorate the anniversary of the Czechoslovak Independence Day. The entertainment is to take place in Mr. Novak's hall at West 25th Street and Homan Avenue, and whoever desires to spend a pleasant evening will certainly not overlook this opportunity. The entertainments arranged by our ladies are always characterized by that admirably cordial spirit which prevails in all their social affairs, and tomorrow's ball will not be an exception to the rule.....</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee has arranged everything that can contribute to the general merriment of the guests, and it is therefore desirable that the attendance be commensurate with the care taken by the Spolek. Doors open at 8 P.M. Admission fifty cents.</p>
