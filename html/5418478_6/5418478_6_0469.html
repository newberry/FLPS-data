   <p>Our Bohemian colony in Berwyn proved eloquently yesterday that its numerical and patriotic strength makes it one of the foremost Bohemian groups in Chicago's suburbs. Our friends there set out to show their sympathies for Slavic peoples fighting against their worst enemy, the Teutons, and to make a collection for our brothers in the old country. Their purpose was fulfilled to perfection.....</p>
   <p>The hall of Sokol Berwyn was filled to capacity.....</p>
   <p>The speakers were Mr. Nigrin, Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky, Mrs. Bujarek-Stanek, and Mr. Palandic....whose eloquence was rewarded not only by stormy applause, but also by the result of the collection, which yielded $250, an amount which the organizers of the meeting expect to raise to $300 before it is passed on to the proper committee.....</p>
