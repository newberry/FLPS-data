   <p>To all true Bohemian countrymen! In the next few days the Ceska Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) will start a general collection of a voluntary national tax for the work for the liberation of the Bohemian nation and the Bohemian land. All friends of the Bohemian cause and all true Bohemians are asked to make a contribution.</p>
   <p>In order to avoid all misunderstandings, the Narodni Sdruzeni will issue identification cards bearing the emblem of the three Bohemian countries and signatures of the officers of the Sdruzeni to all accredited collectors. Only men equipped with such identification cards have the right to receive money for the Narodni Sdruzeni.</p>
