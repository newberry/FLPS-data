   <p>The parents of the unfortunate Ella Paroubek, who was kidnapped, murdered, and now lies beneath the green sod of the Bohemian National Cemetery, are not forsaken in their great grief. Everyone with the least bit of feeling in their hearts sympathizes with them, and their friends are coming to their rescue, not only with soothing words, but with actual deeds. Nothing is more natural than the fact that the Paroubek family is now penniless, for they dedicated everything they owned toward the return of their child.</p>
   <p>One true friend of the Paroubeks is Mrs. Sofie Johanes of 2810 South Avers Avenue. She made two collections for the benefit of the Paroubek family; one at a party given in honor of Mrs. Ourada, which netted $4.40, and the other in Bohemian California, which brought $51.00. (A list of those contributing is published).</p>
