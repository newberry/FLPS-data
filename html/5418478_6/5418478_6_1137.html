   <p>Our Bohemian public, being informed by daily newspapers, knows that the Czechoslovak National Alliance, together with the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics, the Slovak League, the Priadky (Women's Auxiliary of the Slovak League), the Vcelky (Women's Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak National Alliance), and the Bohemian Art Club, intends to arrange a bazaar toward the end of May. The Czechoslovak Legionnaires were also invited to participate. In preliminary consultations of these groups, it was decided to arrange this bazaar for the benefit of legionnaires, widows, and orphans in Czechoslovakia. At the meeting of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires, held March 13, it was resolved to ask the delegates of the Bazaar Committee to place the legionnaires in the forefront--in publications and proclamations, etc. Namely, it was hoped by our legionnaries, that a bigger success could be attained and more confidence gained among our Czechoslovakian public for the enterprise--confidence which on all sides is disappearing. But this proposition was not accepted. The Executive Committee of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires then called a special meeting of its members for Monday, February 22, and the situation was discussed. At the meeting it was unanimously decided not to participate in the proposed bazaar, the success of which, under prevailing conditions of discontent, is in doubt--and a report of the decision was to have been made to the Bazaar Committee at its meeting held Tuesday, March 23.</p>
   <p>Brother Legionnaire Rudolph Kohlicek-Hartwald, as a member of the Executive Committee and editor of the Americky Legionar (the American Legionaire), who was entrusted with the task of introducing the report in said meeting, took the floor and spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"At a special meeting of brother Czechoslovak Legionnaires, I was authorized to translate to you, the Bazaar Committee, our standpoint and decision which was reached after long and thorough consideration.</p>
   <p>"First of all, I most decisively call the attention of the delegates of the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics, the Slovak League, the Priadky, the Vcelky, and the Bohemian Art Club to the fact that we appreciate their noble efforts and work in the past, and that there is not one of us who does not wish for and depend upon their co-operation in the future.</p>
   <p>"I have been instructed by the Czechoslovak Legionnaires to notify you that we refuse to co-operate in any enterprise in which the Czechoslovak National Alliance participates under its present leadership.</p>
   <p>"The officers of the Czechoslovak National Alliance, Messrs. J. Paskovsky and F. Musil, and likewise the Chairman of the District Committee, Frank Kubec, are persons whose removal was required according to the vote of all the members present at yesterday's meeting.</p>
   
   <p>"The Czechoslovak Legionnaires blame these gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"(1) For unmanly actions. They, who should have been an example and who should have been among the first to don the uniform of the poorly paid legionnaire, have betrayed the Sokol's principles and have evaded their obligations, for which their brothers died on French and Slovakian battlefields.</p>
   <p>"(2) For absolute inability to lead an institution as important as the Czechoslovak National Alliance should be, in consequence of which the organization lost from fifty to seventy per cent of its membership; the dissolution of one of the best Alliance branches in St. Louis, Missouri; dissolution of the branch in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and many other branches in the United States.</p>
   <p>"(3)For disturbance of our public life, manifested by absolute distrust in the persons who are at the head of he Czechoslovak National Alliance and in any action which is undertaken by that body.</p>
   <p>"(4) For an attempt to maintain expensive headquarters, keeping unnecessary offices and officers, which will use up the remainder of the money donated by the poor, common people.</p>
   <p>"(5) For terrorism against people who happen to disagree with them; people who otherwise are honest and patriotic.</p>
   <p>"The Czechoslovak Legionnaires will use other ways and means to compel the above-mentioned gentlemen to resign from their offices. Until that time, the delegates of the Czechoslovak National Alliance on the Bazaar Committee are asked to acknowledge our proclamation. As legionnaires who have fulfilled their obligations to the last letter--whose obligations were to die on the battlefields for the liberation of our native land--with all determination, we ask for and take the right to decide in matters concerning our foremost national institutions. We are fully conscious of what we are doing and we firmly believe that we will be followed by all those who are interested in the purification of our national life and the removal of all those who, merely for business reasons and against public opinion, are trying to hold offices which should be occupied by persons enjoying general public confidence.</p>
   <p>"Under the conditions now existing, our motto of 'national discipline' is only talk as long as it is preached by people who have never acted accordingly.</p>
   <p>"If it is possible for the delegates of the Bazaar Committee to do something in this matter, we ask them to do so immediately. Otherwise, as we have decided, we shall arrange an independent action for the benefit of our brother legionnaires in our old country, from which the Czechoslovak National Alliance with its present leaders will be absolutely excluded."</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned proclamation should have been introduced in the meeting as an explanation of why we legionnaires cannot and will not participate in the proposed Bazaar, but brother Kohlicek-Hartwald did not finish reading it. As soon as the name of Mr. Paskovsky was mentioned, he was ruled out of order by the chairman of the Committee, Mr. Kouba. Therefore, the Czechoslovak Legionnaires come before our people with their proclamation in order to have our public correctly informed about the actual conditions. Further steps were immediately taken and the legionnaires firmly hope that they will be supported by all who have retained the sentiment of clean and honest national work. Today, three-fourths of the former good workers for our national cause wish to remove the root of this situation, which threatens the cooperative work of all good Czech people. The Czechoslovak National Alliance must be reorganized before all sentiment for reorganization fades.</p>
