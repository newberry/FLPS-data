   <p>At the wedding of Mr. Otto Randa and Miss Bessie Vitek, a collection was made for the benefit of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association). The collection brought a total of three dollars, which sum was deposited in the office of Denni Hlasatel where the authorized representative of the association may secure it. It would be desirable if more such collections would be made in order that aid might be extended to as many as possible of our poor people during the Christmas season.</p>
