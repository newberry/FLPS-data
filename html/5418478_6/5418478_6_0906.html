   <p>Arizona has passed a new labor law which is in fact a law against immigration. According to that law no large enterprise may have more than twenty per cent immigrants among its employees. All others must be American-born workers. This is a new bit of evidence of the gratitude shown by America, which owes all it is today, in the first place, to our people, the immigrants. On the other hand it is a well known fact that the American is the last man who would agree to do hard labor. This he avoids, and he seeks light work for more money. His favorite occupation is politics, which brings in the largest income for work that may just as well be called idleness, and the income is made up of the money of those against whom our legislatures have been passing increasingly drastic laws lately.</p>
