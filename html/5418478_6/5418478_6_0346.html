   <p>The first consignment of clothing, linen, and shoes collected for our prisoners of war in Serbia will be shipped from Chicago to New York tomorrow. There are several cases filled with these articles, and all of them should prove serviceable to the wearers for a considerable period of time.</p>
   <p>But this is only the beginning. There are between thirty and forty thousand Bohemian prisoners of war in Serbia, all of whom are in great need of clothing.....Therefore, we still have a great deal to do.....</p>
   <p>Before their shipment from Chicago, the articles will be disinfected in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>sterilizing apparatus of the County Hospital.....This will be done entirely free of charge.....</p>
