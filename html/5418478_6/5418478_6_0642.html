   <p>P.2--On Mr. Sedlacek's premises yesterday evening the arrangements committee of the Bohemian Charitable Association held a meeting to hear the report on the dance given on the 26th day of October, 1910, at the Pilsen Brewing Park. Mr. Frank J. Petru and the secretary of the Association, Mr. F. G. Hajicek, reported that the proceeds of the dance will amount to $1,700 or $1,800. This is certainly a handsome sum and proves the good will of our countrymen. It likewise makes it possible for the Bohemian Charitable Association to carry on its splendid charitable work. Various reports will be presented at the next regular meeting, and the women who worked to make this affair a success will give their report.</p>
   <p>There was a discussion concerning a contribution to the Association acquired through the agency of Mrs. Czajka. Mr. Foucek, the secretary of the Association, announced that Mr. Quinlan has contributed a five-acre tract of land in Florida, worth about $400.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank J. Petru, a real estate broker, undertook to investigate the location <span class="page-break">\2</span>and value of this land.</p>
   <p>Doubtless the Association will issue tickets and raffle off the Florida land. It is situated near Johnston, Florida, where a small Bohemian colony is settled. The Association expressed its thanks to Mr. Quinlan, the donor.</p>
