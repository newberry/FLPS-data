   <p>A play of Spanish vintage, called "In the Low Lands," adopted by the Bohemian stage under the title, "Se Srdcem Divno Hrat" (The Heart is a Freakish Toy), was given by Ludvik's theatrical group last night. It served as an excellent vehicle for a performance given for the benefit of the popular actor, Mr. Ladislav Dvorak. The play occupies a high artistic level, and made a good impression upon our public, whose mind usually inclines more to comedy. The roles of "Manlich" and "Martha" were played by Mr. Dvorak, and Mrs. Cervenka, respectively. The staging was very good, and the large audience enthusiastic.</p>
