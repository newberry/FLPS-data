   <p>The preparations for a soiree of welcome for all the delegates and participants of the two expeditions to Czechoslovakia--[Bohemian-American commercial expedition and the one by the Narodni Sdruzeni Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics)]--are in full swing.</p>
   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Komora (Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce) will be host to these returned countrymen on Wednesday night October 13, in the Pilsen Park pavilion. Thanks to the untiring efforts of the entertainment committee, the preparations made for the soiree are progressing nicely, and our countrymen living in Chicago and vicinity may well look forward to this event, for never before has there been so much care used to make an evening <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a really enjoyable one. The committee consists of the following: Messrs. Jan A. Cervenka, Anton J. Cermak, John A. Sokol, J. M. Kotek, Frank G. Kajicek, A. Laadt, Louis Jalovec, W. Hnatek, Jesef Citta, J. F. Zetek, Samuel Strobl, Rudolf Liska; Mesdames A. Schnabl, Anna Zarobsky, Jennie Sistek, Emma Nikodem, Katerina Novy, Marie Hnatek, Josefina Beranek.</p>
   <p>Everyone is looking forward to this reunion of our Chicago visitors to the old homeland, and it goes without saying that it will be a real reunion of all their friends and acquaintances too. It will be a soiree not unlike the one in Prague, though here in Chicago we shall meet more people personally known to us. And as for the program and the entertainment prepared by the committee, there will be so many specialties and novelties that to stay away would be unwise. The cuisine, on this occasion, will be a la Prague in its smallest details, and the rest of the entertainment will make your muscles ache from inordinate laughter. The "serious" portion of the program will consist of the retailing of experiences bordering on the absurd. Admission, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>including the supper, is $1.50 per person; this price is within the reach of all. The committee tried to institute pre-war prices on this occasion, and is not sorry to have spent so much time and labor to make the event a first-class affair. In short the soiree will satisfy both your physical and your spiritual needs. Several hundred tickets were mailed out, and should you be one of the unlucky ones whose name was not on the mailing list, come personally to Mr. Louis Solar's store or telephone Lawndale 0604; tickets may also be obtained from Mr. Schnabl, West 26th Street and Trumbull Avenue, and Mr. Jalovec, 3415 West 26th Street. If you cannot come, telephone, and the tickets will be mailed to you. Payment must be received by October 10.</p>
