   <p>Brothers! On Friday June 23, 1922, the Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu (Czechoslovak Legion Post of Chicago) will have its plenary meeting in the Sokol Chicago at Kedzie Avenue and West 23rd Street. The problems of the general convention confront us, and it is desirable, therefore, that all members be present. The brothers who asked for their demobilization papers in the English language....are requested to call for them.</p>
   <p>For the Legion Post,</p>
   <p>Albert Houska, secretary,</p>
   <p>3322 West 23rd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
