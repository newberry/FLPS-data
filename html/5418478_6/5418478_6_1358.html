   <p>Three large Bohemian settlements have organized branches of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance). These settlements include the third largest Bohemian settlement in the United States (the one in Cleveland), the oldest one (in Milwaukee), and the youngest one (in Morton Park, Illinois).</p>
   <p>Three huge meetings, all of which were addressed by the representative of London Bohemians, Mr. Frantisek Kopecky, succeeded in removing all doubts, and the worst pessimists have now promised to do their share of national duty.</p>
   <p>The meeting in Milwaukee was attended by five hundred people, the one in Cleveland, by six hundred, and the one in Morton Park, by three hundred. Complete confidence in the Narodni Sdruzeni and its Chicago headquarters was expressed at all three of these meetings, and in all three of them it was decided to found a local Sdruzeni.</p>
   
   <p>The unanimity of opinion was particularly striking in Cleveland.....where the speaker stated that all Bohemian workingmen, both in the old country and in America, are in favor of absolutely universal suffrage, and laws providing for direct and secret elections of the people's representatives both in the diet of the new Bohemian State, and in the elections of the officers of city councils throughout the country. He promised that in case the unexpected happened and the Bohemian land should stay under the Hapsburgs, the Narodni Sdruzeni in America would support, morally and financially, the struggle for the introduction of the described kind of suffrage and elections in the Bohemian lands. This assurance was received by Bohemian workingmen with stormy applause in the Cleveland, the Milwaukee, and the Morton Park meetings, and the Chicago headquarters has expressed its full agreement and sympathy with the speakers, and the attitude of their audiences.</p>
   <p>For this reason, there should not be a Bohemian workingman who would not do his share in co-operating with and supporting the action for the liberation of Bohemian lands, because in a free and independent Bohemian state the working people will have the same political rights as anybody else. The working people in the old country form sixty per cent of the population, and were deprived of their proper share in directing the administration of the country and its cities by antiquated laws which have been kept in force by German obstruction and the opposition of the aristocrats, against the continuous efforts of Bohemian political leaders.</p>
   <p>The meetings in all three communities were most successful, particularly the one in Cleveland, where the local Austrian consul and his stooges have been confusing the Bohemian people, in which, to the eternal shame of the Bohemian-American press, they have been supported by the peculiar attitude of the American. This paper has not even mentioned the meeting, although reports about it were in all local English-language newspapers.....</p>
   <p>Equally successful was the meeting in Morton Park.....</p>
   <p>It is now up to all countrymen to co-operate. The next meeting of the Narodni Sdruzeni in Morton Park will be held in the Hall of Sokol Karel Jonas next Tuesday at 8 o'clock in the evening and collection sheets will be issued to applicants.</p>
   <p>Also the more recent collecting activities have been successful, and the Sokol units are again in the vanguard of these activities. Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy contributed $200; the Sokol of East St. Louis $10; Sokol of St. Paul, $27.35..... The Narodni Rada (National Council) of Cleveland contributed $81.20.....</p>
   <p>[A full column of contributions, both from organizations and private individuals, follows. They range from fifty cents to $230.] Total income during the last few days $721.75.</p>
