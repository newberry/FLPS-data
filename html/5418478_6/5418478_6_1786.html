   <p>The Fourth of July is of great significance in the historical development of the American nation.....[Translator's Note: An outline of the history of the United States is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>There surely was no celebration more impressive and variegated than the festivities with which July 4 was observed this year. There was no nationality, with representatives in the United States, that would not have heeded President Wilson's appeal for demonstrations of patriotic sentiment.</p>
   <p>Czechs and Slovaks, always in the forefront in their demonstration of patriotic ardor, carried off first honors this time. President Wilson's call found the most enthusiastic response in even the smallest of our settlements. The Czech National Alliance arranged celebrations in every one of our colonies.</p>
   <p>A mighty demonstration of loyalty and sterling citizenship took place in Douglas Park yesterday. It was sponsored by the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, and the Slovak League. It was a spontaneous demonstration of the attitude of our people. Over one hundred thousand Czechs and Slovaks congregated in the open space solemnly to vow fealty to the United States, the American people, and its great President. It was an exalted moment when Czechs and Slovaks showed again that the confidence placed in their loyalty was not unjustified.</p>
   <p>The parade itself was a magnificent affair. It surpassed all previous events in "Czech California," this largest Czech American settlement. The district took on a holiday aspect. No house could be found that was not adorned with our colors.</p>
   
   <p>Although the time for the parade to start had been set at 1:30 P. M., 26th Street at noontime resembled a sea of people which was constantly growing. In spite of its gigantic proportions, the parade proceeded strictly according to program. This shows how thoroughly it had been prepared by Mr. Anton J. Cermak, grand marshal, and Messrs. F. J. Kubec, J. J. Salat, and Andrew Schustek, marshals of the parade. Their staff consisted of over a hundred assistant marshals.</p>
   <p>The procession started at 2 P. M. from the intersection of Crawford Avenue and 26th Street. When all the participants had taken their places, the line of marchers was several miles long. It is not easy to make an accurate guess at the number of persons in the parade; it must, however, have reached the total of several tens of thousands.</p>
   <p>A large detachment of Chicago police, all Czechs, led by Captain John E. Ptacek, was at the head.....Our Czech policemen marched with the precision of trained Sokols. A number of sailors, on furlough at present, formed a very presentable link in the parade. They are Chicago Czechs, and most of them are former members of Sokol associations.</p>
   <p>Of course our Sokol organizations were especially well represented. They are the old guard that always lends the brightest luster to all our celebrations. Along with them strode girls and women, and striplings from the children's classes with their little "Sokol sisters," all in the colorful Sokol garb. Boy scouts, led by Mr. Jan. A. Sokol, deserve special mention, and so do the Home Guards in their olive-hued uniforms, Veterans of the Spanish-American War, butchers' associations, and others.</p>
   <p>Several floats, all picturesquely decked out, attracted much attention. One of them, symbolizing harvest time in Slovak lands, was generally admired. The parade was in columns of eight, and in some places even of sixteen. The parade proper was preceded by a line of automobiles supplied by the Lawndale Automobile Club. The number of these cars is estimated at five hundred. All were decorated with the national colors.</p>
   <p>The procession moved to Kedzie Avenue, then north to 22nd Street, and east on Marshall Boulevard to the southern part of Douglas Park. The streets through which it went were thickly lined with people, and every window was occupied. The Marshall Boulevard elevated station, which afforded an excellent view, resembled a human bee hive.</p>
   <p>A large tribune had been erected in front of St. Anthony Hospital, and groups of visitors began to cluster around it, growing in numbers and density. At about 2:30 P. M. the head of the parade reached the south entrance to the park. The police cavalcade and the automobiles dispersed. Men and women formed a ring around the platform, the uniformed units functioning as a sort of guard of honor. Several hundred children, conducted by Mr. V. Kodl, director of Dvorak Park, arranged themselves on the lawn in the pattern and colors of the American flag. This live emblem was an impressive spectacle.</p>
   <p>It took three quarters of an hour before the end of the marching column had filed in. In the meantime, many thousands of others had grouped themselves around the platform, besieging it in thick throngs. Standard-bearers assembled in one body, which gave an idea of the number of banners. There were about one hundred, besides innumerable "service flags," conspiduous because of their large number of stars.</p>
   <p>About two hundred seats were on the platform, ready to accommodate leaders of the three sponsoring organizations and the guests. Among these, two officers of the Czechoslovak Army attracted the liveliest attention--Messrs. Holy and Horvat, who had marched at the head of the parade, and were the cynosure of interest and acclaim. A part of the tribune was reserved for a mixed chorus, scouts, veterans, and sailors. Women of the Red Cross training classes for nurses had a prominent place in the general arrangement, which resulted in a beautiful, harmonious picture. As mentioned before, the number of participants was estimated at about a hundred thousand. Be that as it may, the fact remains that this was an event of a magnitude hardly expected, and surely not equaled in the history of our settlement.</p>
   <p>The formal part of the celebration was opened by the raising of the flag by the sailors, while the scouts let their bugles sound. Then Mr. Brousek's band played "The Star-Spangled Banner," while a chorus, directed by Mr. Charles M. Coufal, sang. The multitude listened to the performance in breathless awe.</p>
   <p>The Reverend F. W. Jedlicka, one of our patriotic pastors, read President Wilson's message, while the audience stood in rapt attention. Reverend Jedlicka, speaking in English, then expressed the hope that, just as the proclamation one hundred and forty-two years ago brought independence to America, so President Wilson's declaration of war on Germany will result in liberty for all the people in the world. This was greeted with enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Charles B. Pavlicek, attorney at law, read the Declaration of Independence, and then extended a hearty welcome to those of the gathering who have become citizens recently. His speech was about as follows:</p>
   <p>"....And now, friends, it is up to us to show ourselves worthy of the confidence placed in us. Let us thank the Lord that we are sons of the men who fought hordes of Germans for the sake of liberty, men who battled the Huns with words and the pen. We are grateful that, after oppression and misery, suffered at the hands of our tyrants, we are enjoying freedom and opportunity in this country of milk and honey....."</p>
   <p>The British national anthem was played. The Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Central Singing Unit) sang the vigorous chorus "Svuj K Svemu" (Every one should hold on to his own). This sublime choral made a deep impression. At its conclusion there were salvos of applause for the singers and Mr. Coufal, their leader.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jos. P. Pecival was intrusted with the reading of the solemn manifesto of the Czechs and Slovaks which is to be sent to President Wilson. It is a sincere proclamation of unwavering loyalty to the American flag, the American people, and its traditions, and we firmly hope that it will be accorded grateful acknowledgement in Washington. It was published in prominent English-language papers, and we may, therefore, be sure that it will fill its purpose. [The proclamation is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>The following names are signed on the document: For the Czech National Alliance. Dr. Ludwig L. Fisher, Jar. Zmrhal, and V. Benes; for the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, the Reverend Jno. Kestl, Rev. F. W. Jedlicka, and Fr. Sindelar; for the Slovak League,Albert Mamatej, Jan Jancek, Reverend Joseph Murgas, and Andrew Schustek. The proclamation was accepted with exultant acclaim, because it expressed what everybody felt in the depth of his heart.</p>
   <p>"Columbia" was sung. Mr. Andrew Schustek, speaking for the Slovak League, admonished the gathering always to keep in mind the vow contained in the manifesto. He expressed high gratification over the recognition by the French and British governments of an independent Czechoslovak state and of the Czechoslovak National Council. He added that a similar, positive declaration may soon follow on the part of President Wilson, authoritative spokesman of the Allies.</p>
   <p>Our ever beautiful hymn "Kde Domoy Muj" (Where my Homeland is) was followed by the second speaker for the Slovaks, Rev. Gregory Vaniscak....who reminded the assembly of what we owe to America. He invited everybody to join in cheers for the American nation, President Wilson, and an independent Czechoslovak state. The jubilant shouts of hearty consent reverberated through the air.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Vojta Benes took the floor. He is a man who has become most intimately connected with the liberation movement in the past few years. He spoke in the Czech language. We have heard Benes very often, and each time we carried away the impression that we had listened to utterances coming from an ardent Czech soul. The best proof of how his words penetrated the heart of everyone present was the frenzied applause that interrupted the speaker after almost every sentence.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes drew a parallel between the statue of the Indian in front of the museum in the city of Boston, and the small nations. Before the arrival of the white man the Indians were happy. Now they are as dead as the stone from which the statue was sculptured.</p>
   <p>"I think of that Indian. The fate of his race has also become the sad fate of small nations of the world. The blood-stained German came, strong and terrible in his power, and put might above the law of love. Belgium was burned and enslaved; Poland was trampled on and destroyed; the poor people of Serbia were drowned in blood and their children violated; a million Armenians had to die. Sons of my own nation were starved, imprisoned, or driven into a fratricidal war. Darkness shrouded mankind at the moment when our hope, great Russia, tumbled from its lofty position.....</p>
   <p>....In the heart of the great American people--there is where the God of right and truth was born! In this fact rests the immense significance of the American nation in the World War. I want to say it frankly: America has saved the moral strength of mankind! And that is why the world owes it eternal gratitude, a gratitude over which the sun will never set. Claiming no reward, coveting no gain in territory--merely wishing to rescue the treasures of mankind and the confidence in what man has learned to love--thus one hundred million American people stand before the world.....This flag of the United States spells victory of the mind over matter. It is the symbol of the tremendous moral power of a free people which will emerge purified from this war, strong, and with a vigorous start toward a new and better life."</p>
   <p>Congressman A. Sabath, the last speaker, though heavily engaged in official business in Washington, found the time to come to Chicago on this occasion to convey the greetings of President Wilson, and the members of the cabinet. He was heartily applauded, for every one knows that he will use his influence to promote our cause in Washington in the highest official circles.</p>
   <p>The splendid program of this memorable afternoon closed with the singing of "America". The solemn strains or the mighty anthem were carried to the remotest spots of the park, where people sat, warmed by the parting rays of the setting sun.</p>
