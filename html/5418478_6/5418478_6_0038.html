   <p>Mrs. Ruzena Fisher has deposited the sum of $33 in our office, a collection which she undertook among her friends and acquaintances for the benefit of blind soldiers in Czechoslovakia. The collection will be sent through the Bohemian Red Cross to its destination. We thank Mrs. Fischer, in the name of those for whom the collection was undertaken, for her generous effort to help the unfortunate men.</p>
