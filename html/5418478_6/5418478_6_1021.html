   <p>All the social affairs prepared by the Klub Ceska Vlast (Bohemian Homeland Club) have been characterized by first-class entertainment, carefree fun, and good order. To these, we should add the fact that a spirit of neighborliness prevails among the members and guests of this Club. All these characteristics will again be noticeable at the annual ball which the Club has arranged and which will take place in the Pilsen Park pavilion, West 26th Street and Albany Avenue, tomorrow night at 7:30.</p>
