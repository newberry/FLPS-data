   <p>A suit for seven thousand dollars damages was filled against Hugo E. Pitte of the firm Robert L. Pitte and son, now defunct, for Mrs. Anna Liska, 1901 South Hamlin Avenue, by Attorney Otto Kerner, in the Circuit Court yesterday. The bill charges that the firm had sold a mortgage intrusted to it by Mrs. Liska's late husband, who committed suicide upon learning of the failure of the Pittes' private bank, which held his hard earned savings. Mrs. Liska had been left in ignorance of the sale.</p>
