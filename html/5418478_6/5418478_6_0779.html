   <p>The town of Berwyn is steadily growing, even though there is no evidence of miraculous building activity. Beginning with the first of January, 1908, 1,093 building permits were issued, which shows a yearly mean average of 182 new building in the last six years. In the first three years of this period, 661 building permits were issued, which amounts to 209 more than the following three years. It seems that this decline can be ascribed to lack of improvements in transportation, about which there are many complaints in our western suburbs. Instead of lowering the fares companies have raised them, and that, no doubt, is the reason for the building slow-up in the latter years. This would not have happened if we had had normal transportation. During the last year building conditions have improved; 135 building permits were issued, and a total of $297,000 was expended. Of these new buildings, 58 are in South Berwyn and 77 in North Berwyn. It is expected that this year's building activity will be greater than that of last year.</p>
