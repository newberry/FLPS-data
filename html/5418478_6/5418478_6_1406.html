   <p>What did the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) accomplish in the two years of its activity? It broke the ice of unfriendliness and indifference toward Bohemians, where previously there had not been even an attempt to do so. It carried out a successful program for the introduction of the Bohemian language among modern language studies in the high schools of Chicago. It provided the text books and other aids for the teaching of the Bohemian language in the high schools and had them published at its own expense. It provided for a translation of the Bohemian national hymn to be incorporated in the song books. This hymn is now sung by 300,000 pupils. Up to the present time, this is the largest informative work the Council has accomplished in Chicago. It arranged more than thirty lectures, illustrated by beautiful pictures bought for that purpose, in public schools and other institutions. In this way about twenty thousand non-Bohemians were informed about the Bohemians. It arranged for the publication in English of a selection of Bohemian folk stories, which will be issued soon <span class="page-break">2</span>and will be used in schools throughout the United States. It carried out a program for the benefit of the Jugoslavs, which brought us into a closer relationship with them and was for our struggling Jugoslav brothers a fitting financial support which they sorely needed. The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada arranged a gigantic protest meeting when the Slavonic peoples were attacked by Professor Ross in an article appearing in the magazine Century. It arranged three Prastky (Spinners festivals), the net proceeds of which, ($661.00) was sent to the aid of the Bohemian schools in threatened lands. Thousands of Kronen were sent to the Ustredni Matice Skolska, (Central Scholastic Association), Narodni Jednota (National Union) in Olomouc, and to the Moravska Matice (Moravian Association) in Brunn; the balance, $53.37, was divided equally among the Matice Skolska (Scholastic Association) in Mistek, the Narodni Jednota (National Union) in Holice and the Matice Osvety Lidove (Peoples Council on Education) in Polish Ostrau. Jointly with the Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) it arranged for the lecture by Dr. F. Zahradnik, chief physician of the hospital in Brod, on the Balkan war. It arranged a lecture about Bohemia <span class="page-break">3</span>and Bohemians, with illustrations, and a musical program at the Teachers' Institute in Chicago, where more than five hundred teacher candidates, together with their professors, were present. It carried out a vast amount of informative work with the old country. It secured extensive information about both American and overseas Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The amount of work which the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada accomplished with so little financial support is stupendous. The pictures for illustrating the lectures cost it another $500, and the text books for the high schools cost it another $500. What else [is there to be accomplished]? There is still much work to be done. There are still hundreds of places where the most benighted opinions about the Bohemians exist, where it is necessary to bring the light of correct knowledge, that is, in the universities, high schools, of which there are fifty in this city, in two hundred and thirty-one public schools, and in various lecture, art and literary circles, into <span class="page-break">4</span>all of which a way will be opened for us if we work harmoniously. Also needed are good translations of Bohemian literature, poetry as well as prose, suitable for the list of books recommended for young people, the so-called juvenile list. It is necessary also to make business contacts with the homeland.</p>
   <p>We desire the following improvements: (a) that the city government appropriate a sum of money for the purchase of Bohemian books; (b) that the public reading rooms in the Bohemian communities be furnished with Bohemian periodicals, newspapers and books in order to eliminate the existing sad conditions, as for instance in the reading room on Millard Avenue, where, as the members of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada convinced themselves, there was not a single Bohemian newspaper or periodical and a total of only about twelve books. We want to arrange concerts of chamber music in connection with lectures, and programs of Slavonic composers at reasonable prices or, if possible, free, in order that wider circles of our people may learn to know and appreciate really good music--that they may learn to differentiate between good and bad music.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The program of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada is far too extensive and it is impossible to introduce it here in its entirety. It is necessary continually to be on guard, so that there may be no repetition of such cases as that of Professor Ross. How are we to accomplish all this? By a suitable and strong organization, which arouses respect and esteem, such as the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada.</p>
   <p>It is an error to think that all this has been or can be accomplished by a few individuals. Just as a general without an army is powerless, so also these individuals, be they ever so sacrificing and talented, if they do not have the financial and moral support of the general public, of societies and of individuals, cannot work with much prospect of success. For that reason we are inviting Bohemian-American societies and all individuals to whom the welfare and honor of the Bohemian colony in America is sacred, to become members of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada. The dues for active members are $5 per year, for contributing members $2 per year.</p>
   <p>Only in this way will it be possible for us to appear before the general <span class="page-break">6</span>public of America and carry on an educational campaign in the interests of the Bohemian people in this land. Only in this way will it be possible for us to preserve an honorable position in this land. Only in this way will it be possible for us to benefit our people, if we resist the attacks of our enemies with dignity and success. In this way we will be able to lead a really cultural, worthy and respect commanding life in this land as Bohemian-Americans.</p>
   <p>All of you who recognize the advantages of educational work among our people, regardless of political or class differences, should become members of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada. The few dollars which we dedicate to the enlightenment of the nation we dedicate to our own enlightenment; it is a capital investment which will bring big returns. The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada is an institution of the people, by the people and for the people. Do not hesitate, but apply for membership and bring your friends. Applications may be made either to the president, J. A. Cervenka, 2438 South Lawndale Avenue; to the English secretary, Professor J. J. Zmrhal, 1869 South Millard <span class="page-break">7</span>Avenue; to the financial secretary, F. Stanek-Bujarek, 1539 West 19th Street; or to any member.</p>
