   <p>On Sunday, March 5, I expect to leave for Providence, Rhode Island, and there face the charge which has been brought against me.</p>
   <p>I herewith request the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), in the interest of the Czech nation, to ascertain the truth. I suggest that you select a lawyer to come with me, and together we will make all necessary arrangements. I also request that you advance him the necessary cash to defray our expenses.</p>
   <p>All newspapers, whose desire it is to learn the real truth, should arrange public subscriptions. By this means, the amount advanced to cover our expenses will be returned to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, and any money remaining could be retained for the benefit of the organization. If I am found guilty, give <span class="page-break">2</span>the remaining money to the Hus Memorial Home.</p>
   <p>Chicago, March 3, 1916.</p>
   <p>Dr. Frantisek Iska.</p>
