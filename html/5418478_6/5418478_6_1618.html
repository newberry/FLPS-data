   <p>Sokol Slavsky, which, in our estimation, holds first place among our lodges, opened its bazaar in the Bohemian-American Hall on West 18th Street last night. It is expected that this bazaar will be well attended, and we feel confident that it will be a success. In the center of the hall was a stand where several sokols of the women's division distributed assorted delicacies. On the stage the well-known orchestra of Mr. James Hus, directed by Mr. Hus in person, played melodious songs that added to the festive air.</p>
   <p>Those who could not attend last night's bazaar will have another chance to join in the festivities next Tuesday evening at the same place and time, with the added attraction of singers of the Bata-Klan Club.</p>
