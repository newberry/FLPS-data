   <p>A meeting of the Ladimir Klacel Literary Society was held last night in the society's quarters, at Leavitt and 19th streets, in behalf of those of our countrymen recently stricken with a terrible calamity. Bohemian citizens settled here can create a correct picture from reports published in our paper, of the catastrophy which overtook our Bohemia.</p>
   <p>Whoever remembers our beloved mother-country, whoever retains memories of how hard the farmer there must struggle for a slice of bread they surely will not hesitate in giving aid, when they know that these farmers have found themselves on the verge of destitution because of the destruction of their crops, the result of a whole years toil. The call for help was first echoed among our countrymen behind the lime-kilns. At yesterday's meeting of the Ladimir Klacel Literary Club definite steps were taken so that our stricken countrymen might receive the most effective assistance quickly. A mass-meeting will be called for August 28th.</p>
