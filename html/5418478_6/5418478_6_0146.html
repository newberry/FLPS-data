   <p>The Czech wards lead all other wards of Chicago. The Twelfth Ward, which has the largest Czech population, has done very well. We must admit that the Thirty-fourth Ward, with the second largest Czech population, has not come up to our expectations. Leaders of this Ward gave the excuse that certain handicaps hindered an intensive agitation. Vigorous action, however, has now started and the ward is certain to equal or even surpass the best of our Czech wards.</p>
   <p>We do not deem it necessary to explain to our Czech community that we should join the Red Cross. The Red Cross does such magnificent work under its head, our great President, Woodrow Wilson, that its activities cannot be praised <span class="page-break">\2</span>too highly. We do not want to be called "slackers".</p>
   <p>The Thirty-fourth Ward will surely heed the call, for belonging to the Red Cross is not only a duty but an honor.</p>
