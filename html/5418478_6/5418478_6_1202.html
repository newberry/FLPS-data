   <p>Delegates are arriving from Czech districts in the United States to take part in the sixth jubilee rally of the Czechoslovak Union to be held in the Vojta Naprstek Czech language school. A host of friends, wishing to spend a few pleasant hours and obtain first-hand information on the important decisions to be reached at the conferences will also be present. The sessions will take place on several consecutive days.</p>
   <p>A supper was given for the guests in the Pilsen Brewery Park, West 26th Street and Albany Avenue last night. Thirty out-of-town delegates were present. The group almost completely filled the hall.</p>
   <p>The climax of the affair was the introduction of 135 new members. Dr. J. P. Pecival, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>president of the Grand Lodge, Mr. Eugene Frydl, former president, and other members officiated at the ceremony. "Hej Slovane" [Ho! All you Slavonic people!], the Czech national anthem, was sung with great ardor. Doctor Pecival then gave a talk on the advantages--insurance and pecuniary aid--enjoyed by the members in lodges of the Czechoslovak Union. He closed by carnestly entreating the new members to remain loyal American citizens. The applause after these words was followed by the "Star-Spangled Banner" played by the band and sung by the assembly. The reception closed with a dance.</p>
