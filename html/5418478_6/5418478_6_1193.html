   <p>An esteemed friend of our nation will be our guest. He is Mr. Marcel Knecht, a native of Alsace-Lorraine, who will deliver a lecture on his native country and also on Czechoslovak lands. In a telegram to Dr. Ludwig Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, he announced that he is scheduled to speak before the Chicago Board of Trade, and that he will gladly accept an invitation extended to him by the Chicago Czechs and Slovaks.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Knecht will be officially welcomed in the Pilsen Brewery Park pavilion next Friday. We should all appear there and proclaim our loyalty to France and to our own country.</p>
   <p>Needless to say, the Czech National Alliance is counting upon every Czech to make his appearance there, and the Slovak League also expects the Slovaks to do their duty.....</p>
