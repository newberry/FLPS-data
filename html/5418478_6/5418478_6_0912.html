   <p>Yesterday's Tribune carries on its first page a very enthusiastic but not quite accurate article about the Bohemians of Chicago..... Here is a translation of the article:</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Most of the first part of the article appears to deal with the "Slavonic Epopee" by the famous Bohemian painter, Alphonse Mucha, whose work on the paintings of which the "Slavonic Epopee" is composed was financed largely by Mr. Charles R. Crane of Chicago. After a paragraph containing general information about Bohemians in the United States, the article goes on as follows;]</p>
   <p>.....Chicago is the largest Bohemian center with the exception of Prague and Vienna. Here the Bohemians have five banks of some importance, one of which is a national bank and four are state banks. From their directors we learn <span class="page-break">\2</span>that Bohemians send very little money to the "old country". They like to put their savings into homes which they own. To promote home building, they have organized about one hundred building and loan associations, some of which show assets close to one-half-million dollars.....</p>
   <p>All around Chicago there are many farming districts where Bohemians predominate. Some of these districts are almost purely Bohemian.....</p>
   <p>It has been more than fifty years since the first Bohemian colony settled in Chicago. But no Bohemian has yet been sentenced to death for murder in this city.....</p>
   <p>Chicago Bohemians are prominent in politics. More than eighty per cent of them have become American citizens.....Mr. Karel J. Vopicka, a prominent Bohemian brewer of Chicago....will soon go to Europe as the United States Ambassador to <span class="page-break">\3</span>the Balkans.... Here [in Chicago] the Bohemians have one congressman, two judges, the chief bailiff of the municipal court, a clerk of the probate court, seven aldermen, and many other public officials of consequence.....</p>
   <p>....They have many Catholic and a number of Protestant churches here, four dailies printed in the Bohemian language, several weeklies and other periodicals, a Bohemian theater, five thousand Sokols (gymnasts), many clubs, and some six hundred fraternal and benevolent societies. Of special interest as an unusual institution are their Saturday classes where their children learn the Bohemian language and the history of their own and their parents' homeland.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The editor of the Klasatel states that there are a number of inaccuracies in the article, particularly of a statistical character.]</p>
