   <p>From now on the Bohemians of Chicago will have their own motor club, which undoubtedly is the first of its kind in the United States.

The purpose of the Club is mutual aid in accidents, wholesale purchase of automobile accessories, etc., and, of course, also the organization of social outings. The next meeting will be held tomorrow at 8:30 P. M. in the Club headquarters at 1910 South Kedzie Avenue. Motorists who are interested in acquiring membership may apply during the meeting.
