   <p>We inform our public of further details concerning the loss of the steamship "Liberty Glow," which was just reported to us by Mr. Victor J. Kubelka, director of the Commercial Department of the Czechoslovak Consulate General at New York.</p>
   <p>The steamship, as it is known, did strike against a mine. The captain was trying to save the steamship with its cargo by driving the steamship toward the nearest shore; in this he succeeded and the steamship was hurled by the waves upon the rocks. But the storm-battered steamship broke in two and one part sank, while the other part remained on the rocks. Most of the cargo in this remaining part was saved. Details were received slowly.</p>
   <p>After a rather long period of time, the insurance companies informed Mr. Victor J. Kubelka that about eight or nine hundred of our boxes were saved, <span class="page-break">2</span>but that all the others amounting to 2,500 boxes were lost. The insurance companies in their own interest strove to obtain a release from Mr. Kubelka, that is, permission to forward the salvaged boxes to the place of destination, providing that no compensation would be asked. Mr. Kubelka naturally refused to give this permission, especially when he learned from other sources that even the boxes which were salvaged were damaged by the salt water. In his answer to the agents of the insurance companies, he advised them to keep those boxes and pay out the whole amount of compensation, which means that the insurance companies will sell them at auction as soon as possible. He was able to do this, because the insurance policy contained the so-called "special coverage clause," which protected the shipment against other losses besides theft. The total insurance on our shipment aboard the steamship "Liberty Glow" represents the sum of $300,000.</p>
   <p>The insurance companies have also tried to induce the Czechoslovak Red Cross to accept the damaged goods. On February 23, the following cablegram from the Czechoslovak Red Cross was received in New York:</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Hamburg reports that the shipment aboard the steamship "Liberty Glow" is being unloaded in Holland. The W. M. H. Miller Company of Amsterdam writes that if the salvaged cargo is to be forwarded to a further point, it will be necessary to send a guarantee of ninety per cent of the total value. Otherwise, everything will be sold at auction. Forward instructions as to disposition to the insurance company, to the Czechoslovak Legation at Hague, Holland, and to us."</p>
   <p>That means that the Lloyd's representatives in Amsterdam make the condition that we must give up all claims to damages greater than ten per cent; in other words we must release ninety per cent to the company. Otherwise, the company will sell it. Evidently, the cablegram was on its way from Prague a very long time, because in the meantime the company sold the damaged goods as per Mr. Kubelka's answer.</p>
   <p>We doubt that our countrymen, who have sent the boxes to their relatives aboard the steamship "Liberty Glow," are excited about the report that their <span class="page-break">4</span>boxes were sold at auction in Holland. There is no doubt that it was the best solution. Mr. Kubelka, who is representing the Czechoslovak National Council, was for a long time office manager for the Phelps Brothers, a large steamship agency in New York, and understands the transportation business thoroughly. We are convinced that the great majority of our countrymen will be more satisfied to collect the compensation than to have their boxes with soaked provisions and clothes delivered to their relatives. That the full amount of compensation will be paid out very soon is a fact. We beg our countrymen to understand this unhappy situation. There is no reason at all to blame the Czechoslovak National Council, because it was impossible to accomplish more than what had been done. We promise our countrymen that we will use all means to obtain a quick settlement of all insurance claims.</p>
   <p>We take the liberty to appeal to our people not to become hysterical and not to let themselves be influenced by persons who are so unfortunate that in everything they see only scoundrelism and humbug. The Czechoslovak National Council took care of this second shipment only with great reluctance, because <span class="page-break">5</span>too many complaints were received on account of the first shipment. But our people demanded this action from our organizations and, therefore, this action was performed. It should not be forgotten that all of our collecting depots were operated without profit. We ourselves in Chicago have had no desire to make any profit on our countrymen's shipment, neither had the Czechoslovak Consulate General at New York, which took care of the shipment from New York to Hamburg, nor the Czechoslovak Red Cross, which took care of transportation from Hamburg to the place of destination. The Czechoslovak Red Cross secured the services of the largest forwarding company in the Czechoslovak Republic, the Shenker Company, which has been delivering the shipments at cost. Our charges were also about one-half of the price charged by forwarding merchants. The shipment fund of the Czechoslovak National Council now amounts to about $8,000, out of which sum a few bills have to be paid out. If, at the end, there is any surplus, it will be given to the Czechoslovak Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak National Council is even held responsible for conditions in <span class="page-break">6</span>Europe, as though it were its fault that the shipment had been en route for such a long time. In our old country, and Europe in general, conditions are different from those to which we are accustomed in the United States. It is a known fact that even a money remittance sent through the mails is delivered only after two or three months' time. Our former secretary, Vojta Benes, in his letter, says that his baggage, which he left in Paris a month ago, is still on its way and that the members of the Czechoslovak Catholic mission from Chicago also had the same experience. If the circumstances in Europe are such that it takes a couple of months merely to transport baggage from Paris to Prague, then it is no wonder that it takes many months before the boxes sent from Chicago are delivered in some remote village in Czechoslovakia. Mr. Bohumil Klir, our representative at Prague, published the following in Narodni Politika [a Czech newspaper in Prague] on February 4: "About Christmas time, railroad transportation had stopped; in the month of January, the warehouses at Decin were flooded twice, and transportation was interrupted again." The Czechoslovak Red Cross in this humanitarian action is only representing the Czechoslovak National <span class="page-break">7</span>Council of Chicago. It has a list of the shipments, keeps that in evidence, and is taking care of the claims. Of course, it is not at all concerned with the shipment of goods of commercial companies, with which it has no connections and naturally takes no responsibility whatsoever.</p>
   <p>The entire shipment of the Czechoslovak National Council is insured against damage and loss. It is absolutely necessary that the recipients must ascertain the actual damage officially at once. An attested statement should be sent at once to the Shanker Company, which, together with the Czechoslovak Red Cross, will act properly, so that the compensation for the lost or damaged gifts is collected. It is necessary to take into consideration the exceptional difficulties in transportation from Hamburg and difficulties in harbors and railroads. We have to reconcile with that, the fact that transportation of our American shipment is taking more time than was expected by us in America.</p>
   <p>We also call attention to the instructions which it is necessary to follow <span class="page-break">8</span>in case of a loss. Our countrymen presume that they do not have to do anything else, but come to the office of the Czechoslovak National Council and state that their brother or some other related person informed them that something was stolen from the box. We ourselves know that our people would not make any improper claims, but the insurance company wants, and is asking for, proof before the compensation is paid out. The recipients in our old country were notified by the Czechoslovak Red Cross that all claims must be presented there according to fixed regulations.</p>
   <p>Once more we ask our countrymen to have patience with the exceptional circumstances and not expect the impossible from the Czechoslovak National Council. We cannot be held responsible for the post-war conditions in Europe. We have done our duty, and we will continue to perform it conscientiously.</p>
