   <p>The Tabor Slovanske Lipy and the Sokol Slavoj are to be merged. No definite decisions have resulted from the respective conferences. One proposition tends to name the combined organizations Tabor, and recommends the blue American attire, the banner carriers to wear the Czech (red) attire. The motion was defeated by seventy-five to sixty-five votes. This proves that the majority of the Sokols are for a complete merger. It is expected that the new negotiations prepared by both sides will lead to the desired end.</p>
