   <p>In our reports of the activities of the Bohemian Charitable Association, we have mentioned that the second year of the Association's existence will be inaugurated with a drive for more members and contributors. The Association has established an office at 1436 West 18th Street, and turned all the work over to an executive committee. This committee, after preliminary work, sent letters to many Bohemian businessmen and individuals with the request that they become members. There was not the least doubt that the letters would meet with a generous response. In the course of five days, the Association received $200 in contributions, and it is expected that this sum will be materially increased in the next few days. (A list of names of contributors follows).</p>
   <p>The Association extends thanks to these contributors in the name of the many <span class="page-break">\2</span>persons whom it helps. There is no need to dwell on the manner in which the Association helps, for that has been demonstrated many times already. There is no form of assistance which the Association would not render to those who are deserving. Such, for instance, was the case of the abduction of or disappearance of Ella Paroubek. The Association underwrote a reward of $500 for the return of the girl alive to her parents. In order that the regular funds of the Association would not be used for this purpose, a special fund was subscribed to. (List of those who contributed to this fund is given).</p>
