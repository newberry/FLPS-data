   <p>The Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) has received a letter from our Paris countrymen in which they acknowledge the receipt of the $200 which the Vybor sent to Bohemian families in Paris. These families need help because of conditions brought about by the war. The letter is decidedly of general interest, and we offer it herewith to our readers:</p>
   <p>"To the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Dear Friends: We acknowledge herewith the receipt of the 1,019.70 francs which you were kind enough to send us recently. We are happy that our appeal has not been in vain, that it has reached the hearts of our countrymen in free America, who, with the same zeal as we ourselves, are defending our national interests in these sad, fateful days.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"These times call on us not only for unified work for our common national interests, but also for the performance of our duties toward those who are giving their blood for justice, civilization, and liberty.</p>
   <p>"The wives of our volunteers, as well as the families of other countrymen, appreciate the generosity and the awareness of common interests you have manifested by your help to us.</p>
   <p>"Our work comprises relief for the wives and children of our volunteers and those of our countrymen who have become idle because of the war. In addition, our efforts are directed toward the solution of the question of the future form of a Bohemian state or federation of Bohemian lands: how it should be constituted, and what measures should be taken to insure its independence.</p>
   <p>"A further aim of our activities has been to secure protection, and today we enjoy the protection and the high esteem of the leading officials of the French <span class="page-break">3</span>Republic. Thus a Bohemian in France, is no longer considered an Austrian, as are, for instance, the Hungarians, Austrian Germans, and other nationals of the Monarchy. The French Government has recognized the Bohemians as a separate nation, and in many respects our situation is similar to the Alsatians, who also are true friends of France. We are free to live in the Republic during the war, and we have received special permit cards from the police prefecture. By a decree of September 27, 1914, all real estate owned by Austrians and Germans has been sequestered, while our properties are protected.

   <p>"With kindest regards,</p>
   <p>"J. Capek, president,</p>
   <p>"F. Jakl, treasurer."</p>
   <p>[Translator's note Subsequent articles reveal that the organization with the <span class="page-break">4</span>foregoing officers is the Comite de la Colonie des Volontaires Tcheques de Paris.]</p>
