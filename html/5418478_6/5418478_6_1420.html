   <p>Never have we Bohemian-Americans suffered such a brutal and savage public attack as in the last few months, when Professor Ross, a man otherwise respected in his profession and enjoying a good reputation, assailed the Bohemians and the Slavonic races in general, using most offensive language in speaking of us.</p>
   <p>He described us as people made of the "worst material that was left in the workshop of the Creator".</p>
   <p>As an educated people we certainly want the truth to prevail, especially when this means rejecting the stigma unjustly fixed upon us by a man whose hatred of us is so great that he has stooped to a type of attack completely at variance with the ethics of a scholar. To accept these insults quietly would be proving that we are in fact "people without brain and honor," as Professor Ross calls us.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Therefore it is our duty to voice an energetic, but dignified objection, and show Professor Ross and the Century Magazine how greatly we have been wronged.</p>
   <p>Therefore we appeal to you, brothers in the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), and announce that at the last meeting of this central body it was agreed that a mass meeting should be held next Sunday afternoon in the Pilsen Park pavilion. There an energetic answer to the wrongs and insults heaped upon us will be formulated.</p>
   <p>This matter is of such interest that none of you must be absent from this meeting. You want to prove that you are proud of your Bohemian origin; that you are not the outcasts of society as Professor Ross declares; and that we as men know how to defend truth and honor!</p>
   <p>Na Zdar! (To success!)</p>
   <p>For the Narodni Rada: E. St. Vraz, Vladimir Spatny, Jaroslav Zmrhal, John A.</p>
