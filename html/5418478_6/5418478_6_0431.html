   <p>The total contributions to the funds of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) today amount to $4,341.69, including this week's growth of $290.15. At the time when this report was being prepared, a new contribution of $46 was received. It was collected on the occasion of the wedding of Mr. Novotny and Miss Skolil at Ord, Nebraska. The names of the contributors will be published next week. For the time being, we say "many thanks, lots of good luck, and no marital wars".....[There follows a column of names of contributors and amounts.]</p>
   <p>We should like to call the attention of all collectors to the decision of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor that collection lists must be returned one month after the date of their issue. In that way only can an efficient control be maintained.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank our old collectors and request them not to weaken in their efforts. There is still a great deal to be done. Those who want to join the ranks of these good people should apply for collection blanks at the American State Bank, 1825 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>For the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor, James F. Stepina, President; J. V. Nigrin, Secretary.</p>
