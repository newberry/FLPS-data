   <p>A store at 1808 South Ashland Avenue has been adapted for a branch office of the American Red Cross. The neighborhood is dominantly Czech. Mr. M. Sabath is chairman of the campaign committee for that district. Anyone may call at the office and obtain printed material for window displays. All Czech businessmen are urged to make ample use of this display. That will help to show that we all work for a humanitarian purpose.</p>
