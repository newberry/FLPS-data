   <p>The society's treasurer, Mr. Frank G. Hajicek, received a check yesterday for one thousand dollars as a bequest to the Association by the late Mr. L.

When his will was opened, it was found that he had bequeathed large amounts of money to various charitable organizations on Chicago's West Side.

Now they have given one thousand dollars to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost.....</p>
