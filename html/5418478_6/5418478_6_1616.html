   <p>p. 12--"God bless him who is down and out!"</p>
   <p>The refrain of that old folk-song of ours recurs to our mind as we send this invitation to our fellow-countrymen to attend the hard-times ball to be given tonight by the ladies of Zofie Podlipska Choir Lodge 21.</p>
   <p>The affair will be strictly informal; more than that it will be, so to speak, under the auspices of poverty. It will prove that though we have not the wealth of others, ours is a spirit which makes us feel happier than the rich.</p>
   <p>L. Klacel's hall at Nineteenth and Leavitt streets will accommodate the merry dancers, of whom twenty ladies will receive prizes for being the most shabbily dressed.</p>
   <p>Admission, gentleman with lady, thirty-four cents, and gentleman alone, twenty-four cents.</p>
