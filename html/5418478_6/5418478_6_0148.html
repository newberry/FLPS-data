   <p>There should not be a single Czech American Family of which at least one member does not belong to the American Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The Red Cross renders humanitarian and noble service anywhere mankind is in distress.</p>
   <p>This society is always in the front where any suffering has to be alleviated. Therefore, in this war its task is enormous. Every bit donated to the Red Cross is devoted only to its high aim.</p>
   <p>By becoming a member and paying the annual dues of one dollar you will aid a very noble cause. Welcome, therefore, the Red Cross worker who will call at <span class="page-break">\2</span>your home and ask you to join. Give the worker as much as possible, or apply at the branch offices in your neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Let There Be Not a Single Czech Family In America Not a Member Of the Red Cross.</p>
