   <p>The meeting was called to order by the organizer Mr. Enrique Stanko Vraz who announced that the majority of the members had sent excuses for their absence. The chair was then taken over by Mr. Karel Vopicka. Mr. Vraz announced that he had received many letters from Bohemia asking for information. These he either answered himself or turned them over to authorized members to answer. Because the secretary, Mr. R. Jaromir Psenka, did not come to the meeting his place was filled by Mr. Jindrich Ort. The secretary read a communication from the Ceska Narodni Rada (Bohemian National Council) of Prague, in which that organization announces that in its meeting of October 12 Mr. Vraz had been unanimously appointed as its representative in Chicago. Mr. Vraz is an experienced reporter of the foreign department of the Bohemian National Council of Prague. He is the organizer and first president of the Bohemian-American National Council in Chicago.....</p>
   
   <p>Several communications from Bohemia were then read requesting contributions for the Parik monument in Trebenice and for the school in Mysliva. The communications were accepted and placed on file. It was resolved that a special committee be appointed to handle such communications and requests. However, the chairman left the matter in care of the organizer and the secretaries.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vraz announced that in the course of his travels he worked to arouse the branches of the Bohemian-American National Council, but everywhere the opinion was expressed that Chicago must take the lead with its initiative.</p>
   <p>Branches were organized in Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Racine, Wisconsin; Cleveland, Ohio; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; St. Louis, Missouri; and other cities. Mr. Vraz, who will again very soon travel in the North and the South, fact that the Czech language has been introduced in the high schools of other cities, indeed in some state universities. Finally Professor Zmrhal announced that the Superintendent of Schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg-Young, is very favorable to our request and promised to give it all the aid possible. Professor Zmrhal recommended that the request be placed before the Board of Education in the form of a resolution without delay. The resolution will be printed and presented to the Board of Education on Monday or Tuesday. The whole matter was entrusted to the resolutions committee which will present the matter to Mrs. Flagg-Young. The committee is composed of Mmes. Stolf, Geringer, and Sustra, Messrs. Karel Vopicka, James F. Stepina, Kralovec, and Triner.</p>
   <p>It was also announced that Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan is organizing the fine arts department of the National Council. This work has progressed satisfactorily and Dr. Vojan will continue to work for its realization. Mr. Vraz opened discussions on how it might be possible to bring about solidarity among our gymnasts, so that the coming Sokol excursion to Bohemia will be to the glory of the Czech name, universally and collectively harmonious; so that both Sokol camps might join in this excursion and in that way prove that there is no disunion among us, and that fraternity and solidarity reign here.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian-American National Council, but chiefly, Mr. Vraz is to be, so far as is possible, the go-between in the matter. It was resolved that the organizer, Mr. Vraz, should do everything within his power to conciliate the two groups, so that they will participate jointly in the expedition; so that they may arrive in Bohemia as one body and in this way, at least upon this occasion, to set aside dissension.</p>
   <p>The financial report could not be presented because all papers were not on hand.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. Triner, wanted to resign because he is leaving the city, but his resignation was postponed until the annual meeting. Thirty dollars per month was allowed for the services of a private secretary for Mr. Vraz. With that the meeting adjourned.</p>
