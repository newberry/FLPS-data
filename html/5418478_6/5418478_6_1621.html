   <p>p. 1--Last Wednesday a meeting for the election of officers was held, and the following officers were elected: Charles J. Vopicka, president; John O. Hruby, vice president; Joseph J. Kotovic, treasurer; Joseph F. Triska, financial secretary, and Joseph O. Kostner, recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The board of directors as now elected, consists of the following persons: Hugo L. Pitte, Dr. J. E. Jelinek, Dr. Ed. J. Patera, Dr. Frank J. Pokorny and William Kodacek.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nadherny was elected librarian, and Mr. Jan. Geringer, conductor of the chorus.</p>
   <p>At this meeting the main question discussed was whether or not a building should be erected for the use of lodge meetings; a building like the one planned would cost about $45,000, and would do honor not only to the club, but to all Chicago Bohemians. The plans were very interesting to the members present at this meeting.</p>
   
   <p>All were in favor of raising both the membership fees and the annual dues in order to raise sufficient funds. The officers doubt that the building will be built by the end of this year.</p>
   <p>Monday, the 3rd of February twenty-five years will elapse since the president of the Bohemian Club, Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, celebrated his wedding. The Club members took this opportunity to congratulate both Mr. Vopicka, and his wife, and will arrange a dinner in honor of the 25th anniversary of this wedding in Libuse Hall, on 12th boulevard on the day already mentioned.</p>
