   <p>Beautiful diplomas were awarded to the following members of more than ten years standing: Anton J. Cermak, John A. Cervenka, C. R. Jandus, Ferdinand Svoboda, Joseph Z. Uhlir, associate Judge of the Municipal Court, were among those thus honored.</p>
   <p>It was emphatically declared in the meeting that although the United Societies stand for a liberal interpretation of the liquor laws, they will relentlessly prosecute saloons whose behavior is liable to damage the cause of the organization. The organization will, therefore, stand up for those places only that conduct business in a decent, lawful manner.</p>
