   <p>In view of the fact that the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago, together with those who, during the period of our strenuous work stood aside or even tried to harm this work, attack the workers of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America), Frank J. Kubec, Joseph Paskovsky, and Ferdinand L. Musil we proclaim the following:</p>
   <p>That we recognize the sacrifices and great work of these workers who, together with us, worked for the liberation of our native country. That we reject the unjust and groundless attacks upon their honor and character and that it is being done only for personal reasons to harm their work. That we will continue to work with them hand in hand for the benefit of our new republic as long as it is necessary. That we condemn the subversive work of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires, and much more, because it is being done during a most critical period for our republic, when it needs the most effective aid of her sons and daughters.</p>
