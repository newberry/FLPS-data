   <p>This day commemorates the birth of George Washington, the glorious commander of the colonial Revolutionary armies and the first President of the United States. This great pioneer and idealist, who was promised by Great Britain that he would be hanged on the gallows, assured immortality for himself and the first and foremost place in the history of his country. As enlightened people and as citizens of the American Republic, we honor the memory of great men whose self-sacrifice speaks to our hearts from the Declaration of Independence, and Washington's birthday therefore has a great significance for us. The celebration on February 22 has become a tradition in our community, thanks to the patriotic zeal of our Pilsen Sokol ladies, who have included it in their regular annual program.</p>
   <p>Such a celebration took place last night in the Pilsen Sokol hall. It was a successful event, sufficient proof of the piety, respect, and gratitude felt <span class="page-break">2</span>by our people for the "Father of Our Country". The attendance was unusually large, and in spite of the fact that the program lasted until 11 P. M., the audience remained seated and listened gratefully until the last number was finished. The managing committee and Miss Marenka Novak, who headed it, were able to procure some really excellent artists for the occasion. These were chiefly Mr. and Mrs. Vaclav Machek, whose string orchestra, composed of the pupils of the violin virtuoso, played so well that it was a pleasure to listen. Even the opening number, a medley of American songs, evoked thunderous applause, which was a tribute not only to the conscientious teacher, but to all the performers. The piano accompaniment was furnished in a masterly fashion by Mrs. Machek. The string ensemble played Safranek's "Kouzelna Fletna" (Magic Flute) and a medley of Czech songs by the same composer.....young Karel Zika, a lad of about thirteen years,....played the "Ninth Concert" by DeBeriot with such technical purity and fullness of tone that the audience was at once completely overwhelmed by his talent. He was accompanied at the piano by his own music master, Mr. Vaclav Machek. There were a number of vocal pieces, among them a male quartet consisting of our popular foursome, Messrs. Richard Class, Rudolf Hajek, Karel Malik, and Ondrej Ludvik....Miss Marie Ort, accompanied at the piano by Miss Lillian Schuh, <span class="page-break">3</span>sang an aria from Weber's "Freischuetz". She, too, was rewarded with great applause, although the acoustics of the hall did not do justice to her voice....</p>
   <p>The main feature of the program was, of course, the festive speeches; and here it behooves us to emphasize the fact that we were particularly fortunate in the selection of both the English and the Bohemian speakers. The English speech was given by Judge Frank Johnston, Jr., whose address earned him loud and prolonged applause.....Judge Johnston is a member of an old Southern family, and without a doubt, belongs among the most popular judges in our district. He is an excellent speaker, especially given to the expression of truth at all costs; thus his remarks did not contain the usual ballyhoo and flattery so often delivered by other speakers. In short, his address did not eschew any just or severe criticism, if such were necessary. The speech lasted for about one hour and was often interrupted by enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian speaker this year was Mr. Otto Pergler who is the president of the <span class="page-break">4</span>Velkorad Statu Illinois Cesko-Slovanskych Podporujicich Spolku (Grand Order of the State of Illinois of the Czecho-Slovonic Benevolent Societies) and one of our foremost and most zealous workers in nationalistic affairs. Mr. Pergler enjoys the reputation of being one of the best speakers we have, and this brilliant renown was fully borne out by the address he delivered yesterday. As in the case of Judge Johnston, his remarks did not "spare the horses"; they were critical of our political conditions; they encompassed some of the evils of present-day public life. This Washington's Birthday celebration offered a good opportunity for the speaker to point out some of the inconsistencies which may be found today. Pergler's speech, too, was accepted with tremendous applause.</p>
   <p>As we have already said, the whole festival was a success, and it is our hope that our brothers, the Sokols, will take part in similar festivities in the future and will attend in greater numbers.</p>
