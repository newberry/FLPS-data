   <p>Every time we prepare anything really big and festive we do it with the additional purpose of showing the American public what we are able to do. We are trying to show to the indifferent and frequently hostile "America" the degree of our progress, our development, and to demonstrate the ability of the immigrant people. No doubt this is an eminently proper desire, rooted in the justifiable wish to demonstrate our cultural level to people of other nationalities, but our efforts, in this respect, fail almost every time. America seems to retain the tendency of remaining a "foreign country," and the attention we receive from the American public never comes up to our expectations and is, in no instance, in proportion to the importance of our undertakings. This has been our experience many times. There have been big theatrical performances in downtown houses, there have been concerts whose artistic level <span class="page-break">2</span>was such as to merit somewhat detailed reviews in large American newspapers. But such undertakings are usually dismissed with a few lines of standardized, meaningless mention, that is, in case the paper has even found it worth while to say anything. Almost every time we have been disappointed in our expectations; hence we should have become accustomed to it by now.</p>
   <p>Let us just recall what our English-language newspapers had to say about the Sokol Slet (mass convention). No doubt this was an event of exceptional importance and scope, one of the greatest national festivals Czechoslovak Chicago and Czechoslovak America have ever celebrated. Important personages came as guests from Czechoslovakia, hundreds of American Sokols from all parts of the country participated in the magnificent gymnastic production in the Coliseum, thousands of people gathered there together to witness the glory and success of Sokoldom, and it was therefore to be expected that the Chicago press would pay it at least as much attention as one of the Chicago papers is paying to the campaign for "shorts" for women. All papers carried short notices <span class="page-break">3</span>about the important guests from Czecheslovakia upon their arrival, a word about the Slet that is being prepared, and, finally, a brief interview with Senator Klofac. That, of course, was natural and to be expected. Klofac was representing here the government of the new Republic, he is a former minister of national defense, and actually vice-president of the National Assembly, therefore a personage of a standing which always receives a certain amount of attention from the English-language press.</p>
   <p>But the attention was net, by any means, the kind that Jack Dempsey or Charlie Chaplin would get if they came to Chicago. That, of course, is easy to understand. A very large percentage of the American people is much more interested in the boxing ring and in film stars than in all the statesmen of the world put together. Who do you think would get more attention, Secretary of State Hughes--therefore the prime minister of the American government--or Mary Pickford, if they were to come to Chicago at the same time? Or, supposing that Jack Dempsey should come here after his fight in New Jersey. Not even the whole cabinet, perhaps not even the President himself, would receive so much attention.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The papers made some general mention of the Sunday parade, and of both the great days in the Coliseum, but not a word about details, about the magnificent gymnastic performances. One morning paper published a short notice about the drill of the Sokol youth, and remarked that it was "good for America". Now, if such training of the youth is "good for America," why did not the performance of the Sokol youth merit a somewhat more adequate description? And what about Jelinek's "symbolic" (symbolical tableau-like group drill) "Za Svobodu" (For Liberty). This was something quite new for America and therefore of interest also to those who have no understanding for our cause.</p>
   <p>While we have some right to find fault with all that, to complain of lack of understanding and appreciation, it has its very definite reasons of which we, in turn, seem to lack understanding and appreciation. The American newspapers cater to the tastes of their readers, print what the people like to read, and show the greatest interest in matters which have the public favor. Sports are a favorite subject, and the papers devote to them at least one, and more <span class="page-break">5</span>frequently several pages, in every issue. It would seem, therefore, that it would have been quite proper if the Slet had been given a few columns of descriptive report. But there is something else that also seems to require consideration. The American newspapers have never been particularly interested in immigrants, and much less so since Americanization has become one of the important public problems. During the War, many people have been considering plans, proposals, and methods for the most rapid Americanization possible of all immigrants, and the interest in this matter has persisted after the War. These people are not satisfied when the immigrant becomes a good and patriotic American citizen and keeps on performing all his duties in just as perfect a manner as he did during the War. They want him to sever all the ties he has with his old country, to forget immediately his native tongue, and to abandon, at once, everything that, in their opinion, made him an "immigrant," or at least a "hyphenated American," as they like to call him. Their propaganda could not fail to influence the American press, including newspapers which, otherwise, were rather tolerant toward the immigrants. These people are not especially friendly when they see the immigrants function independently as <span class="page-break">6</span>Czechoslovaks, as Poles, or as other nationals, with the possible exception of the Irish. But even these are occasionally being found fault with for paying too much attention to Irish affairs. In the case of the Irish, it should be borne in mind that they have always exercised considerable influence upon the public, and that they use the English language exclusively, thus being at least in that one respect, no "foreigners". The other immigrants, it is, apparently, believed, stop being good Americans when they celebrate their national festivals, talk their native language, and undertake to make a public appearance in order to show their national feelings, and demonstrate their culture, their progress, and the evidence of their success in the sphere of physical education.</p>
   <p>All that has, no doubt, quite a bit to do with the meager notices about our national events in the English-language press.</p>
