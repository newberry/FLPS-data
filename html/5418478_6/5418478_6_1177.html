   <p>The decision by which the Government of the United States recognized the Czechoslovak National Council as the provisional government of the Czechoslovak lands is of paramount historical significance. This was done by a solemn proclamation, in which our old homeland is adjudged, more emphatically than in any other way, full right to her political independence. The Czechoslovak people of Chicago should, for this reason, manifest to the President, and the Government of the United States, their deepest and exultant gratitude, and their sincere love for the entire country.</p>
   <p>Chicago is said to be the Czechoslovak metropolis of America. Let it, therefore, represent itself in a manner befitting this name.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovak Chicago was always to the fore whenever duty called. It is a most beautiful and glorious feeling which prompts us to express our gratitude to the Government of the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We are, therefore, for this reason, issuing a call to all our workers in various associations and national organizations to appear at a meeting which will be held in the main floor hall of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on September 6, at 8 P.M. Plans for a solemn manifestation of gratitude to the Government of the United States will be discussed at that time.</p>
   <p>We are about to welcome a new member into the family of Allied nations; the nation of our forebears, the nation of our brothers! Let us conduct ourselves in a dignified manner, and let us say thanks in a deeply impressive way, for the great gift bestowed on us by our new homeland.</p>
   <p>We are sounding the call to secretaries and presidents of all our organizations, brotherhoods, glee clubs, and all others, whatever aims they may pursue. We are addressing all representatives of societies and alliances, whether of the Catholic faith or Free Thought. We are also calling to our brothers, the Slovaks. We trust in, and expect, the participation of the entire Czechoslovak community of Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We advise that all manifestations of gratitude and joy, which surely will be sent by all Czechoslovak organizations, be addressed to Robert Lansing, Secretary of State.</p>
   <p>We cordially invite you to attend the meeting next Friday.</p>
   <p>For the arrangements committee: Vojta Benes; Jar. Zmrhal; Fr. Sindelar; Reverend Father Vaniscak; Ondrej (Andrew) Schustek.</p>
