   <p>The Crawford Neighbors' Club gave a dance last Saturday, the proceeds of which were for the benefit of the Jan Neruda school, which was organized on March 5. At present, it is located on 43rd Avenue at 27th Street. This dance, thanks to the active agitation of the sacrificing ladies, brought a clear profit of fifty dollars for the benefit of the school. Although the school was only recently organized, it already has one hundred fourteen pupils.</p>
   <p>The Crawford Neighbors' Club, which founded the school, is already thinking about erecting a special school building.</p>
