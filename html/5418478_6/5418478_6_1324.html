   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) opened its fall publicity campaign last Sunday with a meeting in the Bohemian-Slovak settlement in Hawthorne, Illinois. The credit for organizing this meeting is due to the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Hawthorne (Hawthorn Gymnastic Sokol Union) and the Morton Park Branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, which two organizations were represented at the meeting by a fair number of members. The majority of the audience were Slovaks who mustered an attendance of almost two hundred people. The meeting was livened by a choice musical program, for whose excellent presentation full credit is due to Mr. V. Cerny's orchestra, of Morton Park, which performs frequently at the affairs of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni.....</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by the commander of the Morton Sokol group, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mr. J. Kluiher,....who introduced as the principal speaker, the secretary of the main branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, Mr. [J.] Tvrzicky-Kramer.....</p>
   <p>His speech, as well as the speech of the representative of the Slovaks, Dr. Osusky,....was received with much enthusiasm and a great deal of applause. After these speeches the main purpose of the meeting was taken up; that is, the foundation of a new branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni. As soon as the respective motion was made and seconded, a number of those attending the meeting volunteered to become organizers and active workers of the branch. The first to volunteer was the commander of the Hawthorne Sokols.</p>
   <p>The organizing meeting of the new branch will take place in the same hall, that is, in Mr. Kastner's hall on 29th Place and 50th Court, Wednesday, October 13, at 8:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>The Hawthorne Branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni will be the forty-first unit <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of this Bohemian national organization, not including some twenty settlements in which preparations are being made for the formation of new branches. Eleven new branches were organized in the month of September. </p>
