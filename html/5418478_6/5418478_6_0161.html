   <p>Thousands of Czechs have already become members of the Red Cross. So much has been written on the sublime aims of this organization that surely not one of our readers needs any further detailed information about it.</p>
   <p>Yet it seems that much has remained untold. Just let us imagine the immense amount of work that has to be done in the pursuit of the humanitarian aims of that body, both in peacetime and in wartime. In times of peace the Red Cross is always ready to extend a helping hand to those smitten by disaster. After the War your sons will be telling you how tenderly they were taken care of when they lay wounded by enemy bullets. Red Cross workers are everywhere. They are in the hospitals and in the thick of battle. They are not concerned about their own lives, but they go where they are needed by the stricken.</p>

   <p>In the United States the Red Cross counts over fifteen million members, among whom there are thousands of Czechs, as stated before. We may proudly claim that we Czechs are entirely cognizant of the high purposes of the Red Cross and that consequently there is not one of us who would not be ready to make any sacrifice for it. There is no doubt that we shall attest to our love for the Red Cross and shall prove our good intentions by deeds.</p>
   <p>During this pre-Christmas week you will be spoken to and visited by Red Cross workers. Nonmembers will be invited to join. We know our kind well enough to be certain that they will receive these workers with outstretched arms and an open heart and, of course, with an open purse.</p>
   <p>The men and women who will visit you will not be paid for their work. They will give their time for the cause. Their only reward will be the satisfaction that comes with the discharge of one's duty. Let us all <span class="page-break">\3</span>think as they do. Let every Czech-American home wear that very beautiful decoration, the Service Flag of the Red Cross!</p>
