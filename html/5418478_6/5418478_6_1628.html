   <p>p.1.--Powerfully and nobly echoed the tunes of our Bohemian National Hymn, Kde Domov Muj, (Where Is My Home), under the large glass dome of the Polk and Dearborn Railway Station, last Saturday evening when the special excursion train left Chicago.</p>
   <p>At this occasion one could not find a person whose eyes were tearless, because this ceremony was so touching and patriotic that even the most adamant person's emotions were aroused. It will always be remembered.</p>

   <p>The special excursion train was due to leave at 8 p. m., but hours before that time crowds of people came to the station to bid farewell to the Sokols and their loved ones. People came from all Bohemian settlements in Chicago to witness this colorful spectacle. They came in such large numbers that the station was in a turmoil.</p>
   <p>Several of the excursionists were old people, who longed to see once more the land of their birth, while others wanted to be present at the Sokol Meet.</p>
   <p>Several minutes before the train was to leave, something took place at the station which probably had never happened there before. As a surprise the Smetana's Bohemian Choir, appeared in full number and sang, "Farewell" then, "America", and as the train slowly pulled out of the station the choir sang "Kde Domov Muj."</p>

   <p>The public joined in to sing this song the last words of which echoed when the train vanished from sight.</p>
   <p>Many Americans and reporters of various Chicago newspapers were present and all watched with astonishment and enthusiasm this dignified farewell ceremony by Bohemian people of Chicago. Every one present removed his hat during the Bohemian National Hymn.</p>
   <p>By this dignified act the Bohemians of Chicago have proved to the whole world, that they deserve respect which at present no one can deny them.</p>
