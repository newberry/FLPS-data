   <p>It was two weeks ago yesterday when the whole of Chicago was horrified by the terrible news that the Steamship "Eastland" sank, or rather keeled, on Chicago River, at the North Clark Street bridge. The vessel carried over twenty-five hundred passengers, participants in an excursion arranged by the Hawthorne Club to Michigan City, Indiana.

The news was a terrible blow not only to hundreds of Bohemian families in Cicero, Illinois, but also in New Tabor, Lawndale, Bohemian California, Pilsen, Town of Lake, and other Bohemian residential districts from where so many of our people, mostly young and in excellent health, justifying the rosiest hopes for the future, joined the excursion.</p>
   <p>The catastrophe cost the lives of almost one thousand people, who are now identified, of whom two hundred and fifty are our people; people living in the Bohemian districts of Chicago.
