   <p>We have very often had the opportunity to comment on the praise worthy activities of the Damsky Dobochinny Krouzhek (Ladies' Charitable Circle), of Chicago. The circle was founded only a short time ago, but it has accomplished much; the Utulna (Old People's Home) especially is indebted to it. The circle regularly arranges uplifting entertainments, initiates collections and endeavors, by all possible means, to further humanitarian and patriotic aims. It is, therefore, no wonder that the circle has a great many friends, especially in "Czech California," the district of its most vigorous activities, where, in fact, all who call themselves sincere Czechs are its friends.</p>
   <p>This friendly attitude of the public has shown itself in every entertainment or enterprise of the circle and no less in the masquerade ball in Sokol Chicago hall, held for the benefit of the Vojta Naprstek school. The afternoon was given to the children, all of whom received beautiful little presents. Valuable prizes were awarded to the most striking twenty masks among the woman. The hall was overcrowded, and the entertainment yielded a handsome amount of money to provide the maintenance of the school.</p>
