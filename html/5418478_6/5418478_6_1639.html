   <p>P.1--The participants in the outing to Willow Springs conducted yesterday by the Telocvincna Jednota Sokol Praha (Gymnastic Society) will remember the day with sadness. Frantisek Krizek, one of their stalwart members, was drowned in view of a crowd of onlookers before help could be brought; he died in the attempt to save the life of another.</p>
   <p>Cruising on the river in a rented boat, Krizek heard a certain Jan Pitcha, a bather, shouting for help. Mr. V. Kral, the owner of the rented boat, took another boat and made for the drowning man. Krizek, who was nearer, leaped into the water to rescue Pitcha but sank and did not reappear: He had sacrificed his life to save Pitcha, who was finally rescued.</p>
   <p>Krizek's body had not been recovered, at the end of the day.</p>
