   <p>The police of all Chicago stations were notified by the Chief of Police last night that any person who finds the missing Ella Paroubka alive will receive a reward of five hundred dollars from the Bohemian Charitable Association. Of course it is understood that the reward is not restricted to the Chicago police but will be paid to any person in the United States who either finds the girl or gives information leading to her recovery. The Bohemian Charitable Association is not alone in offering a reward, for the State Treasurer of Illinois will pay a reward of two hundred dollars. Up to the present time we did not have a law which permitted doing anything of the kind, but as we previously mentioned, such a law was passed by both houses of the State Legislature on the day before yesterday. This was done in answer <span class="page-break">2</span>to the urgent petition of Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir, president of the Bohemian Charitable Association, Alderman Anton J. Cermak, secretary of the Association, and Judge Thomas Scully. These gentlemen were in Springfield on Tuesday and visited the Governor, with whom they discussed the matter, and, on behalf of the Association, they asked for help in the search for the missing girl. Governor Deneen immediately subscribed twenty-five dollars and then took steps to secure the passage of the necessary law whereby a reward of two hundred dollars might be offered by the State for the recovery of the kidnaped child. In view of the sensational case of Ella Paroubka such a law was immediately drafted and without even being referred to a committee was placed before both houses and unanimously passed. So far as the reward offered by the Bohemian Charitable Association is concerned, it should be explained that it will not be paid out of regular funds but from a special fund which was contributed by members of the Association and by other philanthropic Bohemians; this fund amounts to more than a thousand dollars. Because of general public interest in the matter we shall publish the names <span class="page-break">3</span>of the contributors in the near future.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Bohemian Charitable Association held their regular meeting on Friday evening in the office of the Association in the Bohemian-American Hall on 18th Street. The meeting was presided over by Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir. The secretary, Mr. O. R. Fuerst, read the minutes of the previous meeting, and when these had been accepted as read, the meeting proceeded with other business. First of all, communications received were read, and of these the most interesting was the one from a certain countrywoman, whose name we will not mention. She is a poor Bohemian woman upon whom misfortune has fallen. The Bohemian Charitable Association was informed of the case and gave assistance to her and her family so that not only was despair turned away, but the spark of hope was brought back into her humble home. In ardent words this woman thanks the Association, and the simplicity of this highly interesting letter so moved the directors that it was resolved to enter the communication in the minutes.</p>
   <p>Agent J. Docekal then gave reports of various Bohemian families which have <span class="page-break">4</span>applied for aid and for work. There were many such cases, and some of them were so touching that one could hardly believe that such distress existed. In the majority of these cases the directors agreed to extend help either through the payment of rent or the furnishing of food. On the other hand cases came up which do not deserve attention because the applicants do not really need help. These of course were denied. Further reports were made by Messrs. Sedlacek, Loula, Turek, Triska, Petru, and Ringl. They had investigated several cases. The installation of a telephone in the office was also discussed, and it was decided to let Messrs. Uhlir and Cermak make the necessary arrangements. Mr. Foucek introduced an offer from Mr. Karel Nechansky, who offers to sell to the Association a large painting representing "Custer's Last Fight" for $150. The painting is valued at $400. The offer was placed on file for later discussion.</p>
   <p>The executive committee recommended that the holding of a tag day on Decoration Day be given up because of the plans of the National Cemetery Societies, <span class="page-break">5</span>which intend to hold their tag day on that date for the benefit of the school. This was approved of, and then it was unanimously decided to hold the Association's tag day on July 4. The Bohemian ladies will be invited to participate, and tagging will be carried on not only in all Bohemian communities but also at the places where the various Independence Day celebrations are held.</p>
   <p>We do not doubt in the least that the Charitable Association's tag day will bring in several thousand dollars. Every Bohemian in Chicago who watches the work of the Association is its friend. The meeting was adjourned after the chairman once more had mentioned the committee's visit to Governor Deneen.</p>
