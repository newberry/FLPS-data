   <p>Members of the benevolent association, Mothers, Wives, and Sisters of World War Veterans, Number 1, noticed a report in our newspaper about Joseph Spika, invalid legionnaire who is on his way home from Siberia, and visited him at the County Hospital yesterday. They presented him with a gift of ten dollars from their patriotic organization. The sick legionnaire was very much pleased and grateful because he was remembered by them in his unhappy fate.</p>
