   <p>All our friends may not know that, according to Austrian laws, the Austro-Hungarian consulates are not permitted to give information or legal help to Austro-Hungarian subjects who, have been injured while employed in arms factories, or factories manufacturing any other kind of war material belonging to citizens or governments of other countries. United States' factories are among those affected by this provision. Because it is possible that some of our Slavic countrymen might become victims of an unfortunate accident, the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) herewith advises all Slavic employees in the Eastern States to apply, in case of injury, accident, or sickness contracted while employed in the described kinds of factories, to the Relief Bureau of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni in New York, at 302 East 72nd Street, where they will receive the necessary help and information. Workingmen in other states, that is, in the Central and Western States of the Union, and in Western Canada, should apply to <span class="page-break">2</span>the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni at 3639 West 26th Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
