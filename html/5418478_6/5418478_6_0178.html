   <p>All Czech Chicago is taking part in the humanitarian action of the Bohemian Charitable Association. There are very few business houses in our community that are not distributing the coupons for the Association, and those houses will surely be giving them away during the next fourteen days, at which time the contest will be concluded. Whether these stores will be giving away coupons depends chiefly upon the customers themselves, who should not fail to ask for one with every ten-cent purchase.</p>
   <p>Posters in numerous shop windows give ample proof that the movement is in full swing. We are informed by the offices of the Association that business houses are trying to outdo one another in buying coupons and in distributing them among their customers. Our housewives should consider that every coupon gives them a chance to win one of the sixty beautiful or useful prizes, some of which are quite valuable. They should also consider that the proceeds of the contest are dedicated to the support of the poor, whose numbers among <span class="page-break">2</span>our people are constantly increasing. Those who are doubtful as to the value of the prizes may inspect them at any time at 3226 West 26th Street, corner of Sawyer Avenue, where they are on display in a showcase. Of course, they will not see two of the special prizes, the Buick automobile and the live Shetland pony. The auto will be driven through the streets of our Czech districts within the next few days.</p>
   <p>Town of Lake, a Czech district here, has, up to the present, excelled all others in the contest enterprise.</p>
