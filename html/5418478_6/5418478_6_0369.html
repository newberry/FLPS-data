   <p>For years there has existed among us a club composed of Bohemian "prominencies" and the cream of the Bohemian society. Whenever there is an opportunity to "show off", the club never fails to proclaim to the world that it represents the very elite of the Bohemian-American patriotic society. For more than six months now the club has had the opportunity of showing off by making a substantial donation to the widows and orphans of Bohemian soldiers who lost their lives in the war. But the nationally-patriotically-prominently-Irish banqueting [sic] club remains in the background, and prefers to leave the matter to the milk, much skimmed milk, of our society, composed of needy, but nevertheless, unselfish, self-sacrificing and enthusiastic workingmen whom, of course, the club does not admit.
