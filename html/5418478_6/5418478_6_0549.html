   <p>Tireless efforts of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Society) to have a branch office of the County Agent established in our "Czech California" district will no doubt be successful. Alderman Anton J. Cermak and Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir, as representatives of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, together with Commissioners Mendl and Kuchlewski and County Agent Venecek, went looking for a conveniently located site for the branch office yesterday and agreed to lease a vacant store on Kedzie Avenue, about seventy-five feet from 26th Street.</p>
   <p>No doubt their decision will be approved, and thus we shall finally have a branch of the County Agent's office right in our district. It will be of great advantage to the poor people of this district, because they will not have to go as far for their relief as they do now.</p>
