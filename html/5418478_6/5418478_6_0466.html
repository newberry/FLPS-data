   <p>In Wednesday's meeting of Sokol Slavsky, a component part of the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Sokol Unit called Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs), action was taken which is considered of great significance. In addition to the usual agenda, Sokol Slavsky dealt with the question of a contribution to our suffering brothers in the old country. As in other patriotic matters, Sokol Slavsky proved to be most generous. The discussion of this question was very brief indeed. The decision, by a large majority, was to withdraw $500 from the treasury, and in addition to this, assess each member with a tax of $1, which amount will have to be paid within a certain short period. Thus, the total contribution voted in Wednesday's meeting amounts to $696, the Sokol Slavsky having 196 members at the present time. It was agreed to hold the money until an opportunity presents itself to send it to the Ceska Obec Sokolska (Bohemian Sokol Association) [with component units in Bohemia, Noravia, Silesia, and Lower Austria] for distribution where help is needed <span class="page-break">2</span>most.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously, the hope was expressed that all other contributions collected in Bohemian America will be given to the Ceska Obec Sokolska in the old country, which body would undertake the distribution, together with Bohemian teachers. No doubt the Sokols and teachers would form a body which would be fully competent to undertake an equitable distribution, and when the time comes to make the respective move, the Sokols and teachers should be taken into serious consideration.</p>
