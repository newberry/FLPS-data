   <p>It would be most advisable to work out a plan which would make it certain that money collected to help our brothers who suffer from the war fulfilled its mission; and the plan, once worked out, should be made known to the public. We firmly believe that the contributions would be much more generous if our public were approached with a definite plan. The leaders who are responsible for the effort should, in the first place, take advantage of the pre-Christmas mood which softens human hearts and opens our pockets. The other day we pointed out the misery of Bohemian journalists and writers, misery caused largely by the war. Many newspapers have stopped publication because of the war and people do not want to read anything else because they are not interested in anything else but war and war news.</p>
   <p>The touching appeal of these poor fellows has appeared in all Bohemian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>newspapers reaching our office. But so far we have not seen a single indication that these neediest of the poor will be given help from the American auxiliary funds. As we have said, the collections would be progressing much more rapidly and would show results much more in keeping with our numbers, our intellectual maturity, and our love for the old country if our people were approached with a definite plan and told how, approximately, the money, or at least a part of it, will be divided and who will get it.</p>
