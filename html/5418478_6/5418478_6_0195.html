   <p>The Beseda J. V. Fric, a club with Socialistic tendencies, but also active in Czech nationalistic affairs, has taken upon its shoulders the task of supplying Czech prisoners of War with reading matter. At the same time it is bending its efforts toward the acquisition of clothing for our destitute fellow-countrymen in the prison camps in Russia, Serbia, and France.</p>
   <p>The Austrian Red Cross is very slow in the care of those poor men, although the Czech population in Austria is being continually drained of money and other contributions for the benefit of the Austrian Red Cross ..... A large part of those prisoners have preferred Allied prison camps to the battlefield to help the Allies toward a speedy victory, and to aid in this way toward the liberation of Bohemia.</p>
