   <p>The theatrical presentation by the amateur club, Lada, of the four-act musical comedy, "Lucifer," was, on the whole successful. The play was given under the direction of Mr. R. Bubenicek last Sunday in the C. S. P. S. (Czechoslovak Benevolent Society) hall in the Town of Lake, 48th and Honore Street.</p>
   <p>The various characters were played by Miss. E. Janovsky; Miss A. Bernasek; Miss E. Kara; Miss J. Harmacek; Miss M. Trnka; Mr. A. Prucha, and Miss V. Jelinek. The players were given many floral offerings after the performance. The musical accompaniment was by Mr. F. Svoboda and his band. Mrs. M. Bubenicek, who conducted the rehearsals of the group, received a beautiful ring. It is to be regretted that the attendance was not as large as the diligent club, Lada, was deserving of at its first independent public appearance.</p>
