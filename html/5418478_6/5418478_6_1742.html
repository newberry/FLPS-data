   <p>A Posviceni (Fall Festival) is the people's holiday in the old homeland and a national festival in Czechoslovak-America.</p>
   <p>One of the foremost Bohemian authors of the third period of our literature, poet Jan Neruda, with his master pen defined the Posviceni as follows:</p>
   <p>"Posviceni is not a public entertainment but a delight; not a formal proclamation, but a blossom of nature; not a table d'hote, but the act of seizing a piece of meat with your teeth with such gusto that a napkin must be used to wipe off the greasy chin. Posviceni is a Posviceni--hooray for the Posviceni!</p>
   <p>"The Posviceni cannot be regulated; it cannot be forbidden; it cannot be analyzed in the mind or by a pen; it cannot be damned or celebrated by a song: The only thing to do is to eat, dance, and shout with joy. Hooray for the Posviceni!</p>
   <p>"The Posviceni is a bright spot in the misery of everyday life when all troubles are kicked aside and the whole lean year is forgotten. It is the greasiest materialism, the plumpest blossom of a simple human heart. That is the Posviceni, and therefore--hooray for the Posviceni!"</p>
   <p>Such is Neruda's definition of the Posviceni in our old homeland beyond the ocean. And what does the Posviceni mean for us Czechoslovaks of America? It means a combined national holiday and demonstrative festival.</p>
   <p>It means a holiday when all our sincere and self-sacrificing national workers get together to discuss their accomplishments of the past year, to enjoy themselves, and at the same time to invigorate themselves for further national work. It is also a demonstrative festival of all those sincere and true Czechoslovaks who have not drowned in the ocean of strangeness and in whom sentiment for our old homeland has not died.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the people of the United States have their own Thanksgiving Day, the Frenchmen of America their Mardi Gras, therefore we, the Czechoslovaks, must have our own holiday--a holiday for us and nobody else. Our Posviceni has always been such a holiday in recent years, it is this year--and let us hope it always will be in the future.....</p>
   <p>Everyone who is willing to prove that his patriotism lies not only in his words but also in his heart should come to the Pilsen Park pavilion on August 15, 1920. Hooray for the Fifth Czechoslovak Posviceni!</p>
