   <p>Our readers will surely remember the report we brought on July 7 about the death of an unfortunate Bohemian youth, John Hruby, who was killed on Blue Island Avenue, while learning to ride a bicycle. The parents of the youth, who only recently arrived in this country, find themselves in desperate straits, and it would be desirable that all those who can, contribute materially for their benefit. Contributions may be sent to the office of this paper. They will be acknowledged in the paper. The parents live at 2631 West 20th Street.</p>
