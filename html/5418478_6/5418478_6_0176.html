   <p>The parade held last Wednesday under the auspices of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) has produced a favorable effect upon the charitably-inclined people of our community. It was arranged to advertise the contest about which we have repeatedly reported in our columns. More and more businessmen are buying coupons for this enterprise. Crowds of people can be seen at the offices of the Association and in various banks where the coupons are sold. These coupons are being given away to customers with every ten-cent purchase. This new enterprise has proved to be a strong stimulus, and businessmen declare that their trade is increasing under this system.</p>
   <p>Not only Czech concerns and store keepers have found this method profitable, but non-Czech firms have also introduced it..... We are publishing the names and addresses of houses where coupons are sold.</p>
