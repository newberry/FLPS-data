   <p>The Pilsen Sokol (gymnastic society) of Chicago sent a resolution to Congressman A. J. Sabath which we printed on May 3, 1917; the Pilsen Sokol received an answer from the legislator, assuring them that the resolution was not necessary. "Anyone who has studied and followed up my activities knows that I have stood by the President for fully four years, and that he stands by me, and, above all, by the Czech people," he declared, "and no one can accuse me of alien sentiment, although I was born in the old country [in Bohemia, that time under Austrian rule]; I am like all Czech-Americans, a loyal American citizen.</p>
   <p>"Like most Czech-Americans, I have not been in favor of universal service; but the time has come for me to rectify my convictions. I am going to do everything in my power to help the introduction of compulsory service, which <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is needed. Therefore, I join in the call 'To Arms!' Let us show that we are not the last, but the first, in the defense of our country."</p>
