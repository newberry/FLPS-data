   <p>The sum of four hundred and fifty thousand Czechoslovak Kronen was sent during the last few days to Doctor Alice Masaryk, president of the Czechoslovak Red Cross to be used to save the suffering children in Czechoslovakia. Recognizing the necessity of aid to these innocent sufferers, the generous members of Bohemian rationalist societies in Chicago and vicinity collected among our countrymen and men of other nations the sum of $4,229.49, which sum being exchanged for American money, is equivalent to the above-mentioned amount of Kronen which was sent to Czechoslovakia for the cause of our children.</p>
   <p>It is also necessary to mention that the members of Frantisek Ludvik theatrical group and children of rationalist schools and clubs also assisted in this collection. This collection is one of the many noble deeds, performed by the people of good will toward the protection of our young Czechoslovak republic.</p>
