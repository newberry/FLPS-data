   <p>Czechs! Your new homeland, the Republic of the United States, has, in the name of the most sacred possessions of mankind, entered the war against barbarism. It is a struggle for us and our children; it is also a battle for our native land. The Czech and Slovak peoples began to fulfill their duty to this land from the first moment when the United States declared war. This land has provided bread for us and our children. This country is going to shed its blood for the rights of oppressed, down trodden nations. This is why you have sacrificed your sons, so that they may stand up for this country and its ideals. This is why you have exchanged the yield of your hard labor for war bonds and have worked for their sale in strenuous campaigns. You have demonstrated that the Czech and the Slovak peoples stand behind the great democratic ideals with deeds and not merely with words. The recognition by the highest government authorities, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>the praise bestowed upon us for our patriotic sentiment and willingness to sacrifice, have filled our hearts with joyful emotions.</p>
   <p>The Czechs and Slovaks are not represented by large numbers, and certainly not by riches, but by their understanding and sacrifice they have succeeded in being pointed out as model citizens.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Czech and the Slovak peoples will continue to do their duty. Our people may be poor and live now under far more strained conditions than in times of peace--yet they will show an understanding of the obligations which this critical time places upon our shoulders--a heavy burden which they are willing to bear, hoping that their sacrifices will bring luck to all suffering and struggling nations.</p>
   <p>Your sons and brothers are on the battlefields in France, and perhaps even tomorrow the murderous weapon of the barbarians will strike them. Tomorrow, <span class="page-break">\3</span>perhaps, your child, or your neighbor's child, will be groaning, wounded desperately. Our Czechoslovak Army receives the aid of the American Red Cross, which takes care of our soldiers in a genuinely motherly way, just as painstakingly as it does with Uncle Sam's soldiers. Wives and children of our volunteers, who have left the United States to join the Czechoslovak Army, have found the American Red Cross to be a real father and mother to them.</p>
   <p>All of these hundreds of thousands are calling loudly to you today:</p>
   <p>We soldiers in Uncle Sam's army have given everything to our homeland. We have offered our breasts to be smitten and to bleed.</p>
   <p>We women and children also have given unflinchingly whatever we possibly could give: our provider, our peace of mind, our bread. Who is going to take <span class="page-break">\4</span>care of us pitiful creatures?</p>
   <p>Czechs and Slovaks! What are you going to give for your homeland? The fight is not finished, and a hard task is in store for our brothers on the battlefield. How are you going to ease this situation for your brothers?</p>
   <p>We are addressing ourselves to the Czech and the Slovak peoples with this heartfelt entreaty:</p>
   <p>Brothers and sisters! Do what is within your power for the Red Cross. Let no one go away without extending your aid to him who knocks at your door soliciting for the Red Cross. Let the Czech name appear at the top of the list of all of those who have sacrificed their utmost.</p>
   <p>May 20 is the first day of the Red Cross campaign week. This week is going to be a week of charitableness and love for the suffering. Men and women <span class="page-break">\5</span>will come to your house asking your support for the Red Cross. Brothers and sisters, help! Let the praise and honor bestowed upon the name of Czechs and Slovaks follow them up to the days of peace and victory!</p>
   <p>Fulfill the duty which you owe to the American Red Cross!</p>
   <p>For the Czech National Alliance: Dr. L. J. Fisher, Vojta Benes. For the National Alliance of Czech Catholics: Reverend Ino. Kestl, Fr. Sindelar.</p>
