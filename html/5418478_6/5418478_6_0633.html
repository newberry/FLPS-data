   <p>P.1, Col.5--The holidays are near; only a few days separate us from them. The holiday distribution will be made on Saturday morning. There is great activity in the Pilsen Brewery Pavilion. Many things have been delivered there since Saturday, purchased or donated by noble-minded benefactors. Their names will be published in the daily papers later. This afternoon the ladies will begin to pack these articles, especially the foodstuffs, in baskets which will be distributed on Saturday to applicants. There will be almost a thousand baskets. Applications are coming in rapidly, and the committee on arrangements, empowered by the board of directors of the Charitable Association, has decided to satisfy all requests, turning nobody away. Every one will realize that great expense is involved, but what difference does it make? In Chicago there are many Bohemian philanthropists who for such causes dig down deep in their pockets and the Bohemian Charitable Association is depending on them.</p>

   <p>In the Town of Lake, where several thousand Bohemian families live Mr. Joseph F. Triska, 1945 West Forty-seventh Street, has been made the representative of the Charitable Association and will receive applications for aid and contributions to the Association. He informed us yesterday that he had visited several businessmen in the Town of Lake and had been assured by them that they will always help the Charitable Association. To set a good example, he contributed ten dollars. We repeat once more that applications for the holiday distribution will be received only up to Thursday evening. Donations and contributions will be received till Saturday morning, but it would be best for every one who desires to contribute to do so before Friday evening. Do not forget our poor people; do not forget their children. Let every one contribute who is able. Even if the contribution be ever so small, it will be welcome.</p>
