   <p>Our last appeal to Chicago countrymen for help to the unfortunate Bohemians who are kept as prisoners of war in Serbia and who suffer unspeakably from lack of clothes and linen--among other things--and whose health and lives are therefore in constant danger, has not been in vain. So many countrymen have sent us their names during the last few days and told us they are ready to receive and store such contributions of clothing as will be brought to them, that the number of our depositories has been doubled.</p>
   <p>Now it is possible to deposit clothes, personal and bed linen, shoes, etc., for the Bohemian prisoners of war in Serbia. [Addresses where donations are received are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>All that is necessary now, in order to have all our colonies represented, is to find locations in Town of Lake and in the Bohemian settlements on the northwest side of Chicago. When places have been secured in these sections, it will be possible for our countrymen to get to a depository without walking too far.</p>
