   <p>.....The Czechoslovak independence day (October 28) was properly celebrated in two places by the Czechoslovaks of Chicago. The first celebration, which was under the joint auspices of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires, the sokol unions, and the Narodni Rada Americka, (Czechoslovak National Council of America), took place in the Pilsen Park pavilion. The second celebration was organized by the Pullman Branch of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires in Pullman. Both of these occasions were characterized by a truly enthusiastic and imposing demonstration.</p>
   <p>Although Saturday is not the most desirable day for such [nationalistic] manifestations as those which we now describe, the crowds which gathered in the Pilsen Park pavilion were of such magnitude that the spacious hall of that building was almost entirely filled. The evening program began with the playing of several numbers by the Czechoslovak Legion band.</p>

   <p>The first speaker of the evening was brother Jarka Kosar, a pioneer sokol worker who despite the many years which he has devoted to the affairs of sokol organizations, is still full of the fire of youth. Brother Kosar chose for the theme of his address the subject which is nearest to the hearts of all sokols--the life aims of the two founders of sokoldom, Jindrich Fuegner and Dr. Miroslav Tyrs. With words full of poetic fervor he pointed out the invaluable services which these two men have rendered to the nation: Fuegner was imbued with civic virtues, and his enthusiasm knew no bounds; his best friend and spokesman, Tyrs, was a nationalistically enlightened aesthete and educator who forever held before the eyes of the multitude those great examples of classical Greece during its most glorious period. These two men furnished an education to their nation which after many decades bore fruit culminating in the declaration of independence on the day of October 28, [1918]; for it was chiefly due to the Czechoslovak legions that the declaration was made....and the legions were, in turn, composed of former sokols. To the sokols, then, the nation is indebted for her liberty, for the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>breaking of the shackles under which it suffered for centuries; to them she looks for support today when, although liberated, still needs [patriotic] guidance. The post-bellum period brought with it much undesirable and insidious poison; and after the first fruits of liberty the national labors seem, for the most part, to have been pushed into the background giving place to the outcropping of selfishness; yea, a great many so-called patriots tried to become rich in twenty-four hours; but all these social phenomena are only transitory. What counts today is the abandoning of bitterness which seemed to have gotten hold of us; what is most necessary today is the work still to be accomplished to preserve the liberty so dearly bought. When these attitudes and activities will be among us, there need be no more fear and anxiety about the future of the Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>The closing words of Brother Kosar were drowned amid thunderous applause which was almost frenzied in its intensity. It was quite obvious that the speaker touched everybody's heart.</p>

   <p>The next speaker was the Czechoslovak consul general [of Chicago], Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka. Dr. Smetanka mentioned the events of the day of October 28, [1918]; he also pictured the events which followed the revolution. In a lengthy address he traced the economic developments of the liberated homeland, pointing out that the economic life of the country is improving from day to day, which is the best answer to the belittling attacks made against the cause of liberation by a Chicago sheet which is being financed by Austrian money. This hypocritical newsmonger predicted with a sarcasm befitting a Judas that the Czechoslovaks are not able to have an autonomous government, and that before the war approaches its end, everything in the [old] homeland will be depleted leaving us a nation of cripples and sickly men. Such a miserable end was perhaps the ardent desire of this malevolent scribbler, but the fate was kinder to us than all these false prophesies, and the Czechoslovak nation today is the most orderly and the best regulated one in all Central Europe. Dr. Smetanka's speech was also rewarded by thunderous applause.</p>

   <p>The celebration was attended by the secretary of the Jugoslav consulate, Mr. Tchitchitch, who uttered a few enthusiastic words in the Serbian language. Mr. John A. Cervenka spoke on behalf of the Narodni Rada Americka, and it was he who paid the greatest homage to the young republic. He said that the Czechoslovak nation had made such rapid progress during the short time of its existence that it amazes the entire civilized world. It may be that all is not as it should be in the old homeland, but what else could be expected of a nation so young? The creation of a republic is always a tremendous problem, and it is [therefore] impossible to put everything on the right tracks overnight. The new nation must be given an opportunity to prove its life's virility and ability. Other nationals recognize this fact and pay their highest respects to Czechoslovaks; it is only we, American Czechoslovaks, who, after a brief sojourn in the new country, return home filled with all kinds of petty complaints.</p>
   <p>In continuing his harangue, Mr. Cervenka touched upon the stagnation which <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>suddenly seized our representative [Bohemian-American] organizations; the exception to this being the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics [of America]) which really is an energetically working body. Mr. Cervenka stressed the necessity of having a powerful organization which would continue to work indefatigably in the task so hopefully begun. It matters not under what name that work is to be carried out, but work we must. Foreign-language immigrant groups are constantly being attacked by the ranks of the narrow-minded zealots who are convinced that they will serve this country best by propagating ideas which are not even American. The prohibition of the use of other languages besides English in the deliberations and proceedings of foreign-language societies, is only one example of such outbursts of fanaticism, and that must be counteracted by a strong organizational effort. Mr. Cervenka also voiced his sorrow at the rupture which occurred within the ranks of the Czechoslovak Legionnaire [in this city], and expressed his hope that the shattered camps will in the near future reunite in a fraternal union inspired by the same feeling which made them one solid group while they still fought in the trenches.</p>

   <p>A very fine address was delivered by Brother Filko, a member of the Chicago group of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires' Federation. He mentioned the heroes whose bodies lie buried at various fronts; their memory was honored at his request by the audience rising to its feet.</p>
   <p>A loud ovation greeted the banker, Mr. Frank Steiskal, one of the few remaining Czech veterans who battled through the hell of the [American] Civil War. Due to the fact that Mr. Steiskal had a bad cold he could not make a speech but said a few words only. Even these were most enthusiastically received.</p>
   <p>Thunders of applause greeted the speech made by Mr. Poliak who spoke on behalf of the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League). He spoke in the Slovak tongue. Alluding to the term "Czechoslovak," he pointed out that it was the heroism of our legions that made it echo around the world, and highly admired wherever it was mentioned. And when, during the course of his speech, Mr. Poliak displayed the flag of Czechoslovakia, waving it as a sacred document of legionnaire bravery <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>and self-immolation, the enthusiasm of the audience reached its culmination and the Pilsen Park pavilion trembled to its foundations shaken by the storm of clapping human hands.</p>
   <p>Mr. Novak, a member of the Lawndale-Crawford Post, was the official speaker for the American Legion. He asked the audience not to lose sight of the heroic deeds of the American World War veterans, and to show their appreciation of these deeds by voting for the soldiers bonus. This question was subsequently mentioned again in a Czech speech made by the president of the Sokolska Obec (Sokol Community). At present there is a bill in the state legislature proposing the floating of a bond issue for fifty-five million dollars, the maturation of these bonds to be strung out over a long period of years. To the taxpayers this issue would be an insignificant expense, since for every one hundred dollars of assessed property the taxpayer would have to pay the sum of only ten cents additional tax. The question is to be voted on at the next election on November 7, [1922], and it is desirable that the issue be voted for by an overwhelming majority.</p>

   <p>The evening program was enriched by several vocal numbers. Miss Helena Weiner gave a few selections of folk songs accompanied at the piano by Miss Jelinek, and her singing met with an appreciative audience. Besides, this the public had its first opportunity on Saturday to listen to the coloratura singing of Mr. Arno Balda who just happened to arrive in Chicago. Mr. Balda possesses unique talents.....He sings the coloratura parts from various operas, arias which were especially written for coloratura sopranos. Even his first appearance on the stage was a shock. He appeared faultlessly attired in a woman's gown, an ermine cape, and a gorgeous lady's hat. When his number was announced there were many in the audience who, due to the prevailing noise and bustle, did not hear his masculine name announced, and took him for a woman. He then sang an aria from G. Puccini's opera, "Tosca,"and it was not until the last few bars of the song that he laid away his female masquerade appearing as a well-groomed gentleman in full evening dress. The audience was beside itself with wonder. Mr. Balda then sang an aria from B. Smetana's "Bartered Bride".....ending with another operatic aria <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>full of the most difficult fioriaturas and trills in the best approved coloratura style. Mr. Balda is not an imitator of women singers, but rather a female impersonator who received the best of vocal musical training. We are certain that his success in this country is assured.</p>
   <p>The attendance of loyal nationally conscious Czechoslovaks at the Pullman celebration of the Czechoslovak independence day was exceptionally large. The celebration in this Chicago suburb will remain unforgettable for those who witnessed it. It had also a special significance for those of our countrymen who settled in that district. For it was the first time in the history of that district that the members of both [halves] of the Czechoslovak nationality [that is, both Czechs and Slovaks] had a joint celebration of their independence. This occasion was to serve for a renewal of loyalties, a declaration of a mutual faith with which to face the various inimical rumors and doubts which lately seem to have sprung up among us, poisoning our national life. To achieve that end, and to give again a documentary proof of the fraternal love which <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>exists among the Czechs and the Slovaks, and thus also to dignify the celebration of the memorable day of October 28, the local branch of the Svaz Cesko Slovenskych Legionaru (Federation of Czechoslovak Legionnaires) contacted the Sokol Union No. 179 of the Telocvicna Slovenska Jednota Sokol (Slovak Gymnastic Union Sokol) with the result that a mutual agreement was reached to hold a joint celebration in the beautifully decorated and spacious Jan Stancik's Sokol Hall, 205 East 115th Street, Pullman, [Illinois].</p>
   <p>Before the start of the program the orchestra played a few concert numbers as well as folk songs.....The first speaker of the evening was Mr. Jan Matlocha, president of the Prvni Okresni Sbor Slovenske Ligy (first district board of the Slovak League) who in a very poignant way alluded to the significance of the day of October 28, mentioning the conditions which exist among us both in Czechoslovakia and here [in the United States]. He declared that four years ago the stabilized Republic of Czechoslovakia made greater achievements than some other and much larger and wealthier countries had achieved for their <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>peoples in several decades. He touched upon the question of valuta and declared that a brilliant future awaits the Republic of Czechoslovakia, a future which depends, of course, upon the unstinting co-operation and unreserved support of every loyal Czechoslovak. The beautiful address of Mr. Matlocha who, by the way, is one of the foremost national workers, and whose labors are well known among his countrymen not only in this country but in the old homeland, was fully appreciated and the hearty applause it received proved that it touched the hearts of all.</p>
   <p>The second speaker....was the president of the local branch of the Czechoslovak Federation of Legionnaires and member of the editorial staff of the Denni Hlasatel, Mr. Jaroslav Bukovsky. Mr. Bukovsky recalled the early beginnings of our revolution, and pointed to the slogan of the beloved leader of our nation, president T. G. Masaryk who, placing that slogan--"Pravda vitezi" (Truth wins)--in his shield, carried it to the highest goal, to Hradcany. [Translator's note: Hradcany, the former residence of the Kings of Bohemia, became the official residence of the president of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. What the speaker meant to say was <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>of Czechoslovakia. What the speaker meant to say was that with truth as his slogan, Masaryk reached the highest position in the state.] This well-tried slogan should not be forgotten. It is absolutely necessary that our people keep it before their eyes, and guided by it, learn to distinguish all the disturbing news which reach us from the old homeland and highly colored by subversive tendencies, give rise here in America to so many misunderstandings. In always seeking the truth and understanding we must finally come to the conviction that only in the union of the two peoples of our nation may we be spared from any new and possible enslavement and suffering; in union there is strength which will protect us. Only by strength and might will we be able to withstand the onslaughts of our old enemies; it is only strength and might which they really respect. And it is that strength which we now possess that they would like to see fall to pieces among us so that they could benefit thereby.</p>
   <p>.....The speech having ended, two motion picture films were projected showing <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>our nation during its enslavement and its final victories. This part of the program was entrusted to Brother Belehrad, a member of the local branch of the Czechoslovak Federation of Legionnaires.....After the singing of the two national anthems [Czechs and Slovak] the....program ended, and free entertainment lasted until the wee hours of the morning.</p>
