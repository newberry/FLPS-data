   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor (Bohemian Relief Committee), organized for the purpose of alleviating the sufferings of the victims of the "Eastland" disaster, a letter from the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) was read, informing the Vybor of the appropriation of $500 out of the Beseda's treasury for the Vybor's fund and enclosing a resolution of condolence. This is the first time the Ceska Beseda, an organization for purely social purposes, has suspended its rules and appropriated the greater part of its ready money for charity.</p>
   <p>The resolution reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"In view of the great sorrow in our midst following the catastrophe of the Steamship "Eastland," which caused the loss of so many lives, the Ceska Beseda has adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the membership of the Ceska Beseda express their heartfelt sympathy for the families, relatives, and friends of all those who perished in the disaster. This resolution to be entered on the records of the Ceska Beseda.</p>
   <p>"(Signed) Joseph Holpuch, president,</p>
   <p>"Frank Mayer, secretary."</p>
   <p>The resolution was adopted in a special plenary meeting of the Ceska Beseda held July 28, 1915.</p>
   <p>It was decided to send a letter with a request for financial support to all better situated Bohemian businessmen, lawyers, physicians, and other well-to-do countrymen.</p>
   <p>The Vybor has been advised that a large number of individuals and organizations are planning to arrange parties for the benefit of the relief fund, but the Vybor has expressed the opinion that it will not be in a position to give its name to such undertakings because it could not supervise and control them. For the same reason, the Vybor declares itself unable to authorize any individuals to conduct collections of funds in the Vybor's name. Of course, the committee will be glad to receive money collected by private individuals and bodies as such.</p>
   <p>The legal committee reported that, in all probability, the heirs of the victims will not get more than $15,000 (that is the value of the ship), which will mean only a few dollars per victim. This committee discourages the filing of suits against anybody until it is definitely known that there is hope, not only of receiving a judgment, but also of collecting the money.</p>
   <p>The Vybor will meet again today (Tuesday), and all members are urged to attend the meeting.</p>
   <p>The treasurer reported having $7,378.70 in the bank.</p>
