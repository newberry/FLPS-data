   <p>The evening of music and speeches arranged by the Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Karel Jonas(The Sokol Karel Jonas Gymnastic Association) on Saturday night was a complete success. Our countrymen, both from Cicero and Chicago, came in large numbers to hear the excellent band of the Sokol Karel Jonas and the speech of Mr. J. Tvrzicky-Kramer.....</p>
   <p>Thus, his arguments in behalf of the political movement to liberate the Bohemian nation, and his discussion of conditions now prevailing in the old country, held his audience in rapt attention.....</p>
   <p>The final number on the program of this successful meeting was a one-act dramatic sketch presented by the dramatic section of Sokol Karel Jonas.....</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the financial proceeds of the affair will please the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organizers, and that Sokol Karel Jonas will continue working for the noble cause, for the freedom of Bohemian lands.....</p>
