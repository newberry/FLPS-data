   <p>The Bohemian-American National Council, which up to now centered almost all of its activities upon its organization, is gradually taking on the shape of a finished body, which, by its form, indicates what purpose it will serve. In the last meeting of the Bohemian-American National Council, held in Libuse hall on 12th and Robey Streets last Tuesday evening, the executive committee approved several important plans for the beginning of activities. These will surely be accepted by the entire patriotically inclined Bohemian public with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The meeting was brought to order by Mr. E. St. Vraz, the organizer, and chairman of the Bohemian-American National Council. He welcomed the members present, <span class="page-break">2</span>and announced that during the sixty days since the organization of this advisory national council, much work had been done. The organization of the body had almost been completed, and activities will gradually commence. Mr. Vraz, in his opening speech, spoke a few heartfelt words to those present. He made no secret of the fact that during the work of organization he experienced both pleasure and disappointment, because he found people enthusiastic about the cause, and also people who were cool toward it, or even unfriendly, who criticized and destroyed everything.</p>
   <p>"We want to work in the field of evolution, and not revolution," said Mr. Vraz. "We want to do a certain piece of work, and the fatherland looks to us with expectancy. We counted on the Sokols, but up to now, they do not want to understand our idea, although we were depending a great deal on their cooperation. It is fear, perhaps, that we might try to dictate to the Sokols, but that is a groundless fear, because we are servants wishing to take upon ourselves a part of the burden. Our aims are beautiful, but thus far enthusiasm is not so general as we had hoped. It seems to me that I was somewhat mistaken in the patriotism <span class="page-break">3</span>of American-Bohemians."</p>
   <p>Whereas it is not possible immediately to commence activity in all departments of the Bohemian-American National Council, the organizer proposed that activity be started first of all in the field of enlightenment among the young people, and in immigration matters. Professor Jar. J. Zmrhal, secretary of the department of enlightenment, moved that in this respect work be commenced immediately from the very beginning, gradually and surely. First, it is necessary for Americans to learn the truth about us, for there are very few Americans who are acquainted with the Bohemians, or the real facts about them. Work should begin with the maturing American youth. A selection of stereopticon slides and lectures should be provided in the public schools. Professor Zmrhal reasoned that the early impressions made in the youth are retained in their minds longest, and in view of the fact that we have about 250,000 school children in Chicago, acquaintance with the Bohemians would spread very rapidly through the younger generation. If then, the same method is used in other cities throughout America, in a few years Americans will have an entirely different conception about us than they now have.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Further Professor Zmrhal recommended seeing to it that books, written in an interesting manner, containing fragments of Bohemian history, old Bohemian stories, are provided. Books of a similar kind dealing with all sorts of nationalities are provided for the public schools. There are many of them, but there is not one among them dealing with anything Bohemian. It would be best to translate some of the best Bohemian books on history and mythology, and see to it that they are put on the school supplementary reading list, which would not be a matter impossible of accomplishment.</p>
   <p>Further something is to be done for the immigrants. Many countrymen are moving here, who,being unfamiliar with local conditions, are becoming the victims of their own ignorance, and are taken advantage of by unconscionable people. It would be good to provide an information book about local conditions, containing important laws and other information.</p>
   <p>He also called attention to an altogether new field of activity, which, as he says, is overgrown with vegetation and grass, because nothing has thus far been <span class="page-break">5</span>done upon it. He refers to the good translation of Bohemian literature into English. Thus far, we have nothing translated into English. Between Bohemia and America, is an immeasurable flood of Germanism, so that is is difficult to receive anything. For example: we see that it took years before "Prodana Nevesta" (The Bartered Bride) reached the American stage.</p>
   <p>Also it should be endeavored to have the Bohemian language taught not only at the University, but at the high schools also. At the University, all that is needed is a request from Bohemian students. Today, for example, there are twenty Bohemian students at the University of Illinois, who would be furnished a professor of the Bohemian language if they desired it, but not a single one of them is interested in it. After Bohemian has been introduced at the University, it will be easily introduced into the high schools.</p>
   <p>These proposals were discussed and approved in the original sense, because they were found to be practical and enlightening by all members. The immigration department will now work for their actual realization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In regard to the stereopticon pictures, Mr. Vraz announced that it was difficult to obtain good Bohemian stereopticon pictures, because he is making a collection with great difficulty, having the aid of the best artists, still it will be a long time before he has it complete for his lectures. It was finally decided that Mr. Vraz, at the conclusion of his lectures, would loan them for the purposes of the schools.</p>
   <p>During the debate about Bohemian in the high schools, it was pointed out that the Poles have succeeded in having their language introduced as a study in the high schools. Mr. Kralovec, a member of the school board, was asked what per cent of Polish students attend high schools. He said that as yet there were no statistics available in that respect, but that he is informed from reliable sources that there is a very small number of Polish students represented in the high schools. The Bohemian students far outnumber them. In this matter, nothing can be done this year, but there is hope that the Bohemian language can be introduced in the high schools. Some societies of other nationalities have already requested the introduction of their languages as study courses in the high schools, but none <span class="page-break">7</span>of the Bohemian societies has made such a request as yet. On the motion of Mr. Vraz, a committee of three members was elected to work in behalf of this matter. The committee was made up of Messrs. Kralovec, Stepina, and Professor Zmrhal.</p>
   <p>A motion by Mr. Stepina was then approved. The motion refers to the purchase of all Bohemian books by the Public Library so that we will be represented there as are other nationalities, because we are entitled to such representation, and it will be given to us, if we request it.</p>
   <p>A communication from the Karel Havlicek Borovsky Monument Association was then read in which the Bohemian-American National Council is asked to accept the sponsorship of the unveiling festivities, or at least to cooperate. The communication was accepted, and Mr. Vraz, was elected as the representative. At the same time, a communication from the Association for a sane Fourth of July celebration was accepted, and Mr. Vraz, was elected to represent the Bohemian-American National Council.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>An agitation committee for the Havlicek festival was elected, and its members are Messrs. Vraz, Vopicka, Dr. Radesinsky, Ort, Kosar, and Professor Zmrhal.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the information committee should work for the establishment of a Bohemian immigrant museum. The chairman and members of the various departments of the Bohemian-American National Council were then named. However, that work was not finished, therefore, it is to be discussed again at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, it will be sufficient if the Committee for Enlightenment, the Committee for Youth, and the Committee on Immigration, work on the above noted plans, because the work they have in charge is certainly great and far reaching. The rest of the committees will start activities as soon as they have been appointed, and as soon as financial means indicate that the Council should develop its activities in full.</p>
   <p>The chief concern is the financial means, which are necessary for the work to be <span class="page-break">9</span>carried on. For that reason, it is necessary that societies and individuals apply for membership in the Bohemian-American National Council, and support it, both morally and materially.</p>
   <p>Every Bohemian society, which deposits a registration fee of five dollars and agrees to pay two dollars a year, will have the right to send its delegate to the Bohemian-American National Council.</p>
   <p>Societies wishing to be represented by their Grand Lodges or Groups will leave the selection of the representative up to the central body.</p>
   <p>Any compatriot who is proposed by three members of the Executive Committee, and subsequently accepted by the whole committee, may become an active member of the Bohemian-American National Council. The dues of such members are voluntary as to amount, except as to a minimum, which is five dollars a year. This also applies to trustees residing outside of Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Contributing members are also accepted in the Bohemian-American National Council. Any compatriot, who is willing to support the Council, and pay at least two dollars a year, may become a contributing member.</p>
   <p>Although contributing members have no voice,they are entitled to attend all mass meetings, and national celebrations given by the Bohemian-American National Council.</p>
   <p>Registration, membership dues, and voluntary contributions should be sent to the treasurer of the Bohemian-American National Council, Mr. Joseph Triner, 1333 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In view of the grand endeavors, and the development of welfare activities of the Bohemian-American National Council, it is desirable that every patriotically inclined Bohemian should become a co-worker and contribute his marc toward the work.</p>
