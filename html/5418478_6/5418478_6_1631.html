   <p>p. 1 - col. 6.. An enthusiastic group of young Bohemian people of Chicago have organized a genuine national Bohemian Club, which will be known under the name of "Cest" (meaning Honor). The purpose of this club will be to educate its members, by teaching them the Bohemian language, by holding educational lectures, and by encouraging them to read Bohemian literature. It also intends to give theatrical plays annually or semi-annually, the proceeds of which would be turned over to some worthy cause as to some Bohemian benevolent undertaking.</p>
   <p>The aim of this club is indeed a lofty one. The hard work of this young group will surely bear fruit and the club will be a success, if all its members continue to work in the future, with such enthusiasm and harmony as they display at present.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Farsky is given the most credit for the organization of this club, because it was his idea which originated it. He is a Bohemian teacher who has taken part in many Bohemian activities in Chicago.</p>
