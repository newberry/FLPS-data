   <p>The news about a terrible catastrophe which, as we learn, is of much larger dimensions than the one caused by the fire in the Iroquois Theater, spread with lightning speed throughout Chicago in the early hours of yesterday morning. The catastrophe will bring sorrow and despair to many Bohemian families.....</p>
   <p>The Lake Michigan steamer "Eastland" had almost three thousand passengers, who were almost exclusively employees of the Western Electric Company. This company has its enormous plants in a district now predominantly inhabited by our countrymen, many of whom are working in its plants. The steamer turned over on its side and all those who were on the deck were swept into the water, while those who were in the cabins were trapped, and few of them were saved.....</p>

   <p>....Because the news about the catastrophe spread with lightning speed, our countrymen, even in the distant districts, knew about it shortly after eight in the morning. The details of the news had the most profound effect in Bohemian California, in the Lawndale district, in Morton Park, New Tabor, Marigold, and in the whole of Cicero, where many of our countrymen appear to be stricken by the catastrophe. A very large number of our countrymen who work for the Western Electric Company have their homes in those parts, and left them early yesterday morning in order to participate in the excursion that proved fatal to so many. Naturally, therefore, there was a great deal of excitement in these districts, even panic in some of them, including even the Pilsen district, Town of Lake and the Little South Side.....</p>
   <p>Sad, extremely sad, was our duty as reporters when, guided by information received from various sources, we started tracing down our countrymen whose names were on the lists of those drowned and missing. In almost every family we visited, we witnessed heartbreaking scenes of sorrow and despair; every where <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>were eyes reddened by tears; and questions, were asked and requests were made for definite news about their members.....</p>

   <p>Those Saved</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: A list of forty-eight persons saved from the waves, and, in some cases, a description of the manner in which they were saved are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Participants Were Members of Hawthorne Club</p>
   <p>The excursion was arranged by the Hawthorne Club, whose membership is available to the employees of the Western Electric Company exclusively. One of the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>organizers was our countryman, Karel Borovsky.....</p>
   <p>Excursions similar to the one planned for yesterday are arranged by the Western Electric Company every year.....</p>
   <p>Over 6,600 tickets were sold for the excursion....According to Mrs. Borovsky, there are over 3,000 Bohemians employed by the Western Electric Company.....</p>
   <p>The number of drowned is estimated variously at two to three hundred people, but it may prove to be even four or five times as great.....</p>
