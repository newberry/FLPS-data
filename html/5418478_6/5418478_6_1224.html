   <p>With regard to the occasion of the memorable gathering of Chicago Czechs in the Pilsen Brewery Park on May 16 of this year, we wish to express our thanks to all those who so generously contributed to the patriotic cause. We are voicing our gratitude to every individual and to the various business associations and enterprises. We feel especially obliged to the management of the Pilsen Brewery Park, which leased the premises for only a nominal rental fee. We also include the Chicago Czech language paper, Denni Hlasatel, for the free and lavish publicity given to the affair. The printing shop of the Czech monastic order of St. Benedict furnished all printed leaflets, tickets, and posters free of charge. We further extend our thanks to Professor J. Pribil, to the excellent orchestra under Mr. J. Svec, the octet of the Club Rieger, to the ladies of the Pevecka Jednota Antonin Dvorak (Antoni Dvorak Singing Society), to the members of the St. Agnes <span class="page-break">\2</span>branch of our organization, and to several ladies who worked with particular zeal for the success of the affair.</p>
   <p>Executive Committee of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics.</p>
