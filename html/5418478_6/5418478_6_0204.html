   <p>Over five hundred ladies from our Czech Chicago society gathered in the Pilsen Brewery Park yesterday afternoon. The occasion was a "strawberry feast" arranged by the Ladies' section of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) for the benefit of the poor and destitute in our community.</p>
   <p>There was a very entertaining program, consisting of several selections of music and recitations. Mrs. M. Sokol is chairman of the Ladies' section. Others conspicuous in the activities of this organization, and present at the affair were: Mrs. R. Sedlacek, Miss Helen Weiner, Mrs. Slavka Svoboda, Mrs. A. Nering, Miss Mamie Hajicek, Mrs. A. Cervenka. Mr. Jan Weicher, Jr., violin virtuoso, appeared on the program with Miss X. Weicher assisting. Several other ladies contributed to the success of the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the Municipal court, in an address <span class="page-break">2</span>appealed to the gathering in behalf of the Czech Branch of the American Red Cross.</p>
   <p>The "strawberry feast" will serve as a stimulant, and will surely be followed by other similar charitable entertainments.</p>
