   <p>Last week's contributions to the activities of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) amounted to more than one thousand dollars, evidence that the understanding in regard to our cause is growing.....</p>
   <p>The largest donation, five hundred dollars, came from the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity). If we take into consideration the fact that most of the members of the Jednota are workingmen, the moral value of the donation is, of course, much greater.....</p>

   <p>The Press Committee of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, which is undertaking also the work of the lately disbanded Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American <span class="page-break">2</span>Press Bureau), is getting into full stride and developing most energetic activity. Mr. J. Tvrzicky-Kramer was elected its chairman. He is also the secretary of the Narodni Sdruzeni. The secretaryship of the Press Committee has been given to our tireless worker, Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka. The Press Committee began its work by mailing releases to all Bohemian-American newspapers. Its next step will be to mail to all Canadian newspapers letters containing valuable general information concerning the international situation as regards Bohemians, explaining the attitude of the nation toward the war, and requesting the recognition of the Bohemians who live in Canada as friends and allies, not Austrians. In order to increase the working capacity of the committee, the following men have been asked to co-operate: For the Slovaks, Mr. Stepan Osusky, Mr. Karel Pergler of Cresco, Iowa, and Mr. J. Martinek, editor of Pravo (The Right) of Cleveland, Ohio. The committee also succeeded in signing up a number of European correspondents. It is now contacting a number of American scientists with requests for articles about Bohemians which it is planing to have published in the American English-language press.</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni is working on the text of a protest against the <span class="page-break">3</span>well-known "Appeal" [to the President and Congress to proclaim an embargo on the export of war materials]. A draft of this protest has been signed by all Bohemian-American and some other foreign-language newspapers.</p>
