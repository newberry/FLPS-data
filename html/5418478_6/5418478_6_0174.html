   <p>While making every effort to win the war and so down the enemy beyond our land, we should not forget the other enemy lurking within the borders of this country. We mean privation. Rising prices of food and clothing will be felt doubly in the wintertime.</p>
   <p>Everyone of us should help the contest which is being conducted by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association). The proceeds from this charitable enterprise will go to the needy of our community.</p>
