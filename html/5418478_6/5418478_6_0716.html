   <p>Criminal statistics of Czech Chicagoland have recently revealed an astonishing record. The sad fact remains that the undesirable credit for this record goes to boys who only a short time ago were still holding on to their mothers' apron strings. There is now a number of boys of Czech descent in the reformatory in St. Charles, Ill., whose misdeeds could easily stand comparison with those of any full-fledged criminal.</p>
   <p>Two new sad acquisitions were made to that institution: Boys of eighteen, nineteen years, both from the neighborhood of 27th Street, between Troy Street and Turner Avenue. They were convicted of robbery and gun-toting.</p>
