   <p>In every State and City of the United States, preparations are being made for collections for the soldiers who are in the trenches abroad, and also those just leaving for the battlefields. The men are fighting for democracy and offering their lives so that militarism will be beaten, and the small nations now under the yoke of despotism will be liberated. The entire American press is urging the public to do its share. Various organizations and many individuals are arranging collections, both public and private, so that love gifts and Christmas presents can be sent to those heroes.</p>
   <p>It is our paramount duty to think of the many fellow-countrymen who are "over there," to think of those who are leaving, and of the thousands who will join them later. He who follows up the names of these young men will find that a large number of them are of Czech, Slovak, Polish or other Slavonic descent. It is not improbable that many of our fellow-countrymen here will have one or several good friends or acquaintances among those in the trenches in France or Russia. He will be thinking of them, and so will they of him. Any token of good will and friendship that reaches the men in the trenches is a sign that their people have not forgotten them, and will mean an encouragement to them.</p>
   <p>All the foreign language papers of the United States are collaborating in the program designed to make the collection an effective one. Each individual or organization wishing to contribute may fill out the coupon on this page and mail it to the office of the Denni Hlasatel. Only gifts of real usefulness are solicited. We are confident that all our Czech fellow-countrymen will generously respond to this appeal.</p>
