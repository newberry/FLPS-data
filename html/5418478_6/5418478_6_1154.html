   <p>(1) The name. Heretofore, the title of the Czech National Alliance was changed to the Czechoslovak National Alliance only for the reason that this title includes all of the races of our Nation, among the Czechs, the Moravians, the Silesians, and especially the brother Slovaks. Brother Slovaks asked for this change during 1917, but at that time our revolutionary actions had not been completed, and we were unable to satisfy them for tactical reasons.</p>
   <p>In the ethnography and science in general, the Czechs with the Moravians, the Silesians and the Slovaks, form one Nation, therefore, this new title is correct, not only from the standpoint of ethnography, but also from the standpoint of philology.</p>
   <p>(2) The purpose. In the new rules and regulations, our purpose is set forth in these words: The Czechoslovak National Alliance in America is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>an organization of the liberal Czechoslovakian people in the United States, Canada, South and Central Americas. It is taking care of their cultural and social needs, and is a propagator of American democracy. We mention this because our adversaries blame the convention for not accepting the title of "freethinking people," and are not satisfied because the Czechoslovak National Alliance organization was pronounced as "liberal" only. Anyone who is not paltry knows that such an all-national organization such as the Czechoslovak National Alliance has been and is, which has served the people and the Nation, should not debate with anybody about were words when real work is concerned, but it must see to the organization of the greatest possible number of people of good will. Nevertheless, we do explain that the word "liberal" is not only more modern, but also much more comprehensive for the program of the all-national organization, which cannot persist on precedents and serve the interest of certain factions only. The word "liberal" always means some improvement or correction, or step ahead from the old and unsatisfactory forms, and is also commonly used in the old country.</p>

   <p>(3) Members. Any society which gives its moral and financial support, and promotes the ideals of the Czechoslovak National Alliance can be a member of our branches, providing that its representative attends the branch meetings regularly. We especially call attention to this because of existing rumors that by introducing this direct membership we were excluding our Czechoslovak societies which have done so much for our action. It is apparent that this is not the case. Only the make up of our district committee and our central committee have been altered.</p>
   <p>It cannot be otherwise in an organization which must have a solid foundation, because not even a house can be built from the roof down, but always from the ground up.</p>
   <p>(4) Financial report. The central office of the Czechoslovak National Alliance has placed all of its accounts and treasury books with the convention, together with the detailed report for the period of its existence <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to be worked up by an accountant expert. The accounts books and the report were examined by the auditing committee and found to be correct. The auditing committee then recommended the publication of all these items, which afterward were voted on in the convention.</p>
   <p>(5) In the Czechoslovak National Alliance, there is no secrecy at all. The central committee is publishing information about the meetings and reports financial standing in its monthly journal, Poselstvi, every month. This journal will be given free to each member of the Czechoslovak Alliance.</p>
   <p>(6) The work of our people also was brought up and properly appraised by the convention according to this resolution: Therefore, it is further agreed to ask our public not to become idle, but go to work and help finish this beautiful task which will be an honor to us in the ages to come.</p>
   <p>(7) This is not the end of our tasks. The Czechoslovak National Alliance <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>has not ceased its work yet. We need this organization now as much as we needed it during the War, especially for cultural work in the Czechoslovak America. Read over the records of our convention, and you will agree with us that if we did not have an organization like the Czechoslovak National Alliance we would be forced to create one.</p>
   <p>Dear friends! You, who helped us during the War so unselfishly, do not put your hands on your lap. Only with your help were we able to bring our revolutionary actions to a successful end.</p>
   <p>Now Czechoslovakia is a free Nation, and today every one of us can proudly call himself a Czechoslovak. Continue to work with us. Our Czechoslovak National Alliance is active, although it does not give publicity to every incident or issue concerning its achievements. If it is to carry on, if our nation is to be properly represented in this country, the aid of all of you will be needed. Every one of us counts, for all of us belong to one and the same nation. Remember that we all have promised Thomas G. Masaryk, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the Grand Old Man, on the occasion of his visit here that we shall not give up, but that we shall persevere to the end. Remember that only a Czechoslovak, who is fully conscious of his national sentiment, can be a loyal American.</p>
   <p>Friends: If the fate and welfare of the American branch of the Czechoslovak people is near to your heart, do not cease to work for our cause, but support us as you have done up to the present. What we have been able to accomplish is to your own credit. Do not scorn or belittle your Czech national heritage. Elect representatives for your prospective branch so as to keep informed about our activities. Do not forget Josef (Joseph) Kajetan Tyl, who helped awaken our national consciousness by many stirring words, one of which says: "All our steps must be guided by love for the nation, and by thought of the people's happiness."</p>
