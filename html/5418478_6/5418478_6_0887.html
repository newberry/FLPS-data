   <p>More than once have we remarked in this very place that it is wrong to rely on preserving the Bohemian ways of life and the Bohemian language here in America while we know that very little, and in some respects absolutely nothing, is being done toward that end. For this we have been censured in various quarters with the remark that we love to criticize and love to criticize most where no criticism is necessary. But censure is not refutation, for refutation requires the presentation of proofs of the fallacy of the statement or opinion in question. Have such proofs ever been offered to us? No. Had they been, we should have abandoned our opinion, or at least we should have revised it in the proper manner. Our opinions have merely been censured, never refuted; it is therefore quite natural that we have not changed them, and that we propose to criticize even where some people think no criticism is needed.</p>
   <p>Therefore we are turning again to the painful and still open wound of the preservation of our national life. We do so in the hope that this time we shall reach at least a few persons who will take notice of our criticism and give to it some consideration. We do so with the conviction that not all those around us are deaf and blind; in fact, we believe that there are around us a goodly number of those who do not mind opening their ears and their eyes when they have the opportunity to hear about conditions and apprehend facts which are submitted to them with the best intentions. More than once have we said that we propose to discuss everything that is going on around us and while trying to be impartial to discuss and call attention both to agreeable and to disagreeable issues and questions, and the latter are much more plentiful than the former. There is one thing that we have frequently noticed: complaints, and no doubt fully justified complaints, that very little is being done among us toward the preservation of our Bohemian national life in America, where no longer so many immigrants arrive as in former years, and it was the newly arrived immigrants who were the core of our national life. These complaints, amounting to a confession of guilt, are sincere, but they are nothing more than a confession. Nothing has been done to revive the waning strength and to refresh the withering blossoms of our national life.</p>
   
   <p>We appear to be fond of using every opportunity to talk about our Bohemian schools. We like to talk about the fact that their number has been growing every year, but we stop right there, saying nothing about the results which they are accomplishing. It is very praise-worthy and meritorious to take care of our children, to see to it that they know how to read and write Bohemian, to make them able to talk with us in our native language, the language that we have inherited from our ancestors. Since this is not a matter of indifference to us, we should not stop there; we should go a step farther. We should see to it that the knowledge of the Bohemian language is backed up by something deeper, something more substantial and permanent, principally by a national feeling, without which the Bohemian language is nothing more than a hollow sound, a body without a soul. To create such a feeling in our youth is a difficult and very complicated task, for it involves a number of circumstances which we cannot control, and which stand in the way of our best efforts. But there are also circumstances within ourselves which are in our way. Let us not forget that there are people among us who have nothing but ridicule and insult for everything ever so slightly connected with the old country, and who extol everything in this great America. They ridicule and insult the old country, our own cradle, right in the presence of the children and without the least embarrassment. Acting in that way, how can we expect our children to have a warm feeling, a deep esteem and respect for the mere language? Will they not feel that it is more of a burden to them than something that elevates, ennobles, and liberates?</p>
   <p>In saying this we have in mind more than our school children. Let us take a look at our more mature young people, the youth from which we recruit the new membership of our Bohemian associations. There are very many of them. Let us admit freely that in founding our societies and associations, our lodges and clubs, we have done so principally with the purpose of preserving, as long as we can, the Bohemian way of life, and with the Bohemian way of life also the Bohemian language. Are we following that purpose now? Have we ever followed it in the past? What do we propose to do about it in the future? What will the life in our associations be like in the near future when the Bohemian language is already disappearing from them when we, particularly our young people, use the English language in conversation? Is not this a phenomenon that should make us stop and think, stop and begin to consider the means of a rapid and thorough improvement? Anybody who is a member of any one of our associations will have to admit that the matter is just as we have described it. The Bohemian language is gradually being pushed out of our associations, to be replaced by the English language, which is being used with particular delight by the young members. That this is the case is best shown by the fact that the introduction of the English language as the official language has been discussed in a number of our societies.</p>
   <p>This should not be a matter of indifference to us. If we eliminate from our associations the Bohemian language, we shall eliminate with it the Bohemian ways of life, and there will be nothing Bohemian left in them but the name, and even the name frequently fails to remind us of anything Bohemian. We are not overstating it. We are simply stating it plainly. We assert, and it pains us to assert it, that the Bohemian language is about to disappear even from our Sokol halls, into which slowly but surely alien customs are finding their way, not only in parties, when the members gather for social purposes, but also in gymnastic drills and even in business meetings. And the Sokols are those who should be the guardians of the Bohemian ways of life and should preserve our sweet Bohemian tongue in this land where we are encircled by things foreign. This is more than we should tolerate. We must wake up, realize the danger, and give some evidence of pride and self-esteem. Without these two we shall have no life of our own.</p>
   <p>Let us not be deaf and blind to everything that is going on around us. Let us open wide our eyes and ears, and when we see or hear that there is anything in that modest and meager life of ours that needs improving and correcting, let us try to correct and improve it. Let us not rely on anybody else to do it. Let us do it, every one of us, by himself and within himself. The sooner we begin, the better. Soon it may be too late to make a beginning. Soon we may have to reproach ourselves, to accuse ourselves for having been unable to preserve and conserve for ourselves that which we should have treasurer as our dearest and holiest possession, that of which the nationals of all countries are most proud, and which serves them for guidance on their way to more beautiful and nobler accomplishments in life.</p>
