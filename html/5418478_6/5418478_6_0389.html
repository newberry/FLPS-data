   <p>The distribution of Christmas presents by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) to poor Bohemian families will take place in the Pilsen Park Pavilion next Thursday at 2 P. M. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost will take care of all the families that are on its books; that is, each family that was supported by the Spolecnost this year will receive a Christmass basket. These families will be invited by post card to come for their baskets. There will be a Christmas tree awaiting them in the Pavilion, and each child will receive a Christmas present. The children will receive an invitation also. There are very many more families that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost would like to take care of and arrange happy Christmas holidays for, but its ability to do so depends on the support of its friends. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost has received many more requests for help than it can possibly provide for. It was agreed at the meeting held last Friday to give help to 172 families; in most cases, this assistance consists in paying the rent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In the December 1913 meeting, support was voted for only fifty families; the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost is therefore taking care of more than three times as many families this year.</p>
   <p>In December 1913, the Spolecnost had $7,079 in the treasury; today it has only $2,000, and a long winter is ahead of us. Without unselfish friends who are willing to help now, the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost will be unable to accomplish its noble task.</p>
   <p>The Christmas charities cannot be paid for out of the treasury; they must be defrayed by donations from individuals, families, and corporations.</p>
   <p>The meeting also reviewed the contributions which the Spolecnost received for its Christmas charities, and those present were greatly disappointed to learn that the Druzstvo Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetery) has completely forgotten the most important <span class="page-break">\3</span>charitable organization of Bohemian Chicago. The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost numbers among those whom it supports members of all organizations represented on the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, and is certainly fully deserving of consideration by such an organization as the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov.</p>
   <p>The Christmas tree committee of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost plans to arrange a program in connection with the distribution of Christmass presents to the children, and requests our artists, both amateur and professional, who are willing to help by presenting one or more entertaining numbers for the children, to send their names to the secretary, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, 2324 South Central Park Avenue.....</p>
