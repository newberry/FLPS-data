   <p>P.1--There is a long felt need among the Bohemian people of this city for a charitable organizations of a similar kind as those maintained by other nationalities. Our readers have, from time to time, read the moving appeals made by families. These were sporadic outcries of misery, and we gladly state, that they were never uttered in vain. At the same time, however, we must admit, that there were families, in whose homes prevailed dire need, and which instances were concealed from the public. We have among us numerous families, who have too much pride to display their condition in the eyes of those who could have extended help to them, no matter how innocent they themselves felt of their plight. We are well aware of the fact that many a mother is hardly in a position to give her children even one square meal a day. These mothers, for whom no one seems to care, to whom no one extends a helping hand, must earn a few cents by hard work, in order to keep their little ones from starving and at the same time not be able to care for the children at home during working hours, while sickness lurks to add gravity to their destitution.</p>
   <p>We know, that the deserted wives or widows, may apply to public charitable <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>institutions, from which they may receive assistance, occasionally, but never, even in the most favorable cases, do they receive sufficient aid, to enable their misery to be called as need only. Our Bohemian charitable organizations do not hesitate to take such families under their wings, since many of the needy formerly belonged to the same organizations; very often, however, the destitute stand isolated, exposed to poverty.</p>
   <p>The heads of many impoverished families are worthy men, who would gladly work, if they had the opportunity. It is generally believed, that he who wants work will find it. Do not fail to convince yourself that this is not so. Look at some of these fathers of families, and how they spend the hours in a vain search for work, becoming footsore standing in line, and clustering about the factories and storehouses, only to return to their families to say to them, that they were rejected in favor of others, who had the right "pull." It seems ridiculous that in order to obtain hard menial work it is often necessary to resort to favoritism. Just try to get a job in the Western Electric or in the McCormic works, and see how you will be swept aside, unless you can produce a recommendation of some kind. In short, some one of enough importance to sponsor you.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>These conditions will now be ameliorated by the founding of the Bohemian Charitable society (Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost), which, if properly supported,--and we heartily hope so--will be an aid society in the full sense of the word. There will be no more jobless fathers of Bohemian families, no starving women and children. It will not be necessary for our poor to beg for work to be repaid by a pitance of alms which is called "wages."</p>
   <p>Other nationalities have had these aid societies for many years, only we, have been tardy to establish our own. A few societies were organized on different occasions, it is true, but they soon disappeared, not by reason of lack of support, but because the basis of their activities had not been firmly layed down, along definite lines, upon certain indestructible principles.</p>
   <p>Now, we hold the best promises for the new society, and are determined to further its aims as best as we can. Last Friday, there met, in the offices of the bank house F. G. Hajicek, 26th street and Turner Ave., a group of men, fully conscious of the task before them, of who we are certain, will come up to its expectations. They were: F. G. Hajicek, Jos. Z. Klenha, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Vaclav Cihak, Joseph Z. Uhlir, Roman Sedlacek, John A. Cervenka, Anton J. Cermak, Vaclav Roubal, Jos. Stastny, Karel G. Foucek, Frank J. Petru, M. Novotny, Jos. Z. Pisa. The Bohemian press was represented by O. Fuerst of the Denni Hlasatel, Jaromir Psenka of the Svornost, and Thomas Kraus of the Narod. A great number of our countrymen who were not present at the meeting, assure us of their co-operation and ardent sympathy with the work to be done; of these we single out: W. Kolacka, Charles Vopicka, Ant. Jelinek, Jim. Kralovec, C. R. Jandus.</p>
   <p>The meeting was presided by Jos. Z. Uhlir, judge of the municipal court, who explained the aims of the society to be founded, and gave several examples from his judicial activity in support of the necessity of its creation. He laid special stress upon the collaboration of women, whom he expects to be staunch supporters of the cause.</p>
   <p>It behoves to report, that a meeting with the foundation in view had been held before, in which Messrs. Foucek, Cervenka and Hajicek were delegated to sound the attitude of the Bohemian press toward the planned society. Mr. Cervenka declared in the name of this investigating committee, that <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>he found the sentiment of the editors in perfect harmony with what should be expected from Bohemian journalists--guaranteeing smooth and full cooperation. This statement was acknowledged by the chairman as highly gratifying, while the representatives of the newspapers present voiced their approval. Thereupon Mr. Cervenka appealed to those present to consider, that only persistent work will bring the desired results and the reward that goes with a noble purpose achieved.</p>
   <p>Alderman Anton J. Cermak took the floor and subjected other nationalities to his criticism in regard to the treatment accorded by their charitable organizations to Bohemian destitutes. From his experience he gave the example of a boy whose life he had saved from the wheels of a train. This boy, as he noticed, had no underwear on his body, which was incredibly dirty. He brought him back to his family and he learned, that the father had abandoned his wife and three children, who were left to themselves, while the mother lay ill in bed. Several other cases, in his narration served to further prove the need of the establishment of a charitable organization. After a debate, in which the sound reasons for the proposed foundation were reiterated, Mr. Roubal made the motion to establish the organization <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>as a permanent, chartered body. After a short debate, in which Mr. Cervenka suggested a temporary organization to be followed by a permanent one after a general meeting, Mr. Roubal's motion for a permanent one carried. The officers of the society were nominated: J. Z. Uhlir president, Fr. J. Petru vice-president, John A. Cervenka vice-president for the distrist "Plzen" (Pilsen) and Vaclav Roubal for "Bohemian California."--Mr. Hajicek offered to pay for books and initial expenses of the society out of his own pocket.</p>
