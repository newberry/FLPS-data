   <p>An interesting report on the activities of the Ceskoslovansky Pomocny Vybor (Czechoslovakian Aid Committee) was made in yesterday's meeting. This patriotic organization obtained its charter in Chicago in August, 1914. Its aim is to provide relief for the families of soldiers, Czechoslovakian prisoners of War, etc. Many letters expressing gratitude for the manifold gifts distributed, and for the moral support lent, have been received.</p>
   <p>Many of our soldiers, the majority of them members of Sokol organizations, were deprived of the most urgent necessities and the most desired articles of comfort, as prisoners of war, until the Aid Committee came to lend them support.</p>
   <p>Each case application is thoroughly investigated to eliminate the possibility of aiding the undeserving. The Committee compiles a list of wounded, permanently crippled, and deceased soldiers, whose families are in dire need of help. This list is ever growing. Prison camps and military hospitals are <span class="page-break">\2</span>being supplied not only with necessities, but also with books, magazines, and newspapers.</p>
   <p>The Aid Committee does not hamper the activities of other charitable and patriotic organizations. It co-operates with the Czech National Alliance, which even contributes to the Aid Committee's collections. The support of the war widows and families of the maimed, not only here, but also in the old country, will be one of our main tasks. Two donations of twenty-five thousand dollars each have been promised to us for the support of the destitute in Czechoslovakia, after that country is liberated by the World War. Our collection which is to be donated to the Red Cross for a heavy ambulance, as a gift from the Czechs, is making excellent progress. Several inquiries as to prison camps have arrived from Czechs who would like to join the Czechoslovak Army. Systematic support of such men, our brother Sokols, should be crowned with success. We are in receipt of many letters from our soldiers on the various fronts. One of them, from the Saloniki front, expresses thanks for 3,402 francs sent by the Czechoslovakian Aid Committee.....</p>
