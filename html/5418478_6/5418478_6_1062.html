   <p>Our Czechoslovak legionnaires of Chicago have found a sincere advocate of their national aspirations in a sisterly organization which was organized in Chicago last week with the assistance of our nationally conscious women and girls, most of whom, during the last war, greatly helped to make our struggle for the independence of the Bohemian nation successful.</p>
   <p>All formal and routine business of the new group was dispensed with at the last meeting held Tuesday evening at the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall. Mrs. Antonie Cervenka, wife of the well-known national worker, Mr. John A. Cervenka, president of the Garden City Brewery, was unanimously elected president. It was also resolved that this new organization be known as the Damsky Odbor Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru v Chicago (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago). The next regular meeting of this new organization will be held in the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall next Tuesday <span class="page-break">2</span>evening. Those women and girls who intend to become members of this new national body are cordially invited to attend this meeting. Their applications will be accepted by Mrs. Anita Klepal, secretary, at the said meeting. Applications may also be sent by mail to the following address: Mrs. Anita Klepal, 1401 South Keeler Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
