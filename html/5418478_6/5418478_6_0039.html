   <p>Joseph Spika, one of our dear legionnaires, who after many years of trouble and hardships which he had to endure with many of our other boys in Siberia, who almost miraculously landed in Chicago, and who at the present time is lying in the County Hospital, will be happy. He was placed there by Dr. Thomas F. Farland, former interne of that hospital, who with the assistance of other doctors, will amputate Mr. Spika's left leg if it is found necessary. He will be convinced that he is not being left alone, that here he has a large community of friends and patrons who are remembering him not with alms but with donations toward an honor gift which will be given to him before his departure homeward. Up to yesterday the following donations were deposited in our office: [TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.--A list of donors follows.] Total $54.74.</p>
