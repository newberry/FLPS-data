   <p>P.1--The board of directors of the Bohemian Charitable Association, at last Friday's meeting, resolved to establish permanent headquarters suitable for that purpose in a spacious room, in the rear of Mr. Charles G. Foucek's drug store, which Mr. Foucek is placing at the disposal of the society, free of charge. The office will be opened tomorrow and perhaps, for a few days Mr. Foucek, will himself manage the business affairs of the society. The directors will seek suitable help of some kind, which will be engaged for the office. The directors' meetings, will take place in the future in the new office and this Friday's meeting, will be held there also.</p>
