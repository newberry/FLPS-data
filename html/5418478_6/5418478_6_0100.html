   <p>Our Czechoslovak Army in France is growing. Thousands of new volunteers are joining it. They come from Russia, released from war prison camps, and from America. They are doing their duty toward the old homeland and for civilization as a whole. The creation of the Czechoslovak Army has put a serious task before the Czechs and Slovaks of America. The demands are growing heavier, but the consciousness of our duty toward the Czechoslovak Army urges us on to still more vigorous activity and increased sacrificing generosity. Sincere love for our sacred cause and respect for the self-effacing heroism of our soldiers have prompted groups of our Chicago Czech women to organize into auxiliaries. There are the Vcelky (Little Bees) and other Slovak associations, that buy and produce useful articles and send them to Europe to allay the want of our boys.</p>
   <p>We can see, however, that these activities do not suffice. They lack the <span class="page-break">\2</span>necessary centralization and expansion. Centralization for us is of prime importance. The Czechoslovak National Council maintains a branch in New York from which the entire auxiliary work is directed in accordance with a definite plan. The time has come for us in Chicago to adopt similar methods and extend them to the regions farther west. All groups on the American continent are going to work concertedly, as branches of the Czechoslovak Auxiliary Committee of the New York Branch of the Czechoslovak National Council. Agitation, buying of material such as wool, cloth, etc., mailing, and other work, will from now on be directed from the New York headquarters.</p>
   <p>The new system is about to begin operation in this city. It was established on June 7, when all the bodies that work for the maintenance of the Czechoslovak Army met in the headquarters of the Czech National Alliance and combined to place themselves at the disposal of the Auxiliary Committee in New York. In the meeting there were delegates of the Vcelky from the Czech <span class="page-break">\3</span>National Alliance, the Vcelky from the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, and various Slovak auxiliaries from both the National and the Catholic factions. The Beseda Fric (Club Fric), which has always been associated with our relief movement, was also represented.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. F. Kubec, chairman of the Vojensky Vybor (Czechoslovak Military Committee), representing the Czechoslovak Army. The importance of our women's work in the movement was given due recognition, and the scope of their activities was outlined. Mr.Vojta Benes, school teacher [and organizer of the Czech National Alliance], then emphasized that three questions must be solved. First, how to organize Czech and Slovak women for efficient action; second, how to provide money for material; and third, what to produce from the material. Organization is the main thing. The clearer the purpose, the stronger our ranks will grow.</p>
   <p>A plan was adopted whereby all Chicago Czech and Slovak women's auxiliary groups are to be combined into one body to promote all work for the Czechoslovak <span class="page-break">\4</span>Army. This body will be active not only in Chicago, but will extend its influence to all districts in the western United States where affairs of the Czechoslovak Army are handled. Czech and Slovak women will be represented in this body by equal numbers of delegates. Thus, the National Slovaks and the Catholic Slovaks will have three delegates each. The Czechs will have three women for each of the Vcelky organizations. The Beseda Fric will also be represented.</p>
   <p>The resolution, in which the organization and the new plan were outlined, continues as follows:</p>
   <p>Our national military action relies and leans on our great women's organizations, and solicits their moral and financial support. Since our ladies' organizations have done so much meritorious work for our nation, it is their duty to continue by participating in the meetings of the newly formed body, our Central Committee. Some of our large organizations will be asked to send one delegate each to the Central Committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>This will bring the number of members to twenty. They will work under the direction of the New York Central Committee, endeavor to extend their influence to the Western States, and help in the creation of new branches in those parts of the country."</p>
   <p>The delegates for the Chicago Central Committee will have to be elected not later than June 21, since on that day a constitutional meeting of the newly formed Chicago body will be held in the offices of the Czech National Alliance, 26th Street and Millard Avenue, at 3 P.M. Statutes for this new body will be adopted and officers elected.</p>
   <p>We hope that by this organization, production for the Czechoslovak Army will be increased to ten times of its present volume. It will bring immense relief to our soldiers in France, for they are the first to whom our loving care is due.</p>
   <p>In doing this work, our women will be fulfilling their most sacred duty, not <span class="page-break">\6</span>only toward their motherland, but this country as well--this country, which is fighting for our Czech ideals, just as the Czechoslovak Army in France is battling for the ideals of this country.</p>
   <p>For all auxiliary organizations of Czech and Slovak ladies, The Czechoslovak Military Committee.</p>
