   <p>How about setting up a Christmas donation to Bohemia and Moravia as the goal of our collections? Our Christmas would be the happiest possible if we should celebrate it knowing that we have done a good deed by which several thousand families in the old country would profit. We cannot give them happiness and joy, for that we are too weak, and the catastrophe that befell them too great; but we may be able to dry the tears of many, mitigate their despair, rekindle their hopes. If we succeed in this, we shall have done a piece of work which will give us the purest of pleasures and real Christmas happiness.</p>
