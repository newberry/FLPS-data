   <p>Under the auspices of the Supreme Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Union) the usual New Years Day festival was held at Pilsen Hall on Ashland Avenue, where hundreds of lodge members and friends of the Union filled the great hall.</p>
   <p>These New Years Day celebrations have a deep meaning to us because of the opportunity offered for close contact with our sisters and brothers, where we may be refreshed with good entertainment and above all gain immeasurably because of contacts made with men and women--all prospective members of our union.</p>
   <p>At these yearly celebrations, our well-wishers are given a chance to evaluate our yearly work for humanity, and see and hear about the work done by our union to attain our ideals of humanity, fraternity, and self-sufficiency.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>In this respect, these celebrations are a means for propaganda; they help us gain new members; and, judging from the beautiful course of Saturday's entertainment and the enthusiasm displayed by everyone, the Grand Lodge of the Bohemian-Slavonic Union has gained all the objectives sought.</p>
   <p>The afternoon had really a holiday meaning; the cold, rainy weather made one feel quite cozy here.</p>
   <p>The busy managing committee prepared an interesting musical program, vocal and instrumental.</p>
   <p>The afternoon program was opened by the ochestra playing Verdi's overture "Nabuchodonosor". Mr. Kratochvil led the large orchestra.</p>
   <p>The playing of the first number seemed to put everyone into a jovial mood, which seemed to rise by degrees as the program went on.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society next sang Foerster's Velke, sire, rodne lany" (Broad fields of our native land) in such a captivating way that the audience applauded almost without end, so it seemed.</p>
   <p>We see that the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society have a new director. He is Mr. Josef Houdek, a man of kindly appearance; who is, above all, a remarkable director, whose efficiency we will observe many times in the future.</p>
   <p>The singing of this noted chorus was as tuneful as it always is, and the men confirmed again their remarkable reputation.</p>
   <p>As the singers left the stage, the audience applauding, the president of the Supreme Lodge, Mr. Evgen Frydl, who is a good speaker, had the pleasant duty of extending greetings to the audience. He appeared to be a very sympathetic person, and his words seemed to convey a meaning which could not be misunderstood.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In his sincere way, Mr. Frydl stressed the necessity for hard work among the membership to attain the new goals to be striven for during the year.</p>
   <p>Businessmen and manufacturers balance their books at the close of the year; so, too, our Union examines its work performed during the year, and so, too, do we expect work of even greater intensity in the new year, according to the speaker, Mr. Frydl.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frydl went on by saying that foreign associations now must be satisfied to state the fact that they have held their membership quotas, or are forced to admit a small decrease, whereas our Bohemian-American Union can show a membership increase, which is not as large as could be expected, because of restricted immigration, but which nevertheless, is quite encouraging.</p>
   <p>This increase in membership must be credited to the work of some of our members; among whom is Mr. Kalivoda, whose endeavors along these lines have <span class="page-break">\5</span>brought results in the form of over one hundred new members.</p>
   <p>The speaker commended Mr. Kalivoda for his efforts and exhorted others to greater activity.</p>
   <p>At the close of his address, Mr. Frydl wished all a "Happy New Year". That Mr. Frydl spoke sincerely was evident by the spontaneous applause when he finished speaking.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ruzena Fik delivered the next address, saying that she was happy to see the increase in membership of the Bohemian-American Union. Especially significant is the fact that the new members are young and in excellent physical condition.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Fik spoke of the work of the administrative officers; of the good results of their labors; of the performance of their duties for small remunerations as compared with those given by the large insurance companies who employ <span class="page-break">\6</span>highly paid officials and office help, where business is transacted in large offices where high rents are paid for their use. All these expenses of course must be paid by those insured, in contrast to our economy, which is reflected in our lower insurance rates.</p>
   <p>The speaker asked the assembly to bring up their children as true adherents of the Czech nation, and have them join our fraternal organizations in America which need new members to replace our thinning ranks. When Mrs. Fik finished her address, she received the same hearty applause as did the speakers who preceded her.</p>
   <p>A violinist stepped upon the stage to play. He was Mr. Vaclav E. Medek, a young Chicagoan graduated from the Prague Conservatory of Music. He played Dvorak's "Humoresque".</p>
   <p>Mr. Medek proved his artistry at a concert when he had first arrived in America after completing his studies in Prague. And, at this appearance, the <span class="page-break">\7</span>young artist again showed his worth by his superb playing of the ever popular selection.</p>
   <p>This violinist proved, by his beautiful playing, that he is a most worthy member of our artist colony. Mr. Medek was roundly applauded and had to give many encores.</p>
   <p>The principal speaker of the afternoon was Mr. Jan Jelinek. He was a very satisfactory speaker, and began with a reference to the sad plight of the Czech nation in the year 1915. Then he spoke of the purpose and benefits derived by members of our union as individuals , and then as members of a great body such as our Bohemian-American Union.</p>
   <p>The speaker made many references to our community life, which should evoke serious thought and consideration. When he ended his speech, he was applauded unstintingly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The next number on the program, played by the orchestra, was "Grand Potpourri," by R. Schepgrell, which composition is a so-called patchwork of many opera motives.</p>
   <p>After the orchestral selection, a young pianist stepped out on the stage; she was Miss Emma Trnka, and she played Chopin's "Ballad in A Flat Major".</p>
   <p>Her playing was a pleasant surprise for everyone present. With her finished technique and musical understanding she captivated all. When she finished playing, Miss Trnka was presented with a large bouquet of flowers, and was applauded so much that she was forced to give an encore.</p>
   <p>Mr. Janda, secretary of the Grand Lodge, presented his yearly report, and said that, since the last yearly meeting, the Union had lost by death one of its most efficient secretaries in the person of Mr. Josef Hrusa, who served in office many years; the speaker proposed that memory of the departed brother be honored by everyone rising and standing in silence for a short <span class="page-break">\9</span>while. This was done as requested.</p>
   <p>Mr. Janda went on with his order of business, saying that the Bohemian-American Union always supported Bohemian Free Thought schools, and was the first organization to adopt a monthly tax on each member for the schools' support.</p>
   <p>The speaker spoke of the members' interest in Czech affairs abroad and of the political action of the Czech nation in Europe.</p>
   <p>Five hundred dollars was donated by the Union for the work to free Bohemia, also it was agreed that every other worthy cause here in America should receive support.</p>
   <p>Jan Hribal, financial secretary of the Union, presented a very interesting and encouraging report which points to the good financial standing of the Bohemian-American Union.</p>
   <p>According to the financial secretary's report, the death benefit carried over from last year amounted to $11,063.20, which added to this year's surplus of <span class="page-break">\10</span>$68,564.57, totals $79,627.77. Of this amount, $79,510.60 has been disbursed, so that the cash on hand amounts to $4,117.17.</p>
   <p>After the reading of this report, Mr. Hribal made a recommendation that all Bohemian fraternal organizations combine to form one great union in the United States.</p>
   <p>This recommendation was received by all present with great applause.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Workingmen's Society again sang two beautiful songs for men's chorus; "Marjanka" (Marie) and "Kovarovic Andulka", (The Smith's Anna), which were very sympathetically received by the audience.</p>
   <p>Mr. Medek, the violinist, then played a difficult Hungarian Dance by Brahms, to the satisfaction of all.</p>
   <p>The pianist, Miss Trnka, sat down to play Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsody <span class="page-break">\11</span>Number 12". In the playing of this composition, the player showed her mastery of the very difficult passages in this brilliant composition.</p>
   <p>Entertainment of a lighter nature was supplied by Mr. Jan Kocan and Jan Studeny, with comic impersonations.</p>
   <p>The last number of the program was presented about five-thirty o'clock. Altogether this year's manifestation of the Bohemian-American Union was a very successful one, and the Grand Lodge and its protectorates may be congratulated upon the outcome of this memorable celebration.</p>
