   <p>The members of the Spolek Ceskych Dobraku (Society of Czech Good Fellows) are not only real Bohemian good fellows, but also men full of fun whose presence cheers their companions. It is, therefore, to be expected that a great many of our Czechoslovak people will attend the entertainment to be given by this Spolek tomorrow night at 8 P.M. in the Cesko-Slovensko-Americka Sin (Czech-oslovak-American Hall). Nobody who wants to have a good time will regret going to this entertainment. He can be sure that the Bohemian an Good Fellows' highly entertaining program will not bore him. The orchestra will be under the direction of Mr. V. Bastar. Admission is 50 cents per person.</p>
