   <p>We have lived through three years of fierce combat against a merciless foe, a barbarian murderer who for centuries has been bent upon enslaving our nation in order to hurl it into degrading subjection. Much has been accomplished during this period, and the lion's share of the credit rightfully belongs to our Czech women, who from the very beginning have grasped the great significance of our cause and have devoted their best efforts to help us in our work.</p>
   <p>The moment of rest has not yet arrived. As the final act of the world catastrophe approaches, it becomes necessary for us to exert our forces to the utmost so that the work shall not have been performed in vain, but shall be crowned with the success which we all are so eagerly anticipating--the liberation of our Czechoslovak motherland.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance, joined by the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>is making arrangements for a great bazaar to be held from May 11 to May 19 in the Pilsen Brewery Park. Our community's attention is centered upon our women; everyone is convinced that they will, as in the past, lend their aid to the enterprise and make it the most impressive demonstration of the Chicago Czechs' readiness for sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Czech women! May our words be echoed in your hearts!--you who have proudly sent and are still sending your sons across the ocean to the plains of free France in order to repel the German horde which is menacing the whole world--to fight in France under the red and white flag or under the starry banner of the United States, shoulder to shoulder with the Allied heroes, in order to avenge the wrongs perpetrated against our nation. You have made countless sacrifices for your nation. We are convinced that you will continue on our side to the victorious end. May the bazaar find you to be, as always, a mighty pillar, assuring the success that its cause deserves.</p>
   <p>Great are the deeds of women of mighty nations during this terrible war.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The Czech nation, too, will point with pride to its women who have worked untiringly, guided by the beacon of one idea: Independence and liberty of our nation.</p>
   <p>On to work! Your hands have always wrought the most beautiful creations!</p>
   <p>The Arrangements Committee</p>
