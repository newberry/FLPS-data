   <p>Our oldest Czech brewery, Atlas, played at being St. Nicholas yesterday and endowed our humanitarian and most urgent cultural needs with a welcome gift which will surely meet with the sincere acknowledgment of all enlightened Czechs. The Atlas Brewery made a New Year's donation of one hundred dollars to the Old People's Home and Orphanage; one hundred dollars to St. Joseph's Orphanage in Lisle, Illinois; one hundred dollars to the Bohemian-American Press Bureau. The old homeland was not forgotten either, and its most important defense institution Vstredni Matice Skolska (Central Educational Council) was endowed with two hundred Austro-Hungarian gold crowns. This New Year's gift of our most widely known large corporation deserves not only general recognition, but it should also serve as an example to many of our other large commercial and industrial enterprises.</p>
