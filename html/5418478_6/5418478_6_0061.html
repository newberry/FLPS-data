   <p>It is with regret that I must say that the donations for suffering children and countrymen in Vienna, Austria, are not coming in as fast as they are needed and, therefore, I beg of you once more, to please remember these people in Vienna, who are always faithful to our nation. Please help--help quickly--send your gifts directly to Vienna--only those who find it burdensome, should send their gifts to my address. I have received, and I am sending the following amounts to Vienna via Prague. [List of names of contributors and amounts of contributions follows]; total, $70.50. Further and urgent contributions are solicited by E. St. Vraz, 1817 South Millard Avenue, Chicago.</p>
