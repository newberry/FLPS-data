   <p>Surrounded by a "Chinese wall" of railroad tracks through which firemen have no sufficient passages in case of a fire, overloaded with taxes, with which the city administration burdened us, and still intends to load more of them upon us, we are forced to organize ourselves, and to rise and to protest as a body. For this reason, we have founded, as has been done in other Wards, the Czechoslovak Taxpayers' Association of the Twelfth Ward. This meeting took place at the premises of Mr. John Hronek, 2659 West Eighteenth Street. This association is a nonpolitical body, which strives to promote the general welfare, and we are urging all the property owners who live in the Douglas Park vicinity and who are not our members yet to attend our meeting which will be held on Saturday, February 21, and to join our ranks. Do not think that somebody will do anything for you. Only a powerful organization is able to protect you. We also openly are urging the aldermen of our Ward to attend this meeting. We will explain <span class="page-break">\2</span>and report on the Ogden Avenue matter, and also report on the actions of our city administration as everyone of us is looking for improvements.</p>
