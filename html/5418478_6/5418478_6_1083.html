   <p>Our readers are well-informed about the outbreak of the recent ill-omened dispute between the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago and the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America), to be exact, between the Czechoslovak Legionnaires and the officers of the latter institution. We published a report of the meeting called by the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago two weeks ago and so far we have also published proclamations and resolutions from both sides without exception. Today, again, we merely report on yesterday's meeting and we leave it to our readers to form <span class="page-break">\2</span>their own opinions about this unhappy incident, which recently so much excited our people. Nevertheless, we firmly believe that through yesterday's meeting the dispute will be settled forever, as it is surely desired for the benefit of our nation.</p>
   <p>At the hour set for the meeting, Pilsen Park Pavilion was crowded. That the Arrangements Committee had prepared for any eventuality, was evidenced by the presence of several Bohemian policemen from the Lawndale Station led by the police sergeant. Albert Mikes. They, by their tactful handling of the situation, deserve all credit for having made it at all possible to carry on the meeting and to bring it to a conclusion. It appeared as though the meeting would be forcibly ended at any moment on account of the turmoil created as a result of several imprudent remarks made by some of the speakers. The negative standpoint of the Arrangements Committee, who absolutely ignored the request of Legionnaires to give them an opportunity to speak, aroused great excitement and ill feeling among those present, but the Legionnaires finally compelled the Arrangements Committee to <span class="page-break">\3</span>recognize them. This was noisily approved by the audience. Because frequently a great disturbance was created, the Arrangements Committee was afraid to continue this meeting; therefore, the president of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe abruptly ended the meeting and left the stage, followed by the other representatives and guest speakers who did not have an opportunity to speak. Their departure was accompanied by ostentatious applause and by loud calls of "Shame on you!" But the meeting was not ended by their departure. The Legionnaires took the floor and after several speeches the meeting was brought to an orderly conclusion.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Dr. Joseph P. Pecival, who in a few brief words explained its purpose. But by a few of his words, the Legionnaires present felt that they had been insulted and the turmoil started right there. Dr. Joseph P. Pecival proclaimed that the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe has always fulfilled its duties and therefore he would not tolerate the criticism of a few individuals who think they know it all. In the general turmoil and the confused shouting, the president of the Czechoslovak <span class="page-break">\4</span>Legionnaires, Mr. Ludvik Kaderka, jumped on the stage and together with Dr. Pecival restored order. Mr. Kaderka then started to speak. He said that at the time their meeting was called, the Legionnaires invited the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe to send its representatives to that meeting; therefore, they were justified in asking for the privilege to speak and to explain their standpoint. "They were good enough to shed their blood on European battlefields, but they are forbidden to criticize the gentlemen of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe." The Arrangements Committee interrupted his speech and vigorously requested the speaker to leave the speaker's stand, but a noisy approval was heard from the audience, which invited the speaker to stay there.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Placek, president of the Americka Obec Sokolska (American Sokol Union), then took the speaker's stand. In his speech he requested freedom of speech for those against whom such a serious indictment is charged, because such an opportunity is not denied even the worst rascals.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Further, he defended the indicted trio of workers of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe and asserted that they had fulfilled their duties, which was acknowledged by the Executive Committee of the Americka Obec Sokolska and by the Central District. He censured the Legionnaires for not taking the proper steps in requesting the removal of the accused trio and he made a motion that the request be introduced in a proper way, and if they are found guilty, he announced that he will be the first one to ask for their removal. He asked only that the accused brothers be judged and, if they are found guilty, convicted, but only after a fair trial. Mr. Kaderka again tried to take the floor, but in vain. Dr. Joseph P. Pecival then introduced the next speaker, Mr. Jarka Kosar, editor of the Sokol Americky. The speaker invited everyone to work harmoniously and jointly and he described his disappointment upon the return of the Legionnaires. "President Thomas G. Masaryk, at his inauguration at the Hradcany Castle, Czechoslovakia, gave credit to both the Legionnaires and the Sokols." He stated further that he was speaking only for Sokols. "The Legionnaires are fully entitled to demand the purge, but they did not follow the proper procedure. Is this attempt of the Legionnaires an <span class="page-break">\6</span>instance of contempt and lack of discipline?" During his speech the audience quieted down and listened to the words of this old Sokol, whose honesty and good will are acknowledged by everyone. The speaker called attention to the seriousness of the situation and said that it is a mistake to condemn the entire body because of a few individuals. He further asked the Legionnaires how they intend to carry out the purge--Voices from the audience: "By removing the trio!" The speaker then continued: "Is that the aim of the purge?" At that moment Mr. Kaderka interrupted him and in a sincere and solemn voice said: "Jarko Kosar you are an old, gray-haired sokol, but I must tell you what we were forced to hear and to endure here and in France in order to stay true to the sokol ideal." These words were greeted by a storm of applause. Mr. Jarka Kosar then continued. "I do not know anything about that, but I do think that you should have come to us about that." He further related that many people tried to enter the Czechoslovak Army, but not all of them were accepted, because workers were also needed here. "It is true that many of the Legionnaires gladly went to fight on the battlefields, but some of the Legionnaires joined the army only on account of <span class="page-break">\7</span>being drafted and because of the desire for adventure." At the end of his speech he again asked everyone to work in harmony. Mr. Kaderka again tried to get the floor and he finally succeeded. He paid his respects to the former speaker but he was forced to correct the statement that the Legionnaires brought their charges before the public without consulting anyone. In the first place, they called a preliminary conference to which the former speaker was also invited and only after that, when nothing else could be done, did they bring it before the public. He, as a Sokol, mentioned all the reproaches and jeers they had to swallow in silence, such as the following questions: "Where are all the Sokols? Where is Paskovsky and the others?" Further, he asked Mr. Placek in what way had they, violated the national discipline. They never had anything against the Sokols but they are absolutely against the known trio. The speaker asserted that it was one of the duties of the Americka Obec Sokolska to save the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe when this organization started to crumble. "But today, even the Americka Obec Sokolska is against the Legionnaires when the Legionnaires are trying to do what the Americka <span class="page-break">\8</span>Obec Sokolska should have done a long time ago." He gladly welcomed brother Jarka Kosar's proposal for harmonious work, but, in the first place, he asked that the obstacle, which is the trio, be removed.</p>
   <p>His speech was rewarded by spontaneous applause. After that, Mr. Joseph Paskovsky, being first introduced by the chairman, took the floor. His appearance created ill feeling, and various shouts arose from the audience. Mr. Kaderka himself asked the audience to grant him a chance to speak, and Mr. Paskovsky begged the audience for permission to say a few words in his own defense. "Although I was the first one," he said, "to respond to the call of the Czechoslovakian Army, I am placed upon the pillory today." In a few brief words he explained his family and financial conditions and said that, nevertheless, he was willing to fight for his native land, but was rejected. He had laid his case before the Americka Obec Sokolska and the Executive Committee for decision and his action was approved as correct. He declared that his conscience is clear and he is fully convinced that he honestly fulfilled his duty. "He who is human, will judge me in a human way."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>The next speaker was supposed to be Mrs. Stolfa, but there was opposition from the audience: "Let those who are accused speak! We have nothing against our women!" Dr. Joseph P. Pecival uselessly asked the audience to show the lady courtesy. After finishing only several sentences, during which time such cries were heard from the audience as "Shame on the Legionnaires," the speaker concluded her speech by saying, "If the Vcelky (Bees) had not been so much concerned about you [the legionnaires], you would not be so haughty today!"</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Frank J. Kubec, chairman of the District Committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, said a few brief words in his own defense. He produced evidence from the Czechoslovak Consulate in New York, according to which, Mr. Kubec had not been called upon by the Military Bureau of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe (Czechoslovak National Council of America) to perform his duties in the army, although he had voluntarily responded. He had also bound himself to the national discipline, that is, not to act according to his own will, but to submit himself to the <span class="page-break">\10</span>orders of the Military Bureau of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe. In accordance with that, he stayed at his assigned place of duty until the end, therefore, acting according to this discipline. Further, he censured the Legionnaires for trying to be not only the prosecutors but also the judges. He said that because he did not serve in the army was not his fault. The Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe should be blamed because it commanded him to stay at his place. Applause, laughter, and various shouts followed this.</p>
   <p>After him, the third member of the accused trio, Mr. Ferdinand L. Musil, took the floor. He said that the Legionnaires, by their own actions, only confirm what is said about us, that we are not able to govern ourselves when we do not preserve freedom of speech. "It is a government of the mob, and not a government of the people!" He said that he is willing to submit himself to the discipline of the people, but not to the dictation of the mob. He further related all that he has done for the benefit of then national cause and he asserted that if anything dishonorable can be proved against him he will gladly <span class="page-break">\11</span>resign. According to him, they were told by their superiors to remain at their posts and they did. He then related how he had voluntarily tried to enter the army, but was rejected. He censured the Legionnaires, in that they have no power to serve summons upon anyone. "Thomas G.Masaryk himself said the same, and by so doing you are only disgracing the nation."</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaderka interrupted him by saying: "So we are disgracing the nation by trying to oust Musil?" Mr. Musil continued: "The Legionnaires have no right to oust anyone!"--Shouts from the audience: "Is that so, we will show you!"--He also agreed to submit to the commands of his organization, if it is proved that he has done something wrong. "The Legionnaires abuse the confidence of the public."--His further words were drowned in the turmoil that broke out immediately after. Energetic voices were heard: "That's enough! Stop!"--A moment later, during the greatest turmoil, one older veteran stepped forward, and without permission took the speaker's stand and soon restored order. He said: "I am also a veteran! My name is Cipera;</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>I am forty years old and I have seen service in the Twenty-second Regiment, Company Five. I am not a member of the Legionnaires, but I am one of the founders of the Cicero Branch of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe. The only thing I brought home from the war was rheumatism. I am very much surprised by what is going on here. I know that the Legionnaires have complaints and that some of them are justified, but I think that they should have brought them up in a different way. I know Kubec; I know that he has done his duty and, therefore, I want to defend him." After these words the turmoil started again, so that even he was forced to stop his speech. Immediately, Dr. Pecival introduced the next speaker, Mrs. John. After only a few outspoken words, the noise quieted down and the speaker continued amid silence. She introduced herself as the treasurer of the Ladies Aid Committee and presented a detailed report of the activities of this Committee and the manner in which the aid was given to the wives of Legionnaires. Only once was her speech interrupted by one legionnaire who shouted: We have nothing against the Vcelky and we fully recognize their merits!" She concluded her speech amid applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>The next speaker was Reverend Kralicek. He spoke a few earnest words which were listened to by the audience attentively and quietly.....He was rewarded with applause. After this speech, Dr. Pecival concluded the meeting, although the program was not finished. He said that he would not assume responsibility for further results. He left with other members of the Arrangements Committee amid noisy manifestations and cries of: "Shame on you! You are running away! You are afraid," etc.</p>
   <p>Soon after their departure, Legionnaire Bukovsky, who heretofore tried to be recognized, but in vain, stepped forward and vigorously proclaimed: "We, the Legionnaires, do not want to harm the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, and we are not harming it. We did not touch the Americka Obec Sokolska with a single word and also we have nothing against the Catholics. He again explained the origin of this entire dispute and mentioned that all the proclamations and resolutions which were published in newspapers were written by people either directly or indirectly associated or friendly with the known trio. He said that the president of the Americka Obec Sokolska, <span class="page-break">\14</span>Mr. Placek, threatened then with the police the moment they said any-thing. Mr. Placek defended himself, although he admitted that he had mentioned the police, and he censured the Legionnaires in that, in the past meeting, the followers of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe were not recognized. Mr. Kaderka vigorously protested and explained that the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe was invited to send its speakers. Mr. Bukovsky then asked the audience, "Who is violating discipline, the Legionnaires or the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, which does not allow them to say a word? They only want us to take orders, but they do not allow us to say anything. What kind of a reputation the District Committee of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe enjoys, is evidenced by the fact that when twenty-four of the Legionnaires arrived in New York, and being destitute asked the Czechoslovak Consulate in New York for help, they were told that the Consulate could not lend them a single dollar, because not even the District Committee could be trusted with that much money, and anyway the Consulate could not wait for the money in the hope that it would be returned." He said that he has reliable reports from the highest sources that even there <span class="page-break">\15</span>they wish that the accused trio would resign as soon as possible.--Applause.</p>
   <p>The president of the Legionnaires then asked the audience: "Who of those present agree with us and with our action?" Almost the entire audience raised their hands. To the question: "Who is against us?" only a few hands were raised, in fact, only three. Mr. Kaderka concluded the meeting and asked everyone to co-operate. He especially asked that the Americka Obec Sokolska help them start a new, really democratic, national organization.--Applause.--Mr. Placek mentioned, in addition, that the Americka Obec Sokolska did not send its speakers to make trouble but only to defend the rights of the accused members. He proposed that a new committee, consisting of legionnaire, civic, and newspaper representatives be organized, and that this committee do all the preliminary work toward the founding of a new national organization, that is, the future Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe. This proposition was unanimously approved. Mr. Lajer then stepped forth and spoke against it because he said that such an institution <span class="page-break">\16</span>is already in existence and, therefore, it would be impossible to begin it again. To this, Mr. Placek recommended that our supreme institution should again have the right to decide and to supervise the activities of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe. He also remarked that he is well aware of the fact that dissension does not help anyone and that it only brings harm to all.--Voices from the audience interrupted him shouting: "Vojan! Vojan!"</p>
   <p>Dr. Jaroslav E. Salaba Vojan was assisted on to the stage by several Legionnaires. He began his speech by saying that at the past meeting of the Cesko-slovenska Narodni Rada v Americe, it was decided to reorganize the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe to such an extent that in the future the Cesko-slovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe will be only a member of the Ceskoslovenska Narodni Rada v Americe and a real representative of the free thought movement. This report as received with great joy. He remarked that he was astonished that this was not made known before, when much of the excitement and trouble could have been avoided. Closing the meeting, Mr. Kaderka asked the audience to work in harmony with the Legionnaires for the new national organization.</p>
