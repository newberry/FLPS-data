   <p>We have not yet become accustomed to the idea that our nation, for centuries ruled by foreigners, is now its own boss and has a place of honor among independent nations.</p>
   <p>Who would have believed just a few short years ago that the Czechoslovak government would be a mediator between the governments of Austria and Hungary, that the last Austro-Hungarian emperor would be looking from exile at a former lecturer of the University of Prague as the principal obstacle between himself and the throne of his ancestors. Who would have thought that the Czechoslovak flag would be flying in Chicago from windows which were decorated with an Austrian black and yellow flag on the occasion of Francis Joseph's birthday? Surely, peculiar are the things we have been witnessing!</p>
   <p>Today, the day of the third anniversary of Czechoslovak independence, the Czechs and Slovaks in America think about the three years which have passed since October 28, 1918. Has the Republic fulfilled the hopes which the American sons and daughters of the Czechoslovak nation had when they were helping to bring it into being? The reality is never as beautiful as its expectation. We here in America and our nation in the old country both imagined that the Republic would be something of an ideal, and there have been many disappointments. But upon sober consideration of all that has been achieved in three years, just a short while in the life of nations, and upon comparing the Republic of Czechoslovakia with her neighbors, we shall come to the conclusion that we may be justly proud of the nation whose descendants we are.</p>
   <p>Senator Klofac told us on the occasion of his recent visit that it is his purpose, and the purpose of many other leaders of the nation, to make the Czechoslovak Republic the first country in Central Europe. Not first in size, not first in number of inhabitants, not first in power and military strength, but in the state of awakeness, social justice, national education, level of standard of living. It seems to me that Senator Klofac was too modest. Thousands of American Czechoslovaks who visited the Republic this year have returned with the impression that in all these respects the Republic of Czechoslovakia is already first in Central Europe--perhaps in the whole, of Europe. Material damages caused by five years of war have been repaired to a great extent already, and the demoralization of hearts and minds has also been overcome. There is order in the Republic and, in comparison to neighbors, also a considerable prosperity.</p>
   <p>There is one thing that may be declared today, after the experiences of the past three years:</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovaks know how to govern themselves. In spite of all the fights between political parties, in spite of all the distasteful polemics in newspapers, the fact remains that there is discipline in the Republic's liberty. This has been very clearly shown by the attitude toward</p>
   <p>President Masaryk. His recent trip to Morowia and Slovakia was an eloquent demonstration of the fact that he is esteemed and honored by the nation now as much as at the time when he came home as his country's liberator. Where are the statesmen who led their nations three years ago? Wilson, Clemenceau, Paderewski, Venizelos--all except Lloyd George who is still in Great Britian's government--have fallen by the wayside, given good-by by their peoples, but the Czechoslovak nation has recognized in Masaryk a great personality, a great character, a great leader, and it is much to its credit that it keeps on following him still.</p>
   <p>The Republic of Czechoslovakia enjoys a greater degree of respect than any other new state in Europe because its policies have been purposeful, peace-loving, and peace-promoting, sober, and aiming toward the consolidation of Central Europe. The history of the last three years shows her steady progress, without jerking stormily to the right or the left.</p>
