   <p>Is your heart not filled with sincere, ardent pride when you read the current English language publications? Do you not have a sensation of having been lifted from those small, insignificant people to whom the native public had been paying so little attention till recently. Do you not feel proud of being identified with a people who really accomplish things, and whom the American public observe closely, and even respect and esteem?</p>
   <p>We are beginning to be "regular fellows"! We have been waiting a rather long time for a time such as the present, and we have finally seen it arrive! Is it because we possess a remarkable patience. Can you remember? Especially you who have grown white-haired--can you remember times as they were in the past? I myself cannot speak about this, because I have been in Chicago only a few years. But you old timers whose age exceeds several decades--you could do it. You could recite chapters on the beginning of Czech life in Chicago, and, in fact, all over the United States, wherever Czechs have colonized.</p>
   
   <p>What a difference between life as it was then and as it is now! I know only what I have gathered during the past fifty years from people who have remembered. Our national life was then still in its infancy. We lived huddled together, shy and to some extent afraid, in a manner characteristic of us. We concealed our Czech birth in a considerable measure, keeping the consciousness of it alive only among ourselves, not caring to show it before the public at large. Why? We were compelled to do so by an unwarranted fear of being ridiculed. To have been laughed at would have hurt our feelings. And we were being ridiculed, indeed, by various classes of ignorant people who did not call us by any other name but that insulting, derisive one, "Bohunks".</p>
   <p>This was so--not only fifty years ago. Even much later we were looked down upon "from above," here in Chicago and elsewhere. We did not know the surroundings and the atmosphere into which we had wandered, and, until recently, we preferred keeping in the background to making an appearance before the public.</p>
   
   <p>We did not know how to manifest our consciousness of pride which was so definitely a part of us at that time. We could not express ourselves at the right time, for we did not know the language, and did not have any influential connections. We did not know how to stamp the foot, and demand in a categorical manner, as our ancestors were went to do. We were too comfortable to step out form our hiding place--and this was symbolic of our very beginning.</p>
   <p>Those times are gone, and one may speak more frankly now. It is we, our-selves, who are largely responsible for the conditions under which we lived--for several reasons. We were known as conservative people who took cognizance of new things only in times of utmost necessity and absolute need. We did not know how to become acclimatized, and lived, therefore,within the confines which we brought along with us to our colonies.</p>
   <p>We paid little if any attention to our surroundings. What wonder that those about us paid no attention to us There were individuals who tried to become acquainted with the new order of things and with the outer world. There were few only, and even they did not exhibit their utmost energy and aggressiveness, though they were able, and were permitted to do so.</p>
   <p>As a result of all this, the transition from our own mode of living into the American way took a long time. Not until we had cast off our reticence, when we had begun to send our children to public schools and later to higher schools, when we had overcome our propensity for comfort and stripped off a large part of our indifference, did conditions begin to appear in a better light, a much more advantageous one. This resulted in a closer approach to the American people, and they, in turn, began to devote that attention which it had owed us for a long time. The compass of our life began to expand, and we began to project ourselves into the American life which had been closed to us before.</p>
   <p>This progress was made through the medium of the American press. It opened its columns to us, reluctantly and infrequently. Its articles were based on such incorrect and incomplete information that we were led to wish the English columns had remained closed to us for an even longer period.</p>
   <p>All of this was substantially changed as a result of the war, which whipped us up from our case. Above all, the war re-awakened our consciousness as Czechs; and this re-awakening urged us on to the work which we have been carrying on during the past three years, and which, augmented by lucky events has brought forth positive results years, and which, augmented by lucky events has brought forth positive results of which we may justly be proud.</p>
   <p>We have made contacts in influential American circles, and these associations have helped to show us the American public in an entirely different light.</p>
   <p>The recent events in our motherland were largely instrumental in working this change, and daily the English language press devotes prominent space to the happenings in our old homeland.</p>
   <p>Highly influential publications call us "most intelligent and progressive," and point to us as a people to whom the United States has not only offered a friendly squeeze of the hand, but whom, in recognition of its moral strength, America loves and welcomes as an ally.</p>
   <p>This means a long step forward to us, but it does not mean that we may rest ourselves. The appreciation of the work we have done up to the present should be an incentive for continued efforts!</p>
