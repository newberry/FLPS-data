   <p>The Bohemian population of Berwyn, living in the Fourth and Fifth Wards, is discontented with the conditions prevailing there. The dissatisfaction is not confined to the prohibition laws of the town but in a measure is due to the unjust treatment of the people living in the north end, where the Bohemian citizens reside; this section does not get the improvements to which it is entitled. The north-end citizens are complaining that "old" Berwyn, which is the south part of the town, is represented by six aldermen to the north end's four; therefore they are outvoted six to four every time a vote is taken in the council meeting when improvements are considered.</p>
   <p>We have often mentioned these complaints, and that they are not the statements of individuals, the gigantic meeting of Bohemian citizens yesterday afternoon at Berwyn Sokol Hall on 27th Place bears witness.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The meeting was called by the Bohemian Improvement Association, and the hall was filled to its full capacity; ladies too were present. The most interesting topics of discussion were those which caused the meeting to be called. [Foremost] was the question whether the Bohemians settled in that part of the town which comprises the Fourth and Fifth wards should break away from the town of Berwyn and join the town of Cicero.</p>
   <p>The presiding officer of this meeting was Mr. J. F. Vojacek, and a series of speakers explained to the citizens the benefits which would accrue to the Bohemian population by annexation to Cicero, where the local administration is more liberal, and where the Bohemian element would be more likely to obtain justice.</p>
   <p>The speakers called attention to the five-cent fare, which the citizens of Berwyn cannot hope to get under present conditions. The lighting system needs to be improved, as do many other units of the town's service, and the taxpayers are entitled to this service.</p>

   <p>Alderman Svoboda exhibited a map of the district which it is desired to have annexed to Cicero and explained that the law makes it necessary to present a petition to the county court with at least a hundred signatures of citizens sixty days before an election [is to be held]. This proposition would have to be voted on both in Berwyn and in Cicero, and should it win [in both places], it would be put into effect. The securing of petitions is an easy matter; but the hard part of it all is the work needed in Berwyn and in Cicero to put through this proposition successfully in both towns by the time of the next election in April, for enough agitation would have to be carried on to gain an affirmative vote. To achieve this end, every Bohemian vote would have to be counted on, and the votes of many other citizens would have to be solicited; but the hope was expressed that this could be accomplished.</p>
   <p>It was also stated that certain citizens of Berwyn, namely, the prohibitionists, would like to get rid of the Bohemian element because this element sooner or later, they fear, will force more liberal laws upon the community. It was also stated that the Bohemian citizens in Cicero would vote for annexation, as would many other foreign voters, because that annexation would add greatly <span class="page-break">\4</span>to the prosperity of Cicero.</p>
   <p>Practically every one at this meeting seemed to favor annexation; but there were those who voiced their fear that the time is too short for an agitation sufficiently extensive to win at the polls next April.</p>
   <p>Were the motion to lose at election, it would be two years before the matter again could be brought before the voters; but others argued that by the seventh of April much work can be accomplished if the citizens work in accord, and that it is not impossible that the result of this endeavor will be success. It was proposed that the Improvement Club and the Taxpayers' Association of the north end of the Ward be requested to call a meeting, so that there also the judgment and co-operation of voters may be sought.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the Taxpayers' Association is Mr. Janda; he said that the time is rather short before the next election for extensive agitation, but that the members of the Taxpayers' Association will not refuse co-operation <span class="page-break">\5</span>for a cause so worthy of support. Mr. Boucek, also a member of the above-named organization, and many other speakers favored the proposition that immediate action be taken, and speeches of similar purport were loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>The whole trend of yesterday's meeting seemed to point to the conclusion that the question of Bohemian Berwyn's joining with Cicero will be put to a vote next April.</p>
