   <p>p. 1.. A great poet, philosopher, reformer and patriot, Svatopluk Cech has finished his earthly pilgrimage. The mournful news evoked a deep echo in the hearts of all American-Bohemians. They expressed their deepest sorrow in a dignified manner manifesting that they realized the loss of so great a Bohemian patriot.</p>
   <p>In memory of Svatopluk Cech, two meetings have been arranged in our Bohemian centers. One meeting was already held yesterday afternoon in the Bohemian-American Hall on 18th Street. The main speakers of this meeting were Messrs. Zdrubek and Iska. The other meeting will be held this coming Wednesday in Pilsen Sokol Hall and the speaker for this meeting will be Mr. Pelant, from Prague.</p>
   <p>There will be no charge for admission, so that our people will be represented to the fullest capacity of the hall; this will prove their admiration for our national patriots.</p>
