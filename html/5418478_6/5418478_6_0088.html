   <p>The Vcelky (Bees) [an association of Bohemian ladies] of Cicero, known for tireless activities since their foundation, with great satisfaction can refer to their past performances. In one of their past meetings it was agreed to send the sum of six thousand of Czechoslovakian Kronen to T. G. Masaryk, president of Czechoslovakia, as a donation to charitable institutions in Czechoslovakia. This sum was forwarded on December 3, 1919.</p>
   <p>In this regard, the Cicero branch of Vcelky was one of the first to make such a donation, and thereby presented proof of their generosity and unselfish work. Mrs. Albina Janecek is the president, and Mrs. Marie Jisa is the secretary.</p>
