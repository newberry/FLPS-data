   <p>Chicago, December 20, 1914.</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), composed of representatives of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slovonic Auxiliary Committee), and delegates of our foremost central national bodies agreed in its last meeting, held under the chairmanship of Dr. Ludvik Fisher at the American State Bank, on the following statement:</p>
   <p>"The newspapers, Chicago Journal and Examiner [sic] have published malicious and false reports about the activities, aims, and organization of American Bohemians for the benefit of their old country. These reports also contained names of persons allegedly interested in these activities, names the author <span class="page-break">\2</span>used in order to appear reliable as a reporter. The Sdruzeni, having considered the contents of these reports, declares that it has nothing in common with them, and that they are an irresponsible fabrication of a certain person in Gary, Indiana--source of their spurious origin. Knowing very well the conditions both here and in the old country, the Sdruzeni brands these reports as pure fiction with only one purpose: to call the public's attention to an individual of Gary, Indiana with whom the Sdruzeni has no connection whatever. The Sdruzeni has written in this vein to these papers, but it was unable to stop the spreading of this erroneous and unsubstantiated news that was fabricated by that individual. The Sdruzeni also refuted this report in a special letter to the New Yorkske Listy which had published a comment upon it. The Sdruzeni is also cognizant of the fact that the Slav-American Correspondence properly discredited this news. The Sdruzeni expresses its sorrow and disappointment in the fact that there are still individuals in Bohemian-America who value their own personal interests above the interests of the whole without considering how much damage is done the Bohemian cause by such actions".</p>

   <p>After unanimous approval of this statement, the Sdruzeni discussed the invitation of the New Yorksky Vybor (New York Committee) to a conference to be held in January. The Sdruzeni itself, quietly, doing the work made necessary by conditions and entrusted to it by our foremost national bodies, has never tried to hamper the work of any local bodies. It presented to the New Yorksky Vybor some definite proposals for common action as far back as October 22, but these proposals have not been accepted. It will, however, most wholeheartedly welcome any step which would lead to the unification of the Bohemian activities. Therefore, it is highly in favor of a general conference, providing that an agenda for this conference will be mutually agreed upon in advance, this agenda to contain items on which all American Bohemians can work seriously. The Sdruzeni has, therefore, requested the New Yorksky Vybor to work out such an agenda, because as the convocator of the conference, the New Yorksky Vybor no doubt feels and will accept the responsibility for the conference. Having the proper appreciation for each piece of work done for the real benefit of the Bohemian cause, we shall be <span class="page-break">\4</span>happy to do our duty in co-operation with others where we have had to do it alone. This co-operation, however, is possible only if all co-operating parties value properly the work done by each individual or group, and if all of them follow exclusivley the interest of the whole.</p>
   <p>The Sdruzeni is proud of being able to make this statement and prove it after a thorough consideration of all circumstances, it has not passed up a single opportunity to act in accordance with its principles, never permitting itself to be swayed either by possibilities of temporary success and popularity, or unfavorable criticism from a certain part of the press which is frequently apt to pass judgment without basing it on reliable information.</p>
   <p>Upon motion of the secretary of the Sdruzeni, the meeting drafted a suitable expression of sorrow over the death of the most loyal friend of the Bohemian nation and first historian of our modern times, Professor Denis of the University of Paris. Thereafter a number of confidential matters were dealt with. During <span class="page-break">\5</span>the deliberations, the chairman, Dr. Fisher, found an opportunity to request that all officers of the Sdruzeni excluding none, do the work with which they are charged, most unselfishly, without any remuneration whatever, and for love of the cause only.</p>
