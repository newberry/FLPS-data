   <p>Added proof of the fact that the enthusiasm for the cause of the Balkan Slavs, who are engaged in a death struggle with their oppressors, is not diminishing among us was demonstrated at yesterday's spirited meeting held. Under the auspices of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) in the spacious pavilion of the Pilsen Brewing Company.</p>
   <p>Like the Pilsen Auditorium two weeks ago, the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewing Company attracted a huge throng of men who were led by a single idea: To offer their sympathy and their money to aid a cause which is common to all of us--the liberation of the Slavs.</p>
   <p>Those gathered in yesterday's assembly were mostly Bohemians; but just the same, we saw quite a number of Yugoslavs both in the audience and on the speakers' platform.....</p>

   <p>The chairman of yesterday's meeting was the Clerk of the Probate Court, Mr. John A. Cervenka....who introduced the first speaker of the day, Mr. Jar. K. Kosar.....</p>
   <p>His words provoked stormy applause when he said that Mr. Stepina has so far received $2,200 in contributions for the Slavic Red Cross. The money was sent to Professor Pupin in New York.....</p>
   <p>The envelope collection yielded $408.15......</p>
   <p>Contributions for the Slavic cause are being solicited everywhere.....As far as our Sokols are concerned, the Narodni Jednota Sokolska (National Sokol Unity) is getting ready to inaugurate a fifty-cent head tax, which, computing its membership at about seven thousand, would mean a substantial increase in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the general fund. A similar step is contemplated by the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Fuegner-Tyrs Sokol Division).....Why could not each of our building and loan associations declare an extra installment?</p>
