   <p>In order to keep the Bohemian prisoners of war abreast of developments the Narodne-Socialni Beseda J. V. Fric (National Socialist Club J. V. Fric) of Chicago, has been regularly sending them Bohemian-American newspapers. The number of papers sent has been increasing with the progress of the war and the reaction is now showing remarkable developments. How much these shipments are appreciated, and to what extend they appear to be fulfilling their mission, will be seen from the following letters received by the Beseda Fric:</p>
   <p>"Zajecar, Serbia, July 13, 1915.</p>
   <p>"First of all our fraternal greetings! Many thanks for the newspapers. You cannot imagine how agreeably surprised we were when they came and how glad we <span class="page-break">2</span>are to have them. We have torn the sheets apart and distributed them among ourselves, everyone reading them among ourselves, everyone reading them with great eagerness. From these papers we now know a great deal more about the "conditions in our unfortunate, yet so beautiful native country. Please remember us again with a few issues. As far as our conditions here are concerned, things are not as we had imagined, but we bear up cheerfully. War is war, and this one is the third for Serbia within a few years! Later on, perhaps, we shall take the liberty of writing somewhat more in detail about the way we live here. Once more, many thanks!" (This letter was signed by two Bohemian prisoners of war.)</p>
   <p>"Cuprija, Serbia, May 31, 1915.</p>
   <p>"Dear Friends! We this day received your shipment of Bohemian papers from America. It was a most welcome surprise because we had not seen any Bohemian papers for more than six months and did not know what was going on in the <span class="page-break">3</span>world, except for some incomplete items of information which were received in various ways from divers sources. Please remember us with such shipments frequently. There are two hundred and sixty Bohemian prisoners of war here, all working in the local Bohemian sugar factory, and we were very thankful to get information about our homeland! Some of the news has greatly surprised us, especially the news about the Bohemian-American action, and it caused an immense sensation throughout our colony--needless to say a most pleasant one--and we have not talked about anything else since! This news was read and re-read and studied in detail. We shall appreciate every shipment and give our thanks in advance. If possible, please send more. Greetings to all of you there! (This letter was signed by a Bohemian teacher.)</p>
   <p>[Two similar letters follow, one from Paracin, Serbia, and one from Skobelev, Province Fergunskaja, Asiatic Russia.]</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The number of camps has grown to 140, to wit: 55 in European Russia, 41 in Asiatic Russia and Siberia, 37 in Serbia, 2 in Montenegro, 1 in Greece (from Serbia), 1 on the Island of Malta (from Serbia), and 3 in Italy. Up to August 5, 1,564 packages of newspapers were sent out containing 13,862 various issues. In addition the following were also sent: 80 copies of the yearbooks of the Sokol Slavsky of Chicago, 100 yearbooks of Bohemian-American women, donated by Mrs. A. S. Tvrzicky of Chicago, a sizeable number of the July issue of the Sokolsky Borec ( a fully developed, active member of Sokol able and ready to enter gymnastic competition), 35 issues of the Valecna Tribuna (War Tribune), and 300 copies of the European organ of the Narodni Sdruzeni, La Nation Scheque, published in Paris and donated by the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni of Chicago. Also 223 circulars were sent out explaining the purpose of the newspaper shipments and asking for lists of prisoners of war, etc. There were thirty-four personal letters sent to various individual prisoners in these camps and forty-seven other letters in connection with this activity were written by the secretary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>This activity has increased greatly with the co-operation of several publishing companies, who are donating a larger amount of their circulation free of charge. Thus the following papers are being received: Denni Hlasatel, Chicago; Svornost (Unity), Chicago; Spravedlnost (Justice), Chicago; Svet (World), Cleveland; Narodny Slovensky Dennik (National Slovak Daily), Chicago; bi-weeklies: Amerikan (The American), Chicago; Slavie, Chicago; weeklies: Cechoamerican (The Bohemian-American), Baltimore; Zajmy Lidu (People's Interests), Chicago; Rovnost Ludu (People's Equality [Slovak]), Chicago; and Domacnost(Home), Milwaukee. The Beseda Fric has returned and refused to forward the issues donated by the daily American (The American) because of the disloyal attitude of that paper toward the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and to their political activity for liberating [the homeland] in general.</p>
   <p>A large number of our countrymen in rural districts are sending in papers and periodicals with which they have finished. Two depositories of used newspapers have been established in Chicago, one in Mr. Andel's coffeehouse <span class="page-break">6</span>on Blue Island Avenue near 18th Street, and one in Mr. Seyka's establishment at 3550 West 26th Street. Both of them appear to be very useful. Our Chicago countrymen are requested to deliver all such Bohemian reading matter to these depositories. The address of the Beseda Fric is 2322 South Clifton Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
