   <p>The net cash received at this exhibition was $650.50; expenditures $145.50; balance, $505.</p>
   <p>There are twelve societies composing the Zdruzeni Ceskych Spolku (The Alliance of Czech Societies of the Northwest Side), and members of these societies voluntarily assessed themselves five cents each quarterly to go toward building fund for a hall on the Northwest Side.</p>
   <p>....The alliance is working hard without any remuneration, and hopes that the favors accorded will continue so that, in a short time, we will have the hall for which we long, and which is needed so much on the Northwest Side.</p>
   
   <p>The Zdruzeni Ceskych Spolku has assets amounting to $2,235.56, which amount is growing steadily, thanks to the self-assessed five-cent quarterly payments.</p>
   <p>The Zdruzene Ceske Spolky thank all who in any way helped to make our exposition a success.</p>
