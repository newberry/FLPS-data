   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) will conclude its third year of activity by the end of this month. Each of its years has had its own outstanding achievement. The first year it was one million cents for the Ustredni Matice Skolska (Central Scholastic Association [in Bohemia]); the second year the harassing of Count Apponyi, the archenemy of the Slovak people, during his stay in Chicago; the third year the speaking tour of Dr. Frankish Luetzow, who lectured at American universities. Every one of these achievements in itself not only justifies the existence of this institution, but also compensates for the yearly expenditure of money which the organization collects from the public.</p>
   <p>But aside from these main jobs, the Bureau has done a great deal of "petty" work every year. This "petty" work, brought to the Bureau daily by mail, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and requiring at least a dozen letters to be mailed by its office to Europe and various parts of the United States, is almost impossible to describe concisely and clearly. But its more important work has been reported by the Bureau in our newspapers. Today, on the occasion of its anniversary, we are publishing a recapitulation of only the more outstanding activities in order to demonstrate the value of the Bureau's work and its indispensability as a cultural institution of the American branch of the Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>In December, 1911, the Ceska Narodni Rada (Bohemian National Council [in Bohemia]) reported that it submitted to the president of the Jednotny Klub Ceskych Poslancu Na Risske Rade [a club of all Bohemian deputies of all political parties of the Emperial diet in Vienna] the memorandum of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada concerning the need for a radical reform in the matter of appointments to Austro-Hungarian consulates in the United States. Through the publication of English articles in New York and Chicago newspapers, a complaint was voiced against American opera companies for neglecting Bohemian opera. On the occasion of the brewing industry's exhibition in Chicago, <span class="page-break">\3</span>and by means of an article in the Chicago Daily News, the Bureau called attention to the fact that the Bohemian brewing industry was wrongfully omitted when the history of beer was discussed.</p>
   <p>January, February, and March, 1912, were devoted to the arrangements for Dr. Luetzow's speaking tour. These arrangements were so well handled and so completely organized that there was no confusion or misunderstanding during the Count's forty-two-day tour. Releases for the English language press about Count Luetzow, his scientific attainments, the gist of his lectures on Bohemians in America, and other pertinent information were prepared. As a result of these releases, newspapers in cities where the lectures were held--New York, New Haven, Boston, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Madison, Iowa City, Lincoln, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Ithaca, Princeton, and also in such cities as Washington, Buffalo, Omaha, and elsewhere--carried long articles about Bohemian activities. Due to these preparations and the continuous watchfulness and care exercised by the Bureau throughout the length of the trip, the tour met with complete success. Frequent reports on the tour were sent to Bohemia <span class="page-break">\4</span>by cable. These were followed by longer articles mailed to the old country. In addition to this, Count Luetzow has now described the whole town in detail in articles published by the Prague daily, Union [a German paper].</p>
   <p>In April, the Ceska Narodni Rada in Prague was requested to see that the names of Bohemian-American newspapers were dropped from the list of periodicals, for the handling and delivering of them was being refused by the Austrian postal authorities. Following a suggestion contained in a letter from the Ceske Obchodni Museum (Bohemian Museum of Commerce [in Prague], those who took part in the Sokol expedition were requested to discuss, in Prague, the means by which business connections between Bohemia and America could be increased and made more profitable. On the occasion of the great music festival in Cedar Rapids, two English essays concerning Smetana, Dvorak, and Fibich, were written and sent to the Sunday Republican for publication on April 21 and May 5.</p>
   <p>A speech on behalf of Bohemian journalism was delivered over the bier of Bartos Bittner on May 7. Upon the warning that the census bureau's reports on <span class="page-break">\5</span>the nationality of the white population of the United States would ignore the Bohemians, a lengthy and energetic protest was sent to the census director, Mr. Durand, who now points out in all his reports that these are only preliminary reports, and that the statistics concerning the mother tongue will be published in the final issue of the census reports. Throughout the month all possible help was given to the Karel Jonas monument committee in Racine, where the monument was unveiled May 30. Photographs of the monument and of the important scenes of the unveiling ceremony were sent to the English language press and to newspapers in Bohemia. A member of the Bureau delivered a speech during the ceremony.</p>
   <p>Two childrens' stage plays about Bohemians were performed in the George Howland School in Chicago on June 3 and on five subsequent dates. The anthem "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home), Bohemian folk dances, and the plays made a big hit which was mentioned in James O'Donnell Bennett's articles published in various English language newspapers, and in articles by other well-known writers. The Bohemian folk dances were again performed by the pupils of that <span class="page-break">\6</span>school in connection with the concert of the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) in the Coliseum on the occasion of the convention of building and loan associations in Chicago, and will now be repeated in the John Marshall High School, Thursday, November 21.</p>
   <p>A cable on behalf of the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota was sent to the singing society of Prague teachers, congratulating them on their victory in Paris. A release on this same subject was sent to the English language press. The first cable concerning the Vsesokolsky Slet (Sokol Mass Convention) in Prague was received June 20. Seven additional cables of that source arrived during June. The English language press was given careful and elaborate releases concerning the event.</p>
   <p>All cables concerning the Slet and activities around it were passed on to the press. A long article about the Slet was prepared for and forwarded to the Chicago Daily News on July 18.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The article about the Slet, including a photograph, was published in the Chicago Daily News on August 1. A detailed report about the publicity given to the Slet in America, accompanied by a complete collection of newspaper clippings, was sent to Prague.</p>
   <p>In September, by a special release, the ground was prepared for Dr. Veleminsky's lectures. The Associated Press cable concerning the death of Jaroslav Vrchlicky [the foremost modern Bohemian poet] came belatedly from Vienna, and the American papers employing their own reporters had the news by Tuesday morning. However, the Bureau's wires to some Bohemian papers in America were welcome, particularly in places such as Cleveland, where the American press had ignored the news. All newspapers were sent articles about Vrchlicky and the preparations for his funeral.</p>
   <p>Co-operation was extended to the Chicago reception committee which prepared such a fine sojourn in Chicago for the members of the International Convention of Chambers of Commerce, October 5 and 7.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>On October 6 the Chicago Daily Tribune featured the Bureau's article about Smetana's symphonic poems, as a result of which the first half of the complete Smetana cycle, "Ma Vlast" (My Fatherland), appeared on the program of two concerts of the Thomas orchestra October 25 and 26. Detailed information about Dvorak's posthumously published "Dramatic Overture" was furnished for the orchestral program. Pertinent information about Karel Havlicek was provided for the English language press on the occasion of his anniversary celebration in Chicago, at which the main speech was delivered by a member of the Bureau. The first part of informative material on Bohemians was prepared for the Anglo-American encyclopedias. It will be published next Sunday.</p>
   <p>In November co-operation was extended to the Umelecky Klub (Artists' Club) in the arrangement of the Ales [Mikulas Ales--the contemporary, most characteristically Bohemian painter, particularly famous for his drawing and illustrations for folk songs, national poems, etc.] memorial night, from which one thousand crowns ($200) were sent to Bohemia for the Ales memorial.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Publicity was given to Professor Pupin's appeal and a resolution was prepared for the meeting for the benefit of wounded soldiers in the Balkan War. A release covering the meeting was prepared for and sent to English language newspapers.</p>
   <p>The Bureau has been and is making extensive preparations for the Jaroslav Vrchlicky memorial night, which will take place in Chicago on November 20.</p>
   <p>Congressman Adolph J. Sabath was requested to bring about a revision in the agreement between the United States and Austria concerning the military service obligation of immigrants. He promised in his letter of November 13 to inaugurate the necessary steps in this matter. An agreement was reached with the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League) concerning December 13 as the day of Dr. Blaho's [a Slovak leader from Moravia] lecture in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The fact that the seat of the Bureau is in Chicago has not prevented it from co-operating, whenever asked with Bohemian groups in all parts of the country.....</p>
