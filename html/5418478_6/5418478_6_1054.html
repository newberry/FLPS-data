   <p>The occupation of a journalist is a thankless one, but sometimes it also has its bright moments. We lived through such a great and joyful moment yesterday afternoon in the Sokol Chicago hall where, under the auspices of the Veelky (Ladies' Auxiliary of the Czechoslovak National Alliance of America) and with the cooperation of the Lawndale Conservatory of Music and Arts, a splendid concert was arranged, the proceeds of which will be turned over to Hoover's relief fund for the benefit of children in Czechoslovakia. Through our newspaper, we have conscientiously striven to arouse the greatest interest in Mr. Hoover's relief work.</p>
   <p>That our efforts were not in vain has been proved by the large contributions which are being deposited in our office, and this fact was also proved yesterday afternoon by the audience, which was great in spite of the unpleasant weather. The spacious hall was crowded and therefore the financial success of this concert was beyond our expectations. And as far as the moral aspect of the concert is concerned, it was also a success. The program was primarily artistic. Various numbers were presented by our foremost artists, including Mr. Edward Freund, violin virtuoso; Miss Tana Vojan, piano virtuoso; Miss May Hajicek, soprano; and pupils of Miss Libuse Bartuska's dancing school. Indisputably,the best number of the program was the closing scene, presented by about thirty pupils of the dancing school, with Misses Bartuska, Milada Krametbauer, and Emilie Bentley as solo dancers. The scene portrayed the fall and resurrection of Bohemia and Slovakia. All those who participated in this scene received deserving applause.</p>
   <p>We must also mention the beautiful deed of Miss Libuse C. Hajek, daughter of the late co-publisher of the Denni Hlasatel, Mr. Frantisek Hajek. Miss Hajek resides with her mother, Mrs. Karolina Hajek, in Riverside, Illinois. Instead of buying flowers for her little friends who participated in the scene, Miss Hajek deposited five dollars in our office for the suffering children in Czechoslovakia. The beautiful deed of this intelligent Bohemian-American girl should serve as an example at similar occasions.</p>
