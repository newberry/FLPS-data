   <p>The Ladies' Auxiliary of the Bohemian Charitable Association has shown on innumerable occasions that its main function is humanitarian and patriotic endeavor. In their last meeting, these devoted women voted an appropriation of one hundred dollars, which will be divided between the Vcelky (Little Bees) of the Czech National Alliance and the Vcelky of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. The Auxiliary performed a humanitarian and patriotic deed, because the Vcelky work for the benefit and relief of our Czechoslovak soldiers.</p>
