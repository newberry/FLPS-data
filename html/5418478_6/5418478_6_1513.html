   <p>Sokol Dolezal, president of the Miroslav Tyrs Sokol Group, in the presence of the delegates brought the convention to order at about four o'clock in the afternoon with a suitable address. Mr. Joseph Cermak, for the National Sokol Union, thanked the convention for the invitation. Elections were then held and Sokol Dolezal was elected chairman of the convention; Sokol Mejda, vice chairman; Sokol Ditrt, secretary; Sokol Martinek, assistant secretary.....</p>
   <p>Sokol Treska, from Sokol Palacky of Detroit, introduced various motions for the amendment of the bylaws. It was resolved that local delegates should be allowed to represent only one out-of-town society.</p>
   <p>A motion was made that the Fuegner-Tyrs Group should withdraw from the Czech Sokol Community, because there are no advantages derived therefrom, indeed, all the resources of the Group are exhausted and its existence threatened.</p>

   <p>Sokol Ditrt spoke against the motion, saying that it was not possible to expect much in such a short time and protesting against all such motions. The debate was participated in by other delegates.</p>
   <p>In the course of the debate concerning withdrawal from the Sokol Community, the journal Straz Sokola (Sokol Sentinel) was mentioned and the complaint registered that the journal costs too much. The question as to whether or not it would be more advantageous to return to the old system and again publish a journal for the Fuegner-Tyrs Group, because the Straz Sokola dedicates very little attention to the Group, was debated. A committee was then elected which is to investigate whether or not a separate journal should be published for the Groups.</p>
   <p>The convention was adjourned at six o'clock in the evening and will reconvene today.</p>
