   <p>There was a celebration held in the hall of the C. S. P. S. (Czech-Slovak Aid Society), last Saturday, commemorating the three hundred and twenty-fifth birthday of Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius). Of him it can be rightly said that he was a teacher of nations. A poet sang of him that his heart warmed up all mankind. The Educational Club of the Czech-American Youth, the Clubs, Moravian and Buchlov, and the First Slovene Sokol sponsored the affair. Professor Bohumil Simek, member of the faculty of the Iowa State University, and one of our luminaries, was the main speaker. He is a man of whom all Czech-America may be proud. He was born and reared in this country, yet he has been one of our staunchest adherents and national workers; besides he is a speaker very well worth anyone's attention. To him belongs the credit for the creation in 1904 of the first Czech student's club at the University of Nebraska which was named "Komensky." Twenty-nine more such clubs have been founded in <span class="page-break">\2</span>the United States since that time.</p>
   <p>The subject for the address was "Jan Amos Komensky and His Significance." The main appeal in the brilliant speech was directed toward the Czech-American youth.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the program consisted of music and recitations of high quality. "Komensky Parting with His Motherland," a picture made up of live figures, closed the evening with the national anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" (Where is My Homeland?) sung by the audience. The music supplied by the orchestra, under Mr. Kratochvil's baton, deserves much praise.</p>
