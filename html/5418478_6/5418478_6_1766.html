   <p>Today is Czechoslovak Day in the War Exhibition in Grant Park. There will be a parade of the Czechoslovaks in Chicago, who are going to manifest their joy over the proclamation of independence by President Wilson, and take a vow of loyalty to this Republic and the head of the government.</p>
   <p>We expect this celebration to be a magnificent affair. Most of our associations have promised to appear in the garb of their business. Our butchers, also, will march in their uniforms. We are addressing ourselves to businessmen to help toward the success of the celebration by closing their shops and stores about the noon hour, while they may keep open the next day, Sunday till 10 A.M.</p>
