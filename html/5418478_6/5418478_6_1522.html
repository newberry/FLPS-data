   <p>A memorable celebration was held Saturday on the spacious premises of Atlas Park, near the Bohemian National Cemetery. The newly created group Sokol Rozvoj was inducted into the National Sokol Union in a festive manner. This energetic group, though organized only a short time ago, places it self along side the other groups belonging to the National Unity and will surely be an important participant in the life of our countrymen settled in Irving Park..... The celebration was attended by a gigantic crowd and the financial and moral success exceeded all expectations of the arrangements committee. We are sure that Sokol Rozvoj will soon be heard from again and that it will play an honorable role in all national undertakings.</p>
