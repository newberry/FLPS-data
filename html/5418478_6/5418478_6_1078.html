   <p>To the ever-increasing number of inquiries from individuals and societies which are being made to the legionnaires and members of the executive committee as to whether or not the legionnaires will actively participate in a national bazaar being arranged by the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America), the Slovenska Liga v Americe (Slovak League of America), the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America), the Cesky Umelecky Klub v Chicagu (Bohemian Arts Club of Chicago), and others, we briefly reply:</p>
   <p>Although we heartily wish great success to this national bazaar held for the benefit of our brother legionnaires and their survivors in Czechoslovakia, recent events prevent us from participating in this enterprise. The Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago will arrange their own national bazaar in <span class="page-break">\2</span>September of this year, for which preparations are almost completed.</p>
   <p>For the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee.</p>
