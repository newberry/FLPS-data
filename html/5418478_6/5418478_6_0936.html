   <p>In the year 1902 there immigrated to America 155, 789 Slavs and of these 69,620 were Poles, 36,934 were Slovaks, 5,590 were Czechs, 30,233 were Croatians, and 7,533 were Rusinians. The other Slavs, such as Russians, Serbs, Bulgarians, etc., numbered only 5,879 all together. This heavy migration, which this year assumes even greater proportions, is the source of a severe headache to all those who are filled with prejudice against the Slavs. However, the greatest enemies of the Slavs in America are forced to admit that these immigrants are full of energetic strength, that they want to work and are ambitious.</p>
   <p>Such immigrants should be welcomed here and should not be maligned as is being done. From reports in the newspapers it is thought that new proposals of immigration will be introduced in the next session of Congress. So that the opposition might be weakened, the enemies of immigration are spreading honey for the Irish, Germans, and Scandinavians, by expressing regret, that so few of these "desirable" immigrants are coming here now, and taking a position in opposition to the Slavs and Italians, who now make up the greater proportion of all immigration.</p>
   <p>However, if any laws are passed, they will affect all immigrants and therefore, they should all be on guard together and work against the efforts of the "Know Nothings."</p>
