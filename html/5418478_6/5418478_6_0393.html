   <p>The appeal of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) seems to have reached the hearts of our countrymen. The fund for the relief of the suffering in our old country is growing, and we hope that its size will soon become commensurate with the strength and patriotism of Bohemian-America, which has not forgotten the old country but which feels deeply for her countrymen abroad and knows how to act unselfishly whenever conditions require help.....The fund now amounts to $8,279.09.....</p>
