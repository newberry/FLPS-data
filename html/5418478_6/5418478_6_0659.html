   <p>P.1--Various contributions, made for national undertakings or needy individuals, lie uncalled for, at the office of this newspaper. This is due to the fact that the committees of various lodges or individuals, consider those collections closed, and fail to notice that other contributions and donations are made later, on a new list.</p>
   <p>Thus the office of the newspaper has now on hand many contributions, that have been lying idle, for weeks and even months. These are intended for the following, namely for the Vojta Naprstek School, for the Bohemian School of Oak Park, for Sokol Havlicek, for Sokol Miroslav Tyrs, for the Patronage (C.S.P.S.) Bohemian Slovanian Benevolent Society of Town Lake, for the Patronage (C.S.P.S.) Bohemian Slovanian Benevolent Society on West 18th Street, for the Scholastic School in Irving Park, for the Bohemian National Sokol Pokrok, and for other institutions and individuals.</p>
   <p>If within the course of one month, the above contributions are not called for, they will be either returned to the contributors or with the latter's consent turned over to the Central Scholastic School in Bohemia, or to the Old Peoples' Home and Orphanage.</p>
