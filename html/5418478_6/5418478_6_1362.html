   <p>The executive committee of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) held a meeting May 6 at which it agreed to discontinue temporarily the activities of the Kancelar and transfer all its work to the Tiskovy Vybor Narodniho Sdruzeni (Press Committee of the Bohemian National Alliance).</p>
   <p>These are the principal reasons for this decision:</p>
   <p>These great, historic times which will possibly decide the destiny of the Bohemian nation, demand urgently the concentration of all powers and resources, and also the joining of all serious national workers under one flag.</p>
   <p>The press committee of the Narodni Sdruzeni, originally composed of members <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the executive committee of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar and a number of other national workers, is working in the same field and follows the same objectives as the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar. Their work is, in fact, identical: Dissemination among non-Bohemians, and particularly among the Americans, of information concerning the Bohemian nation, its conditions, aims, and desires, and functioning as the headquarters of Bohemian-American journalism. It is certainly purposeless to have the same work done by two separate bodies. It would mean working at cross purposes, overlapping, or at least wasting, of effort.</p>
   <p>The necessity of having one headquarters for the dissemination of proper information, of propaganda for our aims and for the political action for the liberation of our nation, has caused the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar to discontinue the solicitation of memberships and the collection of fees and contributions needed for the upkeep of its office. After the contributions of the members of its executive committee and funds donated by its founders became exhausted, the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar found itself without <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>means to continue its work.</p>
   <p>Hence the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar has decided to discontinue its work for the duration of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, to turn over to the Sdruzeni all its connections and good will, and to give all possible support to the Sdruzeni press committee. The president and two other members of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar have become members of the executive committee of the Narodni Sdruzeni, and are hoping that their six years' experience in the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar will be helpful in the work of the press committee of the Narodni Sdruzeni.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar agreed to donate the remainder of its funds to the Narodni Sdruzeni for the political action, except one hundred dollars, which they will retain in case the Narodni Sdruzeni and its press committee go out of existence. In that case the undersigned members of the executive committee of the Cesko-Americka <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Tiskova Kancelar will consider it their duty to revive the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, using the mentioned amount of money to start its work again.</p>
   <p>After six years of activity during which it was putting forth its best efforts to fulfill its large program of work and during which, in addition to a large number of small but important tasks, it accomplished a number of big actions which will always remain noted as real achievements in the history of Bohemian America, the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar parts with the Bohemian-American public, requesting it to give all its confidence and support to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni and to have all workers co-operate in the great and important work which is likely to fashion the destinies of our old country. It is its wish to see all the nationally enlightened countrymen who were supporting the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar during the years of its existence by membership fees and voluntary donations show their generosity, multiplied many times, to the Narodni Sdruzeni, and remember that the time is here for Bohemian America to prove that it is not indifferent to the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>future of our nation.</p>
