   <p>As we have previously stated, this year's school census shows that 102,749 Bohemians live in Chicago. This figure includes both Bohemians born in the old country and American-born Bohemians whose fathers are of Bohemian origin. There are more American-born Bohemians in Chicago than those born in the old country. The first number 53,675 as against 49,074 of the latter. Most Bohemians live in the Tenth, Twelfth, Twenty-ninth and Thirty-fourth Wards, but there is not one single ward in Chicago without any Bohemians. The number of Bohemians in the several wards is as follows:</p>

   <p>These, together with recently annexed Morgan Park, where there are <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>four Bohemian-born and five American-born Bohemians give a total of 49,074 Bohemian-born, and 53,675 American-born Bohemians residing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>These figures, however, do not give an exact picture. Mr. J. A. Holpuch, the only Bohemian member of the Chicago board of education at the present time, has pointed out that many American-born Bohemians have registered as Americans, even though their parents were born in the old country.</p>
