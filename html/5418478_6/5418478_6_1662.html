   <p>The 28th of October is no less important to us than the Fourth of July is to Americans or the 14th of July to the French. It represents the crystallization of our revolutionary activities, in which the Czechoslovaks of America took part not only financially and through active propaganda but also by recruiting volunteers among our people and sending them abroad to join the colors of the Czechoslovak army.....And while our legions fought the enemy at the battle front, our countrymen in the old homeland rose to shake off a yoke centuries old. The day of October 28 is therefore a national holiday for all Czechoslovaks, and it is also the duty of our countrymen in America to bring to remembrance the significance of the liberty thus gained. The Svazova Druzina Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (local branch of the federation of Czechoslovak legionnaires), in co-operation with Sokol Union 179,....has arranged a celebration of the Czechoslovak Independence Day on October 28.</p>
   
   <p>The celebration is to be held in Brother Stancik's place, 205 East 115th Street (Pullman).....</p>
