   <p>An inquest was held yesterday at the Lawndale Police Station over the corpse of fifty-four year old carpenter contractor Joseph Vacek, of 2919 South Hamlin Avenue, who was shot to death the day before yesterday by his sixteen year old son Joseph Vacek Jr., who, according to witnesses, was his favorite son.</p>
   <p>It is a terrible tragedy and the son, although he wept and complained when taken into custody by the police, probably does not realize what a terrible deed he has committed; indeed, according to all indications, it seems to us that his mind is not in perfect order.......</p>
   <p>Upon the advice of counsel, the patricide Joseph Vacek Jr., declined to testify at the inquest......</p>
   <p>After the hearing, the coroner's jury bound the youth over to the Grand Jury, without bail, and he was taken to the County Jail......</p>
