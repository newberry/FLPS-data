   <p>Enemies of the immigrant element are taking advantage of wartime conditions. They insist that there should be one language and one sentiment in this country. They complain about the permitting of immigrants to perpetuate their mother tongue, build their schools, and publish their newspapers. Consequently, these immigrants feel more attached to their motherland than to the United States. "The result of this exhibits itself in an especially malicious light just now during the World War, when the entire populace should stand united--one mighty rampart against a dangerous enemy." Thus runs the claim.</p>
   <p>We Czechs need not defend ourselves in this respect. Even before war was declared against Germany and Austria, our boys hastened to enlist in the United States Army and Navy. We may fairly claim that there are fewer draft dodgers of our nationality than of any other.</p>
   
   <p>War bonds and war-savings stamps were bought by our people and contributions were made for the relief of soldiers. Our fellow countrymen fulfill their duty and intend to do so until the end of the war. Czech newspapers, schools, and Czech organizations have taught our people to perform the work in true Czech spirit, which is at the same time American. Both spell democracy, justice, and humanitarianism.</p>
   <p>The same spirit prevails among immigrants of other nationalities, particularly the Slavs, who have given conclusive proof of their loyalty to America.</p>
   <p>A voice rose against the enemies of the immigrant element recently which merits particular esteem. It came from Miss Mary McDowell, for many years head of the University Settlement in the Chicago Stock Yards district, where she works among immigrants, particularly of Slav descent. Her words should permeate the thinking of the American people and should especially reach those who would like to make out of immigrants so-called "Americans", meaning people would speak English, but would at the same time be ashamed of the spirit they had imbibed with the milk of their immigrant mothers--people who would have only a hazy concept of the real American spirit.</p>
   <p>We regret that we are not in possession of the entire address delivered by Miss McDowell, but we content ourselves with a short excerpt printed in last Monday's Chicago Daily Tribune, a paper which itself is fervently advocating rapid Americanization of immigrants. The excerpt runs:</p>
   <p>"Our efforts should be directed first toward allowing immigrant children to learn to make use of the culture of the native land of their parents, and then, when they are growing up, to acquaint them in their own language with American history and customs. Too hasty Americanization of children makes young rowdies of them, thus creating a more serious danger than is presented by the problem of parents who do not know English. It does not matter in what language we teach, but what we instill. It is nonsense to say that we are impeding the progress of the immigrants if we permit them to perpetuate the traditions of the hand of their birth and to keep their language alive.</p>
   
   <p>They can absorb new ideas only when the ideas are conveyed to them in the language they understand. When they have grasped the meaning of American ideas, they will naturally want to learn our language."</p>
   <p>Miss McDowell may justly lay claim to a better knowledge of the immigrants than any other person of our local native American society. She has done more to spread understanding of America ideals among immigrants than any one of those people who think that by merely having taught the immigrant the English language, they have transformed him into a real American......It is worth noticing that Miss McDowell recommends not only that the parents be taught American institutions and ideals in their native tongue, but also that the children be introduced to the culture of the land of their parents' birth.</p>
   <p>This means that Czech children should be taught Czech history, that they should be informed about what the Czech nation has done for the enlightenment and progress of mankind, so that they will learn to esteem the nation from which they came and proudly claim allegiance to it, even when they are full-fledged Americans and speak the English language.</p>
   <p>Miss McDowell is perfectly correct in stating that quick Americanization has a destructive effect upon family life and the entire education of the children. This conviction may have come to her by observing families with whom she came in contact. She speaks of children who were brought up only to become young rowdies. They exhibit their bad manners before their parents, whom they have been taught to look down upon because the latter do not know the English language. The children are advised in schools and by newspapers that such people are inferior. Consequently, they refuse to obey or be advised by their elders. Family ties are thereby loosened, and many a young soul goes astray. This would not happen if the child learned to esteem his parents' nationality.</p>
   <p>There is considerable fault in American public life. It lies in permitting some people to parade as experts, and to speak or write on subjects which they have not studied and digested. These people indulge in hollow phrases, touching in a desultory manner upon questions that just happen to be the fad at the moment. Immigration is discussed mostly by people who never had any contact with immigrants and therefore know nothing about their longings and efforts, their material and spiritual interests.</p>
   <p>People of such caliber charge themselves with the task of solving problems concerning almost one fifth of the population of the United States, including questions of vital importance to all American people. Their "solutions" do no good, but generate much evil. It is, therefore, most advisable that men and women who are as qualified as Miss McDowell is, raise their voices and wield their pens, drawing from their experiences and through studies of many years. When this takes place, we may hope that American immigration will move in the right direction for the good of both immigrants and native Americans.</p>
