   <p>The Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) may look back with pride upon the work done during the first three months of its existence. Up to this time, $4,505.70 has been collected in voluntary contributions, and $1,200 has been deposited for our account with newspapers. The largest part of this money represents donations from individuals. Our civic organizations and public corporations have so far done very little, for the simple reason that we have thought it advisable to concentrate on individuals during the first period of enthusiasm. But now that we have succeeded in getting representatives of all the largest national organizations into our Vybor, the work within other societies, associations, and groups will start. We are hoping that all of them will again show their love for humanity and their patriotic spirit and will make substantial contributions for war relief in the old country. Similar activity will be inaugurated among our businessmen.</p>
   
   <p>The Pomocny Vybor is also extending its work in other directions. There will be two festivities taking place in Chicago which will be given for our benefit.</p>
   <p>The Narodni Jenota Sokolska (National Sokol Union) will present a public drill in co-operation with the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies) in the Pilsen Park pavilion on November 15. The Pevecky Sbor Bedrich Smetana (Bedrich Smetana Singing Society), in co-operation with the violin virtuoso, Miss J. Rudis-Jicinsky, and the singers, Mrs. Topinka and Mr. Ernst, will give a concert in the Sokol Chicago hall on December 6.</p>
   <p>As was mentioned in our first report, the Vypomocny Vybor has contacted the Sokols and the teachers in Bohemia in order to get their help in distributing our contributions to the most needy, patriotic Bohemians in the old country. At this time it may be reported that requests for support have started to arrive, the first coming from Krkonose (German: Riesengebirge), the poorest part of Bohemia.</p>
   
   <p>The following organizations have sent their representatives to the executive committee of the Pomocny Vybor: The grand lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) of the State of Illinois, Messrs. K. Kopecky and C. Hurt, the grand lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity), Mrs. M. Liska and Mrs. F. Pokorny; the Narodni Jednota Sokolska, Mr. J. Siman and J. Cermak; the Sokolska Zupa Fuegner-Tyrs (Sokol Unit called Zupa Fuegner Tyrs), Mr. B. Hak; the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity), Dr. K. Neuman and Mrs. J. Motyka; the grand lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Vlastenek (Unity of Bohemian Patriotic Women), Mrs. M. Smrcka and Mrs. H. John; the Cesko-Americti Lesnici a Lesnice (Bohemian-American Men and Women Foresters), Mr. Z. Chobotsky and Mr. V. F. Hajek; the grand lodge of the Taboriti (Taborites) of the State of Illinois, Mr. J. Vodrazka and Mr. J. F. Sidlicky. We are hoping that all other groups which we have invited to co-operate with us will send their representatives in the near future.</p>
   <p>Two members of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor, Dr. J. Rudis-Jicinsky and Mr. J. Skrivanek, together with Dr. J. Krasa and a nurse, Mr. K. Klepal, left this week for the battlefields in Serbia to perform the work of Good Samaritans. The expedition is being financed by wealthy Americans and is led by our x-ray specialist, Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky, the most active member of our committee. All of Bohemian America wishes them success.</p>
   <p>For the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor, J. V. Nigrin, secretary; James F. Stepina, president.</p>
