   <p>p. 1 - col. 5.. Often we are told that we neglect to give aid to our poor countrymen and orphans, that we are inclined to be selfish, instead of giving them a helping hand in time of need. It is pointed out that other nationalities are taking greater interest in helping their poor and orphaned. Often we are informed by the police department of needy Bohemian families which are not given aid, due to our lack of interest in benevolent work.</p>
   <p>It is time that we Bohemians of Chicago make amends. This will be done by doubling our representation at the International Benevolent Association.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago we have a benevolent institution known as Bureau of Charities, which helps the poor and orphans of this city to a certain extent, but it can not shoulder the full responsibility. It is up to us to give this organization our support.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians had only one member or representative in these organizations - Mr. K. Vopicka, but during the last meeting of the Bohemian Benevolent Societies, Mr. C. G. Foucek, a well known Bohemian druggist, was appointed to also <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>represent them.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. G. Foucek, who has long been active in this work is well qualified for this position. He promises to advise and do all he can in helping needy Bohemians of Chicago. Mr. C. G. Foucek will render his services to any needy or orphaned Bohemian in Chicago and there is no doubt he will advise and aid every one in the best way that he possibly can. Hereafter cases of this nature will receive more attention.</p>
