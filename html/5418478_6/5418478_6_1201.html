   <p>The National Socialist Workmen's Club Fresl is making its first appearance before the American public. Its membership is composed mostly of former members of the Beseda Fric (Club Fric). The reasons which prompted us to found the Club Fresl are well known. We are going to work for the great movement as represented by the Czech National Alliance and other patriotic associations. We want to give the care of Czech prisoners of war our undivided attention. The Club Fresl was founded last May, and has been sending two hundred packages weekly for the relief of our soldiers abroad. This makes very exacting demands upon our finances, and we hope for contributions from the American public.</p>
