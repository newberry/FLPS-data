   <p>America has taken a stand on the side of our revolutionary movement, and thus the question of Czechoslovak independence has become universal. It is up to us to help our government annihilate our age-old murderer; it is up to us to appreciate the recognition of our rights by the United States. No one should use Americanism merely as a cloak, but he should show his colors, for now is the time when every hand is needed. To be a Czech means to be a good American also.</p>
   <p>The Cicero branch of the Czech National Alliance will hold its regular meeting today at 8 P. M. in the hall of Sokol Karel Jonas. That is the right place for every Czech. There are still many who lag in their Czech conscientiousness. Let us put all our personal opinions aside; let us cast off our shackles. Let us join hands and help our fellow countrymen in the old homeland cut their tethers. Come, and participate in the meeting to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the last man. Your place is at our side! Your work is bound with ours! The Czech National Alliance is calling you!</p>
   <p>For the Cicero branch,</p>
   <p>Karel (Charles) Toplan, secretary.</p>
