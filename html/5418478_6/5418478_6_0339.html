   <p>The last few days have seen a stepping up of political activities, and have brought fine results. These activities were particularly successful in two of our colonies, and their success is due to the tireless work of a few individuals who have made it their business to stir up the active interest of their friends and acquaintances in the liberating activity.</p>
   <p>This work is of particular merit because it is very, very difficult. Knowing the indifference of a large part of our people, we know how to appreciate the work of men and women who go from house to house, from door to door, trying to explain the purpose of the movement. There are always so many excuses ready where it is a question of supporting a Bohemian cause! But these activities [this propaganda work] must be continued; and those of our unselfish, self-sacrificing individuals who are conducting them will be rewarded by the knowledge that they have done their patriotic duty, and that their efforts toward a better future for the Bohemian nation will be a part of the recorded history, not only of Bohemian-America, but also of the struggle for Bohemian independence.</p>
   <p>Two of our communities have made their work known recently. They are those of Morton Park and of Town of Lake respectively. In the first community, the Sokol Karel Jonas presented the beautiful evening program we reported on Monday.</p>
   <p>"The Bohemian Town of Lake to the Homeland," was the motto of the Sunday celebration whose program started with a presentation of musical selections played by the fifty-piece band of Mr. Lhotak....The band rendered its service free of charge....and played some of the most popular compositions of Dvorak, Smetana, Friml, and Kryl.....</p>
   <p>The hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Associations) in Town of Lake was a scene of lively activities on the part of the youngest of our countrymen, our children, throughout the afternoon. The majority of the audience were ladies; in fact, there were only a few men present.</p>
   <p>In the evening there was an address by the secretary of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), Mr. J. Tvrzicky-Kramer, who stressed the necessity of work for Bohemia's liberation. He pointed to the fact that local nationals of many countries of Europe have done important work for the liberation of their homelands overseas; such as the Irish, Greek, Poles, Yugoslavs. He stressed the point that their activities had never been considered by anyone a violation of neutrality. Thus no one could consider as a violation of neutrality the Bohemian movement, which, after all, is now only in its very beginning.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzicky's speech was received with enthusiasm. It left a feeling of deep conviction.....The workers of Morton Park and those of Town of Lake have promised that they will attempt the organization of a branch of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni in each of these two communities, and it is, therefore, to be hoped that the Sdruzeni will soon become the strongest body in Bohemian-Chicago. The working committee of Town of Lake, composed of representatives of all local Bohemian organizations in that community, deserves special recognition. Its members personally collected funds exceeding now the sum of $1,200, and there are hopes that it will be increased to $2,000 in the very near future. Thus the benefactions of this community will surpass those of both the rich business district of Bohemian Pilsen and the large Bohemian California district!</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni has now branches in New York, Boston, Baltimore, Detroit, Cedar Rapids (Iowa), Cleveland, Omaha, San Francisco, and New Bedford [Massachusetts]. Thus there are now nine Sdruzeni's. Soon there will be a branch in Town of Lake; and one in Cicero, one in Racine, and, most likely, also, one in Westfield, Massachusetts, and one in Springfield, Massachusetts.....</p>
   
   <p>The splendid sum raised in Town of Lake has been mentioned. A shining example is the community of greater New York; also that of Cedar Rapids. In each of these the sum of $1,500 was collected in a short period of time. In Boston, where the Bohemian colony has only about five hundred members, $900 was collected. San Francisco contributed $500, and a similar sum came from Omaha.</p>
   <p>There are, however, states, Missouri and Wisconsin, for instance, where Bohemian associations were organized more than fifty years ago. The Bohemian colonies in Milwaukee and St. Louis, especially, should see to it that the history of Bohemian-America will have something else to tell about them than that they knew how to keep quiet.....</p>
   <p>Cleveland, also should show greater energy, since it is the third largest Bohemian colony in America.</p>
   <p>But Chicago has the saddest record so far. There have been some encouraging signs [Sokol Slavsky has contributed $500; Zupa Fuegner Tyrs (Sokol unit called Zupa Fuegner Tyrs), $200; the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Unity), $275, the Pilsen Butchers Association, $100]; but in the foregoing list does not appear the names of the largest and richest Sokol units, our benevolent associations, and the richest Bohemian organization [Editor's note: Meaning no doubt the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club)]!</p>
   <p>To talk about wealthy individuals seems a waste of breath. Names of most of our rich countrymen are missing on our lists, and so are the names of many firms having Bohemian patronage exclusively; firms which have grown prosperous because our Bohemian community has thought they were Bohemian firms and, therefore, worthy of confidence. Have they remained Bohemian until now? It will soon be time to go through the lists of Bohemian bankers, Bohemian businessmen, Bohemian lawyers and physicians. This will be done at the beginning of May when general collecting will start.</p>
   <p>Who of our well-to-do countrymen will save us this work, and, seeing this challenge, will recall that they are Bohemians?</p>
