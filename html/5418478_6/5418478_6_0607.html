   <p>Mr. F. J. Skala, well-known Chicago banker and treasurer of the executive committee of the Bohemian-American Press Bureau, sent 9,700 Austrian crowns to the Czech Central School Association in Prague, Bohemia, the proceeds of a collection initiated by the Bohemian-American Press Bureau among all Czech-American communities. The Press Bureau deserves the utmost credit for its patriotic enterprise.</p>
   <p>About $12,000 was collected for similar noble purposes in the course of the last year. Much more could have been done, we are sure, with still more exertion on our part. The recently created Bohemian-American National Council has taken over from the Press Bureau the task of collecting funds for the pursuit of national aims.</p>
