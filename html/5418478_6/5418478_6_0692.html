   <p>p.4- Bohemian workingmen will do their duty. Welfare activity on behalf of the striking coal-miners has been started in the larger communities, and it is expected that it will have the support of the majority of our public.</p>
   <p>Bohemian California, in this respect, is progressing far ahead of all other Bohemian communities. Bohemian women of Bohemian, California are arranging a ball for Saturday evening, Oct. 11th, from which the net proceeds will be donated to the needy coal-miners.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, following this affair there will be held a grand party by union workingmen for the same purpose. We feel certain that both of these undertakings will meet with great success. Bohemians, without exception, sympathize with the lockedout coal-miners and, with all their heart, wish for them a victory over the pot-bellied capitalists. In order to help the coal-miners to gain their victory Bohemians will contribute their dollars.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian-California community is so large and so well informed, that both entertainments will be able to boast a large attendance.</p>
