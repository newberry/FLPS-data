   <p>p. 1.Col.6--We have mentioned repeatedly, that it is our duty as Americans and Czechs to contribute according to our means toward the alleviation of the terrible suffering into which were suddenly hurled the inhabitants of our westernmost metropolis, prospering San Francisco, and of other towns of sunny California.</p>
   <p>The San Francisco Bohemian settlement was not large, numbering only a few hundred people, but according to reports which have reached us of the destruction caused by the earthquake and conflagration, they lost everything.</p>
   <p>Trade unions are sending contributions to their own members who are suffering there, everyone is taking care of those who are nearest to them. Should we remain indifferent and allow the suffering of our brethren to pass unheeded?</p>
   
   <p>This is incompatible with our national consciousness; we would gladly contribute even if there were none of our fellow-countrymen among the sufferers.</p>
   <p>Let us exert all our energy in order to make the collection as effective as possible when we are concerned with the alleviation of want and suffering of many Bohemian families. Our people are generous, this no one can deny. Here is the opportunity to demonstrate this characteristic of ours to the American public, and to help our countrymen who are the victims of one of the most terrible catastrophes recorded in the history of the world.</p>
   <p>Denni Hlasatel begins the collection with a gift of seventy-five dollars.</p>
