   <p>140,000 cents will be added to the million cent collection for the benefit of the Central Scholastic Association.</p>
   <p>P.1, Col.1--It happens very seldom, when such numbers of Chicago countrymen meet at one time in the same place to do homage to a single idea. We witnessed something of the kind in Pilsen Park yesterday evening, where a great national celebration in memory of the 25th anniversary of the theatrical mission of American countrymen to Bohemia, the first mission and visitation to the homeland, at which time a somewhat official beginning was made in the collection of a million pennies for the benefit of the Central Scholastic Association in Bohemia. The attendance and success were, even though expected, simply surprising. We will not be overestimating, in any way, if we say that over 4,000 countrymen attended the celebration yesterday and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>they were almost all Bohemians who knew what the celebration meant to Chicago Bohemians, that it was in fact a distinguished commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the day, on which the American branch of Bohemians drew closer to the race from which they originated. It was truly a festive evening.</p>
   <p>The financial and moral success of yesterday's celebration was beyond expectation. Approximate summary of the receipts is as follows: For "Chips," $774.40; for admission tickets at the gate $186.40; for wine $100.00; from Mr. Beranek, $36.20; from Mrs. Randak, $30.00; from the Ladies of the Bohemian Club, $23.00; from the Bohemian Ladies Unity, $102.65; from Miss Belohlavek, $30.00; from Mrs. Stevens, $45.00 and others. This is only an estimate and a detailed report will be made later.</p>
   <p>Now it remains for those who were not present at the celebration to endeavor, by their actions to contribute to the collection sheets, so that Chicago Bohemians can collect a greater part of the million penny collection.</p>
   <p>The committee will hold a meeting Monday June 20th at 8 P.M. in "Libuse" hall.</p>
