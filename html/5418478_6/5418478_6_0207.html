   <p>The Havlicek-Tyrs Sokol gymnastic society gave a theatrical performance in its hall on Lawndale Avenue and 26th Street last night, the proceeds of which are to be donated for the benefit of our Czech volunteers in the Allied Armies. It is to be regretted that the audience was not large, although the purpose was a noble one, and the players discharged their tasks very skillfully. The atmosphere which pervaded the audience was refreshing, nevertheless.</p>
   <p>F. F. Samberk's comedy, "Svatojanska Pout'" (The Pilgrimage on St. John's Day), went across the footlights smoothly, spreading all the mirth with which this well-known piece is replete. Numerous sarcastic remarks concerning political and economical conditions in Bohemia are interwoven with humor, but they did not fail in their intended effect upon the public. Amateurs and full-fledged professional actors made up the cast.</p>
