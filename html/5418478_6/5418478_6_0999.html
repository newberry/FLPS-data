   <p>The military committee of the Czech National Alliance and of the Sokol Community of America has concluded the first part of its program, in having been helpful in the enlistment of Czech-Americans before compulsory service is introduced. The activity carried on by the Committee has been a success; more than fifty per cent of all the Czech-Americans who enlisted throughout the United States came from the ranks of the Sokol gymnastic societies. The percentage of our own volunteers is higher than that of any other immigrant group; we are proud of this fact, and not less of the appreciation of our efforts by the authorities; even if we have not been able to prove to them that a regiment consisting of Czech-Americans would be of advantage to <span class="page-break">2</span>the United States Army, we have still given an example of willingness to sacrifice and of patriotic endeavor.....</p>
   <p>It was pointed out by some of our fellow-citizens that not sufficient pressure has been brought to bear upon the government, and that our action was precipitant. Both these objections appear to us to be invalid, for the Czech National Alliance, as well us the Sokol Community of America, have done their utmost to secure a full success. We have had contact with the War Department, both personal and by correspondence; Mr. Sidl of Cleveland, Ohio, a personal friend of Mr. Baker, voiced the wishes of the Czech-Americans concerning the formation of a Czech regiment. The Secretary of War viewed the plan with favor, the General Staff of the Army, however, objected pointing to the system used in the Canadian army which proved inefficient. With regard to bringing up the various units to full war strength, and with regard to their training as well, the United States Army is going to follow its own program. Our General Staff intends to use the volunteers for the completion of the present units, and then begin their training in large bodies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Secretary of War, in accepting the recommendations of the General Staff, cannot, therefore, grant the wishes of the Czech-Americans, though he had at first promised to fulfill them..... It was contended by some of our people that the military committee should first have worked to assemble enough Czech volunteers to form a complete regiment, in full war strength, and not until then stepped before the Government with its suggestion for a distinct Czech-American unit. To accomplish this was beyond even the almost superhuman efforts of the military committee....</p>
   <p>The military committee had sent urgent appeals to every branch of the Czech National Alliance and of the Sokol Community of America. Though these appeals had been doubled, not a single response was obtained from any of the Sokol branches except from the group T. J. S. Blesk of Baltimore, Ohio,</p>
   <p>The fact that several hundred of our men enlisted in Chicago, and several <span class="page-break">4</span>hundred in the rest of the Czech-American communities, was fully utilized for our national aims by the English language department of the Press Bureau of the Czech National Alliance; this is proved by laudatory articles which appeared in not less than one hundred and twenty American-English language papers which held us up as model citizens. Many of these papers gave us space to make the broad American public acquainted with our exertions in behalf of the liberation of our old homeland; they were publications from all over the United States, which demonstrates the extensive activities of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <p>It is fitting, in addition to the foregoing, to consider again that if our Sokol volunteers had postponed their enlistments they would have automatically renounced certain advantages, even though small, which had been promised by the military authorities, and at least partially granted, to those who offered themselves before compulsory service is introduced; the cause of Czech liberty would also have been poorly served, as there is no merit in enlisting for service when there is no way to escape it anyhow.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The military committee has been unable to recruit the full number of men who could have simultaneously met the three conditions for voluntary enlistment with a chance for early advancement, that is: a minimum age of twenty-five; previous military training in any army; and United States citizenship.</p>
   <p>The attitude taken by the Secretary of War can be understood from his letter to Doctor [Ludwig J.] Fisher of the Czech National Alliance reading:</p>
   <p>"I take pleasure in acknowledging receipt of your letter, dated April 30, in which you make reference to a letter of April 16, 1917, and to your answer to me April 21, 1917. After my conversation with Mr. Sidl of Cleveland, Ohio, and in response to your request mentioned above, I can only say that at the present time the policy of the War Department does not allow the organization of an individual regiment composed of one class or nationality, and that in compliance with present regulations the enlistment of men as suggested by you <span class="page-break">6</span>is not permitted. You will comprehend that it is not expedient for the War Department to disclose what military measures, appropriate for its purposes in accordance with the compulsory service law, will be taken, before the law is passed.</p>
   <p>"The services of every Czech man will be gladly accepted and appreciated under the present regulations, and I hope for large numbers of your men en-listing.</p>
   <p>"Thanking you, and the Press Bureau for the patriotic service by which the action for enlistment has been expedited.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Newton Baker</p>
   <p>Secretary of War."</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>It is obvious from the foregoing exposition that those Czechs who were first to answer the call for service have extended better help to our Czech cause than if they had waited; they need feel no pangs of conscience, for they have kept the promise given to their people.</p>
