   <p>Whereas, our unit, the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs (Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs Unit), ranked foremost among those who participated in the struggle for the independence of our nation, or the so-called liberation action; whereas, we participated not only by direct action in the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe (Czechoslovak National Alliance of America), where members of our unit occupied important offices, but also because sixty members of our unit voluntarily joined the ranks of the Allied Armies, therefore, today, when the Americka Obec Sokolska (American Sokol Union), with which our unit is affiliated, and which in the name of Sokols spoke out on such an important occurrence as is the purgation of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, we take the liberty to bring before our public our standpoint discussed and resolved on at a regular meeting of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, held on April 15, 1920. Firstly, we concur with the proclamation of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires and we approve it as justifiable. The reference to young sokols, namely, brother Joseph Paskovsky, who is the Supreme <span class="page-break">2</span>Commander of the Americka Obec Sokolska, brother Joseph Paskovsky; brother Ferdinand L. Musil, and others, who today are at the head of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, that they should have been in the army and not at home is correct, and our unit, in a protest sent to the Executive Committee of the Americka Obec Sokolska two years ago, asked that brother Joseph Paskovsky be removed from his position as the Supreme Commander. Secondly, we protest against the Americka Obec Sokolska speaking in the name of Sokols as a whole, on similar questions such as, the standpoint of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of today, because its and our opinions differ. The Americka Obec Sokolska apparently only speaks for itself, because the great majority of its members are for the purgation of the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe, and agree with the Legionnaires. We will endeavor with all our might to bring about the desired reform. The language of a sokol, who is not influenced is that people who are above suspicion should be at the head of the Ceskoslovenske Sdruzeni v Americe, so that the Ceskoslovenske Narodni Sdruzeni v Americe might <span class="page-break">3</span>accomplish what the Bohemian public expects of it.</p>
