   <p>The members of the Bohemian Arts Club, at their meeting held on February 11, decided to contribute the sum of one thousand Czechoslovak kronen toward the gift which will be presented to Thomas G. Masaryk, president of the Czechoslovak Republic, on his seventieth birthday by Czechoslovak America, and which should amount to at least a million kronen. The amount equivalent to one thousand kronen was collected from the present members and sent to the proper place.</p>
   <p>The singing society Bedrich Smetana, which produced several successful performances of the opera "The Bartered Bride" (Prodana Nevesta), and which contributed a net profit of several hundred dollars to our national and charitable causes, resolved in its meeting, held on February 10, to contribute the sum of two thousand Czechoslovak kronen out of its treasury toward the gift which Czechoslovak America is getting ready to present to President Thomas G. Masaryk on his seventieth birthday. These two deeds should stand out as examples to those organizations which have not contributed toward the gift so far.</p>
