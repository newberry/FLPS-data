   <p>The official celebration of the Twenty-eighth of October to commemorate the second anniversary of the "Declaration of Independence" of the Czechoslovak Republic was given at the Sokol Chicago hall by the district committee of the Czechoslovak National Alliance of America, the Chicago district of the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America, and the first district of the Slovak League of America. A long time before the program started, all the main floor seats were occupied and the entrances to the galleries had to be opened in order to accommodate the throngs of people who were coming in.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Julie Hrych, vice-chairman of the district committee of the Czechoslovak National Alliance and also chairman of the arrangements committee of this official celebration, opened the program. In the name of the above-mentioned district committee, she greeted the audience, whereupon the band played the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>American anthem, the "Star-Spangled Banner," while the audience stood at attention. Mr. Konrad Ricker, chairman of the Chicago district of the National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics, also greeted the audience and in a brief speech expressed a hope that in the course of three years, conditions in our old homeland would improve greatly. Following his speech, Mrs. Otilie Splavec recited a beautiful poem, "The Twenty-eighth of October," by Ferdinand L. Musil, and she reaped a storm of applause for her really exquisite presentation of this poem.</p>
   <p>Then, after the playing of the Bohemian anthem, "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home), Mr. Andrej Schustek, chairman of the first district of the Slovak League of America, spoke a few words of great significance. He assured us, the Bohemians, that every Slovak is a sincere brother of ours, a son of one mother--Slovakia. He referred to the frequently overlooked fact that until recently, the Slovaks did not have their own Slovak schools, that ever since childhood they were brought up to hate Bohemians and everything Slavic. Therefore, it is not surprising that many of them are still against us today, especially when they are continually instigated by hired or voluntary agents.</p>

   <p>However, let every Bohemian embrace a Slovaak, and in every one he will find a brother. Our independence can never be taken away from us. Following his encouraging speech, the band played the anthem of our brother Slovaks, "Nad Tatrou Sa Blyska" (There is Lightning over the Tatra Mountains).</p>
   <p>The floor was then taken by the legation secretary, Dr. Krizek, who came from Washington, D. C., representing the present charge d'affaires of the Czechoslovak embassy in Washington, D. C., Mr. Halla, who could not attend this celebration because of important duties and family reasons. We recognized in Dr. Krizek a very fine speaker who delivers his speech in plain words, without inflated phrases, and without barren patriotism, but what he says not only goes deep into the minds of his listeners, but also reaches into their hearts and stays there, because his profound and real love for our old homeland is apparent at once, in spite of his plain and simple language. It is easy to see how sorrowful his heart is because of the prevailing conditions. We regret the impossibility of printing his speech in its entirety, but at present we are able to give only its high lights.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>First of all he transmitted greetings to us all from our countrymen beyond the ocean, and then he explained the absence of Dr. Halla. After these preliminary words, he said that we, the Czechoslovak-Americans, are more entitled to celebrate the Twenty-eighth of October than our countrymen beyond the ocean. For us this day is a holiday; for our countrymen beyond the ocean it is only a day of rest, a day of mutual reckoning and admonition.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovak-America may be proud of its accomplishments that have been crowned with such success, because they laid the foundation for a revolution and carried it on to a happy end. If President Thomas G. Masaryk is called the "Father of Our Country," then we could justly call Czechoslovak-America the "Mother of Our Country." And as every mother excuses her child and looks indulgently upon her baby, so, too, according to the speaker, we here look indulgently upon the mistakes of our countrymen beyond the ocean. We excuse their mistakes, and we try to help them.</p>
   <p>As far as our [Czechoslovak] Republic is concerned, the speaker mentioned four <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>tasks which confront us: First, to insure her external security; second, to adjust her internal conditions; third, to amend the losses she suffered because of the war; and fourth, to secure her existence in the future.....Ending his speech, Dr. Krizek expressed a firm hope that the Czechoslovak people of America will continue to support their brothers beyond the ocean. The audience listened to his speech with rapt attention and rewarded him with prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal, cultural attache of the Czechoslovak Republic in the United States, was the next speaker, and in a very interesting manner he described conditions as he found them in our old homeland.....</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mrs. Julie Hrych thanked the audience for their attendance and proclaimed the festival concluded. On the whole, the mood of the audience had not been festive at all, and when the band, not exactly of the highest standard, played our national anthems, "Kde Domov Muj" and the "Nad Tatrou Sa Blyska," whose melodies are not representative of real national anthems, the result was that it sounded like a funeral ceremony. But it was really <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>incomprehensible why none of our national anthems were sung at the conclusion of the celebration.</p>
   <p>The Festival in Pilsen Park Pavilion</p>
   <p>A double jubilee of significance was celebrated yesterday at the mass meeting held in the Pilsen Park pavilion and arranged under the auspices and cooperation of the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago, the central district of the American Sokol Union, the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers, the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society Lyra. A great multitude of people met there to celebrate the second anniversary of the Twenty-eighth of October, when the Bohemian nation, weary but still defending her rights, proclaimed, to all the world, her determination to reject the rule of the Hapsburgs forever. The meeting was also held to pay homage to the Brixen martyr, Karel Havlicek-Borovsky, whose ninety-ninth birthday anniversary would have been held on October 31. Both of these celebrations were combined into one, and it is necessary to say that this national demonstration was crowned with moral success. A parade starting from the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall preceded the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>celebration. Although extremely unpleasant weather prevailed, many people participated in this parade. The main section of the parade was composed of Sokols, members of various organizations, and legionnaires.....</p>
   <p>The first number on the program should have been a tableau, but for various reasons this was omitted, and Brother Brichta introduced Dr. Antonin Mueller as the first speaker of the evening. The subject of his speech was the significance of Karel Havlicek-Borovsky, and we must admit that his address was brilliant...</p>
   <p>Dr. Jaroslav E. Salaba Vojan, a member of the executive committee of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers, was the last speaker of the evening. In his lengthy and logically arranged speech, he talked on the invigoration of the Free Thought movement. The speaker was master of his subject, and he was loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>The celebration ended with community singing. An admission fee of ten cents <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>was charged for this mass meeting. The total proceeds of this celebration will be donated to humanitarian causes which the Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago have in their program.</p>
