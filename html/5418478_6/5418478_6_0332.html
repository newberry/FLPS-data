   <p>The tag day of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) will be held on Decoration Day. The income from this day is the source of one of the two most substantial items of the Spolecnost's yearly income. This year was one of the most critical that the Spolecnost has had in its five years of activity. It donated $8,000 to the Bohemian poor, and its resources are almost exhausted. The Spolecnost, therefore, asks our Bohemian women and girls to help tag, and those who are willing to co-operate are asked to give their names to the chairman of the tag day committee, Mr. F. J. Petru, at 1443 West 18th Street, or to the secretary of the Spolecnost, Reverend Vaclav Vanek, at 2324 Central Park Avenue, or to the office of the Spolecnost at 2603 South Kedzie Avenue.</p>
   <p>The members of various patriotic and other ladies' organizations are especially requested to give a helping hand in this philanthropic enterprise. The collections and solicitations for various purposes here and in the old country must not let us forget that we have very definite duties to our own Bohemian-American <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>poor families, of which there are hundreds in this city, who are taken care of by the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The Spolecnost may be justly proud of its record. It has paid out over $20,000 to poor Bohemian families during its five years of existence.</p>
