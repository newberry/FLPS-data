   <p>The committee of five elected at the special meeting of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) and the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) for the purpose of agreeing upon steps which Bohemian America should take in our nation's present crisis, makes the following proposals:</p>
   <p>1. The Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee), formerly known as the Cesko-Slovansky Cerveny Kriz (Bohemian-Slavonic Red Cross), a body organized for the purpose of conducting collections among Bohemian-Americans for the benefit of mitigating the intense suffering of our countrymen, should be recognized as the central collecting committee to unify our whole nation for powerful support of our country.</p>
   <p>2. The unification of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada, the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) and the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor into one single organization, the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance).</p>
   <p>3. The work of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni will be to keep the American and European public informed about the just requirements and legitimate demands of the Bohemian nation, aiming at its independence, and thus to prepare the ground for achieving this independence when the reorganization of Europe is discussed during the peace negotiations.</p>
   <p>In order to make this work possible, the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni is entrusted with the duty of starting the solicitation of funds among our people and American friends.</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni is charged with the duty of working out a detailed program of future activities.</p>
