   <p>The Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) held its annual meeting in the Pilsen Brewery hall last Friday evening. Due to the severe cold weather, the meeting was not well attended.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors' meeting, presided over by Vice-President Anton J. Cermak, was disposed of first, and in this meeting several reports were received from the financial secretary. Then the regular annual meeting proceeded under the chairmanship of Judge Joseph Uhlir. The minutes of the annual meeting for the year 1911 were read by the secretary, the Reverend Vaclav Vanek, and were approved as read. Mr. John Cervenka announces that he received an offer from Doctor Bernauer in which the latter expressed his willingness to give a lecture on phrenology for the benefit of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The Association, however, must reject the offer, because it is neither the purpose nor the program of the organization to sponsor any such enterprise. However, no restrictions are placed upon individuals who wish to make arrangements for the benefit of the Association. The secretary was instructed to reply in this manner to Doctor Bernauer. The secretary presented the financial report for the period from April 14, 1911, to January 26, 1912, which reads as follows: Cash disbursement to 101 families, $465.35; Christmas distribution cost, $627.13; rent paid for 51 families, $316.30; loans to 9 families, $243.16; groceries provided for 114 families, $404.07; coal provided for 35 families, $174.70; clothing and shoes provided for 27 families, $123.66; medicines for 11 families, $3.55; medical care $3; graves and funeral expenses for 7 families, $55; office expenses, $514.17.</p>
   <p>There were 77 requests for work, and of these, 41 were satisfied. Christmas basket distribution was extended to 400 families. There were 410 applications for aid, and of these, 62 were rejected. Cash on hand March 15, 1911, was $2,165.74; receipts from March 15, 1911, to January 26, 1912, were $2,876.21. Balance in treasury, $3,733.78.</p>
   <p>A motion was made to amend the bylaws to the effect that the present executive committee be abolished and all matters be handled by the Board of Directors. This amendment was passed.</p>
   
   <p>The manager of the Utulna A Sirotcinnec (Old People's Home and Orphanage) calls our attention to the condition of that institution. Our wealthier population acts in the same stepmother fashion toward the Utulna A Sirotcinnec as it does toward the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, so that the institution must continuously struggle with great burdens. The institution houses over fifty inmates; that is, old people and orphans. The children are growing and developing to the honor of our people, for all of them have distinguished themselves as the best pupils in the public school.... Figuring only twenty-five cents per day for each inmate together with other expenses such as fuel, light, etc., this amounts to over six thousand dollars per year. Where is this money to come from if our Czech "nobility" pays no attention to the institution and never even thinks of it? When an attempt is made to establish some source of income, there are always opponents to the suggestion. Mr. John Cervenka and Judge Joseph Uhlir then took up the problem. Mr. Cervenka said in his speech that the time had arrived when it was imperative to stir the public conscience and draw from the pockets of our "nobility" who bask here in splendor and opulence and forget everything, even their humanitarian duties toward their Czech fellowmen from whom they obtained all of their wealth.</p>
   
   <p>How painful, how sad it is that the third largest and wealthiest Czech city in America cannot find among the wealthy Czech element (whose property reaches into the millions) more than $1,300 in a year's time for poor, suffering families, forsaken orphans, and old folks. It is a pity that such a large Czech community as Chicago cannot afford more than $1,300 a year for its poor, and that out of this amount a whole twenty-six per cent comes from foreign benefactors. This sum has to be earned through receipts from dances and a Tag Day.</p>
   <p>Judge Uhlir spoke in a similar manner, adding that such "nobility", in order that it will not have to contribute, goes so far as to denounce the institution on the grounds that certain people are profiting therefrom. We boast verbally about all that we can do, all that we will accomplish. When the moment arrives to reach in our pockets and contribute something--in order that our boasts may be supported with actions--we are so small that it is laughable. Judge Uhlir called attention to the Poles who began working in this direction long after we did, and who have accomplished great things. In their institutions there are hundreds of inmates who suffer no hardships. They do not have a "patch-on-patch" existence but are supported through the effective generosity and humanitarianism of those whom fate blessed with more than they actually need, and who did not forget those who were condemned to suffering as in our case. Something should be done to remedy this condition, for it is noted that our most prominent wealthy people who prospered and made their money from our Czech people have thus far contributed not a single penny toward any of our institutions.</p>
   <p>However, the gathering manifests its recognition and gratitude toward our local newspapers. They have done so much meritorious and worthy work for this cause and they deserve the credit and recognition for everything thus far accomplished. Thanks to the present directors, first to Judge Uhlir, Mr. Cervenka, the Pilsen Brewing Company, to all lawyers who did meritorious work for the poor, and to all doctors for their services, and to Doctor Rezanko who permitted the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost to use his office free of charge. The ladies, also, deserve an expression of gratitude and recognition for all their efforts at the time of the Tag Day, and for other work in the humanitarian field.</p>
   <p>Because we continue to receive complaints that aid is being refused families who need it most, and that such cases are the subject of severe criticism by the public, and indeed, that some people have refused on that account to make contributions, as announced by Mr. Loula and others, the representative of Denni Hlasatel, Mr. J. A. Hospodsky, expressed the opinion that a complaint and investigation committee be established. This committee would investigate such cases and make decisions about them. Mr. Loula ardently supported such a motion, and it was passed. Mr. Cervenka then moved that this committee be made up of representatives of the press. The motion passed. Mr. J. A. Hospodsky was selected for the Denni Hlasatel; Mr. J. Krasny for Svornost; Mr. Joseph Dusek for Spravedlnost. These men were elected at the same time to the Board of Directors. Hereafter, anyone who has any complaint should get in touch with one of these newspapermen, and the matter will be property investigated and corrected.</p>
   <p>Then an election to fill vacancies and to make replacements for the Board of Directors was held..... Receipts of the evening were $153.20. Disbursements during the month were $99.68. Balance in the treasury is $3,732.78.</p>
   <p>The next meeting which will be held for the purpose of electing officers for the coming year is scheduled for February 16, 1912.</p>
