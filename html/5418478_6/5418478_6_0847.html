   <p>The Grand Lodge of C.S.P.S. [Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slav Aid Society)] sent a telegram to the governor of the State of Iowa, last Sunday, in which a most vigorous protest is raised against an official order, issued by him, which, if followed by the other states, would be a severe blow to the Czech language in the entire United States. The decree forbids the use of any language but English, in public as well as private schools, in churches, at public meetings on the streets, railways, etc. It is directed mainly against the German language, but will necessarily be also applied to the Czechs, and other nationalities which form a strong percentage of the population of Iowa.</p>
   <p>The governor's order caused feeling to run high, especially among those nationalities which have never passed up an opportunity to demonstrate their loyalty, and who make every effort to support the Government in these critical times. It is needless to mention that the impression made by the order upon the Czechs was especially grievous.</p>

   <p>The telegram reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"William L. Harding, governor, Des Moines, Iowa: Representing twenty-five thousand Czech citizens, about whose loyalty there can be no question, we voice our regret over your proclamation, and protest against its wording as far as the Czechs are concerned. Our patriotic record does not warrant our being classified within the sense of this proclamation. Discrimination should be made between enemy and friend.</p>
   <p>"The National Grand Lodge, C.S.P.S.</p>
   <p>"Jan Tlusty, president</p>
   <p>"J. V. Lunak, secretary".</p>
