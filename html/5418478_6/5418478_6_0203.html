   <p>Just an example of the patriotic spirit which fills the Klub Rieger: At the regular meeting on Thursday, it was decided to spontaneously demonstrate the love which the members hold for the old homeland. One hundred dollars was collected for the cause of the liberation of the Czech people, two hundred dollars was subscribed for Liberty Bonds, and forty-two dollars was donated to the American Red Cross. As the club has no treasury, all the contributions were donated by the individual members.</p>
