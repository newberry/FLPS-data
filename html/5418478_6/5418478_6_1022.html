   <p>A committee was recently appointed under the sponsorship of the Narodni Socialni Beseda Fresl (Fresl National Socialist Clubs). This committee has for its purpose the arranging of an expedition to Czechoslovakia in 1924, on the occasion of the quincentennial of the death of Jan Zizka [the great Hussite warrior and general]. Whoever desires to join this expedition is hereby given an opportunity to become a member of the Club. The Club will facilitate the project by having its members make regular deposits of $2 which sums will ultimately accumulate and thus provide for the payment of traveling expenses. The initiation fee is $1. In case any member should later decide not to take part in the expedition for any reason, the accumulated savings shall be returned to him. Meetings are held every Friday at 8 P.M. in Mr. V. Svoboda's restaurant, 1870 Blue Island Avenue. One may also make application for membership by letter. The secretary of the committee is Mr. V. Havelka 1512 West 18th Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
