   <p>p.1---representatives of the Ceska Straz are going to call on Mayor Dunne to submit to him a request, signed by severed hundred of our fellow-countrymen, to appoint on the Library Board one member of Bohemian extraction. They have nominated the well-known physician, Dr. E. E. Kolar. We assume that the Mayor will agree with our choice. The Bohemians by proportion of population are entitled to at least one member on the Board; that we have had none is our own fault, since we have made no effort to have one appointed.</p>
