   <p>Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni (The Bohemian National Alliance), which, in the last three months, has grown in membership to be counted among the greatest of Bohemian-American organizations, also is growing in the number of its local affiliates.</p>
   <p>Two weeks ago, an affiliate was started in our Czech Pilsen in Pilsen Sokol Hall, and immediately promotional work was begun, which is progressing nicely.</p>
   <p>This new Pilsen affiliate has, through its representative, just turned over to the district office the sum of $210.50. In this sum is included $122.50, which was collected at the Benes lecture held under the auspices of the circuit of Sokol Figner-Tyrs, whose chairman, Bonus Hak, added $27.70 to the $122.50, which now totals $150. Mr. Vokral, a member of Plzensky Sokol and an accountant of the Pilsen affiliate the Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni, <span class="page-break">2</span>and a great friend of the cause and a liberal contributor, collected $50, to which he added $20.</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni in Chicago announce these new affiliates: Ladies' auxiliary of the society Ceska Kalifornie, Novy Tabor, and Cicero.</p>
   <p>New affiliates are now being formed in Irving Park and Berwyn.</p>
   <p>With all these new affiliates, the Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni situated in the third largest Czech city in the world will be strengthened into an inseparable whole, which we hope will well represent our 150,000 Czechs for a better future of our Czech nation across the waters, and for the solidarity of all sincere Czech peoples under the motto, "Svoboda Ceskemu Narodu" (Freedom for the Czech Nation.)</p>
