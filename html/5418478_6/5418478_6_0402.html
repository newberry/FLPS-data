   <p>At the end of the fourth month of collections, the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) reports that it has received $6,244.99 so far, including $229.20 that came in last week. In addition to this, the Denni Hlasatel has $1,281.05 and the Svornost, which already has delivered $600 to us, has $200. Hence, all in all, the income totals $7,726.04.</p>
   <p>Now we are starting collection activities within our national societies and other bodies. Although the times are not particularly propitious, we trust that every one of our societies, clubs, lodges, etc., will contribute at least a small amount to our fund. Some of our societies feel that they have done their duty by sending us the money they have collected for us. But that is not quite enough. They should also appoint a delegate who will represent them in the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor and take an active part in our work.</p>

   <p>As an example for those of our societies which may be reluctant in their co-operation with our Vybor, we want to mention the Vzdelavaci A Zabavni Beseda Svatopluk Cech (Educational and Recreational Club Svatopluk Cech) which, upon its own initiative, has sent us a delegate and the sum of fifty dollars.....</p>
