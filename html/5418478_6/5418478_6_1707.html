   <p>The exhibition of documents pertaining to the revolutionary activities of our Legion and to our own efforts leading to the liberty and independence of our nation, came to its festive conclusion last night. It was a most beautiful and significant occasion because the conclusion of the exhibition was connected with the celebration of the third anniversary of the foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic--a holiday of all Czechoslovak people. The celebration was arranged under the auspices of the Sokolska Zupa Stredni (Central States Sokol Union) and the Druzina Legionaru Ceskoslovenskych (Fellowship of Czechoslovak Legionnaires) and attended by a multitude of our people who followed with intense attention the program of the celebration, a program truly worthy of the importance of the day. The first and <span class="page-break">\2</span>principal speaker was one of the organizers of the exhibition, Brother Ruml, lieutenant of the Russian Legion, who opened the festivities of the evening with a beautiful address about the significance of the day Twenty-eighth of October as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear countrymen, Sisters and Brothers! It was seven years and one month ago that the first groups of our soldiers assembled in the Sophia Square in Kiev in order to take a solemn oath to their first flag, the first flag of our independent army, pledging mutual love, equality, and brotherhood in arms, in battle and in death, and demonstrating to the whole world their unshakeable determination to make war against the German and Magyar gendarmes and jailers, a war of life and death.</p>
   <p>"It was the Twenty-eighth of October, 1914, when our Sokols stood in the Sophia Square. There were not many of them, some eight hundred volunteers, but their staunch hearts were not afraid of a fight against the Germanic armies, were not afraid of the privations of war. These boys did not haggle, <span class="page-break">\3</span>did not compromise with personal advantages or consider them.</p>
   <p>"They knew that the old prophecy about Czechoslovak armed men must come to fulfillment and for that reason they lifted their flag of insurrection against Austria-Hungary as a symbol of their fight for justice and truth, which at the end must prevail.</p>
   <p>"If nobody in the whole world had remembered at that time that there existed such a thing as the Czechoslovak nation, our boys would have been standing there just the same; they would have been standing in the Sophia Square as well as in the Foreign Legion of France.</p>
   <p>"And in the year 1917 there were already whole Czechoslovak regiments ready for the war, tens of thousands of Czechoslovak boys, gunners, cavalrymen, artillerymen--a complete army composed of all the necessary parts. Their numbers grew further in France and Italy until they were a brotherhood of more than a hundred thousand, conscious of its immense strength, rooted in <span class="page-break">\4</span>an awareness that this was a just fight, firm as a pillar against which their leader, old and trusted, real father of his boys, now the little father of the whole Czechoslovak nation, President Masaryk, could lean in full security.</p>
   <p>"These were the years of suffering and privation, years when good Czechoslovak blood flowed for a better future of the Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>"The deeds and exploits of our boys proclaimed to the whole world that our race is strong, full of self-confidence, trusting in the final victory of right and justice.</p>
   <p>"Why, it was justice herself who created the Czechoslovak legions. It was in justice that our nation began to believe, our nation which so many times had been deceived, cheated, beaten, disappointed--a suspicious nation, a nation without a god. And the Czechoslovak boys went into the battle with a smile on their lips, with a song in their hearts, just as they should be going <span class="page-break">\5</span>every time in the future. Yes, they were the same boys, whether in France, in Serbia, in England, in Canada, in Australia, or in America and Italy. All good sons of the nation heard the call to arms, no matter where they were, perhaps at the end of the world. And they answered that call, and that was the nucleus of our armies marching against Austria-Hungary from the East, South, and West. That was the nucleus of the armies that spoke significantly of the necessity that the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the realm of the Hapsburgs, this sin against nature, must be destroyed. That was the nucleus of the armies that made the world sit up and take notice of the small, but by no means weak, Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>"Thus the day of the Twenty-eighth of October, the day of the liberation of the Czechoslovak nation, the day whose third anniversary we are celebrating today, means a great deal for the Czechoslovaks. Let us first remember again and again the oppressed state in which our nation lived, the suffering of our people, remember with reverence all the sacred sacrifices our fallen brothers have made for liberty, remember all that has been suffocating and stifling our <span class="page-break">\6</span>nation for three hundred years, remember the great historical struggle, and realize all the new and important duties it imposes upon all of us.</p>
   <p>"Those who have fought for the independence of our nation will keep on fighting for its happy future, but of course their weapon will be different. They will fight by staging an economic revolution which is not a less difficult undertaking than a political revolution. But in that, also, our nation will be victorious, simply because it must be victorious. They will go into that fight again with a smile on their lips and a song in their hearts; they will go not on behalf of just a part of the nation, they will go for the whole of it; that applies also to you who are one of its strong and important branches, a branch which must not die but must remain hale, fresh and green, and bring an ever new crop of the most delightful fruit for the country which you have left and from which you have gone far away overseas because it did not give you the kind of happiness you had been longing for.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>"The thousands of dead and tortured must never be forgotten, and every thought of them must strengthen in us the determination to lead the nation to new successes, to new heights. All of us shall do our best; all of us are entering the fourth year of our Czechoslovak Republic with the firm determination never to weaken in our efforts. Fate has given our nation an excellent leader who brought us through the darkest period of our modern history, and we call: May thou live and stay in good health with us, our little father, Masaryk! Thy word is our law!"</p>
   <p>A stormy applause was the speaker's reward. He was followed by the delegate of the Ceskoslovenska Obec Sokolska (Czechoslovak Sokol Community) of Prague, Brother Havranek. He began his talk by pointing out the close relations between the Sokol community and the Legion and showed the differences in ideas of the soldiers of the various nations engaged in the World War. The soldiers in our Legion have fought for purely national motives, for ideas inculcated into the nation by Sokol education, and these ideas fused our armies into one single strong body. In our Legion, parts of which were scattered over all the <span class="page-break">\8</span>fronts of the war and all sections of which were winning their victories in the spirit of insurrection, there was one peculiar and unique characteristic quality. In spite of the fact that its parts did not fight next to one another--in fact, they fought far from one another--their action on all battlefields was unified because their thoughts had one common origin, their action one common aim, because they were educated according to one set of principles, the Sokol principles.</p>
   <p>The speaker concluded his splendid address by the significant declaration that a Sokol will never be white, and never red, but always white and red [Czech national colors].</p>
   <p>The enthusiastic applause reverberating through the hall gave the speaker the assurance that he had been understood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sustek, the quiet and efficient worker, addressed the audience on behalf of the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League), and after his speech the artistic part <span class="page-break">\9</span>of the program started. The first number consisted of three tableaux, "Joy," "Sorrow," and "Victory". These beautiful tableaux were presented by the ladies of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs.....Miss Jennie Cervenka, accompanied by Miss Berenice Jelinek, enriched the program of the evening by a number of songs, the second of which, our beautiful national anthem, was most loudly applauded.....</p>
   <p>The Sokols merited their applause by the presentation of a new and complicated drill by a group of nine. Miss Krametsbauer then introduced her pupils in a number of dance routines.....</p>
   <p>The Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Czech Workingmen's Singing Society) obliged by presenting the gorgeous chorus "Battle in a Forest," and was prevailed upon to give an encore, the pleasant "Slovacka" (Slovak one). Then the stage was filled by the youth of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs who, under the leadership of their instructor, showed a number of athletic games.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>The evening was concluded by Mr. V. Niedrle's recitation of Machar's fitting poem "Vecer Jana Mydlare 21. Cervna" (Jan Mydlar's Night, the Twenty-first of July).....</p>
