   <p>p. 1.. The Czech and Slovak committee, led by officials of the Czecho-Slovak Evangelic Union, will leave for the unfortunate town of Cherry, Ill., to deliver to the widows and orphans the gift from their Czech and Slovak brethren. The donation is expected to be considerable enough to provide for the unfortunate during the first days of their plight.</p>
   <p>This action should not, however, be the end of charitable endeavor. Winter is before the door, and once its reign is established, it is bound to work much hardship upon the population of the smitten town. And to alleviate their sufferings and to enable them to face the onslaught of inclement weather, combined with starvation - this should be our care, who find ourselves in more bearable circumstances.</p>
   <p>Individual contributions ranging from $5 down are listed below; the total has, up to date, reached the sum of $303.51.</p>
