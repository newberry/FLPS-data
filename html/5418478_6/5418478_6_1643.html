   <p>Damsky S'Bor Vlasta Cislo I (Vlasta Woman's Club No. 1) held a celebration yesterday in Telocyicne Jednota Sokol (Sokol Gymnastic Union) Hall in commemoration of the birth of the great Bohemian teacher and nationalist, Josef Jakob Jungmann.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Kl. Novak opened the session with an appropriate address referring to the deathless memory of Josef Jungmann, after which Miss Alb. Fligl gave a biographical lecture on this celebrated genius of ours, calling especial attention to all that Josef Jungmann did for Bohemian nationality. Several more short talks followed. Every speaker was applauded.</p>
   <p>It is to the honor of the Woman's club that it never forgets to honor the memory of those who merit remembrance. Toward midnight the ladies served a delightful supper. The entertainment was informal, and there were dancing and singing. It is to be regretted that so few young men attended.</p>
