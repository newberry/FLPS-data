   <p>Reports of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) show that last month the United States consul in Prague, Frank Deedmeyer, received an official communication addressed to "Prague, Austria" instead of "Prague, Bohemia", as had been the custom, and as the mail of the former consul, Mr. Brittain, used to be addressed.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, sent a request to Consul Deedmeyer asking that the only correct appellation, "Prague, Bohemia," be resumed. To this the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar received the following reply:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen: I hereby acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the seventeenth of last month wherein you state that a good deal of interest is being manifested by Bohemian newspapers published in the United States in the fact <span class="page-break">\2</span>that the City of Prague is designated in the latest consular reports as 'Prague, Austria,' and that a similar designation is being used in connection with other cities in Bohemia, whereas previously the designation 'Prague, Bohemia,' etc., was being used.</p>
   <p>"You are asking me in the name of eight hundred thousand Bohemian-Americans to have this marking changed to the older appellation, and to see to it that future consular reports be addressed to 'Prague, Bohemia' as they were prior to this.</p>
   <p>"The consular business reports, which I presume you have in mind, are published by the Department of Labor.</p>
   <p>"Our Congress has designated this place as 'Prague, Austria,' and that is the name to which the Department of Labor adheres.</p>
   <p>"Let me add that, according to the credentials tendered me by the President <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the United States, I have been appointed consul at 'Prague, Austria,' and that all communications addressed to me by the Foreign Department and by its Secretary designate this place as 'Prague, Austria'. Also, the official publications, Register of the Department of State, and Diplomatic and Consular Service of the United States show that 'Prague, Austria' is an American consular station.</p>
   <p>"I do not believe that any consular official has the right to make a change in a name as set by the Congress.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully, Frank Deedmeyer, American-Consul."</p>
   <p>In other words, Mr. Deedmeyer tells us that if his predecessor, Mr. Brittain, used "Prague, Bohemia," in his communications, he did that on his own responsibility, knowing that this form would be accepted by the Bohemians with gratitude; and would not be considered a violation of regulations; also, that he, Mr. Deedmeyer, intends to go by the letter of the law without regard to <span class="page-break">\4</span>the feelings and wishes of the Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar sent Mr. Deedmeyer's reply to Congressman A. Sabath at Washington and requested him to investigate what can be done in this matter. Mr. Sabath always willingly undertakes to do all that is possible in requests of this kind.</p>
