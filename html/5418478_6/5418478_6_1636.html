   <p>The Reverend Vaclav Vanek appeared at the meeting of the Grand Lodge of the C.S.P.S. (Czechoslovak Benevolent Society) and with words of great enthusiasm explained the purpose of the Immigrant Home founded by him in Baltimore. He asked the Grand Lodge for contributions for the upkeep of the institution. The Reverend Mr. Vanek's request was not refused, as of course it would not be by men who are always among the first where purely humanitarian deeds are concerned. Ten dollars was donated for the benefit of the Immigrant Home, and in addition all subordinate lodges will be reminded to contribute as generously as possible for the upkeep of the institution. That the lodges will not have to be urged to contribute to this beneficent purpose we know from past experience. The C.S.P.S. lodges already have done much good and never have allowed themselves to waver in giving aid, both moral and financial, where necessity has been indicated.</p>
