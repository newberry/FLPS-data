   <p>Many a manifestation under the auspices of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Czech National Association) have been reported by us; all of them have had the one great aim of encouraging the people for the task of liberating all of the Slavonic nations from the yoke of their oppressors and, last but not least, the establishment of the Czech nation as an independent state. But none of all the meetings can compare in success and enthusiasm with the great gathering last night in the hall of the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs. Czechs and Slovaks gathered to hear the overwhelmingly joyful tidings that the work done up to date for the liberation of the homeland has not been in vain, that the Allies have made the liberation one of the primary conditions of the conclusion of the war.</p>
   <p>The first speaker introduced was the president of the association, Mr. L. J. Fischer. His address was one glorious homage paid the untiring <span class="page-break">2</span>work of the Grand Old Man, Professor Thomas G. Masaryk. "We must give eminence to his work," he began, "as it was he who had been attacked by many heretics and it was he who, with the purest sentiments for the Czech nation in his heart, was able through relentless persuasion to convince the Allies that it would be to their own best advantage if an independent Czecho-Slovak state were created in the heart of Europe, a guarantee for lasting peace, a stronghold to block Germanic lust for expansion." To this ideal Masaryk sacrificed everything--a quiet family life, a substantial existence, his career; briefly, whatever would have assured a carefree age for him. And when his Spartan self-denials bore fruit, he again forgot to think of himself, and turned his care towards Czech-America. This trait of his character is best illustrated in a cablegram sent to the Czech National Association after the conditions for peace demanded by the Allies became known: "We have had more success than we expected. Greetings to all American Czechs. Your financial aid shall be more than rewarded." This portentous message from the <span class="page-break">3</span>old savant was read by Dr. Fisher and evoked spontaneous applause. Dr. Fisher, at the close of his speech, hit the intrinsic meaning in the cablegram by remarking "that Czech-America would have to eternally feel the pangs of conscience if it could boast of larger deposits in the banks while in the Allies' peace terms the clause about the liberation of the Czechs was missing."</p>
   <p>In easy conversational tone, but with no lesser enthusiasm, Mr. Ondrej Sustek, of Slovak nationality, the well-known president of the Slovenska Liga, spoke of the work done by all the apostles of freedom beyond the borders of the homeland. He declared that in this action of liberation the Slavonic peoples in America have a lion's share. "Who knew us before the war?" he asked, and continued: "The whole world knew that we were being oppressed, but nobody had any clear conception of our longing for becoming separated from Austria toward which we harbor feelings of antagonism. It was left to Masaryk and his co-workers to elucidate to the world our relations with the rotten Austro-Hungarian monarchy, with <span class="page-break">4</span>the Germans, with the Magyars. We do not crave for the blood of our enemies; we want only what we rightfully possessed and what has for centuries been denied to us: we want liberty, the right of self-determination and independent development. Under the Austrian rule we were bound to perish, slowly but surely, and to-day we caught the first glimmer of hope. Much work is still left to do before we reach our goal which, however, will be possible only by a victory of the Allies. And therein lies the center of gravity of our efforts. We have to undertake everything possible to give them financial and moral support, and when, finally, the Czecho-Slovak state is established, we will be able to rejoice over our success with a clean conscience and the pride that is derived from duty fulfilled.</p>
   <p>The climax in that memorable afternoon was the address delivered by the teacher Vojta Benes. "What we have gone through during the last few days, was a time full of feverish suspense, when the nerves begin to lag in service. We knew that the note from the Allies was due, but we <span class="page-break">5</span>were tossed by anxiety to learn whether it would bring yon ray of light into our souls. And it did. This light will also flash through all of Germany," the speaker continued, "and it will shine brightly into Bohemia, where people are meeting today with a hearty handshake in anticipation of their liberation.</p>
   <p>Those are moments filled with joy in which we know that one half the civilized world is giving us to-day what has been denied to us for fully three hundred years. In gazing upon times long gone by, we see the great teacher of the nations, Jan Amos Komensky, parting with his native land, and it seems that his words are to come true. In the year of 1628 the curtain fell upon our nation, torturers took the soul from it; they closed its book of life; they chained its body to feast on it.</p>
   <p>"To-day, we have substantial hope that our demand shall be satisfied. France, still strong and victorious, is giving us guarantees; England vouches for <span class="page-break">6</span>our rights, and so does Russia."--The speaker also mentioned the efforts made by President Wilson to bring about peace, suggesting that just as Abraham Lincoln liberated the slaves, Wilson might liberate millions of other slaves in the heart of Europe.</p>
   <p>Following this hint, a resolution was passed which will be sent to President Wilson and runs as follows: "The Czech-speaking citizens of Chicago, gathered in a meeting, are requesting you to support the plan of the Allies to change Europe on the basis of justice for all the nations, small or big. We are certain that you, as representative of free America, are in sympathy with their intention to deliver the Czecho-Slovaks from the foreign rule."</p>
   <p>The gratitude to Professor Masaryk of those gathered was voiced in a cablegram: "Czech-America is sending the most heartfelt thanks to you and the fellow-patriots." A telegram from the Czech-American Union, which is <span class="page-break">7</span>holding its general meeting here now, was accepted with peals of applause.</p>
   <p>A collection for the pursuit of the aims of the patriotic Czechs and Slovaks yielded about $250 in checks and subscriptions.</p>
