   <p>There seems to be no doubt that right after the war immigration will be stopped for a long period of years. Have we given thought to this matter? Where and how shall we keep on strengthening our national consciousness, which under present conditions dies a natural death in the second generation? Or are we still foolish enough to believe that the Bohemian branch in America is hardy enough to remain fresh and strong in the future without any help from the outside? Let us not make a mistake! It is up to us to be looking for some means of preventing an early decay and death of this branch of ours, while it is still fully alive and in its prime.</p>
