   <p>The women members of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs have been busy with preparations for a "hard times" party which, though stressing poverty, will insist on having good fun. That there will be no poverty of entertainment is guaranteed by the "hard times" committee which did all in its power to make the party a success. Mr. Plocar's orchestra will furnish the music. All the features of this party will be first-class, and there will be no poverty of good humor.</p>
   <p>The party begins at 8 P. M. To make this splendid affair look poverty-stricken, the admission will be only 49 cents.</p>
