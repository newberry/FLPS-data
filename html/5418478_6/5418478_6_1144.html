   <p>Brother Legionnaires! The majority of us are back again in the United States. Those brothers who fell on the battlefields fulfilled their duty by sacrificing their lives upon the altar of national liberty. Our problem, which is the problem of all those who were fortunate enough to return, is not yet solved, but the spirit that led us across the ocean to the blood-soaked battlefields of France is still alive in the mind of every legionnaire, urging him toward further efforts.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to unite and to work together toward our national cause. The desire for unity is inborn in every one of us, and it is evident in most of the societies and circles of the Legion. We desire unity for the purpose of preserving the Legion spirit, securing greater recognition, and keeping alive old memories, as well as insuring the more effective continuation of work started in our national and humanitarian fields. There are <span class="page-break">2</span>already local circles and societies scattered all over the United States which are making efforts to unite themselves into an alliance which would represent the Czechoslovakian-American legionnaires--an alliance deeply imbued with the spirit of the Legion.</p>
   <p>One of the most important points about organizing is the necessity of building on a solid foundation, with a common thought, with one goal, with the fraternal spirit of the motto: "Brothers in war, brothers in peace!" At the beginning of each organization an exchange of opinions is necessary. The personal interests of individuals must be put aside--the primary consideration must be for the interests of the whole group.</p>
   <p>It was natural that in many places where our brother legionnaires started organizations, their first thought was to include only the brothers of the Czechoslovak Legion of France. But after careful consideration they came to the conclusion that such an organization would be, for moral, economic, <span class="page-break">3</span>and national reasons, imperfect.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to unite all the brothers who voluntarily joined the Allied armies, and who were motivated by the same feeling of love for our homeland and responsibility in its struggle for freedom. We have in mind, principally, those brothers who entered the American and Canadian armies, because the greatest percentage of them are in the United States.</p>
   <p>There are many reasons why it is necessary to unite with them. First of all, it is our moral duty, and as legionnaires we should not wait to be reminded by others of our obligation. We know it ourselves. Every Czechoslovakian legionnaire, from whatever Allied army he may be, belongs to us. The same thought and desire inspired him, as is evidenced by the fact that there were many Czechoslovaks in the Canadian Army, residents of either Canada or the United States. In a like manner, our brothers in the United States Army are striving to make themselves of good use, and to represent the Czechoslovakian people. In a certain sense, these are the pioneers of our Legion, and had it <span class="page-break">4</span>not been for their zeal and their anxiety to participate in the struggle for liberty, a zeal which drove them into the Allied armies before our legion was created, they surely would be in the ranks of our Legion today. Shall we then, remembering what it was that prevented them from joining our banner, refuse them the rights of membership?</p>
   <p>The longing for unity is mutual. It has been manifested not only by brother legionnaires from France, but also by the Czechoslovakian volunteers with the American and Canadian armies. In existing legion circles and posts, as for instance in Chicago, brother legionnaires from either the Czechoslovak Legion or the United States work in harmony, and they all manifest an equally ardent interest in the progress of our cause.</p>
   <p>For purely economic reasons, the co-operation of the legionnaires as a whole is also an unavoidable necessity, regardless of what banner they fought under, because the membership will be larger and, consequently, the efficiency of the alliance will be greater.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>At public functions of local posts, the co-operation of volunteers from the American and Canadian armies would be a great advantage, and the sympathy of not only the Bohemian but also the American public would be assured. This matter is very important, because we think it is one of our duties to arouse interest in our Czechoslovakian Republic. The presence of brother volunteers from the Allied armies among us cannot be anything but a great benefit to the Czechoslovakian branch in the United States. It is to our interest that we in the United States keep in contact with our homeland beyond the ocean, in order that our national spirit may be intensified; therefore, we should take into our midst these brothers who otherwise, in the course of time, being separated from us, would become strangers to our cause.</p>
   <p>Let us remember that leading propagandists for the freedom of our homeland, with Professor Thomas G. Masaryk at their head, agitated in these words: "Enter the Allied armies as Czechs and Slovaks and be the first volunteers of our prospective Legion. When the Allies see the great number of Czechs and Slovaks who have voluntarily entered the Allied armies, with intentions <span class="page-break">6</span>of freeing dying Bohemia, suffering under the yoke of Austria, then they will permit us to create an independent revolutionary army."</p>
   <p>The longing was fulfilled and the army was created. The desire of many brothers who voluntarily served in the Allied armies was to be transferred to our Legion--but only the brothers in the French Foreign Legion were successful, and that only because our Legion formed a part of the French Army.</p>
   <p>What was not granted to our brothers in the American and Canadian armies during the war should be granted to them in time of peace. Let us show that we appreciate their services to our homeland. What was impossible during the war is now, for moral and practical reasons, a necessity.</p>
   <p>In the Czechoslovakian Republic, the Alliance of Legionnaires is in existence, and all the members, regardless of uniform, be it Russian, Italian or French, <span class="page-break">7</span>work together as brothers. Then shall we in the United States be divided?</p>
   <p>No! In unity there is strength. One thought united us during the war, even if we had to fight for it on various fronts, in various uniforms, and under different banners--it was the determination to effect the liberation of our homeland. Our task is not yet accomplished; it is necessary to guard our newly born liberty, gained after a hard struggle. Let us work together as brothers!</p>
   <p>Na Zdar! (Good Luck!)</p>
