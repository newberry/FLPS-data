   <p>On two occasions during the year, the Spolek Starych Osadniku (Old Settelers' Society) assembles its members and their friends. First, there is the annual festival....and second, the yearly plenary meeting.....This annual meeting, the sixteenth in the organization's history, was held last night in the hospitable, cozy V Libuse Hall on Twelfth Street. It was attended by a large number of members and a generous representation from the public at large.</p>
   <p>The financial report for the past year shows that the Society has generously supported many of our national institutions. Thus, in the course of its existence, it has donated $2,450 to the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old Peoples Home and Orphanage), and $850 to the Bohemian Catholic Orphanage at Lisle.....</p>
