   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) presented reports at the second annual meeting which was held April 16, 1912, in the rooms of Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club) in Libuse Hall. These reports, which were presented by the office manager and the secretary, offer a clear and comprehensive review of the accomplishments of the organization during the past year. The report of the secretary, Mr. R. Jaromir Psenka, follows:</p>
   <p>"Today the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar ends a year during which the organization has proved that the hopes placed in it by its founders were not in vain. Despite its other accomplishments, at no time during the existence of the organization has it gained such full recognition from Bohemian people in America and the homeland as during the past few months. This is best seen in the number of its members. At the time of the last annual meeting there were only thirty-three active members. With pleasure I now announce that during the past fourteen months the numbers of active members has been <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>more than doubled--today the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar has seventy-two active members, five of whom are out-of-town residents. According to the ratio set up in the paragraph on votes adopted last year, these members have one hundred and seventy-two votes.</p>
   <p>"During the past year the executive committee held ten regular meetings, five special meetings, two joint meetings with the reception committee in preparation for the visit of Count Frantisek Luetzow, and seven consultations, a total of twenty-four meetings. The annual meeting was postponed from February until today because of the visit of Count Luetzow."</p>
   <p>The report on the activities of the institution, presented by the office manager, Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, reads as follows:</p>

   <p>"Annual Report of the Second Year's Activities "(from December 1, 1910 to November 30, 1911)"</p>
   <p>"If we compare the activities of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar in the second year with those presented in the first annual report, February 17, 1911, we see that despite the fact that the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar is financially unable to employ more than one person, the scope of its work has greatly increased.</p>
   <p>"1. Information furnished to the Anglo-American Press: Forty-nine articles pertaining to Bohemian matters appeared in the American newspapers during the second year, as compared with twenty-four articles published during the first year. Many of them were detailed articles, as, for example: "Some Comments on Curtis' Letters from Bohemian" (Minneapolis Journal and Chicago Record Herald); "Chicago Bohemians to Honor National Hero and Martyr" (Record-Herald); "Karel Havlicek," "Heroes of Other Lands," "A Bohemian Opera" (Chicago Daily News); "Composers of Genius Whose Words are Neglected in the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>United States" (New York Sun); "Bohemian-Americans" (The St. Louis Republic), etc.</p>
   <p>"2. Information sent to Bohemian newspapers in the homeland: Articles by the Kancelar--a total of twenty-five were sent--appeared regularly in Venkov, Ceske Slovo, Union, and occasionally in Cas, Pravo Lidu, Narodni Politika, Samostatnost, Delnicky Listy, of Vienna, etc.....</p>
   <p>"3. Representation of the Bohemian-American Press: It was emphasized at the time of the first annual report that the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar expresses itself in this connection only when it conforms with the intentions of the Bohemian Press in America. Almost all leading Bohemian-American newspapers are associated with the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar. Six out of eight dailies are associated with the Kancelar (two Chicago, two Cleveland, and two New York), also Osveta Americka of Nebraska, Slavie of Wisconsin, and St. Louiske Listy of Missouri. The cablegram of condolence sent to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>Mr. F. Korbel in Prague, upon the death of his wife, and the cabled greetings to the Bohemian National Council in Prague on October 1, were included in the functions of this institution.</p>
   <p>"4. Reports for the Bohemian-American Press: One hundred and twenty-six reports were distributed to the Bohemian Press of America. There were twelve lengthy articles from Bohemian in addition to some longer articles which required considerable preliminary study, such as the criticism on the new edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and the article concerning Novotny's Ceske Dejiny. Also included in these reports are the contacts of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar with the American Consulate in Prague. The Consulate regularly enlists the aid of the Kancelar when missing persons are sought, and in one case a missing son was actually located through this medium. The reports of the Tiskova Kancelar proved to be practical in another case: the report on the vacancy in the United States National Museum resulted in the placement of a Bohemian in the position.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"5. Co-operation in large Bohemian-American undertakings: Activities in this respect can be listed in chronological order: At the time of the "Safe and Sane Fourth of July Celebration" in Chicago the Tiskova Kancelar wrote a number of articles for the Bohemian and the American Press of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"At the time of the festive unveiling of the Karel Havlicek monument the Kancelar wrote a series of articles for the Bohemian-American newspapers and for the English newspapers of Chicago. A short time before, and immediately after the unveiling, the Kancelar furnished the Chicago newspapers with comprehensive reports. Bohemian-American newspapers were informed by telegraph of the details of the celebration. The Kancelar edited without charge the eighty-page souvenir booklet issued at that time.</p>
   <p>"The Kancelar is continually reporting the progress of the construction of the Karel Jonas monument. The organization will send an officer to the unveiling ceremony in order that the Bohemian-American newspapers may receive <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>detailed reports as soon as possible. The English-American Press will also be furnished reports of the event.</p>
   <p>"In addition to being active in the promotion of a charity concert in Chicago, the Kancelar participated in the convention of singing societies, and brought several preliminary reports on the Sokol mass meeting in Prague.</p>
   <p>"6. Independent activities: It can be said that none of the independent activities of the Kancelar were failures; in some cases their success exceeded all expectations. The action against Count Apponyi was foremost among these activities. The organization succeeded in minimizing the ill effects of the Count's visit to this country.</p>
   <p>"The million-cent collection ended with the sending of 9,700 crowns to Prague by the treasurer, Mr. Skala. This amount was increased to 10,000 crowns by Mr. Korbel.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>"The complaint on the scarcity of Bohemian officials in the Austro-Hungarian Consulates in the United States was turned over by the National Council to the directors of the Bohemian Representatives Club in Vienna. The Council requested reports from the representatives on the steps taken by them to correct the situation.</p>
   <p>"Action against the neglect of Bohemian music in America especially Bohemian opera, was begun with the publishing of several newspaper articles in Chicago (Daily News, Record Herald, Tribune) and in New York (Sun and Musical Leader). The publication of these articles will be continued this year."</p>
   <p>"Preliminary Report for the First Three Months of the Third Year "(December, 1911 to March, 1912)</p>
   <p>"The lecture tour of Dr. Count Frantisek Luetzow is included in this period. In addition to delivering an address before the United States Congress, credit <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>for which goes to the Bohemian Congressman, Adolph J. Sabath, our distinguished guest lectured at eleven of our foremost universities. The whole tour is fresh in the memory of Bohemian America, and it is unnecessary to repeat that this great task was accomplished with the greatest success.</p>
