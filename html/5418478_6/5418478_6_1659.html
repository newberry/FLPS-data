   <p>The fourth anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Republic of Czechoslovakia was celebrated yesterday, October 29, by the congregation of the Hubbard Memorial Church, a Czech Protestant church, at 2520 South Lawndale Avenue. The celebration, which began at 8 P.M., was a dignified affair. The speakers, who chose for their subject the meaning of October 28, were Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka and the Reverend Vaclav Vanek. Miss Anna Lukes, a well-known Prague singer, sang two appropriate numbers on this occasion--"Svobodo, Svobodo" (O Liberty, 0 Liberty!) and "Uderila nase hodina" (The Hour has Struck). Another feature on the program was a display of some beautiful views of Czechoslovakia by means of a stereopticon.</p>
