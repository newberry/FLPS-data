   <p>The Pilsen Park Pavilion was the scene of the first lecture of Instructor Vojta Benes--one of the few of the Czech intelligentsia who left their native land for foreign soil to give aid to their nation when help was most needed. The lecture was under the auspices of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni [Bohemian National Alliance], and although the time between the announcement and the lecture was very short, such a crowd of people assembled at the pavilion that the spacious hall was well filled.</p>
   <p>Although Mr. Benes had lectured in New York, Baltimore, and Cleveland, and perhaps in other places among the Bohemian-Americans, we doubt whether he ever faced an audience more appreciative than this enormous gathering of our people who listened to him yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes's theme was "How the Czech Nation Lives and Suffers During the War--<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Nations' Hope in the Work of American Czechs," and we must admit that he brilliantly accomplished his task.</p>
   <p>In writing of Mr. Benes's lecture we must repeat what was said of him before, namely, that in his person there came to us a national worker and an educator of our youth, one who is performing the duty assigned to him by the Czech leaders, that of showing to us first of all how the people suffer in the old country. The speaker came to present a personal plea that we in America may not falter in the work for Czech independence.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes is a temperamental speaker, a keen observer with a broad outlook, and withal an enthusiastic nationalist, whose every word breathes the deep conviction that he is working for a good cause, for which he is prepared to render the greatest sacrifice.</p>
   <p>About three o'clock in the afternoon the speaker was introduced to the audience by the chairman of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni, and after a few preliminaries <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>launched into a very interesting topic, "The Life Which the People in Bohemia Now Lead". The speaker said that we are morally responsible for providing financial help in the fight for freedom which Bohemia now is waging. We are also morally bound in America to work for and support in every way possible the other small nations in their efforts to gain independence.</p>
   <p>.....May the beautiful words of the speaker sink in fertile soil, not only in Chicago but also all over Czech America!</p>
