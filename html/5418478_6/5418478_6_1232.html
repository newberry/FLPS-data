   <p>The drills of the Sokol gymnastic societies are always important, and it behooves the Sokols, as well as the public, to pay them visits in the largest possible numbers. They are the scenes in which the Sokols give account to the outsiders of their activities and of the manner in which they follow the mottos of Fuegner and Tyrs, the founders of the Sokol organizations. The present time makes demands on us which are of an extraordinary sort, and the importance of the drills increases correspondingly. They demonstrate in the proper light how we are prepared for any emergency.</p>
   <p>One of the largest and most popular Sokol groups, the Sokol Fuegner Tyrs, is going to show how it takes care of the members, the adolescent pupils, to develop them into strong, full fledged, adherents of the Czech branch of the American nation, those who will joyfully accept duties with which <span class="page-break">2</span>this ominous time may burden them. At the same time, it will be seen how our community has grasped the mission of the Solo organizations.</p>
   <p>Today's drill is going to be a magnificent manifestation of patriotic sentiment on the part of the Czech-Americans. The afternoon is reserved for the pupils, male and female; the evening program, beginning at 7:30 P. M., is for the adult Sokols of both sexes. The admission is 25 cents. A sociable gathering will close the event. The music will be supplied by Mr. Zelina.</p>
