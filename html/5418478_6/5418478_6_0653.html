   <p>p. 1.--Last Friday evening a regular meeting of the delegates of the Bohemian Charitable Association was held in the office of this institution.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. Communications were read requesting aid. These communications were referred to the investigating committee, which later made a report. This report stated that some of the persons who had applied for relief were really in dire need, and aid was given them immediately.</p>
   <p>The secretary then read a financial report, according to which the increase of funds was not as large at the present time as in the past.</p>

   <p>However, the dues are being paid regularly. Under these circumstances we should be careful of our expenditures. A discussion was held in regard to the convention, which matter had to be decided by this meeting. After a lengthy debate it was definitely resolved to hold the convention on Friday, June 17th of this year.</p>
   <p>The managing committee is to announce the place where the convention is to be held; it will also be the duty of the delegates to contact Bohemian sections of our city in order to solicit contributions for the expenses of the convention.</p>
   <p>Another report was read on behalf of the Bohemian Club which pledged its financial support and had elected a delegate to represent that Club at the convention. The receipts of this meeting were donations from: J. Cejka, $10; A. Denemark, $5; Ad. Rys, $25; A. Moravec, $5; California Ice Co, $5; Ludwig Kolar $5, and J. O. Horacek, $5; making a total of $60.</p>
