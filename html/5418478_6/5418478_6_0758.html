   <p>On the North Side of our city, not far from the lake front, a new hotel will be erected and it is said that it will be one of the most beautiful hotels in Chicago. For us, it is interesting because the architect and owner of this new hotel is Mr. J. B. Dibelka, former State Architect and very well known in our Bohemian circles of Chicago. The name of this new hotel will be "Illini" and the estimated cost is about two and one-half million dollars. The new hotel will be located on Surf Street, 160 feet west of Sheridan Road. The frontage of the building facing Surf Street will measure 64 feet and the depth alongside the alley leading to Diversey Boulevard will be 160 feet. The new hotel will have 292 rooms, and a luxurious ballroom with an organ. On the roof of the building there will be a beautiful garden which will be a popular place during the summer. It will be the largest enterprise of its kind ever undertaken <span class="page-break">2</span>by one of our countrymen. Mr. Dibelka is fully prepared to start construction in a week's time.</p>
