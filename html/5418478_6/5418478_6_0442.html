   <p>Yesterday, the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) presented a check for $750 to the American Red Cross in the Marquette building with the request that the money be sent to the Serbian Red Cross and used for relief of Serbian wounded soldiers and their families.</p>
   <p>Chicago Serbs have already sent $2,000, but this is the first Bohemian donation.</p>
   <p>With the money, a letter was sent asking the Serbs to bear in mind that their Bohemian prisoners of war are their Slavic brothers.</p>
