   <p>This week we are sending letters to Bohemian national organizations of the State of Illinois requesting them to become members of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee). By this we are putting into operation a decision of the executive committee of our organization which was reached as a result of a proposal by our large national bodies. In order to make our request fully understood by all our members, we are offering the following explanation: The Cesko-Slovensky Pomocny Vybor, constituted at a mass meeting in the Pilsen Park on July 28 and recognized by conventions of our large national bodies, most of which have already sent their representatives to this Vybor, has purely humane and patriotic aims. Its principal purpose is to help our nation in the old country, which has been plunged into misery by the war in Europe.</p>
   
   <p>The directing body of the Cesko-Slovensky Pomocny Vybor is its executive committee, whose members are appointed by our president and the representatives by our large national organizations.</p>
   <p>Besides this, the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor has a general committee composed of representatives of all Bohemian organizations which have become members of the Pomocny Vybor. So, for instance, the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slovonic Benevolent Societies) have one representative from their national grand lodge, and one from their grand lodge of the State of Illinois in the executive committee of the Pomocny Vybor, while every lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky which becomes a member of the Pomocny Vybor has a representative in the general committee.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor is conducting all the current business of the organization, and the general committee, whose meetings are called from time to time, receives the reports of the executive committee and makes decisions concerning the most important matters.</p>
   
   <p>In our letters to our national organizations, we ask for a voluntary donation and for the appointment of a representative who would sit in the general committee. With each letter, a collection sheet is enclosed in which contributions should be entered. We are asking the members to solicit among themselves and their friends for donations to our suffering brothers and sisters in the old country. The contribution of the organization itself may also be entered on the sheet. Those organizations which have already sent us their contributions are requested to mention that fact on the list, together with the amount contributed. (There are many such organizations.) When the collections are completed, the total amount contributed by each individual organization will be computed. Since many of our countrymen hold memberships in two, three, or more such organizations, many of them will be contributing more than once in order to assure more substantial help for our old country.</p>
   <p>All contributions should be addressed to the American State Bank, 1825 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. In order to avoid unnecessary expense, the money should be remitted in the form of checks. We wish to stress the fact that the bank pays interest on all deposited money; therefore, the sooner the donations are deposited, the more interest they will earn and the larger the final amount will be. None of our officers and workers receives any monetary compensation; hence all the money, with the exception of the necessary current expenses, will be used for the purpose for which it was donated. All collections will be published week by week in local newspapers.</p>
   <p>Our letters are being sent to the secretaries of the bodies as given in their official organs. Since there are many independent societies and associations not connected with any of the large bodies, we request their secretaries to advise us as to whom our letters should be sent, or to whom our correspondence should be addressed. In these terrible fateful times, all of us must do our duty as Bohemians and humans. Let not a single penny be lost to our brothers overseas because our secretary did not know where to address your organization.</p>
   
   <p>Bohemians of Illinois, let us show by deeds that we are the nation of Havlicek, whose monument graces Douglas Park and whose example shines in our hearts!</p>
   <p>For the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor, James F. Stepina, president</p>
   <p>Jaroslav V. Nigrin, secretary.</p>
