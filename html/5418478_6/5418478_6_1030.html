   <p>In its first regular meeting, held September 20, 1922, following the summer vacations, the Umelecky Klub (Bohemian Arts Club) decided to celebrate its.... tenth anniversary in two ways. For its more intimate group, that is, its active and contributing members and their families and friends, it will arrange an evening of entertainment on November 15, 1922, at the Lawndale Masonic Temple. The entertainment will consist of a selected artistic program of a lighter genre. There will be a French buffet, cold supper, and dancing. For the general public the Club will arrange a splendid artistic soiree fourteen days later. This event will take place in Fullerton Hall of the Chicago Art Institute, on Michigan Avenue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Boza Umiro, who was present at the meeting, promised that both he and his wife--Mrs. Ella Spravka-Umiroff--would take part in the program. The cello virtuoso, Mr. Jaroslav Gons, and his wife, Mrs. Gons-Sagurskaja, who is a famous dancer, were likewise most obliging in promising to co-operate <span class="page-break">\2</span>[with the arranging committee] and take part in the program. The same is true of Mrs. Messenger-Sterba, a harp virtuoso, who will enrich the program by her artistic contribution. Other items on the program are still being discussed and prepared. The Club will also publish a special edition of its newspaper which will serve as a program. The committee consists of Mr. Jaromir Psenka, Dr. [Jaroslav] Salaba Vojan, Mr. Freund, Professor Sterba, and Messrs. Svoboda, Jez, and Mrazek. Mr. [James] F. Stepina, a contributing member of the Club, was given a vote of thanks for placing a wreath.... in the name of the Umelecky Klub on the coffin of the recently deceased Czech sculptor, Professor Myslbek, whose funeral was held at the time of Mr. Stepina's visit in Prague. To honor the memory of Professor Myslbek, the Club rose to its feet.</p>
