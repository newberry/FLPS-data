   <p>The Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani (Council for Higher Education) is now completing its tenth year of activities. Its executive committee offers thanks to all national organizations and individuals that have shown their sympathy with the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani by supporting its efforts and thus making its work possible. The committee submits to the Bohemian public in America its tenth annual report, with the hope that the Bohemian-American public will continue helping the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani in its endeavor to raise the cultural level of its nation. Knowing from experience that long reports are frequently laid aside and left there unread, we are submitting herewith a condensed report of our activities during the year of 1912-1913. In order that they may have complete information we are sending to all our members and friends a booklet containing a detailed report on our work, together with the minutes of the Second Convention of the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani. This booklet also contains our financial report and a tabulation reviewing our work throughout the past ten years. The Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani is trying to achieve its purpose of promoting the prestige of the Bohemian nation <span class="page-break">2</span>in America by encouraging its youth to acquire higher education, and by granting loans to young people who would have to discontinue their studies without help from the outside.</p>
   <p>During the year of 1912-1913 the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani granted loans to sixteen students who qualified as worthy of such help. The total amount loaned was $2,535.</p>
   <p>The students were residents of the following states: Minnesota (3), Illinois (2), Iowa (2), Nebraska (2), Texas (2), Michigan (1), Missouri (1), North Dakota (1), Oregon (1), and Wisconsin (1). According to the universities they were divided as follows: Nebraska (2), Texas (2), Illinois (1), Iowa (1), Minnesota (1), Missouri (1), North Dakota (1), Oregon (1), Wisconsin (1), University of Chicago (1), State Normal College, Mankato, Minnesota (1), St. Paul Agricultural College (1), Olivet College, Michigan (2).</p>
   <p>The executive committee calls attention to the fact that at the beginning of the year loans totaling high above $3,400 were granted. This was considerably <span class="page-break">3</span>more than was in the treasury at that time, and is more than any subsequent income up to this time. However, not all of the loans were needed in the full amount as granted, and some were not used at all. Therefore the executive committee was in a position to pay in full all loans which were granted and for which the money was immediately necessary.</p>
   <p>Already, during this school year $2,400 has been paid out to our students, and prompt, substantial help will be needed in order that the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani may be able to pay out loans which have been promised for the second semester. In this connection it may be noted that the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani has on hand a considerable quantity of the Narodni Kolek (National Stamp), the frequent use of which we urgently recommend.</p>
   <p>As mentioned before, one of our principal objects is to encourage our talented young people in acquiring a higher education. In this we need the help of our friends. Let all of us consider it a duty to see to it that the Bohemian youth enroll in high school and attend regularly throughout the year. In cases where this is not possible the young people should attend the so-called <span class="page-break">4</span>vocational schools, which have recently been opened in many larger cities, and which give their students a very valuable industrial education, and prepare them for practical life.</p>
   <p>In submitting this condensed report, the committee thanks again all friends and patrons of the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani for their support, and asks all our national organizations and individuals to keep us in mind. The membership dues are only five dollars a year, but smaller amounts will also be gratefully accepted.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the</p>
   <p>Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani,</p>
   <p>B. Simek, president;</p>
   <p>P. A. Korab, secretary.</p>
