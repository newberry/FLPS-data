   <p>The secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) is engaged in preparing a complete list of all those who have made large contributions. Before the list is published, an expression of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>thanks is due to the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee), which appropriated $1,087 to buy three hundred complete suits of clothes from a manufacturer, which are included in the above-mentioned shipment now en route to Serbia. The suits are of excellent quality.</p>
