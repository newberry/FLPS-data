   <p>That our Czecho-Slovak Town of Lake is growing and improving is best shown by the fact that although there is great building activity there is a continual demand for living quarters. Wherever a new building is being erected, there are inquiries being made in advance. Especially of late, many Slovaks have been settling here. They have already built a new church for themselves at 48th street and Winchester avenue. The construction of the church was under the supervision of Mr. Frank Hubacek, a carpenter contractor. The building movement is evident on all sides. In the near future, work will be commenced on the new school and hall of the C.S.B.S. (Czecho-Slovak Benevolent Society) at 48th and Honore streets. Mr. A. Hopp, the well-known manufacturer of liquors, will build a new home at 47th and Robey streets, and Mr. Fikejs is building on 47th street near Hermitage street. Many other countrymen are either building or making preparations to build.</p>
