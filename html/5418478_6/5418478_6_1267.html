   <p>The representatives of two of our largest ladies' societies came to the meeting of the officials of the Ceska Kalifornie (Czech California) [Ceska Kalifornie is a district in the western part of Chicago settled by the Czechs] section of the Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni (Czech National Alliance.)</p>
   <p>The above-named Czech ladies' organizations have the largest memberships of any of the Czech ladies' organizations in the United States.</p>
   <p>The two ladies representing the Velkovybor Jednoty Ceskych Dam were Mrs. Marie <span class="page-break">\2</span>Liska, acting chairman, and Mrs. Krch a member of the same organization.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Anna Stolfa, chairman of the Ustredni Vybor Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Central Council of the Ladies' Benevolent Organization), was also present.</p>
   <p>The gratifying report of these two ladies is proof positive that Czech-American women understand the seriousness of the situation confronting the Czechs in Europe, where they are again, after centuries of serfdom, fighting for their political freedom. And it is the duty of every son and daughter in America, born of Czech parents, to help with all their might in that great struggle of the leaders of the Czech nation in Europe, to bring about, from the dimness of war, a brighter future for our suffering nation.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Liska announced that, representing the Grand Council of the Jednota Ceskych Dam, it is her duty to say that at the last meeting of the above-named association it was agreed the amount of $1,411.30 which the subordinate lodges of Illinois deposited to the credit of the work for the freedom of Czechy, be deposited <span class="page-break">\3</span>to the credit of the Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Liska gave the above amount to the treasurer, with a letter appropriate to the occasion.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Liska said that the money had been collected last year, and was to have been given to the widows and orphans in the old country, but that was found to be impracticable, and first of all financial help was needed to help in the liberation of Cechy (Bohemia). The officials were deeply moved by Mrs. Liska's address and applauded heartily.</p>
   <p>The same hearty reception was received by Mrs. Stolfa, chairman of the Ustredni Vybor Sesterske Jednoty, when she handed the treasurer a check for $1,200.</p>
   <p>Both of the ladies then announced that their respective organizations will continue their support, knowing well that after the war financial help will be needed for the unfortunate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This rare example of national solidarity which the women's organizations have started will result in favorable repercussion, not only in America, but wherever Czechs reside. Others will try to emulate their good deeds, which will shine for all time as if emblazoned in gold, telling all that it was the women who came to the aid of the Czech nation when that aid was needed most.</p>
   <p>The Ceske Narodni Zdruzeni thanks the ladies' organizations most heartily for their exemplary act, which reflects great credit upon those who are striving for that ideal goal, for which the whole Czech nation is working and fighting.</p>
