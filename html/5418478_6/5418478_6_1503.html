   <p>The National Socialist Educational Club J. V. Fric held its first entertainment yesterday afternoon and evening; the affair was a complete success. The public enjoyed a very beautifully arranged program. The arrangements committee, composed of Messrs. Doubek, Podlipsky, Fiala, and Fordik, took care of all details in a fitting manner. The entertainment was arranged for a noble purpose, that is, for the support of the Liberal [Free-Thought] Schools, to which the net profit will be donated. In the instrumental and vocal numbers on the program appeared young talented performers, who, through their successful performances, ingratiated themselves with the audience and were rewarded by general recognition and thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The services of Dr. Frantisek Iska were engaged for the entertainment. He was to speak on the Liberal [Free-Thought] Schools, but because he was some-what delayed as a result of performing funeral rites, and also, because he <span class="page-break">2</span>did not wish to delay the program, he curtailed his speech to some extent. Doctor Iska briefly called attention to medieval education, to the reforms made therein by the nation's great teacher, Jan Amos Komensky, who was the original founder of the modern educational methods, and the first to remove the compulsion, whereby children of tender years were required to learn what the educational system of that period ordered, with no regard as to whether or not the child was capable of understanding all that it was forced to learn.</p>
   <p>Today's schools, which are to educate a capable youth, nationally enlightened and trained for practical life, are far in advance. Children receive a good education in schools, freely organized and managed in a liberal atmosphere where, to be sure, they are reminded of their origin and maternal language. The speaker called attention to our apparent neglect of our liberal schools, to their mismanagement, and the inadequacy of the teaching staff. Of course it would be vain for us to seek zealous workers for the present-day schools among those who have critized our schools from the day of their organization <span class="page-break">3</span>These persons, who critize our schools, cannot contribute to the improvement of the schools and in this way they are only ridiculing the unappreciated work of those first pioneers of our liberal schools. Instead of criticizing,they could go to work and in that way speed up the progress of the liberal schools where children are now learning our beautiful mother tongue. The contention that children in America do not have to be able to speak Czech and that it is unnecessary because here they must speak English, should cease. How sad it is when parents, who during the youthful years of their children have done for them everything they thought would be beneficial and have themselves helped them to gain security and in their own old age have retired to rest peacefully in the midst of their matured children with whom it is difficult for them to converse because the children very often do not understand them, because they do not know the Czech language. It is always very good when a child, in addition to the language of the country, knows the language of its parents. For that reason parents should send their children to Czech liberal schools so that they may become good Czech-Americans and learn to respect our valiant <span class="page-break">4</span>nation, which in former times stood in the forefront of all others.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, we must not criticize old faults, but must always cheerfully contribute toward the improvement of the rearing and education of the children in our liberal schools. Doctor Iska's speech was warmly applauded. It should be added that the Czech national dances, performed under the direction of Mr. Rudolph Bubenicek, were very beautiful. The program was completed by the playing of our national songs by the band. Following the conclusion of the program, there ensued an informal dance.</p>
