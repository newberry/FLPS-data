   <p>We have always had responsibilities and obligations toward the old country; it has always been our duty to try to help her as we would an old, careworn, hard-working little mother who, no matter how much she wanted to, could not keep on feeding all her children and had to send them out into the wide world to make a living. Our responsibilities are even greater now that the terror of war is raging there with increasing fury.</p>
   <p>The collections sponsored by the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) are growing, and the enthusiastic support that our public is giving to the Vybor shows that our people are fully aware of the seriousness of the situation in Bohemia and that they are ready to mitigate sorrow in the old country by any sacrifices that might be expected from them.</p>

   <p>In two short months Christmas will be here, the most beautiful holidays of the whole year, full of charm, gaiety, and happy memories. Can any of us imagine what kind of Christmas they will have in the old country this year when there is hardly a family who will be spared the heart-rending anxiety about one or more of its beloved members, or fear of dire need? Such thoughts should be the strongest incentive for all of us to support our relief action as much as we can. If the first substantial help could be sent to the old country for this Christmas, to be distributed where the need for immediate assistance is greatest, it would certainly be the most beautiful way for Bohemian America to gain the gratitude of her unfortunate countrymen overseas.</p>
