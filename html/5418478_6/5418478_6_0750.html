   <p>Our countrymen living in the vicinity of Cak Park Avenue and West 22nd Street will surely be interested to hear that R. A. Capek of the Millard State Bank, West 26th Street and Millard Avenue, and a number of his partners, who are mostly west 26th Street businessmen, have bought a large tract of real estate--about 55 acres--in the neighborhood mentioned above.</p>
   <p>We are informed by Mr. Capek that the property is to be parcelled up and that a number of two-flat apartment buildings are to be built on the site. These small flats are intended to reduce the great lack in such dwellings which is nowadays felt everywhere. How much they paid for this property we were unable to discover.</p>
