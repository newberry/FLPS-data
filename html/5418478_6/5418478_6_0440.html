   <p>Men and women who work in the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), in the Cesko-Slovensky Cerveny Kriz (sic) (Bohemian-Slavonic Red Cross) and in the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) for the good of the Bohemian nation both here and in the old country, do so unselfishly and without any pay. They devote their time and efforts to most important national interests without any material remuneration or reward. The best reward they could get would be the knowledge that they did not work in vain, that it had the desired results. Those, however, who stand idly by, should at least have the decency not to mar and spoil this good work. If anybody thinks that he has a good idea, an excellent plan, the introduction of which would lead to success, let him present it to the Narodni Sdruzeni, explain its advantages, and he may be sure that every good suggestion, every worth-while proposal will find the proper appreciation. He who does not do <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>anything has no right to criticize, to say nothing of condemning the work of others.</p>
