[Here follows the usual description of the events which led to the World War, allusions being made to German imperialism, the Hapsburg alliance with Germany, the exploits of the allied armies, the long-drawn-out campaigns, the final victories of the Allied armies, the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>fall of the Hapsburg regime and the creation of a Czechoslovak state.].....</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovaks of America, ever since the beginning of the great conflict, have tried to be of service to their old homeland, have supported the revolution with a generous hand, and have most willingly helped to make the victory assured.</p>
   <p>As during previous years, so this year also, the day of Czechoslovak independence is to be celebrated on the memorable day--the day of October 28--by festive processions and parades to bring back to our memory the sanguine days of the birth of the [Czechoslovak] Republic.</p>
