   <p>The Czech Masonic Lodge, Bohemia, has added $100 to the fund from which the Czech Charitable Society will distribute five-dollar baskets as Christmas gifts among the poor Czech families in our community. Mr. Otto Pecha is president of the Lodge. The collections made by the Charitable Society are growing rapidly. Therefore, the number of needy families considered, after a close scrutiny of their circumstances, will far exceed previous estimations.</p>
