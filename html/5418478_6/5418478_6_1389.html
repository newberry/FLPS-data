   <p>With a very large attendance of the public and with large delegations from numerous Sokol units, the Sokol Karel Jonas, one of our youngest but most active units, celebrated yesterday a festive event which will make this for all time a red letter day in the history of this body. It was the dedication of the new building of the Morton Park Sokol organization, the cornerstone of which was laid September 20.....</p>
   <p>The new building is located at 5510-12-14 West 25th Street, that is, in the very heart of Bohemian Morton Park....</p>
   <p>In building this new home, the Sokol Karel Jonas has taken upon itself a considerable burden, but in spite of this it is looking with great hopes to the future. It has almost two hundred very active members, and in its ladies auxiliary it has around one hundred charming helpers.....</p>
   <p>The Sokol Jonas has already spent about $18,000 on the building....The hall contains a fully equipped modern stage, and the Sokol's amateurs will start their theatrical season this coming Sunday.....</p>
