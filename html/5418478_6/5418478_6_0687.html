   <p>A lively relief movement was begun immediately upon the receipt of reports of the terrible calamity which befell almost the entire eastern section of Bohemia where now reigns the greatest distress. Individuals and lodges out-did one another in their offerings.</p>
   <p>There have already been held many advisory meetings on how the largest sum could be collected. Representatives of the Central Catholic Union met yesterday afternoon in the community hall of St. Procopius on Alport street, and almost all came.</p>
   <p>All the countrymen present displayed a great interest in the cruel fate of the countrymen in the old-country and readily promised to help by word and deed. Committees were appointed, which are to conduct collections in all Bohemian catholic communities in Chicago. These committees will be provided with credentials and subscriptions blanks in Bohemian and English.</p>

   <p>Then a central collection committee was elected, as follows: P. M. Farnik, chairman; Ant. Malcak, vice-chairman; Tomas Kraus, secretary; Vojt. Janda, treasurer and Fr. Svatek, auditor. How actively collections for our suffering brothers, are going on among Bohemian catholics, is shown by the fact that over $1000.00 has already been collected.</p>
