   <p>A convention of our fraternal organizations was to have been held soon, which by the affirmative votes of the members was to go on record favoring the fusion of the many organizations; but from present indications this convention will not be held, and there does not seem to be any certainty that this fusion will materialize.</p>
   <p>As is well known, the members of five organizations voted on the question of fusion, and the votes of three were favorable to the cause; these were the Cesko Slovanska Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Unity), the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian-Slavonic Fraternal Benevolent Society), and the Cesko-Americka Jednota (Bohemian-American Unity). Voting against the fusion were the following societies: Jednota Cesko-Americkych Lesniku a Lesnic (Order Of Bohemian-American Men and Women Foresters), and the Jednota Taboritu (Union of Taborites). As a result of this decision, the three organizations casting the affirmative votes were to form the fusion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Conditions have changed considerably recently, because many of the members who, at first, were enthusiastic for the fusion, now do not seem to be so concerned about the matter. That makes it necessary to take another vote on the proposition.</p>
   <p>The above decision was arrived at by the Cesko-Americka Jednota, and the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota. The Nejvyssi Loze Cesko-Slovanske Jednoty (Grand Lodge of the Bohemian-Slavonic Union), at its last regular meeting, came to the same decision.</p>
   <p>Because of this, the convention had to be postponed to the first week in July, and by that time the members of the three interested societies will have ample time to arrive at a decision.</p>
   <p>The latest copy of the Organ Cesko-Slovanske Jednoty (Organ of the Bohemian-Slavonic Union) explains in detail the position taken by the Grand Lodge, and from it, we have reproduced an article which should interest all members <span class="page-break">\3</span>concerned in the fusion of our societies.</p>
   <p>When the matter of fusing our organizations was first proposed, great stress was laid on the fact that from this fusion there will arise a great Bohemian benevolent union. This union will be linked to all conservative elements, and will be of great assistance to the Bohemian people in America.</p>
   <p>Many of the members voted for fusion from a moral standpoint, which certainly is a strong one. Others did not even consider the financial aspect as much as they did the fact, that from this fusion there would arise a union of conservative Czechs whose potential membership would amount to forty thousand.</p>
   <p>Now the situation is different. We cannot speak of the great moral significance of a strong Bohemian union because the fusion of the six organizations is now postponed, and there seems to be a possibility of the six organizations is now postponed, and there seems to be a possibility that only three organizations will fuse.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge of our Bohemian-Slavonic Union also acted upon this weighty <span class="page-break">\4</span>question at its last meeting, where the fusion of our unions was given full consideration.</p>
   <p>.....A lively debate arose when the chairman brought up the subject of fusion. The proponents of the fusion movement called attention to the fact that the older the organization the more it needs new members, and that the only organization which can live up to its obligations is the one which gains new members.</p>
   <p>It was brought to the attention of those present that there can be no guarantee that the prevailing rates will not be raised.</p>
   <p>Attention was called to this question of rate increase, in case the societies do not fuse. A change in the tabulation of members is inevitable, whether or not a fusion takes place, so argued some of the well-informed brethren.</p>
   <p>A number of members said that some organizations accept men who are old and physically unfit, in order to gain a larger membership. This practice will act <span class="page-break">\5</span>as a serious detriment to them, when the new orders go into effect. These societies will then raise the dues of older men to such a level that many of the older men, being unable to pay the new higher rates, will be forced to leave their organizations with the loss of every dollar paid into such societies.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Grand Lodge did not want to assume the responsibility of deciding whether it wants to fuse with just two organizations, and decided to recommend that members of the various organizations again cast their ballots for a final decision.</p>
