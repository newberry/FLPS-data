   <p>The Czech National Alliance is calling upon our fellow-countrymen, born in the lands of the Bohemian Crown, Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, to fill out military registration cards as follows, and not any other way:</p>
   <p>Where Were You Born?</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td/>
     <td>Town</td>
     <td>State</td>
     <td>Nation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td/>
     <td>Praha</td>
     <td>Bohemia</td>
     <td>Bohemian</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>or:</td>
     <td>Brno</td>
     <td>Moravia</td>
     <td>Bohemian</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>or:</td>
     <td>Tesin</td>
     <td>Silesia</td>
     <td>Bohemian</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>Under no circumstances should any one declare his nationality as "Austrian."</p>
   <p>Why should Czech registrants guard themselves against declaring themselves "Austrians"? Simply because the Czechs, in electing for their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>king a member of the Hapsburg dynasty, have not at the same time signed away their rights to independence of the lands of the Czech Crown; namely,Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.</p>
   <p>The Czechs, by the proclamation of 1916, have declared a state of separation from Austria, and against it. They have decided to form a state of their own, outside of and without the slightest connection with Austria.</p>
   <p>We do not recognize the Hapsburg dynasty, we do not recognize Carl, the new emperor, who has not even taken the oath as king of Bohemia, and therefore, is not entitled to rule over us.</p>
   <p>Austria is not a nation, not even in a political sense. It is merely a government to which we denied our allegiance at the very beginning of the World War.</p>
   <p>Any fellow-countryman who would declare himself to have been born in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Austria, or to be of Austrian nationality will damage our common cause and his own also, if the War should come to an abrupt end because of a split in American opinions.</p>
   <p>All fellow-countrymen between the ages of twenty-one and thirty are urgently requested to follow the directions given above.</p>
