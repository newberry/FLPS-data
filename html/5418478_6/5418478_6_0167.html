Five hundred baskets filled with food, even some delicacies, and toys for the children will be distributed among needy Czech families on December 24.

Mr. Cermak is a director of the Charitable Association. County Judge Thomas F. Scully gave Mr. Cermak a check for twenty-five dollars..... [Translator's note: A list of other donors follows.]</p>
