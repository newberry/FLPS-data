   <p>The Spolek Cheskych Hostinskych (Association of Czech Restaurant Men and Tavern-keepers), has been active among us for twenty years; during this time it has been generously supporting our charitable and nationalistic institutions and also valiantly repulsing attacks from the reactionary forces, which seek to curtail our personal liberty, and by the fanatics who indulge in assaults upon our immigrants. Hundreds of men of the trade belong to the association, whose importance cannot be over estimated by the Czech public.</p>
   <p>The celebration of the twenty-fifth birth day of the association held in the Czech-Slavonic American hall, on 18th St., demonstrated the great interest of the Chicago Czech public for the organization. The arrangement committee took great care in providing refreshments both for mind and stomach; the tickets cost $5 per "gentleman with lady."</p>
