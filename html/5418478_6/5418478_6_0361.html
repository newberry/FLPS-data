   <p>Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky's cablegram urging American Bohemians to collect clothes, linen, and shoes for Bohemians who are stranded as prisoners of war in Serbia, and are badly in need of wearing apparel, has met with a ready response in our colony. Yesterday a number of our good countrymen sent their names to the secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) notifying them that they will make available part of their premises to be used as depots where bundles of clothes for our unfortunate brothers in Serbia, may be brought.</p>
   <p>Because of their kindness, we are today in a position to announce that articles for our prisoners of war in Serbia may be deposited at Miss Scheffel's beauty parlor at 1436 West 18th Street, Mr. Huska's barber shop at 1810 South Laflin Street, and the Shaffner Clothing Company at 1922-26 South Halsted Street, where the articles will be received by the manager, Mr. J. J. Kapsa.</p>

   <p>Those who bring in bundles are asked to give their names to the people in charge of the depots so that the donations may be publicly receipted.</p>
   <p>We should like to call the attention of our friends to the fact that thus far we have no depot in the California Avenue neighborhood. We do not doubt that there will be quite a number of people willing to help in this humane work in this largest Bohemian district in the city.</p>
