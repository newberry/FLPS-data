   <p>The Sokol Slavek is known as one of the most active of our organizations. It recently made a change in the conduct of its meetings which will undoubtedly prove beneficial to the organization. The change is designed to attract prospective members by adding an element of pleasure to meetings which otherwise would appear monotonous. Every second meeting of the month is to consist entirely of a program of entertainment. A promising start in this direction was made last Wednesday when eight new members were inducted at the meeting. Speeches were made by Mr. Anton Dolezal, head of the Sokol Slavek; Mr. Joseph Cermak, head of the entire Czech Sokol community; and Mr. John A. Cervenka. Mrs. Cervenka recited an appropriate poem. Mr. and Mrs. Kouba sang several duets, and Mr. Kerel Malik, well known in singing circles, sang some of Hasler's popular melodies in his beautiful tenor voice. An orchestra played Czech and American pieces. The evening was a pronounced success, and the next evening of entertainment is eagerly anticipated.</p>
