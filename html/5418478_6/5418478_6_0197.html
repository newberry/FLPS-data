   <p>It is meet to mention that since the organization of the Czech branch of the American Red Cross, it has been the women members of our Sokol gymnastic organizations who have made the greatest efforts toward the establishment of regular courses in first aid, diet, and nursing, as these courses had been suggested and were finally introduced by the Americky Sokol (American Sokol).</p>
   <p>Classes are being held at the following places: Pilsen Brewery Park, each Wednesday and Friday; the halls of Sokol Chicago and Sokol Havlicek Tyrs.</p>
   <p>The class at the first location is conducted by Dr. J. Rudis-Jicinsky, at the second by Dr. A. Mueller, at the third by Dr. L. Fisher. Lectures <span class="page-break">2</span>in the first class have just been completed, and examinations will be given by Dr. H. W. Gentles, representing the American Red Cross. The third class includes women of a more mature age, the majority being members of Sokol societies. They see to it that as much as possible is produced and procured from useful goods for the soldiers on the battlefield; they also make collections and receive contributions. Dr. Fisher is anxious to have all the textbooks and instructions translated into the Czech language. In general, his class is guided by the instructions issued from the headquarters; the other two classes follow the same procedure. Twenty-five girls and married women will take the examination. Books and school supplies are bought by our Czech Red Cross workers. We are delighted at the progress this patriotic enterprise is making.</p>
