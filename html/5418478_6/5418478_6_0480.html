   <p>The Bohemian-American newspapers have been publishing articles during the past few days dealing with the formation of a Bohemian volunteer league in Paris, as a result of a telegram from that league requesting financial help from Bohemain-Americans.</p>
   <p>Some newspapers have voiced their distrust toward this move, but now we have found that the action is aboveboard and should be supported. The Bohemian volunteer league is not an innovation of irresponsible or adventuresome elements, but rather an action of the Bohemain colony of Paris, and it has a legitimate, serious reason.</p>
   <p>Immediately after declaration of the Austro-French war, all Austrians in France, including, obviously, the Bohemians,who have a very large colony <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in Paris, an order came to leave Paris and France within twenty-four hours and to go either to Belgium, Switzerland, or Spain. Those who prefer to stay in France must report to the police authorities between the fifth and sixteenth mobilization days, and they will be sent to certain specified places in the west of France for farm work under military supervision and will be considered prisoners of war.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen, most of whom are married and have children, were naturally in despair over this order. Their wives were in tears, and worried husbands found it most difficult to console them.....</p>
   <p>In this desperate situation, a mass meeting of all Bohemians was called in Paris to decide on the steps to be taken in order to dissuade the French government from the policy of dealing in this manner with the Bohemians, who have always been friends of France and Austria.....</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>It was finally decided to form a "Ligue De Volontaires Tcheques A Paris" (League of Bohemian Volunteers in Paris) ....which sent a delegation to the ministry of war....where they met the flyer, Rosenfeld, a Bohemian Jew, who.... had been given French citizenship.....</p>
   <p>Professor Denis....offered the Bohemians his help....and after other important citizens had intervened in favor of the Bohemians, a French member of Parliament brought about something we ourselves never succeeded in achieving: We have been recognized as Bohemians--"Tcheques" [subsequently transcribed in English as "Czechs"]--and not "Austrians".</p>
   <p>Upon the intervention of the above-mentioned deputy, the Bohemians--Czechs--were given an office of their own in the prefecture, a special office staff, and our countrymen, Messrs. Hofman, Novak, and Rosenfeld were appointed as the staff's assistants. Thereafter, all Bohemians offering to serve as volunteers <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>were enrolled, first those who had to leave Paris within three days. Each received a "Permis De Sejour" (permit to stay) and could remain in Paris.....All of them were called to arms August 21 and were immediately sent to the front.</p>
   <p>This is an absolutely reliable report, and it explains the nature of the Bohemian league of volunteers. Its address is: "Ligue De Volontaires Tcheques A Paris, 9 Rue Buffault".</p>
   <p>Excerpts of a Letter from a Bohemian Volunteer in Paris</p>
   <p>In order that our readers may get a better understanding of the reasons for the formation of a body of Bohemian volunteers in France, we publish herewith a few excerpts of a letter written by our countryman, Otakar Cizek, founder of the Sokol at Argenteuil near Paris, to his relatives in New York:</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"Argenteuil, August 8, 1914.</p>
   <p>"My dear friends: No doubt you are anxious to know how we are.....[The body of the letter repeats and describes in detail, the events forming the first part of this article, and then continues:]</p>
   <p>"Once more I am asking you, my dear Mother, to take care of my family, that is my wife and my two girls, if I should not return from the war. To know that you will not leave them without help will be a great consolation for me.....</p>
   <p>"In the meantime, if you can, send them some money.....I am afraid they might go hungry.....</p>
   <p>"....Please have this letter published in our newspapers in America and ask the Sokols to organize collections for the 'Ligue De Volontaires Tcheques A <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Paris', 9 Rue Buffault. No matter how small the amounts, everything will be welcome, because we are all very poor....."</p>
   <p>No doubt, this letter speaks volumes. Whoever can should help these heroic brothers and countrymen who, being forced to leave their wives and children, hurry to help France, a country whom all Bohemians love wholeheartedly.</p>
