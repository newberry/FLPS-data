   <p>Sokol Slovanska Lipa (Slavonic Linden) proudly calls itself the oldest sokol society in Chicago. The second Czech society, which was founded in Chicago in 1861, was named Slovanska Lipa. The first sokol society in Chicago was Telocvicna Jednota Sokol which was organized in 1866 and merged with Slovanska Lipa in 1868. It became, so to speak, a sokol branch of Slovanska Lipa just as Lumir, organized in 1862, was its choral branch. In 1869, Slovanska Lipa built for itself a new hall on Taylor Street near Canal Street. It carried on in this way until 1871, at which time it was changed to a wholly gymnastic society which on July 6, 1892 merged with Sokol Cesko-Americky (Bohemian-American Sokol), the second sokol society in Chicago, which also was organized in 1868. The united society then took the name Sokol Slovanska Lipa and chose as its headquarters the building of the Cesko-Americky Sokol on De Koven Street <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>where it remains to this day and carries on successfully.</p>
   <p>We felt that it was appropriate to publish this historical data in order to make it clear that Sokol Slovanska Lipa has the right to call itself the oldest sokol society in Chicago. Slovanska Lipa has been carrying on its beneficent work among the Bohemians of Chicago for fully fifty years and it has been forty years since the Society began its activities as an independent sokol society.</p>
   <p>Its age calls for respect, and the more so when we consider the work which was done especially in the first beginnings of the Bohemian settlement in Chicago, Sokol Slovanska Lipa still has in its midst members who were active in the Society or in the Cesko-Americky Sokol over forty years ago, and has a large group of those who helped to bring about the merger of the old societies into the Sokol Slovanska Lipa, nineteen years ago.</p>
