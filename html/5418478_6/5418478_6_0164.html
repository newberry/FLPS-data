   <p>The Czech Charitable Society has undertaken the noble task of supporting destitute Czech families. Its immediate purpose is the collection of gifts to be distributed among our poor Chicago Czech people in order to make Christmas a real holiday for them. The Society feels that in its efforts it should be supported by the entire Czech community. The Society is able to record an influx of gifts, true enough, but they are insufficient to answer the purpose.</p>
   <p>A list of donors follows, together with the amounts contributed: The Chicago Butchers' Packing Co., $20. Frank Kirchman, 3149 West 22nd Street, $10. Kaspar State Bank, $10. The Monarch Coal Co., 2229 South Crawford Ave., $5.</p>
