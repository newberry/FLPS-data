   <p>A meeting was again held last night, it's purpose being the alleviation of want, which has befallen the hundreds upon hundreds of our countrymen in Eastern Bohemia who were visited by that terrible calamity of the elements during the month of July. The meeting was conducted by a large attendence of women and men representatives of various lodges and societies, in the premises of the Ladimir Klacel Reading Club, in the hall of the same name on Leavitt and 19th street. It should be said, that the reading club particularly exerted itself to see that the lodges sent their representatives to the collective committee, and thereby it had undeniably earned credit for the fact that the relief movement spread so remarkably. During yesterday's meeting it was resolved to send to Bohemia the sum of one thousand crowns, which is the third such remittance.</p>
   <p>The meeting was brought to order at eight o'clock by the chairman of the committee Mr. Antonin Cmolik. The secretary Mr. Frant. Ort read the minutes of the previous meeting. It could be seen that everything to the smallest detail was recorded very carefully and marked "Accepted". The collection sheets were then read and from all indications it is certain that they were in the hands of energetic collectors, because each one of them showed generous receipts. Mr. Vacl. Spacek gave a report on the entertainment at the Bohemian American Sokol Hall, which was for the benefit of the calamity stricken. According to the report made, it is to be regretted that the entertainment was not attended in such a manner, as decidedly, considering the purpose for which it was arranged, it should have been.</p>
   <p>As a result of the small attendance, the committee had left many donated cigars, much beer, wine, etc. It was decided, therefore, that another affair should be arranged,preferably in Bohemian California, of which community it is known, that Bohemians there do not become frightened by thunder and lightning, and that they will surely attend in large numbers.</p>
   
   <p>For this purpose a committee was elected and it is to begin making preparations at once. Receipts at this meeting amounted to $190.60. As a result, it was voted to send 1000 crowns to the order of Mrs. Naprstek, in Bohemia, who will then deliver it to the proper place. The meeting was then declared adjourned. The next meeting will be held in two weeks.</p>
