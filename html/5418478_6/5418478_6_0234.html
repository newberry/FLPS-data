   <p>The pupils of the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola (The Czech Free Thought School), a day school housed in the Redges Public School in Town of Lake, at the suggestion of their teacher, Mrs. M. L. Bubenicek, agreed to donate one cent for every English work spoken during the Czech hour, the money to be used for the orphans of the Czech soldiers killed in war who had lived in Cechy (Bohemia) and Moravia.</p>
   <p>The good little patriots collected among themselves for the first week of their self-imposed abnegation, the sum of $1.40, which was deposited with the editorial staff or our newspaper, and we will see to it, with the greatest of pleasure, that the amount named reaches its proper destination.</p>
