   <p>Next Saturday will be the fourth anniversary of the declaration of the independence of Czechoslovakia. That anniversary will be celebrated by the Druzina Svazu Ceskoslovenskych Legionaru (local branch of the federation of the Czechoslovak legionnaires), by the Sokols, and by other patriotic organizations. The celebration will take place in the Pilsen Park pavilion on October 28 at 8 P.M. The Czechoslovak consul general and the consuls of the allied governments, as well as other prominent personages, will be present.</p>
   <p>The program, which will be a dignified affair, will include an address by Brother Kosar, who is the secretary of the grand council of the Sokolska Obec ([American] Sokol Community). Brother Kosar's address will deal with the personalities of Jindrich Fuegner and Miroslav Tyrs, founders of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the Sokol societies and the first champions of freedom for the Czech people. These two men more than sixty years ago correctly estimated the value of a mentally and physically fit group of men--the Sokols.</p>
   <p>Brothers and sisters! Attend the celebration in the greatest possible numbers! Na Zdar! (To success!)</p>
   <p>For the Sokolska Zupa Stredni (Central District of the [American] Sokol Union)</p>
