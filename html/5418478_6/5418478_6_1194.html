   <p>The Pilsen District branch of the Czech National Alliance wishes to discharge itself of a pleasant duty in thanking the Cesko-Slovanska Jednota (Czechoslovak Union) for the gift of $99.58. The Union has repeatedly proved that it is a nationally conscious patriotic body, for there is hardly a nationalistic enterprise which it would not support. It is the duty of Czech men and women to become members of this organization and so to identify themselves with its patriotic efforts. It also is the duty of Czech parents to send their American-born children to Czech organizations in order to make and keep the children conscious of their Czech descent and acquaint them with our Czech patriotic aspirations.</p>
   <p>It is only from Czechs who are reared in the atmosphere of Czech organizations that we may expect nationalistic support. We wish that the Czech people would acknowledge the importance of organizations such as the Czechoslovak Union.</p>
