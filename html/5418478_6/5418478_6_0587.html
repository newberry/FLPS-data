   <p>A meeting of the committee of the Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was held yesterday under the chairmanship of Judge Joseph Uhlir. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Turek announced receipt of the following contributions: Mr. Joseph Bartosek, 1801 South Millard Avenue, $5; Mrs. Sofie Lotreck, 3416 West 26th Street, $4; Reznicky Vzdelavaci Klub (Master Butchers' Association), $2; Krouzek Ceskych Dam v Brookfield (Bohemian Women's Circle of Brookfield), $35; Mr. Hora, $3; Mrs. Kral, 1520 Blue Island Avenue, $3; a collection by Mrs. Bachus, $7.90; Joseph Sukovsky, $.25; Frank Dedek, $.50; Lieutenant Ptacek, of the Lawndale Police Station, clothing; Mr. Palda, 1539 South Hamlin Avenue, clothing; Mr. Lisy, of Lalla &amp; Company, flour; Lieutenant Ptacek, for tickets for the ball, $2.</p>
   <p>Mr. Turek reported that from December up to the present time $230 was paid <span class="page-break">\2</span>out for rent, coal, and provisions for needy people. Mr. Frank J. Petru, a member of the Board of Trustees, reported that in the case of Mrs. Helen Suptich, he felt himself forced to take the case before the County Court, because Mrs. Suptich's mother-in-law, although she has property, absolutely refused to support her daughter-in-law and grandchildren. Mrs. Helen Suptich's husband committed suicide. The family was left destitute, and the grandmother refused to aid them as the law provides. The family was forced to seek assistance elsewhere. The Dobrocinna Spolecnost took the matter up with the court. The case was heard yesterday and the judge decided that the mother-in-law is required by law to contribute to the support of her son's children. She was ordered to contribute five dollars per week. The State of Illinois has a law, which states that, it is the duty of parents to provide for their destitute children, that children should provide for their parents, and, in fact, that it is the duty of the nearest relatives to provide for their destitute relatives in so far as their means permit.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petru also announced that he investigated, as he had been ordered, the gift of five acres to the Dobrocinna Spolecnost from the Florida Colonization Company. He was informed that the Dobrocinna Spolecnost cannot obtain the <span class="page-break">\3</span>land unless it sells one forty-acre tract in the colonization district. Mr. Petru was instructed to write to the company and to advise it that the Dobrocinna Spolecnost did not understand the gift in that way, for the gift was offered to it by the company. The company gained good will by making the offer and it is now attempting to evade everything and to break its word.</p>
   <p>Mr. Turek reported that he had to reject thirty-one requests for aid, because the requests were made under false pretenses. In the majority of these cases the petitioners complained that they were unemployed but when they were offered work, they refused to accept it. Many applicants were provided with jobs on the ice field at Cedar Lake and some of these people were in such straits that the Dobrocinna Spolecnost had to pay their transportation to the job. One case was particularly distressing. A certain countryman left for work at the lake, several hours after his wife gave birth to a child. In many cases it was found that children of the petitioners earned as much as twenty dollars weekly, but the parents came to the Dobrocinna Spolecnost for support.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>At the request of the Chamber of Commerce that the Dobrocinna Spolecnost furnish it with a financial report and a report of the entire year's activities, a reply was sent which stated that the Dobrocinna Spolecnost's fiscal year closes at the end of January, and the reports requested will be sent at that time.</p>
   <p>Receipts at this meeting were $41.25 and disbursements were $130.10. The meeting was then adjourned. The next meeting will be held on January 24.</p>
   <p>The office of the Dobrocinna Spolecnost is located at Homan Avenue and 26th Street. Office hours are from 3 P.M. to 6 P.M. daily.</p>
