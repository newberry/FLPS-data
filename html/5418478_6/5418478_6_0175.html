   <p>The Denni Hlasatel is appealing to the Chicago public of Czech descent to contribute to a fund from which Christmas gifts will be bought for every Czech soldier on the battlefields in Europe. The gifts will consist of tobacco and cigarettes. This will be a demonstration of our love and gratitude to our heroic soldiers who are fighting for human rights. It will, at the same time, be evidence of our own patriotic sentiment.</p>
   <p>No one should hesitate to place a coin upon the altar of our good cause. Out out the coupon, fill in your name and address, and enclose the money. Every gift will be properly acknowledged. This collecion will close November 15.</p>
