   <p>Responding to the call of the executive committee of the Druzina Cesko-slovenskych Legionaru v Chicagu (Czechoslovak Legionnaires of Chicago), the representatives of our foremost national organizations will meet June 23, 1920, at the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall to discuss one of the most difficult problems which recently stirred up the sentiment of our Bohemian people.</p>
   <p>We again call the attention of our people to the fact that our legionnaires of Chicago are not interested and do not wish to grasp the leadership of our national organizations or to designate the trends of our future national activities. This attitude is not based on trifling matters of individual character; neither is it a protest against persons who are leading our <span class="page-break">\2</span>foremost national organizations, nor does it represent a trend which is in any way harmful or unfavorable to our public life. The essence of this movement lies in the just complaints of our prominent people and of our organizations. Today's call for reorganization is not a call of the street mob; rather, it is a call of the sincere and well-meaning Bohemian people who liberally supported our action during the past World War, the result of which was the independence of the Bohemian people.</p>
   <p>We do not consider it proper to ignore these righteous protests as long as they tend to invigorate and elevate our public life. These protests, once intelligently comprehended, cannot be construed as a provocation and result in harm to our interests in other countries. We, as legionnaires, are not interested in advertising this quarrel in our newspapers; we are only making an effort to invigorate our national organization. We ask only that justice, democracy, and love for our nation be the ideals of our common struggle.</p>
   <p>Life under the present sad conditions, in which we are losing the understanding <span class="page-break">\3</span>necessary for the noblest tasks and aims, is slowly moving ahead toward extinction. Therefore, it is necessary to beware and save the endangered future, and it is the sacred duty of all those who think that they have the unlimited right to conduct our public life to bring the situation under control before it is too late.</p>
   <p>One of the most difficult problems in our attempt at reorganization must be solved by our national organizations. What is asked of them is well known to everybody; but the question remains whether these organizations themselves know their own duties not only toward us legionnaires but also toward the whole nation.</p>
   <p>We, especially, are pointing out this part of the reorganization program, because it will be impossible to attain success if the program is not thoroughly comprehended. We do not want to be ruled by any gestures; we do not want to conduct our affairs mechanically according to bylaws and regulations. The most decisive factor in conducting our affairs and performing our duties <span class="page-break">\4</span>must be creative power, human thought, untiring energy, and sincere enthusiasm for our mutual cause.</p>
   <p>Such a program is being prepared by us for the conference of our national organizations. Because of its significance, this conference may mark a new era in our movement in America.</p>
