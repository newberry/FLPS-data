   <p>These pictures do not need much explanation. They show the funeral or the whole family of Vaclav and Anezka Novotny, with daughter Marie and little Vilik, all of whom perished a week ago in the Chicago River. The lower picture shows the rites in front of the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola Vojta Naprstek (Bohemian Free Thought School Vojta Naprstek) on Homan Avenue and 26th Street. Above is the funeral procession marching on 26th Street. The scouts are just passing. Behind them are school children and Sokol youth. The procession was watched from the sidewalks by thousands of people, mostly inhabitants of our Bohemian California, but many coming from more distant Bohemian communities to pay the last honors to all the Bohemian victims of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the "Eastland" disaster on the occasion of Vilik Novotny's funeral.</p>
   <p>The Proposal of the Denni Hlasatel Finds Overwhelming Approval--Mayor Thompson and Highest City Dignitaries Attend Funeral</p>
   <p>It was just a week yesterday since the day that filled all Chicago with horror and carried the deepest sorrow into districts inhabited by the immigrants, and particularly those inhabited by Bohemians. From that Saturday until yesterday, scenes have been taking place in these districts that will never be forgotten by those who witnessed them. And similar scenes will be seen also today and in the next few days. It will be a very long time before the life of our countrymen living in certain districts returns to normal, to the former quiet and peace, and traces of pain and sorrow will be plainly noticeable there even after long years. A full week has elapsed since the fateful Saturday when the unfortunate "Eastland" sank to the bottom of the Chicago River and caused the death of so many hundreds of Chicago citizens.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Among these an overwhelming majority were young and healthy, justifying the best and most beautiful hopes for the future, and many were young children. A full week has elapsed, but there is still gnawing sorrow all over the city. There are still funeral processions to be seen in Chicago streets, They are the saddest ones the city has ever had, and fill the spectators with an ever-growing feeling of horror and pain.....</p>
   <p>One of the saddest funerals was that of a little one who could not be identified in the Second Regiment Armory or later on in Sheldon's morgue for full five days. Nobody claimed the little body, although thousands passed by it. Nobody knew who would bury the little one, who would take care of him in the moments of his earthly pilgrimage. The little one was designated as "Number 396," and under this designation a profusion of flowers was showered upon him daily, coming to him not only from all districts of Chicago but also from places far away. The little one was "adopted" by the whole of Chicago. The credit for his final identification goes to the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor (Bohemian Relief Committee), organized upon the <span class="page-break">\4</span>initiative of the Chief Bailiff of the municipal Court of the City of Chicago, Anton J. Cermak. The little one was finally identified as Vilik Novotny, and as such became the center of interest and attention of our countrymen, who could show their sympathy only to his aged grandmother.</p>
   <p>The representative of this newspaper attended the Thursday night meeting of the committee and made the proposal that the committee make the funeral of Vilik and his whole family its very own affair and conduct it with honors that would go not only to him but to the memory of all who perished in the terrible catastrophe last Saturday. The proposal was given serious consideration and was finally adopted.....</p>
   <p>The funeral was the most elaborate of all those which resulted from the "East-land" disaster....but it was not due to anything we have done. All we did was to make the proposal. All credit goes to Mr. Cermak and his committee, who have done all in their power to make the funeral of little Vilik and his <span class="page-break">\5</span>whole family a most splendid and memorable one.</p>
   <p>The funeral was a royal one indeed. It took place at 2 P.M. in our Bohemian California. In front of the Skola Vojta Naprstek a beautiful catafalque was erected by the undertaking establishment of Mr. Jan Chrastka, of 3410 West 26th Street, in front of which four ornate coffins with the remains of the little one and his sister Marie, with their father and mother on each side, stood in a deluge of flowers. There were flowers all over, in front of the coffins, between them, and towering high behind them, way to the speakers' platform erected for the occasion. The platform, as well as the School building, was profusely decorated by drapes in mourning colors.....</p>
   <p>A most touching act was the placing of an American flag on the bier of the little one. The flag was donated by an organization of American ladies [sic] and placed on the bier on behalf of that organization by Mrs. Georgine Roob of 3234 West Chicago Avenue.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Shortly after 2 P.M. the space in front of the School was closed to general traffic, and the Honorable William Hale Thompson, Mayor of the City of Chicago, appeared in front of the platform; the funeral rites then started.</p>
   <p>The representatives of two of the organizations to which the parents of the little one belonged, the Camp Trocnov, No. 15 of the Cesko-Americti Lesnici A Lesnice (Bohemian-American [men and women] Foresters) and the Spolek Veselych Sousedu A Sousedek (Association of Merry [men and women] Neighbors), were the first speakers. The quartet of the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), supported by singers of the Ceska Ustredni Pevecka Jednota (Federation of Bohemian Singing Societies), sang a beautiful dirge, which was followed by the speech of our own editor, Mr. Albert Jaroslav Havranek, who was asked by the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor to take over this assignment.....</p>
   <p>The following speech was delivered (in English) by Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, <span class="page-break">\7</span>who particularly stressed the point that it is imperative to investigate most thoroughly the causes of the disaster and punish in an exemplary way all those who are, in any way, responsible for it.....</p>
   <p>At the end of his speech he requested Mayor Thompson to address the assembly.</p>
   <p>The Mayor voiced the opinion that this funeral was really the ceremony by which all the victims of the "Eastland" disaster are being honored. He said that a thorough investigation would be made, not in order to avenge those who perished, but in order to prevent a possible recurrence of such a disaster in the future. Finally, he expressed his full recognition and appreciation of the splendid work of the Cesky Vypomocny Vybor which is getting to be known throughout Chicago.....</p>
   <p>The reinforced quartet sang another song, and then the coffins were placed in the hearses. The little one was carried by boy scouts who attended in <span class="page-break">\8</span>large numbers and were led by their instructor and accompanied by their bugle and drum squads, the last being really the ones who started the ceremonies by their eerie and nerve-rending sounds. The coffin of little Marie was carried by school girls, and those of Mr. and Mrs. Novotny by city bailiffs. The procession was led by an automobile occupied by the marshal of the funeral procession, Mr. Cermak,...followed by Mr. Brousek's band, boy band, boy scouts, Sokol youth, school children, the representatives of participating organizations....the clerk of the Probate Court, Mr. John A. Cervenka, Congressman A. J. Sabath, Judge Scully, City Clerk Siman, our Bohemian Alderman, municipal judges, many prominent lawyers and businessmen, and an almost unending procession of guests of the general public.</p>
   <p>The ceremonies were concluded at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery), to which the whole funeral was most expertly and carefully transported by Mr. Chrastka's establishment.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>The most touching speech was delivered by Mr. Cervenka in Bohemian.....</p>
   <p>It may be of some interest to note that it was just six weeks ago yesterday that the Novotnys finished paying off, through Mr. F. J. Petru, their mortgage, and like children they were looking forward to an easier, less care-filled life in their own, unencumbred home, where they would enjoy themselves in the company of their well-behaved and devoted children.</p>
