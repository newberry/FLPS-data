   <p>"In this serious time, we should not forget the meaning of the Red Cross when at leisure or enjoying a good time."From this slogan issued the idea to form an organization which would follow this maxim, not in spirit only, but by action also. This organization calls itself Cesko-Americka Jednota [Bohemian-American Union]. It is a brotherhood made up of young Czech-Americans. It initiated its activities by an affair on a large scale, that is a representative picnic for the Red Cross, which was given in the Pilsen Brewery Park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue, yesterday. The noble purpose prompted large crowds to fill the place.....</p>
   <p>The program was started by Mr. Vaclav Basta, president of the Grand Lodge of the Union, who admonished the assembled members and their guests to do their utmost to help their old homeland. He was followed by Mr. Frank Horky, chairman of the arrangements committee, and by Mr. J. Moravek, vice-president of the Grand Lodge, both of whom spoke in the same trend.....Mr. Moravek <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>stated that a large number of members of the Bohemian-American Union enlisted as volunteers for service in Uncle Sam's Army and Navy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Albert Havraivek, editorial writer of the Denni Hlasatel was the main speaker. In terse sentences, he spoke about the War in which the Serbians, he said, have been the worst sufferers up to this stage of the conflict. America, and other nations are called upon to punish the Germans for the crimes they are committing,and to establish order, so that peace may reign again in the world..... The American Red Cross has saved the lives of thousands, before America entered the War; it is now about to allay the sufferings of our own sons. The Red Cross should, therefore, not be forgotten. It is an honor to the Bohemian-American Union to have arranged this festivity to help the noble enterprise of the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Mueller, who now lectures in the Czech branches of the Red Cross, thanked the gathering for the participation in the Red Cross movement, and the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>sincere sentiment displayed.</p>
   <p>The festivity closed with a ceremonial of giving names to about eighty children. [No information given on kind of names.]</p>
