   <p>On March 17, a jolly evening was spent by the members of the Czech Picture Card Club of Chicago, and of numerous clubs from the country towns and districts, in the big hall of Dvorak Park. The coincidence that St. Joseph's Day ( March 19 ) was only two days ahead heightened the hilarious spirit of the gathering, and all the Josephs and Josephines were toasted and acclaimed with great enthusiasm. There was a colorful program of instrumental and vocal music, supplied by members exclusively, and the audience gave repeated proof of appreciation.</p>
   <p>There is extensive co-operation among these picture card boosters. Any member outside Chicago, who would like to see Chicago need only notify <span class="page-break">2</span>the offices of the club; all the information desired will be gladly given to him through correspondence, and ample accommodations will be offered to him upon his arrival here.</p>
   <p>During the meeting that took place the following day a motion, made jointly by two ladies was carried; it concerned the arrangements of a May festival, part of the proceeds of which are to be denated to the Czech language schools. A committee for this preliminary work for the festival was appointed immediately after.</p>
