   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the directors of the Bohemian Charitable Association was held at eight P. M. on Friday evening. The meeting was presided over by the chairman, Judge Joseph Uhlir. The secretary, Mr. Fuerst, read the minutes of the directors' meeting of October 6. The minutes were approved as corrected. Then followed the reading of communications. Miss Barbora Seffl sent a check for $27, the profits from a card party. The communication was accepted, and it was decided to send Miss Seffl a letter of thanks. The Printing Trades Central Union also remits a contribution of one dollar.</p>
   <p>A letter was received from the theatrical club, Jindrich Mosna, in which they excuse themselves because they did not know that they should have the sanction of the Bohemian Charitable Association in order to give a performance for the benefit of the Association. The performance given was not a success financially, but the players took up a collection among themselves which yielded two dollars, which amount they enclosed. The communication was accepted, and it was resolved to thank the Club for its efforts. Once before, it was suggested to societies which desired to give entertainments, whether they be theatrical performances, concerts, or other forms of entertainment for the benefit of the Bohemian Charitable Association that they should consult with the directors of the Association before making final plans, because it sometimes happens that such humanitarian affairs as sponsored by the Bohemian Charitable Association are harmed more than they are benefited. It would be advantageous and more purposeful if our societies would take into consideration the good work previously done by the Bohemian Charitable Association, and would not arrange individual small theatricals and entertainments, but would jointly support the Association's own dances and entertainments. This would, no doubt, be of more benefit morally and financially.</p>
   <p>The report of the committees was read by the financial secretary, Mr. Turek, and showed disbursements for various office needs, and for the purchase of medicines etc., in the amount of $66,37. The report was approved. The report of the dance committee was read by Mr. Petru, who reported that fourteen thousand tickets and invitations to the affair were distributed.....Receipts for the month amounted to $43.50.</p>
