   <p>The society [of St. Michael Archangel] was organized on September 14, 1888. The founders of the Society were John Chemma, John Szostakowski, John Kaminski, and many others who to this day are members of the organization.</p>
   <p>The object of this society is mutual aid in the form of sick and accident benefits; care of the widows and orphans of the deceased members. At the time the society was organized its other purpose in view was the foundation of a new Polish Catholic Parish, and this was indeed realized on the third birthday of the organization. This parish was established in South Chicago, Illinois in the so-called Warsaw district. The members were mainly instrumental in this accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The church and school which are now under construction and on the verge of <span class="page-break">2</span>completion, were named after St. Michael Archangel, patron of the Society. The pastor, Reverend Adolph Nowicki, who is popular [and] well liked, is revered by the parishioners.</p>
   <p>This is strictly a church society; it does not belong to any other greater organization. The sick benefit is six dollars a week. In the event of death, the family of the deceased member is paid fifty dollars for burial expenses and a two-hundred-dollar death benefit.</p>
   <p>Harmony and unity prevail within the Society, and the administration makes every effort to maintain this atmosphere with good order.</p>
   <p>The current year's administration is as follows: John Szostakowski, president (this being his fourth year); Michael Trafas, vice-president; Michael Godzinski, recording secretary, Francis Swiadek, financial secretary; John Wozniak, treasurer; Walter Przybylinski and Anthony Niewolski, chairmen.</p>

   <p>The control board consists of John Kaminski, Martin Pawelczyk, and John Stolarski.</p>
