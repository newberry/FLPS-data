   <p>At its last meeting, the Executive Committee of the Polish National Alliance accepted a request of the Benevolent Society of Chicago and assigned $25 for that purpose from the current fund. In exchange, the society has sent in, in care of the Executive Committee, a certain number of order forms which, when presented by those in need, will entitle them to some help from that society.</p>
   <p>These orders are in the hands of the Relief Department where also those in need should apply for help from that source.</p>
