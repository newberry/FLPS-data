   <p>Last Saturday, December 31, a meeting of the representatives of various organizations and of the press took place in the auditorium of the Woman's Alliance Building. The meeting was called by the Upper Silesian delegation for the founding and broadening of the activities of the local committee for Upper Silesia. The need for this meeting had become pressing because the Upper Silesian delegation, composed of Captain Grzesik-Hauke and Lieutenant L. Konieczny, is due to leave Chicago in a few days. Captain Grzesik, therefore, as the head of this delegation, desires to leave the Silesian interests in the hands of this citizens' committee and to intrust to the committee further activities on behalf of Silesia.</p>
   <p>To our regret this meeting was not attended by many persons who should have been there. To our surprise we noticed the absence even of the presidents of the organizations the banners of which had been decorated with much ceremony with the Silesian Cross of Merit by the Silesian delegation on its visit to Chicago. The executive officers of these organizations should have attended this meeting, especially since personal invitations had been sent to them. We note this as a characteristic symptom of our conditions.</p>
   <p>(Resume of a short paragraph, a talk by Captain Grzesik)</p>
   <p>Captain Grzesik talked of future action in Upper Silesia for the protection of Poles, materially and ideologically, who are to remain under German domination. Because of the future importance of this land, the fate of some million Poles remaining in German Upper Silesia should not be forgotten. The workers on behalf of Upper Silesia in Poland should keep in close contact and co-operate with similar workers in America "because of the political and material support given by America".</p>

   <p>This work will be of great importance. Recapitulating the talks given by Captain Hauke-Grzesik and Lieutenant Konieczny, we add the following. Both the contending parties are well aware that this matter has not definitely been settled, and that the fight is not over. The present decision of the League of Nations is regarded by Poland as a temporary settlement, to be recognized and accepted, especially since in the final analysis the decision is not unprofitable for us in view of the fact that it returns to us two thirds of the mineral and industrial wealth of the above-mentioned country. But this does not mean that our nation, the Polish people, has forever given up all claim to the land and the population, of which an enormous part consists of those who are just as truly brothers of ours as are those who are returning under the protective wings of the Polish Alma Mater, nor that we shall permit them to remain under German domination, exposed to denationalization and oppression. It is just and right that Poland should not forget her good children in Silesia and should not forsake them. We are sure that consistant efforts will be made to sustain the courage and the patriotic spirit of our brothers in Silesia, and that the undying fire of Polish thought and Polish tradition will be fed in this land temporarily separated from us, so that when the proper time comes, and we are confident that it will come, we can demand what is ours, and our brothers in Silesia will boldly stand forth in solidarity and unity and proclaim before the whole world that they are Poles and are returning to Poland.</p>
   <p>When this takes place, nobody will be able to stop them; nobody will dare to oppose the people's will. The state of the international political situation in Europe is to-day and for a long time will remain such that we are justified in supposing that the opportunity for the Polish demand will present itself sooner or later. The speeches of Captain Grzesik and of Lieutenant Konieczny found a responsive echo in the audience. It was unanimously agreed cordially to support the local Silesisn activities, and the temporary committee was empowered to seek authorization and approval from the office of the Alliance of Insurgents in Silesia to recruit new members and workers. It was further decided to get into direct contact, either personally or by mail, with various Polish organizations and with the press in order to gain the support of these institutions. After the adoption of this resolution the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>We heartily desire to help Poland in this matter. All people of good will, wishing to participate sincerely and effectively in patriotic work...., all loyal, patriotic citizens, should aid Poland and the Poles in Upper Silesia to maintain there their patriotic spirit and should help in the work of which the aim and the object are to regain for Poland the rest of Upper Silesia. We, for our part, shall not cease to call upon people here in America and to urge them in this work, so that a goodly part of our Polonia may take part in this momentous patriotic action.</p>
   <p>We must also mention one more characteristic episode. One of our journalists took part in the discussion and in laborious, diffuse, and complicated language offered a motion to create some stereotyped representative committee, the type that we have been acquainted with these many years, committees which are and have been organizations only on paper and for show but not for effective work. When his plan, the results of which could materialize only after several years, whereas this Silesian question brooks of no delay, was flatly rejected by the audience, this gentleman, infuriated, left the room hurriedly, without even so much as saying good-bye, simply because he was not praised and flattered as he no doubt expected to be. Here is the best evidence of how a selfcentered, conceited, blind ego submits to the will of the majority. Well, well; the work will go on without the help of such personages.</p>
