   <p>Work on the new Polish Catholic hospital has begun. It will be named the "Franciscan Sisters'," and will cost $50,000. This new section will be adjoining the old building located at 365 Ridge Avenue. This became necessary when many patients were seeking admittance to this hospital, but the old structure was not large enough to accommodate these people. This hospital is located on the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
   <p>The biggest share of the funds were donated by Polish Catholic churches in Chicago, the rest was given by well-to-do business men of Evanston.</p>
   <p>During this time the second conference was held in regard to building the new Polish Catholic University of St. Ignatz, which is quietly progressing forward. This is proof that the Polish Catholic people are doing everything possible to expand the Roman-Catholic religion in Chicago and the surrounding towns.</p>
