   <p>From Saint Adalbert's Parish, lottery games for the benefit of Saint Adalbert's church, located at 17th and Paulina Streets, began on August 16, and will last until August 30, every day, except Fridays and Saturdays, at the parish hall. The lottery game ticket is good for the entire season, and is priced at $1.</p>
   <p>The result of last year's lottery for the benefit of the church was satisfactory, for it was sufficient to defray most of the expenses of the new organ. The income of this year's lottery will be used for the exterior and interior decoration of this beautiful temple.</p>
   <p>The purpose is indeed very worthy, and for this reason we hope that the Poles living in Chicago, regardless to what parish they belong, will participate in the lottery by buying as many tickets as they can. In this respect, they <span class="page-break">\2</span>will show their love for the Patron Saint of our Fatherland, Poland, and God will bless their gifts as he miraculously, rewarded the generosity of the Polish king, Boleslaus Chrobry, who ransomed the body of the holy martyr from the pagan Prussians.</p>
