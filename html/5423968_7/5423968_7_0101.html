   <p>Perhaps the most opportune time to join the organization known as the "Polish Army Veterans Alliance of America" is the present, for the central body is holding a membership contest.</p>
   <p>Many of our comrades of the last war are under the impression that they can do more for themselves alone, and for that reason are not taking active part in social affairs--but they err. Life in America has definitely shown that belonging to an organization helps those who are seeking aid. Membership in such organization shows that one cultivates an interest in the affairs of society.</p>
   <p>Our organization was founded, after the return of the soldiers from the Polish armies, for the purpose of preserving military tradition, to promote self-help, and to assist the injured along the road to recovery, so that they may become self-supporting. The society publishes an illustrated monthly magazine which is filled with many interesting articles on military life, as well as with <span class="page-break">\2</span>items of educational import. The members sought are those who have a close and proud attachment to their late army services, for they are the ones who will work energetically to uphold the principles upon which this society was established.</p>
   <p>The membership fees are so nominal that there is no excuse for not joining....Therefore, in order to create a desire to join this organization, our friends are given herewith the day and place of meeting of the various posts, where application blanks for membership may be obtained:</p>
