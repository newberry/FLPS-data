   <p>The central committee of the Polish tag day [recently] decided to exert its efforts to obtain an official permit to collect contributions in the heart of the city of Chicago for two days, namely, on January 23, and January 24, 1915. One of these dates falls on a Saturday, a day on which many people receive pay and do a great deal of shopping. It is therefore a day well suited to bring in a considerable amount of money from those tagged. It was necessary to obtain the approval of the City Council.</p>
   <p>Aldermen Stanley Kunz and C. Petkowski presented the proper motion before the Council at its meeting on January 11, 1915. The motion was carried. The tag day for relief of those suffering want in war-torn Poland is to last for two days and to be extended throughout the whole city, including the Loop.</p>

   <p>The committee for the purchase of containers and badges has decided to order a large quantity of both, namely, three thousand boxes and six hundred thousand badges. The badges are to contain only English inscriptions in order to lessen expenses, since every cent of the contributions must be converted into help for our Motherland. For the same reason the central committee has decided not to order any special printed material. All invitations and announcements of meetings will be made through the newspapers, and only the most extraordinary will be distributed by mail.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm of all Poles for Poland's cause should manifest its real worth during the two tag days. No one need sacrifice his life to save hundreds of our brethern's lives in Poland. An unusual opportunity is presented to manifest sincere civic seal. The Polish Women's Alliance, that magnificent and rapidly developing women's organization, in offering its services summons all its members to apply to their individual groups for the purpose of helping in the tag-day work. The administration of the Polish Women's Alliance will endeavor to make certain that all its affiliated <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>societies will receive the boxes from the organization. Mr. John S. Rybicki, president of Circuit Number Two of the Polish Falcons' Alliance, has declared that his organization is ready [to help]. It is anticipated that the entire local Polish Falcons' Alliance will give a helping hand. The president of the Polish Military Alliance, Mr. F. Porzuczek, assured the central committee of the unlimited co-operation of all uniformed members of the Polish Military Alliance.</p>
   <p>The presidents of all fifteen Chicago Communities of the Polish National Alliance call upon all members of the Alliance, regardless of sex, to co-operate in their respective localities. Let no one wait for any special invitation; let him make application himself or appear at a local meeting. The following meetings will be held: Community Number Three of the Polish National Alliance, in the vicinity of Holy Trinity parish, will hold a special meeting of delegates and citizens of the entire locality on Wednesday, January 13, 1915, at 8 P.M. at the Polish Women's Alliance headquarters. St. Adalbert's parish and vicinity will meet on Wednesday, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>January 13, 1915, at the meeting place of Community Number Two, Pulaski Hall. St. Anne's parish and vicinity will meet in the evening, on the same date in Tabor's hall. St. Hedwig's parish and vicinity will meet on the same day in St. Hedwig's parish hall.
