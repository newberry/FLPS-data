   <p>As you know, dear people, every public institution is governed or abides by certain rules, to which also belong order and welfare. Violating these rules causes disorder and ruin to beneficent institutions. So, then, the Nuns of the Polish Hospital of Nazareth request the public to abide by and obey these orders.</p>
   <p>Let it be known to you, then, dear public, that the hours for visiting the sick are from 2 in the afternoon to 4:30 P. M. every day, and Sunday from 2 P. M. to 5 P. M.; visiting during different hours is by permission only.</p>
   <p>Children under the age of 14 are not admitted to the rooms, because their crying and hollering only disturb the sick. It is not permissible to bring for the sick anything to eat or to drink especially smokes or intoxicating liquors, which very easily and quickly may hinder the sick in their recovery.</p>
   <p>In entering the hospital your shoes should be cleaned of mud. You are not allowed to sit on the beds, only on chairs. Not to talk or laugh aloud. Not to take any possessions from the sick such as towels, books, etc. Not allowed to bring any medicine from home to the sick person without the doctors' permission.</p>

   <p>The sick Catholics who come here to the hospital should, with good intentions, receive confession and the holy communion, and on Sunday or holiday attend mass in the chapel of the hospital, as cleanliness of the soul greatly helps one to regain health.</p>
