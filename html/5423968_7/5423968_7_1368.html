   <p>Many people are without employment at present, haven't anything to eat or clothe themselves with, are even led to suicide. It is very sad when you stop to consider it.</p>
   <p>Out of 150,000 Poles in Chicago a great number of them find themselves in this state, that they are hungry, without clothes and sick.</p>
   <p>We then take upon ourselves the responsibility and organize a "Chicago Aid and Relief Society" for those unfortunate ones. The committee requests those, who are more fortunate, to contribute to this task, as we know you all shall aid us in our work of good will toward destitute persons.</p>
