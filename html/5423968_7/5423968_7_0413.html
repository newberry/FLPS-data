   <p>Last night, in the reception hall of the hospital maintained by the Nazareth Sisters, there were gathered many friends of this establishment, attending the graduation ceremonies of six somen, who will be full-fledged nurses. The Nazareth Sisters were very hospitable. The evening program was a real treat for those present, who greatly enjoyed the singing and music presented them. Miss Hedwig Smulska, as usual, sang, and Miss Xelowska played the violin. Mr.Mallek,a great concert artist, was also present with his violin portraying the beauty of music.</p>
   <p>It was sad for the Polish friends of this Polish hospital to know, that among the six women who received diplomas, there was only one who was Polish from Chicago, Miss Theresa Domer. It is true that the course is difficult, because it demands great sacrifices and cramming. But the profession is sublime, as everyone acknowledges. A greater number of women of other nationalities seem to qualify. Is it because our Polish women are not capable of devoting themselves? Or is it because our Polish women are neither brave nor tender enough to care for the ailing? It seems to be that way. There is a great shortage of Polish nurses, in the only Polish hospital in Chicago. Shall we grieve any longer about this shortage?</p>
   <p>From one of those present. X. T.</p>
