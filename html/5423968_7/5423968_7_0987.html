   <p>Through the efforts of the Women's Association of Commerce of the United States of America, an evening party of 'stars' was held on March 4th in the Chicago Theatre, at 8th and Wabash Avenue.</p>
   <p>One half of the profit from this entertainment was intended for war victims in Poland. In spite of the fact that one half profit was intended for the hungry war victims in Poland and continuous advertising in newspapers, the public did not respond as it was expected.</p>
   <p>The program was very well composed. It opened up with everybody singing the Star Spangled Banner and "God Save Poland." After that Mrs. Florence King, president of the Women's Association of Commerce of the United States of America, spoke, outlining the need of women uniting, so as to carry on the work needed during the present war and help democracy toward a final victory. She also remarked that America is very much <span class="page-break">\2</span>duty-bound in regard to the Poles, not only for the help during the revolution when America fought for independence, but likewise at present, when the Poles are the most loyal citizens of this country.</p>
   <p>"Poland," said Mrs. King, "is next after Belgium in suffering during the present war and is entitled to be given help. The present war," she said, "will end in victory and Poland will become free and independent."</p>
   <p>Next the Filaret Choir, under the direction of Mr. Rybowiak, sang two compositions of Pastuszek and the "Last Mazur." It also received well earned laurels; the public applauded the singers for a long time.</p>
   <p>After that, Miss Anetta C. Severin, with piano accompaniment by Miss Gardner, sang two English songs: "In Flander's Fields," and "When the Boys Come Home." She sang well. Miss Nettie McPerson, in a Scotch costume, danced a few Scotch dances and played on the bagpipe, a Scotch instrument.</p>

   <p>Next, Mrs. Smulski, accompanied on the piano by Mrs. F. Smietanka, sang the "Wishes of a Girl," by Chopin, and the "Serenade," by Niewiadomski.</p>
   <p>Francesco Daddi, well known opera singer, sang "Serenata Mediovale," and "L'Ultima Canzone."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Zebrowski, accompanied on the piano by Mrs. Czapek, miraculously played on the violin the "Carnival Rousse," by Wieniawski and "The Barcarole," by McMillen.</p>
   <p>The school children, dressed in Cracovian costumes, danced fairly well the "Krakowiak," They were rewarded with applause.</p>
   <p>Next, during a speech by Miss Emily Napieralski, a group of Polish young ladies arranged themselves on the stage in national costumes and the school children in Cracovian costumes. This group presented itself very <span class="page-break">\4</span>beautifully. The public on the rise of the curtain did not stint any applause.</p>
   <p>Miss Napieralski spoke very well, assuring that the Polish women, just the same as all the Poles, are loyal to America and are ready for all sacrifices for democracy and liberty of the nations. She remarked that the winning of the present war depends on the American women and that it is the duty of women to save and work in order to be victorious, in order to crush the Prussian autocracy and oppression.</p>
   <p>The orchestra under the direction of Frank W. Andrews, played "Polish Flowers," and the march, "Echo from Poland."</p>
   <p>At the conclusion the Dawn and Filaret choirs, under the direction of Mr. Bybowiak, sang the march "Free Poland," by Rybowiak. This march really made a very good impression on the Americans who, being directly enthused with same, did not spare any applause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It seemed the applause would never cease.</p>
   <p>At the leaving of the theater the orchestra, under the direction of Frank W. Andrews, played this very same march, and many of the American public remained, so as to hear it again and only when it ended did they leave the theater.</p>
   <p>From the favorable attitude shown by the American audience, it may be judged that our Polish artists gave a splendid performance. The national costumes, in no less degree, were liked. Talks about them could be heard among the public. The ladies in costumes benefited also by selling to the Americans many small flags.</p>
