   <p>These words are heard often at the meetings and one can also see them in our newspapers and we don't deny there is a lot of truth and sense in them and that all of us should live up to this maxim. But many things advertised as Polish in actuality are not Polish. This is so with the so-called Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Chicagowski is continuously advertising that the "Polish Hospital" is equipped examplarily and according to the latest and best requirements for the care of the sick. We agree with the Dziennik Chicagowski as far as the building itself and the installations are concerned but we differ when it comes to the most important matter, the purpose for which the building was erected.</p>
   <p>The Polish public who helped to erect this fine edifice as well as the exteemed patrons are justified in having a grievance with the management of the hospital for if Poles foot the bills they also have the right to demand of the management to entrust Polish patients to the care of Polish doctors and not to leave them exclusively in the hands of German and American physicians without any knowledge of the Polish language.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Every sick Pole, be it man or woman, who needs hospital care, has a sacred duty to go to the Polish hospital but how can they do this when in this Polish hospital one could not find a Polish physician even with a lantern. One can not reveal the secret and intimate sides of the sickness to a doctor who doesn't understand the language of the patient.</p>
   <p>Also the hospital that was built with the hard-earned money of Poles and that is supposed to be a pride of the Polish community in Chicago should have on its staff the majority of Polish physicians, of whom we have a great many in our city.</p>
   <p>We want to say emphatically that we have not labored in order that only the strangers might benefit from it.</p>
