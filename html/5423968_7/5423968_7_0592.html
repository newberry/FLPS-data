   <p>The affair of erecting a Polish orphanage seems to be under way. Architects have sent us sketches of this structure; none of them as yet have been approved.</p>
   <p>The committee formed by this orphanage has chosen a place for the building on the Northwest Side of the Resurrection Cemetery. The committee will meet as soon as the matter of incorporation is settled.</p>
   <p>Many contributions have been received for this institution. No one will regret their offer toward this aim. The children who were once deprived of a shelter in a Polish institution were spoiled in institutions of other nationalities. They now shall find comfort and good care in this future Polish orphanage.</p>
