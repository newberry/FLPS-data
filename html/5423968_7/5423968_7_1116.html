   <p>The British government has indicated its willingness to make proper arrangements for relief measures in Poland, if Germany and Austria will cease removing food from Poland, and this is an entirely fair condition. Great Britain will agree to terms under which the supplies can be imported into the devastated region.</p>
   <p>The German and Austrian governments can hardly fail to accept this offer and we hope the necessary formalities will be disposed of with the least possible delay.</p>
   <p>The British government has acted with commendable humanity and it is to be hoped that Berlin or Vienna will not be behind in this cause. Experienced Americans will be in charge of the relief work, which is a guaranty that it will be accomplished conscientiously and without undue red tape.</p>
   <p>The case of the Poles is desperate. No time should be lost in extending them such aid as we can give them. Rich and fortunate America should give lavishly and promptly.</p>
