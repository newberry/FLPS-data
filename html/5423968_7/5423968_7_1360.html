   <p>At last night's meeting of the Polish citizens of the Sixteenth Ward, called by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, and Victor Bardonski and Leon Szopinski, there were discussions relative to organizing a welfare association which would look after the needs of the poor Polish families of the Sixteenth Ward who require assistance from the county relief agent, and also to offer assistance to individuals.</p>
   <p>The following persons took part in the discussions: the Reverend Barzynski, F. Bieszki, Mr. Ptaszynski, L. Szopinski, A. Rudnicki, and others.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously agreed that such an organization was needed for the welfare of the Polish people of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>A committee was chosen whose duties will be to make arrangements with the county relief agent, devise means to get donations, etc. The committee is made <span class="page-break">\2</span>up of the following individuals: the Reverend V. Barzynski, F. Bieszki, L. Szopinski, A. Rudnicki, Peter Kiolbassa, W. Bardonski, J. Polozynski, F. Murkowski, M.  A. LaBuy, T. Krolik, T. Gordon, F. Ostrowski, Casimir Neuman, John Arkuszewski, A.

   <p>Those present at the meeting made donations amounting to $32.25. The meeting was postponed until February 5. A list of the contributors will be made in a later issue.</p>
   <p>At the close of the regular meeting the committee remained to organize into a more solid unit. The following officers were elected to head it: Peter Kiolbassa, president; W. Bardonski, vice-president; F. Bieszki, treasurer; and T. Gordon, secretary.</p>
   <p>From the measures adopted at the meeting, an appeal will be made up and published <span class="page-break">\3</span>in the Dziennik Chicagoski. It will be directed primarily to the Poles of the Sixteenth Ward. The aims of the Welfare Society of this ward will also be made known.</p>
   <p>The contents of the appeal will be decided upon at the next meeting to be held by the committee, which will probably be on January 29. The appeal will be published on the following day.</p>
   <p>As a result of this meeting we have a new welfare organization.</p>
   <p>May God favor the activities of this group which was established by people of good will.</p>
