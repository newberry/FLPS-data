   <p>It is known to the public that the Brothers Youth Organization of St. Joseph and the Sisters Rosary Society of St. Stanislaus proposed after the Christmas holidays a bazaar to raise funds for the Polish Orphans' Home in Avondale.</p>
   <p>After checking the books the figures show a gross income of $1117.85, the expenses amounted to $327.06, which left a sum of $790.79 for the orphans.</p>
   <p>We are taking this opportunity to thank all the people for their splendid support given in behalf of the orphans. May God bless their kind hearts.</p>
