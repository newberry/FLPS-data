   <p>A benefit play, "Jaselka" (Crib--a christmas play based on the birth of Christ), was staged last night before a capacity crowd at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Hall. The play was arranged by the Sisters of Nazareth and the proceeds are to go toward the support of the Polish Hospital. As noted from the applause, the play was a success.</p>
