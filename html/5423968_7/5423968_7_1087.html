   <p>From the tenth to the twentieth of January, 1917, a great Allied Bazaar will be held under the auspices of a committee consisting of the most prominent local American citizens and representatives of all the nations most greatly affected by the present disastrous war in Europe. The entire proceeds from the Bazaar will be used to relieve the suffering of war victims. Such bazaars, conducted heretofore in all larger American communities, have yielded great profits. An Allied Bazaar which closed in New York not long ago brought in one and a half million dollars. A similar bazaar which just closed in Detroit brought the local relief committee several hundred thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Chicago, in population the second largest city in the United States, and rich beyond compare, undoubtedly will not be outdone by New York.</p>
   <p>Through the Polish Central Relief Committee, the local Polonia is asked to participate and, as a result, will share in the proceeds--to be divided among the various nationalities in proportion to the numerousness of each.</p>
   <p>Countrymen! We cannot imagine a better opportunity of gaining with relatively small effort a large sum--tens or perhaps even hundreds of thousands of dollars--for the relief of the unfortunate people in our homeland. It would be criminal negligence on our part not to take advantage of this opportunity, thus to condemn thousands of men, women, and children of Poland to starvation.</p>
   <p>We appeal then, in the first place, to the administrations of all organizations, such as the Polish National Alliance and its Women's Division, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish National Council, the Union of Polish Priests, the Polish Women's Alliance, the [Polish] Alma Mater, the Polish Falcons' Alliance Circuit II, and the Polish Businessmen's Association; further, we appeal to all the [Polish] pastors and to all organizations engaged in relief work, such as the Clothing Committee, the Association of Mothers for Children, and the Young Women's Circle for Girls; finally, we appeal to all the community groups belonging to the large organizations, such as the Polish National Alliance Communes, the Polish Roman Catholic Union's Settlements, and the girls' clubs existing in the Polish parishes of Chicago and vicinity. The purpose is to organize a committee on the broadest possible scale to arrange for a Polish section at the Allied Bazaar. In order to apportion the work that needs to be done, the above-mentioned organizations are asked to send their representatives to the meeting that will be held at eight o'clock on Tuesday, December 12, at the Polish Women's Alliance Building, 1309 North Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>There is very little time left for work--a little less than four weeks. The first steps have already been taken by a group of public-spirited women who, fully understanding the great importance of this matter, organized themselves on the spur of the moment and set themselves energetically to work. It is high time that Chicago's Polonia unite to lend a hand in this work, which will dry the tears of millions of mothers and children in our homeland, and which will reveal us to be a cultured and united community, conscious of its national and social duties, in the eyes of the people of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>We request that the Polish press of Chicago support this event until the time of its close--for who, after all, is better qualified to reach the hearts of the public than those who, by their calling, are accustomed to appealing to the emotions of that public? Let everyone throw in his little stone, and an edifice worthy of the three hundred thousand Polish people in Chicago will arise.</p>
   <p>We ask that the administrations of organizations, as well as individual groups, regard this appeal as a formal invitation, for, because of the shortage of time and the lack of certain addresses, it has been impossible to send out individual invitations.</p>
