   <p>The difficulties encountered in the efforts to establish the Polish Hospital are well known to us. Thanks to the indefatigable efforts of the Nazareth Sisters and to the support of a score or more of faithful citizens, we now have the Polish Hospital, which is a great benefit to the Poles of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Funds which have thus far supported the hospital are now insufficient. Large sums of money are needed to keep this institution functioning, and, as has been reported in Dziennik Chicagoski, donations have been very meager. Conditions are getting so that it is practically impossible to purchase even vital necessities. It is my opinion that the fault does not lie so much with the Polish public as with the Nazareth Sisters, that is, with the administration of the hospital.</p>
   <p>Nuns from the German convent canvass the Polish neighborhoods each month for <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>funds for their hospitals, from which we do not benefit. No one denies them support but offers whatever is possible. Why should we support the hospitals of other nationalities when our own is in dire need?</p>
   <p>I am quite certain that if the same policy were pursued by our nuns not one of the Polish persons contacted would refuse to make some kind of contribution. In this way the barren treasury of the Polish Hospital could always be strengthened with such monthly collections, thereby assuring the continuation of this institution.</p>
   <p>Many Polish citizens are also wondering why the Sisters of Nazareth do not make a house-to-house contact for funds like the German nuns do. It is a well-known saying among the Poles that "The shirt is closer to the body than the coat," and I am convinced that if our Polish nuns would energetically undertake this periodic canvassing for funds the results would be more than gratifying.</p>

   <p>As to the method of collecting the funds and the control of them, this is entirely up to the Nazareth Sisters. I am quite certain that no one will deny them a few pennies for this worthy cause.</p>
