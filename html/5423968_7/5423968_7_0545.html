   <p>The idea of building a Polish Hospital in Chicago for women and children, which was initiated by the Sisters of Nazareth, has not been abandoned but is proceeding forward.</p>
   <p>To gather funds for this purpose the Sisters have decided to arrange a Fair or Prize Lottery, and a group of helpful citizens have decided to support this affair as energetically as possible.</p>
   <p>A meeting was held yesterday, December 10, to consider arrangements for the fair, at which Mr. Albert Jenorzejek acted as chairman and Mr. B. Klarkowski as secretary.</p>
   <p>A temporary committee, composed of Mr. J. Gorny, Thomas Krolik, and B. Klarkowski, was chosen to carry out this work.</p>
   <p>The next meeting to consider this important matter will be held on December 22.</p>
