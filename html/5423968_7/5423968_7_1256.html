   <p>Mr. J. F. Smulski, president of the Polish Bank has received, as is already known, a cablegram from the American consulate at Warsaw, which announces the establishment of a Polish-American hospital in Warsaw and asks both the Poles and the Americans for help immediately. We are including the text of the cablegram:</p>
   <p>J. F. Smulski:</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Million Poles on battlefield--thousands wounded. Establishing Polish-American hospital; ask you and your wife to organize committees to appeal to Poles and Americans for financial aid necessary immediately! Propose sending money through Department of State. Cable S. Szucha.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Jerzy [George]Sosnowski</p>

   <p>This cablegram was received yesterday. A million Polish men are in the fighting lines, thousands of them have fallen, many thousands are wounded. At whose hands? At the hands of their own brothers. They are not fighting against a common enemy. They are not fighting like the sons of Belgium, who are sacrificing their lives for their country in order to prove the courage of their nation; or like the sons of France, who die to avenge the Prussian invasion and to save France; or like the sons of Serbia, who die fighting the detested Austrians; or like the young men of England, who by dying for the honor of Great Britain give proof of their loyalty to their country; or like the son of Russia who dies for his batiushka and the holy Russian church, or even like the German boy who dies to add glory and flash to the banners of the Hohenzollerns.</p>
   <p>No, Polish youths die because the uniform of the oppressor and enemy has been forced upon them. A Pole in a Russian uniform has no quarrel with a Pole marching under the German or the Austrian flag. He feels no loyalty towards his ruler and owes him no service. What service he gives is forced. He <span class="page-break">\3</span>fights and kills, but the cause is foreign to him. If he destroys his brothers and wins the battle, he will win it for his oppressor. If he falls on the battlefield at the hand of his brother, he will lie in an ignominious grave.</p>
   <p>On French soil, he fights in the Prussian uniform against his true friends. He fights on the side of those who robbed his country. On the Russian, the Austrian, and the Prussian borders, he fights and dies on the land of his fathers, on the battlefields where hundreds of years ago they defended European civilization from the onslaught of the Moslem, on the battlefields where Kosciusko and other brave patriots fought against three annexers and for several years gave battle to and enemy ten times stronger than they; on the land where Jan Sobieski defended Austria from the revenge of the Turks. The battle today is different: it is not the Turk or the Mongolian--everlasting enemies of civilization and Christianity--who is striking at his breast; it is his own brother dressed in the uniform of an enemy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Whence this horrible dream? What satan has called it forth with hellish conjuring? Certainly it is not the God of the German Emperor, who gives him victory. It is not the God of the Austrian Emperor who wishes William as an ally, since God is the worst of all William's enemies. Neither can it be the God of the Tsar, who is calling upon his army of millions to defend holy Russia.</p>
   <p>This is not a dream. This is a reality. There is no God of Poland. A million of her sons have gone to war. Death mows them down in the fighting ranks. Perhaps, unknown to them, Fate wishes that they should die--die at the hands of other Poles, in different uniforms. They have died without honor or mourning, in the defense of their enemies, they have died for the thieves of their homes, the murderers of their children and women, they have died for the glory of the Hohenzollern dynasty, to strengthen the house of Hapsburg, to glorify the autocracy of the Romanovs.</p>
   <p>Such is God's will. They cannot retreat, they cannot put up their arms. They must send murderous shots at the distant enemy, with the ache in their hearts, <span class="page-break">\5</span>that they might hit and kill a brother. They cannot all die: many must go on living to bear the brand of fratricide and suffer the reproaches of their companions at arms.</p>
   <p>Many thousands have fallen wounded and will continue to fall. It is for them that the appeal from across the sea is made. This appeal comes from the country where the bloodiest battles have been fought and will continue to be fought, from the country which has no part in the quarrel but nevertheless gives its fields and valleys to destruction and its sons to butchery, from the country has lain in ruins for a century and a half, robbed of its possessions, a country without happiness, without hope, plunged in sadness and disgrace, deserted and destroyed.</p>
   <p>A Polish-American hospital has been organized for the children of this nation. An appeal for help comes to America. Let the honorable Americans--many of whom have gained their wealth through the toil of loyal laborers who are brothers of those Poles on the battlefield--ask themselves whether the Poles <span class="page-break">\6</span>are worthy of aid. If so, let them show their generosity.</p>
   <p>All contributions and subscriptions will be sent to the American Embassy in Russia and will be used honestly. Contributions must be sent in care of Charles C. Dawes, who is president of the Central Trust Company of Illinois and the treasurer of the committee.</p>
