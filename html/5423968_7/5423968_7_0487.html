   <p>The articles published in our paper about the Polish Hospital were evidently timely. They found a ready response in the hearts of our compatriots.</p>
   <p>As proof of this, we quote the following letter, which was received at the Hospital, along with a two-dollar donation.</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Feb. 20, 1896.</p>
   <p>"To The Venerable Sisters of Nazareth:</p>
   <p>"Please accept this small contribution for the Polish Hospital. I hope many other Polish hearts are moved by the article in the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>"J. N."</p>

   <p>We also hope that the hospital will receive hundreds of similar letters and donations.</p>
