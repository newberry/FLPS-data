   <p>"At the executive meeting of the Polish Central Relief Committee on December 9, representatives of the Polish National Alliance announced that in view of the gravity of the situation in Poland, their national treasury center had assigned fifteen thousand dollars to be sent through the Polish Central Relief Committee at once for the relief of those most in need of it.

   <p>"The Polish Central Relief Committee has investigated the safest means of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sending the contributions of the Polish-Americans abroad so that they will surely reach their destinations.
