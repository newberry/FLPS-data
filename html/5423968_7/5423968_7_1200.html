   <p>Only twelve days separate us from the day on which, according to ancient custom, we all gather at the table in order not only to share the good things which providence has bestowed upon us and to exchange presents, but to exchange good wishes and comfort each other in adversity and misfortune, in the hope that better times will be proclaimed by Him who came upon the earth to straighten out all quarrels and disharmony, to raise the valleys and lower the hills.</p>
   <p>This is a holiday for everyone. It was the custom of our forefathers [on this day] to take the poorest and most forlorn into their homes and feed them. This was to show the great Christian love, proclaimed and spread by Him who was born on that memorable night filled with the songs and rejoicing of the angels. We have inherited this custom from our fathers and we endeavor to follow it in our daily lives wherever we can.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Year after year all sorts of charitable societies appeal to our generous hearts and ask for contributions in order that the poorest children may have a Christmas dinner. They want to show that ancient Polish hospitality still exists among us, that imbued with this great ancient Polish spirit--open and sincere--we cannot bear to look upon the hunger and destitution of neighbors, particularly when these neighbors are our brothers.</p>
   <p>If in former years we were not ungenerous in giving to the poor, if in former years we tried to make their Christmas a pleasant one, this year we should do it all the more willingly and all the sooner.</p>
   <p>Let us remember that now a horrible tragedy is taking place in Europe, such as the world has never seen before, and perhaps will never see again. Let us remember that over there millions of people are deprived of the things most indispensable to life, Let us remember that over there on Polish soil horrible battles have been fought for the past five months, that our people, deprived of their homes, are forced to wander about from place to place in foreign lands <span class="page-break">\3</span>where there is no one to look after them. Let us remember that thousands of our villages have been razed to the ground, and that our people will have to spend this night on which our Savior was born, hiding in snow-covered fields, dying of hunger, cold, cholera, typhoid and other diseases.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance, by decree of the administrative board, created the department of independence and has so far collected about twenty-seven thousand dollars from Alliance members alone. The board has decided to cable fifteen thousand through the Polish Central Relief Committee, in order to assuage, at least a little the sufferings of our wandering brethren, and to remind the world that Poles in America are mindful of their brothers and always hasten to give as much aid as they are able.</p>
   <p>But we members of the Alliance should also be interested in something else; we must not allow ourselves ever to be last. We want to compete honorably with other organizations and demonstrate that before Christmas we can send twenty-five thousand dollars to Europe.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Can we do it? Yes, because it depends solely on us. Let us now show that we can act when we want to, and let us hurry, so that no one will get ahead of us. In the first place we call on all the groups and communes of the Polish National Alliance, and all relief committees, to send in at once the money which they have collected, and to continue collecting energetically.</p>
   <p>They can be sure the Alliance is not neglecting this matter, but is sending the money at once to the relief committees in Galicia, the Kingdom of Poland. Vienna, Bohemia, and Moravia, where many refugees from Galicia have sought shelter, and where they are suffering terrible poverty.</p>
   <p>There is no time for deliberations. He who gives at once gives twice. In accordance with this old adage we should give at once in order that it may not be too late. There is no time for persuasion and appeals; the time is short. Today every member of the Alliance, man and woman--every one--should give up at least one pleasure in order to help the hungry.</p>
   <p>To work then, brothers and sisters of the Alliance!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Let us show that we will be second to none. Let contributions flow freely next week for those who await the advent of the Lord on foreign soil--for those who have no place of their own to shelter them, who will be shivering in fields and woods, in pits and ditches, on Christmas Eve, when light and mercy flow down upon the earth. To work! We will reach our goal and possibly be able to dry more than one tear.</p>
