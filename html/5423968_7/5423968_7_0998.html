   <p>The great services which the American Red Cross has rendered to humanity, and still renders to the whole world in these difficult and bloody times, will cause that institution to be remembered forever. While the war continues unabating in Europe, the eyes of the whole world are upon America. The world well knows the true American heart, and it knows the hearts of those who came to this country to enjoy the freedom and the just laws which the militaristic and autocratic governments of Europe denied them.</p>
   <p>The American Red Cross has extended its helping hand as far as it can under present difficult conditions--in Belgium, in Serbia, in Poland, in Italy, and in France. The activity of this great American institution in these countries is directed toward prevention of the spread of contagious diseases, caring for the wounded men, and teaching various trades to crippled soldiers. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>American Red Cross also tries to exert a moral influence on the soldiers. The Red Cross has established canteens for soldiers behind the battle lines, in which they can always find refreshing drinks, where they can rest, where they can receive books and newspapers to read, and where they can get plenty to eat.</p>
   <p>How much this moral aid means to the soldier who leaves the trenches can be understood only by one who has seen the weary men leaving the battle front for a short period.</p>
   <p>Next May, a campaign to raise a hundred million dollars for the Red Cross will begin. The Red Cross has turned to the Poles in America with a special appeal that they contribute to help this great institution render the above-mentioned services.</p>
   <p>There is probably no country on earth that suffered as much as did Poland, but then America came adequately to the aid of this unfortunate land.</p>

   <p>President Wilson has stated his position in regard to Poland and our nation's cause on many occasions. In its report of November 28, 1917, the American Red Cross said:</p>
   <p>"The American Red Cross, concerned with the fate of the Polish people behind the German battle front, and equally concerned with the fate of the Polish infants and children who are facing death by starvation, allots $200,000 of the fund collected in America for immediate payment. This money will be divided into two payments of $100,000 each, of which the first will be paid in November of this year, and the second in December, to the Polish Committee in Warsaw, at whose head are Prince Z. Lubomirski and Archbishop Kakowski.</p>
   <p>"The present generation in Poland faces death by starvation. An appeal has come to the American Red Cross for food supplies such as were distributed in Belgium. The above-mentioned donation of $200,000 had as its aim only immediate relief of the situation. If the necessary funds are available, the American Red Cross will supply milk and food to the people of Poland and especially to the Polish children."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Since the American Red Cross puts the question in this manner, the Poles in America ought to understand what sort of work this great institution is doing, and should hasten to aid in the coming $100,000,000 campaign, of which fund a substantial part will be used to relieve the critical situation in Poland.</p>
