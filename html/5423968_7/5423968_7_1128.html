   <p>Poland has hitherto been the principal theater, object, and victim of the present war.</p>
   <p>The line of battle extends nearly 650 miles between the Mazurian Lakes and the Carpathian Passes, the two extreme limits of the country inhabited by Poles. It goes through the whole Kingdom of Poland and Galicia, an area of more than 80,000 square miles, with a population of 21 millions. In this territory about 3 millions of Austro-Germans and 4 millions of Russians are fighting each other. These 7 million soldiers have been for more than six months treading down and tearing up in turn the Polish land and starving and exterminating its inhabitants.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In this war which is raging on their territory and ruining it the Poles are obliged to fight in two opposite camps and for a cause which is not their own. They must engage in fratricidal strife, set by both sides in the first line of battle. Polish soldiers very often kill one another in a bayonet charge. Moreover, they undergo recruiting on an exceedingly severe scale. No delay or exemption from military service is accorded to them as it is granted to the central provinces of the belligerent states and especially to the great towns and to certain important branches of production. On the contrary, they are submitted to a most rigorous system of conscription, used in frontier districts in order to evacuate in time all the conscripts who could be taken by the enemy.</p>
   <p>The Poles hitherto have furnished all together a million and a half of soldiers almost equally divided between the Russian and the Austro-German armies. Up to this time 400,000 of them have been lost--killed, wounded, or taken prisoners.</p>
   <p>The Kingdom of Poland includes 10 provinces and 51,000 square miles with 13 million of inhabitants. The area directly affected by the war includes 40,000 <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>square miles, with a population of 10 million people. The two largest and richest provinces except Warsaw, Lublin and Piotrkow, as well as Kielce, Radom, Plock, Kalisz, and the greater part of Warsaw and Lomza, have been devastated from end to end.</p>
   <p>Everywhere the tide of fighting has repeatedly overrun Poland. It has submerged about 200 towns and 9,000 villages. The material damage amounts to more than 3 billion francs. Five thousand of these villages were razed to the ground, either in battle or to halt pursuit in retreating. Innumerable country houses and farms have been burned; more than a hundred churches have been pulled down; more than a thousand are badly damaged. All the stores of corn and forage have been seized or destroyed. A million horses and two million cattle have been taken for the armies or have perished for lack of pasture.</p>
   <p>Even the bare earth has been ravaged by the digging of endless trenches, and by the explosion of heavy shells the fertile soil has been blown away or buried under clay and gravel, and even the richest districts of Lublin and Radom have <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>long been deprived of their productiveness. Ruin has come equally upon the peasant population and upon the great landowners who have lost large investments. The whole of the agricultural production, valued at 2 1/2 billion francs a year, has been entirely stopped for a long time by lack of seed and cattle. A rural population of 7 millions is therefore reduced to beggary. A very large proportion of those whose villages, in the zone of fire, have been burned down are quite homeless; dying of hunger and cold, feeding on roots, bark, and carrion, they roam through woods or shelter themselves in abandoned towns. Three quarters of the towns are in the midst of the operations of war. Some cities like Kalish, of 50,000 inhabitants, have been destroyed; [among these ruined cities] are great industrial centers, such as Czenstohowa and Sasnowice, of 80,000 each; Lody has twice been captured, and a terrible financial crisis followed. The capital of Poland, Warsaw, with a population of one million, nearly twice as populous as Brussels or Rome, has also been sorely tried by being constantly threatened with capture, overwhelmed by aerial bombardment, and cut off from the wealthiest western districts of the country.</p>
   <p>The means of communication have ceased to exist; upwards of a thousand miles of railway have been <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>torn away, and the stations and bridges blown up; even the highroads are plowed over. The coal pits of Dombrowa, supplying the whole country, were lost at the very beginning of the war; the mines were blown up or flooded.</p>
   <p>Instead of getting, as it usually does, 30,000 wagonloads of coal every month, the country receives barely 100 wagonloads from the distant coal pits of Donetz. All the factories have stopped work; many are badly damaged; a hundred very important plants have been destroyed. The total industrial production, amounting to more than 2 billion francs yearly, has been ruined, and 400,000 workmen are now without means of subsistence. Together with the multitude of artisans and tradesmen deprived, along with their families, of any earnings, the great majority of the townsmen, 3 millions in number, are destitute. Many die of hunger; others have been obliged to flee, principally from smaller towns, to Warsaw or farther on east in a state of utter distress.</p>
   <p>Everywhere famine and epidemic diseases spread--typhus, fever, dysentery, especially among children because of the total lack of milk, and imported <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>cholera. Moreover, the hospitals are crowded with wounded, and medicaments, chiefly of foreign production, are lacking. Galicia (Austrian Poland) includes 82 districts with an area of 32,000 square miles and a population of 8 millions. With the exception of Cracow and the six adjoining districts, an area of 2000 square miles with 750,000 inhabitants, it has been throughout the seat of war. The 17 eastern districts, 6,000 square miles, with a population of 11/2 millions, have been occupied since the beginning of the war. But the rest of the country, where the great operations of war have occurred, 25,000 square miles with 6 million inhabitants, has suffered much more.</p>
   <p>In general, all the calamities brought about by the war, such as destruction, famine, sickness, and death, which have afflicted the Kingdom of Poland, have also befallen Galicia.</p>
   <p>Finally, on the extreme limits of Poland there were the 300,000 Polish Mazurs of the Lake Plain of East Prussia who have twice borne the heaviest disasters of war. There are further the 200,000 Polish mountaineers upon the Hungarian <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>frontier who have twice been overrun by invasion. And last, there are the 250,000 Polish inhabitants of the Bialystok in the Province of Grodno who have suffered the same evils.</p>
   <p>Poland, the great ancient state among civilized nations, tormented incessantly for the last century and a half, has now been plunged without any fault of her own into the deepest misery of a universal war. In a territory nearly equal to that of England and Scotland and more populous than Spain this happy and industrious people of so strong a vitality has suddenly been deprived of all its means of subsistence and condemned to the most terrible sufferings, almost to extinction, by the faults of others.</p>
   <p>Such a misfortune, combined with such an injustice, is without parallel in modern history. Nevertheless, in the face of so appalling a tragedy, the world seems unmoved.</p>
   <p>It is certainly not for want of compassion but for lack of exact information <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>on the true state of affairs in Poland. The undersigned Committee in bringing this information to the civilized world believes that it is doing its duty not only to the cause of its country but to the conscience of humanity.</p>
