   <p>The undersigned cordially invite the Polish businessmen of Chicago to attend a meeting, and discuss ways and means of helping the destitute Poles of Nebraska, who are suffering great hardships, according to the recent letter of appeal for help from Reverend W. Sebastyanski.</p>
   <p>Large contributions will not be requested, for the committee realizes that this is impossible during the present hard times. Small sums in large numbers can bring relief to our unfortunate compatriots.</p>
   <p>This meeting of benevolence is to take place Wednesday, March 13, at 7:30 P. M. in the back hall of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. All are requested to attend.</p>
