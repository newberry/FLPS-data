   <p>On January 6, the auditing commission completed its work and prepared a very commendatory report on the fruitful work of the Sons of Freedom, and acknowledged as honest, conscientious, and harmonious, the work of the entire administration [for 1917]. It is no small triumph to gather five hundred sons of Poland to the Polish National Alliance standard--it is a great deed, a dream that even the boldest did not believe would materialize. Yet, it is now an accomplished fact. No wonder, then, that every member is filled with joy; it is in itself a stimulus to further effort.</p>
   <p>We have confidence in our hearts and hope shines on our horizon, but we are not resting on our laurels; we continue to increase our efforts.....For we cannot sleep now, we cannot hesitate in our organizational work; the greater <span class="page-break">2</span>the glory, the greater our joy, but our duties and responsibilities increase also. Today, we are a large group, and it is easier to recruit members, easier to convince those who are as yet unattached. To action, then!</p>
   <p>The growth of our society and the state of its treasury for the year 1917 are revealed in the following data:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Number of members at the close of the year 1916</td>
     <td>398.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Number of members at the close of 1917</td>
     <td>501.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Funds in treasury at the conclusion of 1916</td>
     <td>$4,440.95.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Funds in treasury at the conclusion of 1917</td>
     <td>$5,090.48.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>These figures speak for themselves on whether a society can become stronger or more firmly established, and whether a member can expect aid when necessary. Do not delay, then, countrymen, but join as soon as possible.</p>
