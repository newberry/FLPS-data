   <p>Two neighboring parishes--St. Stanislaus Kostka and Holy Trinity--have combined their efforts to present a play, Sunday, February 10, for the benefit of the Polish Hospital. Free use of Polish Hall is part of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish's contribution, while the Holy Trinity Parish has offered the services of its Theatrical Circle.</p>
   <p>The play "Mecenas Chlopski" (Peasant Lawyer) will be presented at eight o'clock in the evening. The proceeds will go toward the Polish Hospital. In the name of compassion, all the parishioners of both parishes are requested to attend this performance. By supporting this event, the Polish people will support the Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: No further information concerning this performance appears in later issues of Dziennik Chicagoski.]</p>
