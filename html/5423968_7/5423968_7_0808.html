   <p>Members of the Polish Sokol Society, Unity, have in their possession a title to several lots in the neighborhood of St. Casimir's parish. Plans have been made by them to erect a Polish Home for the benefit of the Polish people of the parish. The lots are clear of debt. All that is needed is enough capital to start building.</p>
   <p>Because of a shortage of funds to start work on this project, the members have agreed to contact all local societies for support. Notices were sent out several days ago. However, no responses were made.</p>
   <p>Since no one has come to the aid of this society, the members dropped the plan, and have proposed to sell the lots. Those interested in purchasing these lots are requested to get in touch with the society any Friday evening at Kurland's hall, 2954 West 25th Street.</p>
