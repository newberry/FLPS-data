   <p>Tears well up in our eyes when we read newspapers from the homeland which describe at length the terrible destruction that the storm of war has brought on the soil of Poland--the Belgium of the East.</p>
   <p>Our cities and villages in the Kingdom of Poland and Galicia now look as though the Huns had passed through them. The German vandals, furious because they were not able to winter within the borders of the Kingdom of Poland and supply themselves out of this granary, well stocked with our Polish wheat, destroyed and burned everything which they were not able to steal and take along with them. They wanted to keep the Russian army, which was chasing them out, from pursuing them further.</p>
   <p>Our land in the Kingdom of Poland--this fertile Polish soil, bathed so many times by the blood of martyrs--today is one huge cemetery, full of graves still open, graves not yet sunken, where rest in eternal sleep both the invaders and those who came to oust them from the old hillocks.</p>
   <p>Our soil--this fertile Polish soil--is furrowed and dug up throughout its entire expanse by the wheels of Prussian cannons and by horses' hooves. This fertile Polish soil, which has been turned topsy-turvy by her temporary "Masters", who came over to expound Western Culture to us, still moans in pain and bows under the weight of the blows which were dealt it during these past few months of war.</p>
   <p>No one knows how long it will continue to groan, how long it will continue to be trampled by horses' hooves, how long the bloody glare of fires will continue to light the way for the peasants, insane with pain and despair--peasants who are returning "to die in their own yards," because they prefer this to wandering and being sent about from place to place in foreign lands.</p>
   
   <p>It is hard to visualize today the magnitude of this tremendous suffering which has befallen our brothers across the sea. It is hard to evaluate today the effects of all the blows which they have experienced and will still experience at the hands of the invaders. But it is not difficult to understand that this land cannot be left this way, that it must be reconstructed. It will be reconstructed only when we begin to help and support each other.</p>
   <p>This reconstruction has already begun. According to what we can gather from the newspapers from the homeland, in the County of Lublin, which suffered, the hurricane of war, the people are planning how to resurrect the destroyed food stores, dairies, savings and loan banks, etc. Besides this, every farmer is doing the best he can by himself to put his farm in order, to prepare the land for sowing, and to remove all signs of destruction.</p>
   <p>"There is within our people indefatigable strength," which will soon be able to remedy the harm which our invaders have done to our soil. But the people themselves will fall under the pressure of this work if the entire nation does not hurry to their aid. We must not drop our arms now to lament over the magnitude of the losses and injustices; we must get to work with energy.</p>
   <p>All of our people in the homeland are setting themselves to this task, even though they are worn out and ruined by the war. Everywhere--throughout all of Poland--relief committees are being formed and the aid for which there is such a tremendous need now is being organized. Everyone gives whatever he can possibly give, because he knows that he is making this sacrifice for our mutual benefit and to one joint treasury whose name is Poland, our homeland.</p>
   <p>One rejoices on reading the long lists of contributions--these offerings of aching hearts--which vary from one kopec to thousands of rubles, from a cent to thousands of crowns, and from a pfennig to thousands of marks, and which flow from all parts of the country, from palaces and manors, from peasant cottages and workmen's houses, to the funds of the committees.</p>
   <p>Only among us is there complete stillness. Only among us is there silence, which fills one with horror and brings words of complaint to one's lips. Is it not shameful that we three million emigres have so far been able to collect so little, so pitifully little, for the most sacred causes! Will we not blush that we who are millionaires in comparison to our brethren on Polish soil--we who are well fed and clothed, we in our comfortable "parlors" and warm bedrooms--have not been able together to contribute even a hundred thousand [dollars] to help our homeland at a time so full of hope!</p>
   <p>What has happened to our declamations in which for dozens of years we have been announcing that we are ready to sacrifice everything "just as soon as the time comes"? What has happened to the promises which we used to make and which we believed to be worthless small change of our cheap patriotism? What has become of all this, we ask!</p>
   <p>Only occasionally a more important contribution flashes, which is made by a group, a society, or a unit of the Falcons. Some noble individuals make a more generous contribution to this cause, but the rest remain in shadow, idleness, and some sort of peculiar indifference and coldness which cools all enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Over there our people are working as hard as they can and working with enthusiasm. Over there, there are no disloyal sons of our mother (although each one wants to govern "according to his own pattern"). Only we patriots for whom declamation takes the place of action, sleep our deep sleep, unmindful of our promises, deaf to the groans of our brothers and our defamed sisters.</p>
   <p>Let us go right on sleeping! Let us put ourselves to sleep humming the lullaby about "our future duties toward free Poland." Let us continue to delude ourselves with the hope that we shall help the homeland a great deal. Let us make promises to our mother country, though we know that we shall never want to keep them, since we are not keeping now, and have not kept in the past, those promises which we once solemnly made.</p>
