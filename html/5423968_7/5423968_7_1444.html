   <p>Mr. Z. P.: You claim that among the Poles who have received Christmas Cheer relief there is a certain number who do not necessarily need help. This may be so. There is no remedy for such a sad situation. While distributing relief to a thousand persons, even with the best of intentions, it is impossible to control it properly. The ladies of the Patriotic Organization have investigated a couple of hundred families; the others were carefully interrogated. The names of all persons receiving relief are entered in a book, and any cheating, if there was any, can easily be ascertained. There is not question that such cheating is highly reprehensible, and it will be a stone on the souls of those who steal bread from those really destitute.</p>
