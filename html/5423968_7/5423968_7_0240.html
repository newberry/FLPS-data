   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Being vitally interested in course of the suit of the widow of the late Mr. Szatkowski against the Polish National Alliance for the death benefit due her from the Alliance, I investigated the matter from the very start and followed the proceedings in court. It came as a great surprise to me when I read in the columns of the Zgoda an article signed by Mr. E. Z. Brodowski, entitled "Explanation," relative to this matter.</p>
   <p>I must say openly that after reading the article I came to the conclusion that the author must have been an acrobat or a contortionist, because the facts were greatly distorted.</p>
   
   <p>First of all, according to the article, the matter was to have started "at the moment when the said institution was passing from an illegal to a legal standing" (sic) [Institution in this case may mean the Polish National Alliance].</p>
   <p>This does not agree with a certain article published by the Zgoda in 1896 which also was signed by "E. Z. B.". An attempt was made to prove that the first charter was not in good order. The fact is that only after constant complaints had been made by the members of the Polish National Alliance was the first charter recalled, and only after certain errors had been rectified was a new charter obtained. But this one also had its shortcomings.</p>
   <p>It can be pointed out--to throw light on the matter--that the money belonging to Mrs. Szatkowski was held by a writ of attachment in 1895 and again on July 1896, when the Alliance passed into a "legal status" (the charter being issued on March 30, 1896).</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Brodowski does not make it clear whether the attachment issued in 1895 forced the administration, or rather Mr. Brodowski (the fact is that he and not the treasurer paid out the money), to pay the entire sum to Attorney Depka, or only a part. This is rather a curious situation according to the reports in circulation and the replies presented in court under oath.</p>
   <p>As to the statement made about the "example set by our predecessors," I can safely say, having known Anthony Mallek and I. Morgenstern, one of whom is absent and the second persona non grata with certain members of the present administration, that during their times there was no such incident. Consequently I cannot understand why such "examples" should exist under the present setup.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brodowski has a peculiar point of view when he calls Mrs. Depka a "poor woman" for she has sued and won a decree for $1200. It seems to me that this is a fair sum of money, enough to safeguard the widow from utter poverty. Considering the fact that she is in good health and is employed as a housekeeper by Mr. C.</p>
   <p>We read in the constitution of the Polish National Alliance that the organization is obligated to take care of the widows and orphans of the deceased members. When the administration wishes to act in this direction, should not this act warrant censure when the money is paid out to someone other than the widow? Why did not the organization of the Polish National Alliance give a guarantee of the payment of the money and make an arrangement with Mrs. Szatkowska relative to an appeal of the decree which was given in the same court in which Mr. Brodowski and others think of winning the present case? If the guarantee is good then why the court proceedings and the additional costs?</p>
   <p>Isn't it sad for an important institution, such as the Polish National Alliance, to have an official who has so greatly neglected his duties that he has permitted a wrong to be done to the widow who is compelled by her circumstances to pick up coal on the railroad tracks or to seek help from the county agent?</p>
   
   <p>The scoffing on the part of Mr. B. at the widow, a poor, sickly, and aged woman, who has lost the aid of her husband, who for many years paid his dues in order to assure his wife's future, is truly an unpleasant act for a president of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Did the author of this article ever stop to reflect for a moment and consider that perhaps some day his family might be placed in the same circumstances as Mrs. Szatkowska is facing at the present? This was an injustice done to her, for, after all, she only made a demand for what was coming to her--the fulfillment of the contract.</p>
   <p>The old proverb about the "table and scissors" can well be applied to Mr. B. there will be enough time at the next convention of the Polish National Alliance to explain the action and give proof of the "strength and energy" of the members of the administration, without the article printed in the official organ.</p>
   
   <p>In conclusion I wish to suggest that if the members of the Polish National Alliance will go deeper into this matter I do not doubt that public opinion will indicate the most just decision in this case.</p>
