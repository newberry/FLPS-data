   <p>The St. Valentine's Society, No. 1, of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish was organized on April 23, 1888. The founders were Hubert Abraham, John Wegner, Fabian Nadworny, L. Baran, A. Gorski, August Dahlman, P. Golus, J. Gorski, A. Koczka, and J. Freibyza.</p>
   <p>These members arranged a meeting on Sunday, April 23, 1888, to lay plans for a society. At this initial meeting only fifteen persons were present. During the discussions it was agreed to have the new Society named after St. Valentine, whose anniversary is celebrated annually by the Society.</p>
   <p>Since January of this year the St. Valentine Society, No. 1, has been associated with the Polish Roman Catholic Union, but it does not participate in the Union's sick and death benefit insurance.</p>

   <p>The aim of this Society is to uphold the principles of the Roman Catholic church, to see that Polish youth is brought up under the teachings of the church, to foster love for the fatherland, to render brotherly assistance to all members in case of sickness, misfortune, or death, and to offer assistance to the widows and orphans of deceased members.</p>
   <p>The Society, in case of illness of one of its members, pays five dollars per week, and in case of death pays two hundred dollars to cover funeral expenses. In the event that the Society takes charge of the funeral, the widow or heir receives one hundred and forty dollars. If a member's wife dies he receives one hundred dollars for assistance.</p>
   <p>Persons of the Roman Catholic religion who speak Polish are eligible for membership in the Society. All the affairs of this Society are conducted in the Polish language. At present there are one hundred and twenty-one members. The treasury has $234.95. Last year the Society purchased flags and banners displaying <span class="page-break">\3</span>its patron saint's image, and bought other incidentals necessary for the operation of the Society, at a total cost of $1247.40.</p>
   <p>Officers for the present year are as follows: Paul Gawronski, president; August Dahlman, vice-president; Joseph Cyszewski, recording secretary; Joseph Wasilewski, financial secretary; Francis Arendt, cashier; Francis Zmich, Anthony Borchman and Ignacy Rindfleisch, trustees; Joseph Tylicki, first marshal; John Maciejewski, second marshal; and Joseph Platuszynski, sergeant at arms.</p>
