   <p>B. Klarkowski, author of an article on the Polish Hospital, which recently appeared in the Dziennik Chicagoski, received the following letter:</p>
   <p>"Chicago, January 6, 1895.</p>
   <p>"Happy New Year to you, Mr. Klarkowski! Let God bless your thoughts and memory for not forgetting about this poor institution, the Polish Hospital. You are perfectly right. Truly, something new is always found and that which has been started is thrown on the scrap heap.....I wanted to make this announcement public a long time ago, but I was afraid that something might happen to me.....Please accept this contribution for the Polish Hospital; you know best to whom to turn it over. I hope that this will not be the last of its kind.</p>
   <p>"Anthony Scherman"</p>
   <p>The letter contained ten dollars which was given to the Nazareth Sisters, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>operators of the hospital.</p>
   <p>Who is the next contributor?</p>
