   <p>It already has been mentioned that Peter Kiolbassa has sent a second sum of money to help our destitute countrymen in Nebraska, who have been hard hit by the widespread depression. This sum of money--two hundred dollars has already reached Reverend Sebastyanski, who has divided it among three Polish parishes: Posen, Elba and Ashton.</p>
   <p>The disposition of the money has been given in detail in a letter sent to</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa recently:</p>
