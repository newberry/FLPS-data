   <p>The St. Joseph Society Number Two of Chicago was organized on October 4, 1891, in St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish in Chicago by Francis Fuhl, Jacob Obert, and Jacob Stanislawski. The purpose of founding of this Society was to join the Polish Roman Catholic Union, because the older group under the same name did not desire to do this. Today the society numbers a hundred and ten members, and all are participants in the P.R.C.U. death benefit fund.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Society are as follows:</p>
   <p>Jack Obert, president, Frank Spalnik, vice-president, Frank Fuhl, secretary, Peter Stryszyk, financial secretary, Simon Lorenz, Frank Droszkowski, and Joseph Blazek, trustees, and John Szczepanski and Michael Reflewski, marshals.</p>
   <p>Although the society has not been in existence a year, it has $278.65 in its treasury. Its officers are energetic and efficient. Meetings are held every second Wednesday of the month.</p>
   <p>The address of the secretary is as follows: Frank Fuhl, corner Noble and Ingraham Streets, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
