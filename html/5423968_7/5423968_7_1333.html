   <p>From a report received from T. Gordon, Secretary of the Committee of the Welfare Association of the Sixteenth Ward, we learn that the Committee collected $186.15. Of this sum $128.70 was used to purchase 176 pairs of shoes, and $43.38 was spent for boys' clothing. The remainder of the money was put in the treasury.</p>
   <p>At the same time the committee received donations of articles valued at $270. Receipt of these items was acknowledged from time to time in the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>The committee gave help to 135 families, giving the purchased articles to school children. It distributed 170 pairs of shoes, 56 suits for boys, 34 pairs of trousers for boys, 6 pairs of trousers for men, 51/2 dozen socks, material for dresses and blouses, 162 loaves of bread, one case of rolled cats, <span class="page-break">\2</span>one basket of bakery goods, and one half ton of coal.</p>
   <p>Considering the fact that the Polish Welfare Association of the Sixteenth Ward was organized on January 27, the service it has rendered in less than a month is remarkable.</p>
   <p>But this effort only partly alleviates the suffering. Poverty and dire conditions are prevalent amid our people. Such conditions should force us to make a more concentrated effort to assist them, for only in this way will we be able to help our destitute compatriots.</p>
