   <p>Last Sunday a meeting of representatives of parishes and organizations was held in Walsh's hall to decide on a way to promote the project by the "Federation of Polish Catholics" to build a large orphanage in Chicago.</p>
   <p>An institution of this kind is very badly needed, and with pleasure we are informing our readers that the results were successful and make sure the realization of this project.</p>
   <p>The plan is to purchase about 300 acres of land in the suburb of the city of Chicago, in Cook County, and then build a suitable building.</p>
   <p>The cost will be about $500,000.</p>
   <p>The amount of this sum should be collected among parishes and organizations in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Title of the ownership will be made to the Archbishop of this archdiocese.</p>
   <p>The members of the newly formed committee are: Archbishop Quigley, Rev.Lange, Gronkowski, Vojtalewicz, Zwierzchowski, Sztuczko and Czerwinski, also Messrs. Szopinski, Polenc and N.L.Piotorwski.</p>
