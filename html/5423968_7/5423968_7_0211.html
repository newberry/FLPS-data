   <p>The Polish nation has had its heroes and martyrs throughout a thousand years of its history. Its martyrs today are those who, although they do not perish fighting for our motherland, sacrifice their youthful lives upon the altar of daily struggle--a struggle to maintain their families and to enrich all humanity--upon the altar of labor.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance paid its final obligation to just such heroes of labor on December 2, 1910. Whoever read the last circular passed upon at this meeting, and published December 3 in the Dziennik Zwiazkowy, must have noticed the unusual number of deaths in one group, namely, Group 351. While one rarely finds more than two deaths in one group mentioned in a single edition, in the present instance there were fifteen of them.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We are certain that our brethren of the Alliance immediately surmised, after reading this edition, who these fifteen are, to whose widows and orphans the Alliance consented to pay out death benefits. They are our miner brethren, who perished several days ago during a terrific explosion of gases in a coal mine at Starkville, Colorado.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: There follows a list of the victims who died in the catastrophe, their names, the sums for which they were insured, and the sums which the Polish National Alliance decided to pay out to the beneficiaries.]</p>
   <p>This catastrophe cost many human lives, deprived many families of paternal care, and took away many good members from the Polish National Alliance's circle; and it cost the organization $13,400 in the form of premature payment of death benefits.</p>
   <p>And yet it is deeply gratifying for all members of the Alliance to know that at least the widows and orphans left by these deceased brethren will not suffer <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>want. Besides having a place in the good thoughts of sincere people as industrious men and real heroes of labor, they will also be remembered as good, foresighted fathers, who, through insuring themselves in the Alliance--a sound, wealthy organization, which is always willing to fulfill its obligations--not only manifested a desire to co-operate with their brother workers for the welfare of our people, but also fulfilled their obligation toward their families. These were young people--some of them had paid only a few dollars to the Alliance--and yet, because they had enrolled in this organization, they have endowed their families with a thousand dollars each. That is a sum which a poor miner might have to work a lifetime to accumulate in a savings account.</p>
   <p>Never are the advantages of belonging to a large fraternal organization so evident as at moments of such catastrophes. Many people are suddenly killed, most of them young but already burdened with family obligations, people who have not as yet had time to make large savings. What would be the fate of their families were it not for the organization? Misery, hunger, dependence upon public charity, and exploitation by various lawyers, who for years on end would carry on legal <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>suits against companies and, if they should win anything, would take all of it.</p>
   <p>In order to be sure of one's death benefits in the event of premature death, it is necessary to belong to a large, wealthy organization, one that can withstand every extraordinary burden and not feel it in the least. The Polish National Alliance, which thus far has over a million dollars in its estate, will readily withstand every exceptional addition to its usual expenditures that might arise as a result of some catastrophe. Fifteen brethren in one group were lost. The usual monthly mortality rate increased considerably. The expenditures increased by several thousands of dollars. But the Polish National Alliance has sufficient funds to cover them; it did not bend in the least under the blow, and would not have yielded if the blow had been, God forbid, even several times greater.</p>
   <p>At the same time, an accident like that at Starkville could have hurt a small local organization, one numbering only several thousands of members and having an estate of only a few thousands of dollars.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>That is one of the reasons why people who really have the welfare of workingmen at heart summon them to enroll in the Polish National Alliance, a large and wealthy organization, which is safe and is prepared to ward off every sudden emergency. That is the reason why this organization is against allowing insignificant unsound local organizations to exist. These small associations might in fact satisfy the ambitions of several local "great" people, but cannot, because of their very nature, offer a complete assurance of death benefits in the event of some large catastrophe.</p>
   <p>The life of a worker is fragile; he is under constant fire, like a soldier at war. The life of a miner, however, is even more uncertain than that of others. He might be compared to a soldier in the front line, nearest to the enemy.</p>
   <p>There are large American organizations that also call themselves fraternal associations, and yet they do not accept miners. If any of them do accept people employed in mines, they do so only at prorated higher premiums. Our Alliance is open to all brethren and sisters on the basis of equal rights and equal obligations.</p>

   <p>All those who are constantly exposed to sudden and accidental death are urged to bear this in mind. They are urged to keep in mind these fifteen of our late brethren at Starkville, who left for work in full strength and health and returned as only a handful of charred bones. They are urged to think of their wives and children and to enroll in the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>True, there are, even among our people, certain idiotic and inconsequential individuals who ridicule the insurance of the Polish National Alliance. They show off their "wisdom" by scoffing at such a praiseworthy purpose as bringing assistance to widows and orphans. Let these scoffers pay a visit to Starkville, Colorado, and be convinced, by being eyewitnesses, as to what would happen to the families of these fifteen heroes of labor had not the Polish National Alliance hurried with assistance in the form of thousands of dollars in exchange for a few paltry dollars that their providers had time to deposit during their lives into the general fraternal treasury of the Polish National Alliance! If, after viewing such evidence, they still persist in ridiculing this beneficial organization, they are not worthy of being called rational human beings.</p>
