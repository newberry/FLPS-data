   <p>Dr. E. Dudley, eminent medical professor of Chicago, friend of Mme. Helen Modrzejewska (Modjeska) and her husband Charles Chlapowski, paid a visit to the Polish Hospital yesterday and was shown about by Drs. Ochsner, Laibe, Szwajkart and Milles. The old as well as the new section was visited. Dr. Dudley was greatly pleased with the care tendered the sick, and stated that more good is being done inside these walls than is let believe; in fact, much more than behind the walls of marble and gold. He praised the Sisters of Nazareth for their fine work in supervision and Dr. Ochsner for his care, and offered a gift toward the completion of new headquarters, promising to pay another visit shortly.</p>
