   <p>A large group of representative Polish women of all the parishes in Chicago met on June 17, at the Holy Family Home, 258 West Division Street, to discuss plans for enlarging the present Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously agreed to start an intensive campaign for funds, and all present were taxed five cents to get things started. With this kind of help the facilities of the hospital will undoubtedly be enlarged.</p>
   <p>For this purpose a committee of thirty women will be formed in every Polish parish. Sister Superior Lauretta Lubowidzka, provincial of the Holy Family of Nazareth of America, was named president of all these committees. Several others will give her assistance.</p>
   <p>Besides this each parish committee is to arrange some kind of social which will aid in raising funds.</p>

   <p>All those women who were unable to attend the meeting last Thursday are urged to call at 130 West Division Street and consult with the president for instructions and an understanding as to how the funds are to be raised. All pastors who have not as yet appointed representatives are kindly requested to do so as soon as possible and have them get in touch with the sister superior.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the pastors will agree to support this cause, and that each parish will give help to its committee, which forms a link in the endless chain of charity, the beginning of which is imbedded in our hearts, and at its and is the realization of an institution of great help to the Poles of Chicago, the Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>It must be added that all names of women belonging to these committees will be listed on a tablet which will be placed at the main entrance to the hospital, as benefactors of the Polish Hospital, and that they will have special rights and privileges.</p>
