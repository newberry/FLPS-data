   <p>The fair to raise funds for the Polish orphanage started day before yesterday at the School Hall on Bradley Street. The place was crowded; and, in addition to helping a good cause, all that came had a good time.</p>
   <p>Beginning today a number of societies will have their day at the fair. People of good will should not ignore the orphans--everyone should contribute to their support by donating something for the fair.</p>
