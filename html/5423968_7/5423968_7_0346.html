   <p>Yesterday at 4 P.M., the first meeting was held to make plans for an organized welfare association that will look after the poverty-stricken throughout St. Stanislaus Kostki's parish at St. Stanislaus Kostki's parish hall. An executive committee was chosen, and given the power to elect other functionary groups. A bureau of intelligence was among the first to be organized.</p>
   <p>The function of this department will be primarily one of investigation and information. It will try to locate the jobless in industry and commerce. An outlook will be kept on all branches of industry, relative to getting as many of the idle to work as soon as possible.</p>
