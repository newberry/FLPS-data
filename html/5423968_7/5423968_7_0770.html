   <p>The holiday of the Three Kings will be celebrated in the home of the Holy Orphanage on Division Street. Puppets representing the birth of Christ will be altered to conform to the commemoration of this day: The shepherds are returning to their homes and the three kings are coming to offer gifts and homage to the Child Jesus Christ.</p>
   <p>Mr. Carl A. Buscher, who has prepared and assembled the miniature replica of the birth of Christ will make the necessary changes. He will work on it today, putting into his work the same artistry he put on the original.</p>
   <p>Children will not be admitted free of charge unless they are accompanied by their parents. Those boys that desire to come alone will be charged ten cents for admission. Two ushers will be stationed at the door to look after these boys and to see that they do not get into mischief.</p>
