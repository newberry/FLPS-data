   <p>A church fair for the benefit of the Polish Hospital will open tonight at the school hall on Bradley Street, under the auspices of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. Single admission tickets will cost ten cents and combination tickets seventy-five cents. There are indications that the fair will be a success in every respect. A great variety of valuable articles and all kinds of goods have been collected and purchased. Polish societies are kindly disposed toward this undertaking, and most probably will lend a helping hand. The public will also support the fair because its purpose is noble.</p>
   <p>The following church societies have promised to take active part in the fair: St. John the Baptist's and St. Stephen's societies will participate on January 20; Holy Trinity Society, on January 21.</p>
   <p>The fair will be arranged and managed by a committee consisting of Reverend Vincent Barzynski, Mr. Francis Wleklinski, A. J. Kowalski, W. Jedrzejak, T. Krolik, John Kortas, John Lamczyk, Stanislaus Hoffman, and Doctor Lande.</p>
