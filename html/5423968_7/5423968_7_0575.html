   <p>Nations caring for their future are becoming ever more interested in the bringing up of the younger generations in physical and mental health. Communities surround their future citizens with tender care because the future of every nation rests upon them.</p>
   <p>What can be said about the little folks who on the very threshold of life have lost their guardians, who have no one to guide their very first steps because their parents are in their graves? What can one say about the orphans?</p>
   <p>They do not have a father to pet them and support them; they do not have a mother to teach them their little Polish prayers and Polish songs.</p>
   <p>The Polish community must be this father and mother to these Polish orphans.</p>

   <p>With a great deal of effort and hard work we have succeeded in building a Polish orphanage in Norwood Park, Illinois. Proof that this institution is useful and is developing its kind activity is the fact that it gives 450 Polish orphans all that it can give--a family home. There, in this orphanage, in the fresh air, in an atmosphere of tenderness and under the kind care of the nuns, these poorest of the poor are growing up.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is the duty of the entire Polish community in Chicago to support this inexpressibly necessary institution--the Polish Orphanage. From this point of view we should support with all our strength and ability the efforts of the Polish Orphans' Welfare Society.</p>
   <p>Our society, thanks to the support of the Polish people and the press, has so far collected almost four thousand dollars, which fund is being used for the orphans' most immediate needs, such as food, clothing, etc.</p>
   <p>Today again the society brings itself to the attention of the Poles in Chicago <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and sends forth a sincere appeal, asking everyone to take part in the social evening which will take place on November 11 at the large hall of the Polish Roman Catholic Union Building (beginning at 8 P. M.).</p>
   <p>The officers of the society, which is composed of representatives of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, Polish National Alliance, Polish Women's Alliance, and Catholic Order of Foresters, sincerely believe that this appeal will not fail to open the hearts of all those who want to aid the Polish children and want to take the place of the parents of these Polish orphans.</p>
   <p>The help given the children recommended by us is a twofold good deed. It gives the orphans direct help, and the orphanage indirect relief.</p>
   <p>The board of directors of the society is composed of the following members: Francis F. Barc, president; A. Korzeniewski, vice-president; A. Wisniewski, recording secretary; A. Neuman, financial secretary; F. Wilkowski, treasurer. The executive committee is composed of representatives of the above-mentioned organizations.</p>
