   <p>Members of St. Hyacinth's Parish in Avondale filled the school hall last night to attend a special program planned to aid the unfortunate people of Upper Silesia. The entire entertainment program was greeted with an enthusiasm never before shown in this spacious auditorium. This large crowd dispelled the belief that an affair of this kind would not be a success. Although it is true that the meeting did not draw people from the neighborhoods adjoining the parish, or from various professional groups of the Avondale district, there is great hope that even these will in some way learn of the purpose of the meeting.</p>
   <p>In the absence of the pastor, Rev. J. Sobieski, C. R., who left for Kitchener, Canada, to attend the funeral of the late Reverend Spetz, C. R., the two vicars of St. Hyacinth's church, Father Repinski and Father S. Zwierzycki, C. R., arranged the entire program. The latter opened the evening with a prayer, and gave a short discussion of the purpose of this <span class="page-break">2</span>affair. Dr. K. Wachtla, who was instrumental in planning the affair, was called upon the stage to take a bow. The doctor thanked the audience for their splendid support and directed August Dora, secretary of the program, to take the stand.</p>
   <p>This affair was similiar to the other Silesian Nights that have been held throughout the city. Its distinguishing feature consisted in speeches throwing new light on the problem in Upper Silesia.</p>
   <p>Accompanied by Miss J. Korolewicz-Wajdowa, the delegation from Upper Silesia, which had made an earlier appearance in Town of Lake, arrived late. As a result, the conclusion of the entertainment came at a rather late hour.</p>
   <p>All the guest speakers gave unusually good addresses. The speeches were delivered with such simple sincerity that they could not help but move the entire audience. Great applause greeted each speaker. An impressive talk was given by Captain Grzesika-Hauke, chief of the Silesian delegation. He <span class="page-break">3</span>gave a vivid picture of the plight of the people of Upper Silesia after the plebiscite. Louis Koneczny, commissioner of the delegation, stirred the audience by his comments. Dr. A. Mikolalzyk presented a pictorial review of the insurrection. His commentary on the actual scenes brought closer to the silent gathering the experiences of the Polish doctor.</p>
   <p>Fr. F. Siara, C. R., well-known supporter of the Silesian cause, moved the entire crowd by his speech calling for contributions. Over two hundred and fifty dollars was collected. Many others gave promises to send money the following week. The affair turned out to be one of the most successful ever planned in the parish.</p>
   <p>The program came to an end as Miss J. Korolewicz-Wajdowa, who sang several numbers earlier in the evening, led the entire assemblage in the Polish patriotic song, "Boze Cos Polske."</p>
   <p>St. Hyacinth's Parish Hall serves a very good purpose in Avondale. It <span class="page-break">4</span>sponsors and supports many events, the present one being a typical example. The credit for its success belongs to the staunch parishioners.</p>
