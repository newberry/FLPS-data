   <p>At the time when the collection of contributions for the monument of Thaddeus Kosciusko was started, it seemed as though the monument would be completed before the opening of the Fair. Liberal donations flowed in from all parts of the city, and no one surmised that a few months later a chill would visit the initiators, dampening their enthusiasm to such an extent as to render them powerless to warm the spirits of their neighbors. It seemed then that collecting a sum of twenty-five thousand dollars in our Polonia was a question of a month's time, but experience has taught us differently.</p>
   <p>Nearly half a year has passed since the collection was started among the Poles in the United States, yet the total collected amounts to less than three thousand dollars.</p>
   
   <p>Are we really so poor or is it that we cannot bury the hatchet even for the sake of co-operation? Or, could it be possible that our patriotism is in reality nothing but an empty and meaningless recitation? Anyone can show his patriotism with words. I have never met a Pole in Chicago indifferent to matters of general interest to our people.</p>
   <p>Should not a monument to Kosciusko, a hero of the nation, this apostle of Christianity and martyr to liberty, be a matter concerning us all? Could we find many as great as he in the histories of nations? No. Many are the magnificent monuments we could point out that were erected to perpetuate the memory of men who only brought sorrow to their people. Among them, to mention only a few, we have Napoleon I; Frederick the Great; Catherine, the famous courtesan; and the renegades Rodecki and Paszkiewicz.</p>
   <p>They have magnificent monuments, erected by their victims, the people they once harmed, who were forced to shed their blood and be covered with mourning, all for their leaders' own fame and gratification of desires.</p>
   
   <p>They have monuments that testify to their greatness and surround them with a halo of fame.</p>
   <p>These monuments were erected by the same people who had been wronged through their deeds--the deeds of the despotic governments of Europe.</p>
   <p>We have in America many monuments of heroes and men of distinction--monuments dedicated to them out of gratitude and respect, not because the people were forced to do it.</p>
   <p>These monuments in Chicago should serve as an example to us, as a stimulus for solidarity. They are a goal toward which we must strive in order to keep pace with other nations.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, as is the case in most matters of vital concern to us, we are again divided into two groups--one in favor of the monument and the other against it. Those in favor announce that this monument--erected through the efforts of the Poles--will elevate them morally in the eyes of their compatriots. Those against. it claim that we have many other matters more important than the monument to attend to--for instance, the hospital, the immigration house, and the hall--and that until they are taken care of it would be unwise to think of a monument. We cannot gainsay this. Yet, if we take into consideration that the monument idea started first, that many citizens have already made donations of $100, $50, $25, etc., and that no one can deny the moral benefits to be derived from it, we cannot but reach the conclusion that the starting of new projects and new collection lists is unreasonable at this time, since it crumbles our forces.</p>
   <p>We are sufficiently well off and, with good will and unity, we could in a few years build the monument, the hospital, the immigration house, and the hall. There would be enough money, if only there were harmony. There would be no need of appealing to the Poles outside of Chicago, if only the ones here were willing to start the work in earnest, laying the foundation of a monument that will contribute to the welfare and fame of all the Poles. Is this so difficult? No. With the number of Poles we have in Chicago, each doing his part, no one need be afraid of not being a Croesus. What we really need is unity and order. By this we mean that, since many Poles are in favor of the monument, those who think that the monument is not a bad idea but as yet untimely should admit their mistake in not hitherto proposing something of greater importance, and co-operate with the initiators. After the monument is erected, there will still be enough money to afford a hospital, or an immigration house. So far as the hall is concerned, well, we need not burden Polish generosity, since this hall is a self-paying proposition.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Aug. 23, 1892.</p>
   <p>It is not exaggeration if we say that there are one hundred thousand Poles in Chicago. If all family heads and single individuals would feel themselves morally obligated to co-operate, each contributing twenty-five cents, we would have within a week twenty-five thousand dollars--just the sum we need to erect the monument. We do not think that this small amount would throw the budgets of our compatriots out of balance. Week in and week out we spend more than a quarter a week for things that are of little benefit to us. If only for one week we would do without some things that are hardly necessary, we would raise sufficient funds for the monument. After raising this fund, we could raise others for the hospital or for other purposes. We know that there are many Poles among us who merely earn nine dollars a week, and who are burdened with large families. For them it would be rather difficult to donate twenty-five cents for each member of the family without some deprivation. Of course, at a quarter each their donations would amount to more than two dollars, which is rather more than they can afford. However, they could contribute a dime apiece. Others who own property, receive bigger salaries, and have small families ought to give at least a dollar or two apiece, according to their ability and will. As long as each of us is willing to do his share, success will crown our efforts. This will be our best testimony of national co-operation and political maturity. It will gain for us the sympathy and respect of the Americans, as well as the satisfaction of having fulfilled our duty.</p>
   <p>Yes, duty. There across the ocean, in our motherland, the people are compelled to contribute for monuments to perpetuate the memory of our tyrants. Our noblemen there have erected monuments of our kings and our learned men. We the public, the peasants--as some people call us with contempt--should dedicate a magnificent monument to the memory of the man who was first to take up arms in our defense.</p>
   <p>Kosciusko fought not only for the independence of Poland, but also for the independence of all nations. He made no distinction between landlord and tenant, between nobility and the man in the city, because he considered all equal and saw in them his fellow men--all heated by one sun at the same time.</p>
   
   <p>When, in spite of Poland's fall, the nobility and the landowners considered themselves creatures molded of better clay, Kosciusko was the first one to throw off the noble kontusz (an upper garment, formerly worn by the Poles) and to don a peasant szermiega (peasant coat made of coarse cloth), thereby expressing equality. When the constitution of May 3 limited its privileges to the landowners, Kosciusko, on the strength of the power vested upon him by the people, proclaimed in his manifesto liberty, equality, and freedom.</p>
   <p>When the German troops hired themselves to England to slaughter the freedom-seeking Americans, Kosciusko took sides with the oppressed and fought to the last.</p>
   <p>If anybody, it is we who should consider it our duty to dedicate this monument, which will testify to our ancestors that we know how to be grateful to the one who sacrificed himself in our cause.</p>
   
   <p>Those who have no love in their hearts for their poor motherland and thereby are cold toward her heroes, should be instrumental in Kosciusko's glory from an American point of view. There are two reasons why we should erect the monument: first, Kosciusko fought for the liberty we all enjoy today; second, a monument will beautify the city, a task toward which every decent citizen is expected to do his part, regardless of personal beliefs.</p>
   <p>Let us, then, sacrifice our factionalism on the altar of general welfare; let us not be alarmed because others think of monuments instead of other things we need. Rather, let us consider how much we can donate now--be it much or little--and the Lord will help us get the other things we need.</p>
   <p>The present list of contributions indicates that some Poles have already donated more than once while others remain indifferent. Not all read the newspapers and not all are interested in public life. Some have no knowledge of this project, and some dislike to be inconvenienced by the delivery or mailing of their contributions. These people should be enlightened and encouraged by their friends and acquaintances.</p>
