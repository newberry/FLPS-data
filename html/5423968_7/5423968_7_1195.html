   <p>It is an old and well-known story that the most useful work for society generally brings the least acclaim and reward. Often it brings nothing but difficulties and painful experiences. While mass murderers like Napoleon go down in history wearing the laurel wreath of heroes on their brows, thousands of geniuses who have created new and beautiful ideas die unobserved and disappear into the infinite without anyone's knowing of their existence. They are like the flame of a candle which has turned all its being into light and then died. It is too bad. The world has not reached its maturity yet and will not soon grow to the age at which it will be able to delve into the psychological substance of things. A great majority of people still judge things primitively, from the standpoint of outward form, which is capable of being recognized by the sense of touch. They cannot comprehend things without color, shape, voice, smell, or taste.</p>
   
   <p>It is not strange, therefore, that those who are interested in publicity, either because of personal ambition or for business reasons, choose the road of external effects, noisy politics, popular slogans, etc.--methods of drawing the attention of crowds. Thus it has always been, thus it will continue to be for a long time to come. But this does not necessarily mean that we should forget about the quiet and productive work or purposely deny such workers recognition.</p>
   <p>It has been a long time since we have had such an opportunity as the present for deep thinking on the social and national question. Why, it concerns our future! We are confronted with Hamlet's "To be or not to be"! Today it cannot be a matter of indifference to us whether the social and national work done by someone is calculated to bring personal publicity or is done for the good of all. We must consider well whether out of all this noisy interparty masquerade,out of these political harangues and the display of pompous slogans, any good can come in the future. It seems that no good can come out of them. Some of the slogans are already dated, others are too abstract and are impossible of execution.</p>
   <p>In the mean time, beside this empty and noisy chase after publicity, really worthwhile, intelligent, and patriotic work is quietly going forward, and the people who are doing it are frequently entirely unknown to the public at large. It is too bad because they have earned recognition.</p>
   <p>Not so long ago the beautiful and noble slogan of armed battle for freedom was universally accepted by the Poles in America. Ideas of national defense were broadcast and the money of Polish workmen generously flowed into the coffers for this noble cause. But again it was shown, as it had been times without number, that it is very far indeed from nobility and generosity to political wisdom. Unthinking persons warped the purpose, and the whole movement became hopeless and useless to the nation and finally died. Today we must give our drive for armed battle for independence a new form and direction. A new way has opened for generosity, and patriotism, a much more useful and a surer way; Poland, trampled by the foot of Mars--destroyed by war--has appealed to her emigre children for help and here in America relief committees have been formed and have begun to amass money for our destitute brethren. Now there can be no talk of politics or orientations. The only way in which organizations should show their superiority over others is by competing with, and surpassing, others in collecting money for the relief of our native land.</p>
   <p>It is quite possible that our poor brethren in the homeland will not even know from which party or organization the aid comes which keeps them alive. They will probably merely say that this money which is saving their lives has been sent by kind and noble compatriots from America. But to us over here this is not a matter of indifference. Indeed not! Let us show our pride. Let us measure our strength. Let us show through quiet, real, and useful work which organization is strongest, most patriotic, most idealistic, and most intelligent....</p>
   <p>Members of the Polish National Alliance, to work! We will certainly not let anyone outdistance us. We will not allow anyone to force the Alliance off the pedestal upon which our gallant forerunners have placed it. It would certainly shame us if the Polish Roman Catholic Union or some other Polish organization were to show greater generosity on the part of its members, would it not? Instead of buying Christmas presents, which are frequently inappropriate, instead of buying foolish things without which one can get along comfortably, instead of harmful celebrations, let us jingle our purses for the benefit of our brethren across the sea, for the benefit of our homeland, which is dearer to us now than ever before because it is struggling toward a new life.</p>
