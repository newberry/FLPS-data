   <p>On the second day of the New Year's holiday, that is, on last Monday, January 2, a dinner was given in the hall of the Guardian Angel Day Nursery, 46th Street and Gross Avenue, in honor of the Reverend Louis Grudzinski, pastor of St. John the Divine parish and founder of the above-mentioned charitable institution.</p>
   <p>About one o'clock in the afternoon the assembled clergy and lay guests took their places at the beautifully decorated tables in the lower hall. The prayer was offered by the Reverend Francis Tyrcha.</p>
   <p>After dinner Mr. Bronislas F. Kowalewski, chairman of the Society for the Protection of the Day Nursery, made a speech in which he said that this dinner was given by the men and women workers of the bazaar held several weeks ago in honor of the Reverend Father Grudzinski, whose civic endeavors have brought him well-deserved recognition and honor. After a toast in honor of the venerable <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>priest, a check for $2000, net profit from the bazaar for the benefit of the Nursery, was handed to him. Father Grudzinski also proposed a toast in honor of Bronislas Kowaleski, a valiant worker for the cause of this Nursery. Both Father Grudzinski and Mr. Kowalewski laid stress in their speeches on the necessity of such institutions as St. Elizabeth's Nursery, the activities of which are of inestimable value, especially for the hundreds of poor Polish widows who work during the day and have nobody to take care of their children. The Franciscan Sisters take care of these little ones not for profit or for the sake of advertisement but as a Christian duty.</p>
   <p>The venerable speakers urged also the creation in our community of some organization to aid young Polish offenders against the law, who form a considerable percentage of juvenile lawbreakers. Both speeches were rewarded with enthusiastic applause. An entertainment, which lasted the whole afternoon, was provided after dinner in the upper hall. We should add that the Reverend Louis Grudzinski has shown a hearty interest in the welfare of the Nursery; he visits it every day and attends to matters which require his care. Through his efforts <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and those of the Reverend John B. Obyrtacz, pastor of St. Stanislas' parish, a building was bought at Ashland Avenue, and Blackhawk Street in the St. Stanislas parish, on the Northwest Side where sixty Polish children are sheltered. All honor to this honorable and noble priest for his great work on behalf of future generations!</p>
