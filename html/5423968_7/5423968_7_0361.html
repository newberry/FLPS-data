   <p>The above valuation indicates that on the basis of the American Experience Table of Mortality with Interest at 4 per cent, the future assessments of the society at the net rates are now being collected, together with the now invested assets, are sufficient to meet all certificates as they mature by their term, with a margin of safety of $964,066. 26, or 16.63% over and above the statutory standards.</p>
   <p>I hereby certify that the above valuation exhibit, setting forth the condition of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America as of December 31, 1925, has been prepared by myself in accordance with the requirements of statute, and that the same is correct and true to the best of my information, knowledge and belief.</p>
