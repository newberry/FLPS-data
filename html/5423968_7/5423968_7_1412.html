   <p>In response to a letter received from Reverend W. Sebastynski, S. J., relative to providing aid to the suffering Poles of Howard and Sherman counties of Nebraska, an approach has been made to the Polish public and an appeal has been voiced for material aid.</p>
   <p>This voice has not gone unheeded. The Polish public already has been notified through the press about the initial contributions for the benefit of our destitute brothers. A discussion among the leading Polish representatives of Chicago disclosed the need for a public meeting to consider this problem.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the undersigned appeals to the Poles of Chicago to attend a meeting on Monday, February 25, at 7:30 P. M. in Room 1 of the St. Stanislaus <span class="page-break">2</span>Kostka school building. Various matters and plans will be discussed.</p>
   <p>All Poles are invited to attend, and to offer or pledge contributions. An especial appeal is made to the local Polish merchants to donate foodstuffs and various articles of clothing, for these goods can provide considerable relief to the destitute Poles of Nebraska.</p>
   <p>Let us help them! It is our duty as Poles and as Catholics.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa</p>
