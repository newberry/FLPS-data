   <p>Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the elder members of St. Stanislaus Kostki's parish will meet to organize a committee to aid the destitute in the vicinity of the parish.</p>
   <p>The first duty of the committee will be to investigate the condition of the poor and then follow a definite program for the solution of their problems. Every effort will be made to help the Poles who are poor.</p>
   <p>Almost everyone knows how little the few outlying private social organizations help. Their chance assistance is very meager, and those needing relief do not know where to apply for the necessities of life nor how to change their predicament for the better. Many do not even know what is waiting for them the next day. In many cases, those who give assistance to the poor do not know whether they are helping the right person or not.</p>
   <p>As a result, the poor have no alternative and turn to begging in the streets, and soon become habitual beggars. Those who hand out a few pennies to these unfortunate souls never get the satisfaction of knowing whether or not they have done the right thing, for many beggars are nothing but parasites.</p>
   <p>Unorganized charity creates a class of false beggars, parasitic leeches, and others who under the guise of poverty prey in the streets upon the people who help the poor. At every opportunity they fool and even rob the kindly donors. Such condition tends to create barriers for the really destitute. The generous givers become aware of the fact that they are being taken advantage of and become indifferent to their pleas. It is not enough to give to the begging poor: one must know the person whom one gives to, whether or not he is actually in need of help. The how, what, when, and who of giving is very important. The mere giving to the poor is a weak charitable substitute. What about the person who is ill in bed and not able to beg? What about those who need something to eat? Is it the proper food? All this only helps to break the morale of the destitute.</p>
   <p>This condition is pointed out to inculcate in the mind of our fellow citizens the gravity of the situation. Something must be done to alleviate the sorrowful plight of many of our people. The mere giving of alms, be it in pennies or dollars, does not solve the problem; on the contrary, it complicates it. What is mostly needed in many cases is the personal supervision of each unfortunate family. Through this means, the people will not only be helped materially but spiritually as well. Here personal attention can be given; sincere hope and hospitality imparted.</p>
   <p>I raise my head heavenwards and pray to the Lord for assistance. I do not ask for diamonds or gold to fall upon us, only for the hope the He will step on earth garbed in the cloths of man and direct the charitable work for the poor and bring to them everlasting joy and peace.</p>
