   <p>The Polish Fellowship Club, which staged a benefit concert last Sunday, March 24, invited the Reszke brothers to participate, but illness prevented their appearance; however, the Reszke brothers sent a three-hundred-dollar contribution.</p>
   <p>To show its appreciation, the Club sent the following letter to the Polish artists, who are appearing on the opera stage:</p>
   <p>"Messrs. John and Edward Reszke, Auditorium Hotel, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sirs:</p>
   <p>"The Polish Fellowship Club, which arranged the recent benefit concert and informed you about it, has received a letter from R. Modrzejewski, containing three hundred dollars for our brothers in need. This organization deems it its duty to extend to you its sincerest thanks for this timely and generous gift.</p>
   <p>"At first it was decided to send a delegation to thank you personally, but this plan was abandoned when news reached us that John Reszke was ill. Therefore, in order not to inconvenience you in any way, the undersigned have decided to send their appreciation, not only in the name of the Club but for those who will benefit from your contribution.</p>
   <p>"Through this medium we beg you to accept these words of appreciation of your gifted talents and assurance of our deep respect. We remain</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>M. A. LaBuy</p>
   <p>S. Barszczewski"</p>
   
   <p>This letter was sent on March 27--and undoubtedly has been received by the kind Reszke brothers.</p>
   <p>[The benefit concert, held March 24, was for the destitute Poles of Nebraska who settled there in 1894, and who have been hard hit by the spreading depression, and also for the Polish Hospital of Chicago. The proceeds were divided equally.]</p>
