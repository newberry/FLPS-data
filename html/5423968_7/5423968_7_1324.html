   <p>Plans to raise funds for the suffering Poles of Russia by concert or theatrical entertainment were perfected at a gathering of representative Polish-Americans held at the Sherman House, last night. January 28th was fixed as the day and the Auditorium as the place. John F. Smulski was appointed chairman of the committee on arrangements. The Rev. Francis M. Woitalewicz of St. Mary Parish, South Chicago, presided. Mr. Smulski said last night: "Twenty thousand dollars has been raised for this fund by Chicago's Poles within the last few weeks. The money will be sent to Henri Sienkiewicz, the Polish novelist, for distribution. The Polish parishes, the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Catholic Union and the Polish Women's Alliance are among the organizations which have joined in the movement."</p>
