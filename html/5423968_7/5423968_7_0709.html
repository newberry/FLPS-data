   <p>The St. Stanislaus Kostka Young Men's Society from St. Joseph Parish, Town of Lake, has contributed five hundred dollars for the orphans of the Holy Family Orphanage. [Translator's Note: This donation seems very large; in all probability it is an error and should be five dollars. If the amount were so large more prominence would be given to the news.]</p>
