   <p>The Joyce Kilmer Players, a Catholic dramatic society from Chicago, will stage the play by William Roeder and A. Bradley, entitled, "The Watcher at the Gate". It will be played at the Powers Theatre on April 23rd for the benefit of St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital.</p>
   <p>This play is very popular in Chicago and surrounding cities, as a result of its excellent text taken from the struggle of the common sense Catholic religion with the black magic of Spiritualism.</p>
   <p>Because the itinerary of the society reaches beyond Chicago therefore this will probably be the last in this city. Anyone who has not yet seen this excellent play and would like to view the best amateur talent, and at the same time help the Polish hospital, let him go to the Power Theatre. Tickets can be purchased or reserved at the St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital.</p>
