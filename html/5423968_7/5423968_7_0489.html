   <p>The other day we mentioned the very important cause of the Polish Hospital. We now wish to say a few words about our generous people, of whom there are so few.</p>
   <p>The following citizens are supporting the hospital, from time to time, without any publicity:</p>

   <p>The Sodality Women and the Society of the Name of Mary, both from the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, have contributed money.</p>
   <p>From the above report we see that the hearts of our Polish butchers are more generous than others. Bakers come next, but there are only two grocers.</p>
   <p>Where are the rest of our hundreds of merchants who could also very easily <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>contribute something for so noble and necessary a cause? Where are our societies, saloonkeepers, doctors, lawyers, merchants?</p>
   <p>We should remember that many a Pole, going to a strange hospital, has lost his life because he could not properly explain what ailed him. In the Polish Hospital, under the supervision of Polish sisters, and in the care of Polish doctors, it is different. The hospital is located in the center of the Polish population in Chicago. It can be reached easily from the St. Adalbert neighborhood and from other South Side parishes.</p>
   <p>Let there be monuments erected in our parks to honor our great men, but let us erect a monument to living charity by aiding the well-being of our brethren. All nationalities have their own hospitals--the Polish hospital is a picture of poverty.</p>
   <p>Let us all get to work!</p>

   <p>We invite our young ladies and young men to devote a little time on a Sunday afternoon, and take a little stroll to the Polish Hospital, and see the crowd of sufferers. One is holding his hand, another his side, the third his legs, the fourth is coughing, the fifth is spitting, the sixth has a swollen face, the seventh wants to straighten up and can't....at the kitchen doors they will see frozen children, hungry, stiff, blue, barely covered with rags, looking for something to eat, as a cat watches for a choice morsel.</p>
   <p>O, brothers! This is no joke! Those whose stomachs are full, who enjoy the pleasant warmth of a red-hot stove and a mug of beer in the home, do not know and cannot appreciate what real poverty on this earth means.</p>
   <p>We call on everyone to help in this cause! Dig down into your pockets, drag out necessary goods, and share them with your poverty-stricken Polish people here in your own community.</p>
