   <p>The reports presented at the seventh semiannual convention of the Central Polish Relief Committee and its National Department disclosed that all the large organizations, which have a combined membership of more than five hundred thousand, have joined this alliance. This numerical strength, alone, will give our organization great influence, since more than one little country in Europe does not have a population numbering so many people, and there is no country so powerful that it could afford to ignore a union of half a million people.</p>
   <p>The organizations which have pooled their efforts in this way are, through their officers and representatives, joined together by an iron band.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>At their conventions, the majority of these organizations established dues to be paid by all their members for national purposes, and thus showed their intention to be active members of this great organizational family.</p>
   <p>Then, too, through the efforts of the union of Clergymen and the National Council, our parishes, which embrace all the Polish settlements in the United States, have also joined in the work. In this way the organization of our national strength from without was accomplished, and in this way the foundation for further national co-operation, better understanding, and a closer relationship with one another was laid.</p>
   <p>While taking into consideration the vast importance of this alliance, we must, on the other hand, keep in mind the fact that in this work we have so far established only a general link between the vital activities of specific organizations.</p>
   <p>These organizations are each inspired by the national spirit and are the <span class="page-break">3</span>product of independent Polish thought. They are not grouped together in a union with autocratic power, but are an association of mutually equal and independent organizational units. Each one is separate; nevertheless all are together. Each can choose its own course and aims, and yet they are unanimous in their national aim. Each has its own command, yet all willingly and voluntarily follow the joint command issuing from the principles and aims of the organization. This joint command supercedes all others, not because of terror, severity, or force, but because of the moral power which flows from organizational loyalty and from love for the cause of the homeland.</p>
   <p>If, therefore, entire organizations have united into one great association to deal with national aims and problems, this union must be carried through in all smaller units, such as the parishes, groups, nests, settlements, communes, etc., constituting separate organizations, and especially in those circles which so far have continued to remain outside our organizational life. It is true that the former already belong to our union, but this must be strengthened in the proper manner--so strengthened that there will be the certainty and <span class="page-break">4</span>feeling that the whole is welded together into one indestructible iron band. While the central departments and main boards are exerting themselves to create a mutual bond in order to accomplish their task in national issues, separate circles such as the parishes, groups, nests, centers, and all societies in general, should, on their part, support these causes among their members, and should work energetically among the masses, so that all the Polish emigres can grasp these problems, understand and take to heart the duty of co-operation for the realization of these issues.</p>
   <p>It is not advisable to recite every specific case, for the main boards will issue special decrees. Parishes and societies not only have self-rule, but they have their own means, and should constantly develop their efforts, in order to achieve the best results on their part.</p>
   <p>Parishes and societies must remember that it is not enough just to tax themselves, and occasionally to toss something into the contribution box. They must go beyond this, and give a general support to the solution of our <span class="page-break">5</span>problems; they should go to mass meetings, gatherings, and lectures. They must take a positive stand at these gatherings, and give proof of the genuineness of our unity in national endeavors.</p>
   <p>This unity is upset if dissenters within the organizations come to the meetings and not only occupy the seats which belong to older citizens and workers--at any rate real workers--but in addition insult them, and with complete audacity boast of this, not only in the Polish papers, but even in the American papers.</p>
   <p>We should demonstrate our unity, not by throwing such provocateurs out of the halls bodily, and by entering into fights with them at meetings, but by demonstrating our disciplined, collective strength. They should be shown that their name-callings and repugnant attacks strike a rock-like bulwark of conviction and unswerving aims, and that members of societies or groups know how to give their officers and representatives moral support.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Therefore, we must attend meetings, and we must go early in order to occupy the seats near the platform. We must reserve these seats for our honorable guests, and always have a guard who knows the local conditions so as to preserve order and to prevent the trouble-makers and provocateurs from getting in.</p>
   <p>We must also break ourselves of the habit of applauding popular phrases, and pay more attention to the real work that a given individual produces. If we have before us a phrase-monger, who himself does not belong to the organization, and who gives nothing for national causes, why should we pay attention to his words? Such an individual should set a good example before criticizing deserving men and the work already accomplished by them.</p>
   <p>Gatherings should be so arranged, and should always have such programs, that the people, on leaving, will say to themselves, "We have learned something, our spirits have been raised, we have benefited." Gatherings that are boring, drawn out, and noisy, do not help, but hurt our cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Let us remember that these Polish gatherings are great schools, teaching national citizenship to Polish families and to a great number of unmarried people who are still unattached to any organization.</p>
   <p>At the gatherings, members of societies and organizations learn how they should campaign, and, when they really get to work, they will each get at least one new member,and the number of united people will soon reach a million.</p>
   <p>The patriotic and civic spirit among us, that spirit which is the chief basis for our organizing, will grow even stronger.</p>
   <p>Part II</p>
   <p>Our Politics</p>
   <p>The semiannual convention of the Central Polish Relief Committee, and its national department has again called the attention of our emigres to works <span class="page-break">8</span>which have, from their very incipiency, upheld the ideal of the union and independence of all parts of Poland.</p>
   <p>This work is not just preparing the ground for some magnificent structure in the distant future. It is rather the present consolidation of all available national forces, in order that they may be used effectively in the reconstruction of the homeland.</p>
   <p>In this work there can be no thought of discrimination to the advantage of some forces, and the disadvantage of others, because we all realize that the loss of even one stone from the structure of our organization might shake the main column, and bury the most cherished hopes of the nation in the wreckage.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we must keep our attention on what is essential; we must develop our modest forces to the point where they may become a harmonious part of the whole movement, and may truly be an expression of the nation's real aim <span class="page-break">9</span>of independence.</p>
   <p>One thing, which is very significant, must be said of our group: It was not created artificially, in response to vague aims, but it grew naturally, out of the enthusiasm of volunteers, who wished to serve, to the best of their ability, a good and sacred cause, and to help it toward triumph and victory.</p>
   <p>All those who make up the group headed by the Central Polish Relief Committee and its national department came of their own free will and in a spirit of willing self-sacrifice. There was no one who joined for the purpose of taking advantage of the cause for personal ends; on the contrary, everyone, especially the wealthiest, has manifested and continues to manifest, a sincere spirit of self-sacrifice. This is proven by their actions.</p>
   <p>Even the most powerful organizations, such as the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish National Council, and others, made no attempt to seize the leadership when they entered upon a joint program, <span class="page-break">10</span>but all shook hands with one another in a sincere and fraternal way, competing for leadership only in the extent of their sacrifice and zeal, and in undertaking work for the common cause.</p>
   <p>All titles and ideologies, all fine reputations, all ideas, even those which are still in a nebulous stage, all ambitious plans and special aims, have been forgotten unless some good can be derived from them for this common cause.</p>
   <p>Relief for the hungry and efforts to regain the independence of the homeland--these are the two causes upon which all our efforts have been concentrated.</p>
   <p>The Central Polish Relief Committee and its national department have called upon all Polish-Americans, both as members of organizations and as individuals, to lend their efforts to this praiseworthy cause.</p>
   <p>This movement embodies all our aspirations, all our political goals. Could <span class="page-break">11</span>anything be loftier?</p>
   <p>If the movement were influenced by wealth or privilege, it would not be ours, because it would not be truly Polish. If leadership in it were given to specific trends, it would not be national, but class politics.</p>
   <p>The political ideology which always and everywhere speaks only of the Poland of the "common people" creates a class system from the bottom and pushes the national genius back to medieval times. This ideology is fostered by those who always speak and write about the "common people," who never want to mention the word "nation," and would be satisfied with an allegedly free Poland that covered only a small territory, so long as it was purely of the "common people".</p>
   <p>The politics of the national department, on the other hand, recognizes only the Polish nation in its entirety, a united Poland composed of all the territories which were unlawfully torn away from her. To such a country <span class="page-break">12</span>belong all strata, classes, and occupations, which have, by their co-operation, earned equal rights to the privileges of citizenship.</p>
   <p>If these forces were unjustly treated, the whole organization would be adversely affected, and would soon be completely destroyed. Therefore, it is necessary to respect even the smallest forces.</p>
   <p>Could our politics be otherwise? Can there be any sort of conflict, struggle,or failure, where serious and undying love of the homeland has taken as its watchword the memorable motto of our great poet, "W szczesciu wszystkiego sa wszystkich cele!" (The welfare of all depends upon the welfare of the individual). In order to accomplish this, truly the forces of all must be enlisted.</p>
   <p>A real army is needed to cultivate the soil for the next crop on the fields which have been neglected for centuries. What joy, to be able to contribute <span class="page-break">13</span>to this crop! What happiness, to work for such a crop! What honor, to harvest such a crop!</p>
   <p>The Central Polish Relief Committee and its National Department has, by its political program, undertaken the preparing of the soil for such a crop; it has already distinguished itself, if we may judge from the results, and has earned universal recognition.</p>
   <p>In its political program the Committee not only calls upon each of the individual forces, but it prepares conditions for their proper development. Under the influence of this political program everyone feels that he belongs to the great national family, which is stronger in direct proportion to the extent to which it is based on all the individual families and on the entire nation.</p>
   <p>Do you, Brother Pole and Sister Pole, experience this feeling of belonging to the nation?</p>
   <span class="page-break">14</span>
   <p>Are you aware of the civic responsibility which belonging to the nation imposes upon you? Do you understand that in exchange you will receive your full measure of rights, when the country is reborn and resurrected? Do you want to join the chivalrous group of defenders of the homeland who are striving for this? Will you answer a call for such enlistment with zeal and enthusiasm?</p>
   <p>The army of the Polish spirit must be tremendous, of unconquerable national solidarity. It must have the courage to face battle.</p>
   <p>Come with us, countrymen! This momentous hour summons all of us!</p>
   <p>Part III</p>
   <p>Our Contributions and Donations</p>
   <p>The closed books which were submitted to the seventh semi-annual convention of <span class="page-break">15</span>the Central Polish Relief Committee show the following figures for the past half year:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>Relief funds for the homeland</td>
     <td>$40,500.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Operating capital</td>
     <td>5,832.84</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Contributions for relief since founding of Committee</td>
     <td>$265,575.68</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>These sums are no indication of the work and efforts of the Committee because the majority of the organizations belonging to the Central Polish Relief Committee send their contributions directly to the Committee in Switzerland. This has also been done by many local committees and other patriotic groups.</p>
   <p>Judging from the data which we possess, the American Poles so far have collected and sent for Polish relief at least one and one-half million dollars, and this sum is not complete, because many smaller groups and private individuals have sent directly to Europe money of which we have no record.</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>It cannot, therefore, be said that the generosity of our people here is small, or that their patriotism is limited to empty words. One must also take into account the fact that our emigres are bound to the old country not only by ties of blood, but also by a great love for their native soil. In spite of the war, money has constantly been sent by the Polish people here to save the land and to help relatives.</p>
   <p>Some time ago Dr. Gargas, who was making a study of Polish-American conditions, revealed that in time of peace help sent by us to the homeland represented a yearly quota of one million dollars.</p>
   <p>During the war we have, no doubt, doubled this sum, sending to the homeland for relief, private contributions for national purposes, and help to families and relatives, up to four million dollars.</p>
   <p>The Central Polish Relief Committee has exerted every effort to encourage the people toward this generosity, and has never tried to take credit for the <span class="page-break">17</span>accomplishments of specific organizations or individuals. On the contrary, the committee has always tried to show Europe the solidarity of the work and efforts here, and has carefully recorded even the smallest contributions, because it knew that this would enlist respect for the Polish emigres among strangers, and give pleasure and further encouragement to our countrymen in the homeland.</p>
   <p>If this really is so, then all organizations and chests should also help to bring it about that the Central Polish Relief Committee will always have promptly, each month, the reports of specific contribution centers, and will be able to indicate their work in its reports, and add it to the record of the work done by Polish-Americans.</p>
   <p>If this were done carefully, three goals would be reached: democratic control of the contributions would be made simpler, we would show strangers and the homeland an encouraging collective generosity; and, lastly, fine competition would be engendered among specific organizations to see which one could gain <span class="page-break">18</span>the best results.</p>
   <p>The matter of substitution and representation in the Central Polish Relief Committee would also be simplified, and even to a certain extent definitely settled, because generosity and national efforts always earn a clear title to representation and a voice in national affairs.</p>
   <p>It is also fair to give a voice to anyone who is already working for the cause, who is sacrificing himself, and not to anyone who is shouting for representation while in reality he is only wasting his own and other people's time with disputes.</p>
   <p>In mentioning the generosity of our emigre--we frequently see touching examples of it--we cannot overlook one very important side of this matter. Everything which we as Poles give Poland and for Poland, we actually give ourselves; we place it in our own bank of national good; it is a savings account for the happiness of future generations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">19</span>
   <p>Therefore, although our generosity does not make too bad a showing, and is even worthy of praise and recognition, we must nevertheless evaluate it a bit more severely from the standpoint of duty to the homeland.</p>
   <p>Is there anyone who would offer only two dollars for medicine for his mother when five dollars was needed for the medicine? Even if he did not have it, he would go and earn it, and would give what was necessary for his mother's health.</p>
   <p>That is the way every Pole should behave when the matter concerns the mother of us all--Poland. If all of us realize that to save her from famine and to resurrect her, money is needed, then we must all give as much as is necessary. We cannot argue about whether we can give less. Rather should we work to earn enough to make up the shortage in the necessary amount.</p>
   <p>Everybody should exert himself in this direction collectively and individually. Many millions of dollars are needed and they are needed at once!</p>
   <span class="page-break">20</span>
   <p>Let everyone recall what he has so far given and hurry to correct his negligence. On this depends to a great extent the freedom and happy future of Poland.</p>
