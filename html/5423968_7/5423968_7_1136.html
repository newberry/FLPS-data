   <p>There has been organized in Chicago a Polish welfare association on the order of the United Charities. The aims of this association are: (1) Guardianship of our Polish girls, working in hotels and coffee shops; (2) The endeavor to establish an employment and advisory bureau for girls; and (3) Directing the attention to reform institutions, homes for the aged, hospitals and shelters, where a good number of Polish souls are lost to God as well as to the Polish nationality.</p>
   <p>To this association may belong parochial committees, welfare societies, and representatives of the Association of Guardianship over Orphans.</p>
   <p>Wishing this new and very much needed organization the blessings of God and success in their work, we express the hope that the Polish organizations and at least our own Polish Roman Catholic Union will give its support to the new association.</p>
