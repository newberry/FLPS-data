   <p>The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy has received the following letter from the Polish Central Relief Committee:</p>
   <p>Dear Mr. Editor,</p>
   <p>We hereby request you to publish this letter in all the editions of Monday, February 1, 1915, and thus acquaint the public with the methods followed in counting the contributions made by the Poles of Chicago during the Tag Days.</p>
   <p>The contents of the boxes of contributions are counted by two parties. Each of these parties is composed of representatives of committees managing the tagging as well as representatives of the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, where the money is counted. In addition there is an accountant present, who counts the money in the presence of everyone.</p>
   
   <p>First, a box is opened. Then the representatives of a committee on tagging, as well as representatives of the bank, record the number of the box and the name of the collector. After this, the money is poured upon the table and counted twice, and the amount contained in a particular box is recorded under the name of the collector.</p>
   <p>At the end of each day all the money is again counted. This is done for the purpose of making certain that the sum total of money is equal to the totals of the individual collections counted on that day.</p>
   <p>All positions, as well as all notes, are recorded on a sheet prepared for the tagging committee. These sheets are recorded by this tagging committee only, never by anyone else.</p>
   <p>The committee's request was complied with: the boxes sent in by Town of Lake were the first to be counted. Then the boxes from other localities were counted, according to the time at which they were received. By the end of January, 1915, several hundred boxes had been accounted for. At present the work is proceeding far quicker than anyone expected. It is anticipated that in the next few days all the boxes will have been counted.</p>
   <p>As soon as all the money has been counted, the result will be made public. The local newspapers will receive a complete list of all the boxes submitted to the Northwestern Bank, together with the names of the collectors and the amount contained in each box.</p>
   <p>The books now kept by the tagging committee, as well as by the Northwestern Bank, are open to all, without exception. Whoever wishes to can find out what a mount a given box contained.</p>
   <p>Some were of the opinion that all the boxes could be counted within several hours. That would be impossible. As was mentioned before, the money in each box is counted twice, and all the money is counted together the third time, at the end of each day. All this necessitates a great amount of time, but it is worthwhile because in this way, and only in this way, can errors be avoided. Errors must be avoided because if they occurred a great deal of misunderstanding would result.</p>
   <p>More than three thousand boxes have been turned over to the Northwestern Bank. Present indications are that the average contents of every box is between eight and nine dollars. It is, however, impossible to state at this moment what the sum total of the money collected will be. All predictions are nothing more than assumptions.</p>
   <p>A great deal of money is arriving by mail. The Polish Central Relief Committee is sending temporary receipts to all such donators. A formal receipt will take the place of the informal ones as soon as the Central Committee brings to order the counting of the contents of the Tag Day boxes. This Committee will also present to all local Polish newspapers the list of the donators. (All Polish newspapers outside of Chicago are kindly requested to reprint these reports).</p>
   
   <p>As was stated previously, the counting of the boxes will most probably be completed within a few days.</p>

   <p>John F. Smulski, Treasurer</p>
