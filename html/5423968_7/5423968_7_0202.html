   <p>The English language newspapers of December 14, 1910, present new particulars on the notorious deficiency found in the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune writes that for the past eleven years the financial records have been unsystematically kept by the former treasurer, Mr. Theodore Ostrowski. The estimated deficit is approximately eighty-one thousand dollars. Mr. Ostrowski has transferred his own personal estate to the treasury of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and it is expected to bring some seventy-four thousand dollars. The officials of the Union have received a list from Mr. Ostrowski which shows the total value of his estate to be forty-four thousand dollars. In addition, Mr. Ostrowski has assigned to the Union twenty-eight thousand dollars which he expects to earn on work now under contract.</p>
   <p>"The secretary recorded the income and disbursements," said Mr. Ostrowski to <span class="page-break">2</span>the Tribune reporter, "and my daughter, who keeps a record of my books, copied his figures."</p>
   <p>Attorney N. L. Piotrowski, legal adviser of the Union, expressed his opinion when he said: "The shortage now discovered has existed for the past several years. There was no mention made of this at the convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, in Cleveland, although two of the officials knew that the deficit then exceeded fifty thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Ostrowski transferred his estate to the treasury of the Polish Roman Catholic Union voluntarily. But if this estate, together with the bond, should be insufficient to cover the shortage, we shall endeavor to obtain the remainder from the former officials. They are wealthy people and I do not anticipate any trouble. I do not think that the Polish Roman Catholic Union will lose a cent."</p>
   <p>Another English-language newspaper, the Chicago Record Herald, states that <span class="page-break">3</span>a meeting of the Union's administration was held on December 13, 1910, at the South Chicago residence of the Polish bishop, the Right Reverend Paul Rhode. Mr. Ostrowski was present. Mr. Ostrowski expressed his conviction that the shortage did not exceed thirty-five or forty thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ostrowski's attorney, Mr. Frank M. Fairfield, said that he would also call to responsibility the former president and the secretary of the Union, if the administration decides to place the entire responsibility upon Ostrowski and retains his entire estate.</p>
   <p>At this meeting Mr. Ostrowski is supposed to have said:</p>
   <p>"I knew that a deficit existed, and a year ago, during the Cleveland convention, the former president and the past secretary knew that the shortage was in the neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars. They, however, told the new officials that everything was in order. I know that I was careless in <span class="page-break">4</span>bookeeping, but it has never been my intention to commit a fraud."</p>
   <p>Attorney Piotrowski stated that the directors do not wish to question Mr. Ostrowski's integrity. If his estate does not cover the shortage, a court action will most likely be instituted against the former officials for the amount still due, on the grounds of neglect of duty.</p>
