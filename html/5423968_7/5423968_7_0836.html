   <p>The work of beautifying the stage at Pulaski Hall progresses daily. The well-known painter B. Markiewicz has been working for some time on decorations and drops, and some of his work deserves special mention. The stage of Pulaski Hall has two drops, the first of which is devoted to advertisements of local merchants, with a mythological picture in the center. The second, now nearing completion, has upon it a very good reproduction of Moniuszko's "Rejtan." Eight scenes comprise the completed picture: The market place in Cracow, a smithy and pastoral scene, a park and fountain, a forest scene, a landscape with windmills, a road scene with a city in the distance, a castle armory,and a cottage near the gates of an ancient castle or prison. All of these scenes are beautifully and faithfully reproduced.</p>
