   <p>The large number of Polish societies which represent thousands of members in the United States, especially in Chicago, has given us an idea which we would like to pass on to our readers.</p>
   <p>Every society has in its midst all sorts of people--the poor and the rich, the subversive, the people of bad character, the selfish, and the philanthropic. As a result of this mixture, a society has to follow a middle course according to which it rules its members and holds its position among the people of other nationalities. Thank God that we Poles do not occupy the last place in the march of American civilization. If we are to advance from our present position, we must regulate our [mutual] relations. It is not our fault that we have not <span class="page-break">\2</span>accomplished more, but Cracow [sic] was not built in a day. The same is true of our people who immigrated to this country during the past twenty years--they have started to build but as yet nothing of great import has been achieved. What we already have shows evidence of great promise, but this does not mean that we should become idle; on the contrary, there is much to be done, many things are lacking, and many things that were begun need finishing.</p>
   <p>All projects on a large scale need public support, for every bit of work requires money. Individual endeavor can produce something, even if so minute as to require a magnifying glass to see it. The accomplishment of something of vast importance and value can only be realized by mass co-operation.</p>
   <p>Things are just the opposite with us. In matters of great importance we disagree and split into many opposing factions, some supporting whatever project is proposed and others trying to ruin it. In other words, we do not get together. It <span class="page-break">\3</span>is safe to say that only a small portion of the Poles living here take active part in affairs of public interest. The rest sleep the sleep of the peaceful dead and never give a thought to matters of concern to them. This is one of our greatest shortcomings, something not to be envied.</p>
   <p>We have four patriotic and philanthropic organizations which include a great number of affiliated societies, not to mention the many independent groups that, although not affiliated with any organization, have paragraphs in their constitutions to the effect that their aim is the unification of the Poles in Chicago or elsewhere, so that they may help each other by working together for the good of all Poles and for the benefit of our unfortunate fatherland.</p>
   <p>This indeed, would be a wonderful paragraph except for the fact that it is ordinarily nothing but dead phraseology that draws no attention from any member, since the societies, as a whole, show only concern for their sick and the payment of the death benefit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Such activity cannot be condemned, nor is it undeserving of some praise. Nevertheless, one cannot say that it comes from brotherly love or from love for the fatherland--that unselfish love of which personal gain is not the motive.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski, Sept. 18, 1892.</p>
   <p>This paragraph, as incorporated by some societies in their constitutions, covers a great field of activity, and not to engage fully in these activities is to give up the right to call ourselves patriots. To be a patriot one must serve his fatherland for the general good of all. Selfish, not patriotic, we can rightfully call the man who, to avoid taking part in affairs of general interest and so to be free from making contributions for public needs, secludes himself in a society interested only in the welfare of its members.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>By this we do not mean that all of our societies fall into this category, even though any impartial person must admit that a majority of them do. Some who have never made a donation for the good of the public consider them-selves staunch patriots for the simple reason that they are at the head of an organization.</p>
   <p>What we have accomplished so far must be credited to the iron will and righteous character of a few individuals. Collectively, we have not accomplished anything. When the new Polish school and hall were in the process of erection, only a few societies and same prominent individuals made contributions. The same is true of the orphanage. You would think that all the Poles had a hand in these undertakings, but no. There were some who gave trifles, but, unfortunately, there were others whose business was to tell their neighbors not to give. This indicates specifically that, in the main, the Polish people at large did not feel obligated to contribute toward these undertakings, and that, if they were completed, the credit goes to a comparatively small number of public-spirited <span class="page-break">\6</span>persons in our colony.</p>
   <p>At the present time we have in mind the Polish Welfare Association founded at the beginning of this year. As we said before, every society has millionaires and beggars. Much to our misfortune, there is a large number of the latter among us, but we do not lack a number of people in well-to-do circumstances. Many, if they wished, could wipe away a tear from the poverty-stricken. We have many who, although not possessing any great fortunes, earn enough to be able to donate twenty-five cents per month without producing any gap in their budgets. Were they only to use five pints of beer or five cigars less a month, the amount of the required contribution would be easily covered. All one needs is to consider the situation and not do as the others, even if they are richer. If life is to be fuller, we must have consideration for those poorer than we. In order to accomplish this objective, we all must be stirred to activity. Since some of us do not read the papers, or take any interest in affairs that concern our welfare as a whole, or even consider saving a small sum for a rainy day, <span class="page-break">\7</span>what is needed is more support from those societies that call themselves patriotic.</p>
   <p>Let us assume that at present we have three organizations that get our support, namely: the Polish Welfare Association of Chicago, the Polish Immigration Home of New York, and the Kosciusko Monument Foundation.</p>
   <p>In order that these three institutions get support to a certain degree, it is desirous that the so-called patriotic organizations collect a definite amount from each member as a contribution toward these causes and appoint someone to take care of these funds and send them to the proper places.</p>
   <p>We would not overestimate the number of members of Polish societies in Chicago if we place them at three thousand. Perhaps there are more, but it must be <span class="page-break">\8</span>remembered that there are many who belong to two and three societies. In order to lighten the burden on these members, we suggest that they only contribute in one. These donations need not be large but, no matter how small they are, they must be constant.</p>
   <p>The Polish Welfare Association should be foremost in our minds, as it has the greatest right for support. The Kosciusko Monument Foundation should be second in importance. Last but not least, the Polish Immigration Home of New York. All we need is a start in this direction. An example of this kind would get the societies of other cities to fall in line. We suggest that each member contribute twelve cents each month for the three named organizations. This money would then be divided in the following manner: Five cents for the Polish Welfare Association, five cents for the Kosciusko Monument Foundation, and two cents for the Polish Immigration Home in New York. Taking three thousand members as an average, the total monthly contribution would amount to $360, which would be <span class="page-break">\9</span>divided as follows: $150 for the Polish Welfare Association, $150 for the Kosciusko Monument Foundation, and $60 for the Polish Immigration Home in New York.</p>
   <p>If we were to take 12,000 society members in the United States as an average, each to contribute two cents, the Polish Immigration Home in New York would receive two hundred forty dollars each month. This amount, of course, would not solve the financial problem of the Home, but it certainly would be better than sporadic donations of twenty-five or fifty dollars. There are only a few who take it upon themselves to send in a few dollars to the Home now and then. A constant but definite amount each month would be much better if this institution is to operate more effeciently.</p>
   <p>The Polish Welfare Association, organized during the early part of this year, <span class="page-break">\10</span>has, as of today, about one hundred twenty-five members paying one dollar each every three months. The income derived from dues, therefore, does not exceed five hundred dollars a year. One can readily see that this sum is insufficient to take care of even the very poor. Not even a Solomon can help the poor if his coffers are empty.</p>
   <p>If our societies in Chicago would take to heart the interest of this benevolent institution, it would receive eighteen hundred dollars annually in contributions. This sum would at least take care of the emergency cases among our poor citizens.</p>
   <p>Five cents each month from each of the twelve thousand members in Polish societies in America would bring in yearly seven thousand two hundred dollars for the Kosciusko Monument Foundation. With such annual contribution, the proposed statue could be erected in a short time. The rest of the yearly income could be used for other purposes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>As long as we persist in following our personal inclinations, limiting our activities to small groups, nothing will be accomplished and all our earnest efforts will come to naught. At present, winter is approaching. The condition of our needy will become worse; their needs will be greater. It is our duty, therefore, to aid these unfortunate souls. None of us would become penniless by contributing twelve cents each month. With this money assistance could be given to many a poor individual and many a child could be comforted, the erection of the monument could be realized much sooner, and the Polish Immigration Home in New York could get constant support.</p>
   <p>If all of us would take this proposal into consideration and become sponsors of this plan, we would fulfill the requirements of the paragraph that appears in our constitutions, and we would be able to say with pride that we are patriots.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>Perhaps someone else has a better idea to alleviate the wants of our people. If so, we will welcome it. What we want is action, not words. We invite all the other Polish papers of Chicago to express their opinions on the matter.</p>
   <p>These ideas are not written for the purpose of telling the people what to do; they are intended to give the people of good will an opportunity to study them and present them for further deliberation at the meeting of their societies.</p>
