   <p>St. Casimir's society of the same parish, located on Chicago's west side, near 22nd and Whipple Streets, has consented to donate fifteen dollars towards the Kosciuszko Monument Fund at its quarterly meeting held March 27. The organization as a whole is small in membership, however, when the question of the Monument Fund was brought up, every member strongly favored its support. "Although the contribution is not large", stated Joseph Grzegorzewski, secretary, "the feeling in which it was given is great. We wish that the proponents of this patriotic project succeed.</p>
   <p>With the energy expanded by the directors of the association, early completion of the drive is imminent. The Polish patriotic spirit in America will show other nationalities that they, too, honor their great heroes. Every true Pole should not veer an inch from this course," concluded the secretary.</p>
