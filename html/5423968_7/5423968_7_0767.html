   <p>Last week the Holy Family Orphanage received two unusual donations. One came from Valentine Pyterek, the other from an unknown visitor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pyterek, who celebrated his fiftieth birthday recently, contributed fifty dimes as a token to God for letting him reach the half century mark. The Orphanage wishes him another fifty years of life.</p>
   <p>A young gentleman visited the place last Tuesday and, upon leaving, pressed something into the hand of one of the girls. She in turn gave the bill to Sister Maria Rosamunda. The bill turned out to be ten dollars.</p>
   <p>Donations of any sort are always welcome.</p>
