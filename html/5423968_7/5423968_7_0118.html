   <p>The Fraternal Aid Society can be considered a corporation or an organization that was founded to assist its members and beneficiaries.</p>
   <p>This aim was also adopted by the Polish Alma Mater, for it brings the Polish men and women of the Roman Catholic faith closer together. But this alone was not enough; therefore, this society has fostered from its inception the uplifting of the soul and of christian morals, and the betterment of citizenship.</p>
   <p>It also has adopted the following principles:</p>
   <p>Better cultivation of culture and patriotism, rendering assistance to members in their various shortcomings, and death benefits.</p>
   <p>Meetings are held in order that the members may acquaint themselves with each other, and promote better friendship and co-operation. Every member, both male and female, is urged to take part in the administration of the organization. It is not enough for the same officers to hold office time and again. Competition for the various positions is always welcomed with good spirit. This gives others an opportunity to show what they can do to help the society expand.</p>
   <p>Fraternal aid societies have been in existence since the days of Solomon. In their earlier forms they were secret clubs; membership in them was forbidden under the threat of death. Today anyone can freely belong to a society of this kind or any other without any fear of punishment, and it is considered a crime, so to speak, not to belong to one. At the present time there are various kinds of cliques and groups, many of which are considered bad, immoral, and culpable. These will exist as long as we have people living in this world who are of a disreputable character, and they will always try to harm the work of good organizations.</p>
   <p>In the United States there are over sixty well-known organizations that have been founded on the principles of administering brotherly assistance. These societies represent a membership of sixteen million. How many more there are of this nature that are not affiliated with these groups is hard to  determine. A majority of the members are insured so that the heads of their families or beneficiaries are left with some means to cover their funeral expenses.</p>
   <p>These brotherly organizations not only teach us to visit the sick, but to render assistance to those who have been left without means because of a death in the family. If a word of consolation helps an ill person on the road to recovery, it must be remembered that a few kindly words will steer a stray person back to the road to Christianity. To compute the figures of kindliness extended by these fraternal societies would take a score of mathematicians.</p>
   <p>Attention is called to the fact that young men and women members are urged to participate in the many debates and discussion groups. They should take care not to bring any disgrace to the society by any immoral actions. Their clubs should always be regarded with the greatest respect and should be defended whenever occasion calls for it.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let every Polish fraternity and sorority continue to exist and prosper. Let both continue to expand. Long live the Polish Alma Mater!</p>
