   <p>The Polish Hospital, located on Division Street and run by the Sisters of Nazareth, received its first patient yesterday. The patient is a 6 years old boy by the name of Stanislaus Bober, who lives with his father and stepmother on Fleet Street.</p>
   <p>Bober fell off the second-story porch, broke his leg and hurt his head. A police patrol wagon took him to Alexian Brothers Hospital but the authorities there refused to take him in. The police then took him to the Polish Hospital where he was admitted. He is a free patient because his father is not only poor but is unemployed at the present time.</p>
