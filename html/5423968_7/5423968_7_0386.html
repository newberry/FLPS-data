   <p>Not so long ago a woman died. She was a member of the Polish Catholic Union. She was insured with the Polish Union for $425; her beneficiary was a poor mother in the old country.</p>
   <p>The society ordered a funeral and sent the bill to the administration of the Union for $273.</p>
   <p>The bill was, for casket, $125; eight carriages, $48; wreaths, flowers, and the potation (drowning of sorrows), etc.</p>
   <p>Where is the sense? Spending the money of the poor mother in the old country. This is a thoughtless crime. It is the duty of the administration of the Union to stop such expensive funerals for the sake of the beneficiaries.</p>
