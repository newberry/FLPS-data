   <p>The name of the Polish organization until recently known as the Polish Welfare Association has been changed to the Polish Child Welfare Association. The board of this our most important welfare organization, met yesterday, at the Morrison Hotel at 1 P.M. The work of this organization, touches upon, and affects all Polish social and community life.</p>
   <p>The committee to investigate all court cases involving Polish children, is composed of the following members: M. Szymczak, Kvolik, Fr. Tomczak, M. Midura. The chairman of this committee in his report, stated that at the present time, there are many Polish children involved in court cases in which our aid is very necessary, he also asked how many of these cases are we willing to assist. The board ordered the committee, to take charge of all children's cases.</p>
   <p>The changing of the name of this association, and widening of the scope of its activities were also thoroughly discussed. It was pointed out that the present name was not fully significant of the work the association was doing. The name, Polish Child Welfare Association, and Polish Juvenile Welfare Association, were suggested; the former title was favored, but it was decided to discuss the matter more thoroughly, at another meeting, today at the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>It was also decided, that all other Polish and American organizations, interested in child welfare, be invited to participate, and co-operate with us.</p>
