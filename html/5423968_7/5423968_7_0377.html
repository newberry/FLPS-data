   <p>The thing is happening on the seventh floor of a skyscraper known as the Temple Building, 108 S. La Salle St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>On the door I see an inscription in gold letters, "Polish Union Fire Insurance Co."</p>
   <p>I enter in an American way, without knocking on the door.</p>
   <p>"How do you do? Is Mr. ....."</p>
   <p>"How are you?" I hear the pleasant voice of the president of the company. He is Mr. Jozwiak.</p>
   <p>"I wish to gather some information for the Narod, Mr. Jozwiak, about the new enterprise."</p>
   <p>"Have a seat, please. In what way can I serve you?"</p>
   <p>"How is business going?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, well, just as at the beginning. We have some wonderful prospects. Large heaps of letters seeking information, which we answer with pleasure."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"I congratulate you, gentlemen. Congratulate you, I say, and I hear about your company always and I read the splendid articles on this subject."</p>
   <p>"Is that so?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, it is so. The Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo newspapers have written about the need of a Polish fire insurance company, even some of the newspapers in Pennsylvania have reprinted the article of the Narod on the subject."</p>
   <p>"That makes us happy," says Mr. Jozwiak, "but which one of the papers in Buffalo wrote about us?"</p>
   <p>"The Daily for Everybody."</p>
   <p>"That shows that Dr. Franczak is always active and enthusiastic."</p>
   <p>"And now down to business. Mr. J. will you please tell me if your company is incorporated and under what laws?"</p>
   <p>"So," rings the answer, "our company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois for the sum of one million dollars."</p>
   <p>"Have you already received the charter?"</p>
   <p>"Yes, we have received it during the last few days."</p>
   <p>"How much are the shares?"</p>
   <p>"Twenty dollars."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Are the shares already in circulation?"</p>
   <p>At this point Mr. Jozwiak calls on Mr. Welsh, manager of the share sales, whom he charges with giving full information to the editor.</p>
   <p>"Then," I ask further, "how many shares have been sold?"</p>
   <p>"Oh! Quite a number."</p>
   <p>"To whom do you sell the shares?"</p>
   <p>"What do you mean 'to whom'?"</p>
   <p>"Well, to the rich or the poorer class?"</p>
   <p>"Not to the rich, because they already wanted to buy out the whole company, but to the poorer class because each one of them looks upon the company as their own."</p>
   <p>"And how many shares do they buy?"</p>
   <p>"Oh, ten twenty. Because we would rather sell to one hundred thousand one share apiece than to ten persons ten thousand shares apiece."</p>
   <p>"Will this be a Polish company?"</p>
   <p>Here already Mr. Jozwiak answers and that with emphasis.</p>
   <p>"Yes, we are pushing toward that and are organizing a purely Polish company.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Outsiders have taken enough out of us, it is time to think of saving the Polish 'skin'!"</p>
   <p>"Commendable! But has your organization support?"</p>
   <p>"Naturally! You know the 34th annual convention of the Polish Roman Catholic Union raised this matter in resolutions. Some of the officials of the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman-Catholic Union and the Society of Poles in America, and others, are warmly supporting this matter." "That's good, but whom will you lean upon for the well being of the company and its development? Will we have our representatives in other cities, and your branch offices?"</p>
   <p>"That is a thing of the future. We wish that building companies, real estate agencies and Polish business men occupy themselves with this matter as their own for the benefit of the Poles in general. As to further questions I judge that in the near future about 200 or 300 Polish agents will begin to work in different cities for their Polish company of ours, where we also will open up offices. We will conduct everything in a business way."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"Bravo! And one more question. Where did you get the most applications from?"</p>
   <p>"So far I must congratulate you. Narod Polski beats all records."</p>
   <p>"Thank you for your acknowledgment and good by."</p>
   <p>"Good by, please come oftener," ends Mr. Jozwiak.</p>
   <p>Efesbe.</p>
