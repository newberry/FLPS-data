   <p>As a result of notices appearing in Dziennik Chicagoski, a collection for the strike victims in Lemont has already been started. To date, the total donations, including five dollars from the Polish Publishing Company, amount to twelve dollars and fifty cents. We appeal for further donations. Each donation will be recorded in this paper and sent on to Lemont. We repeat: God will remember every offering for the relief of the unfortunate.</p>
