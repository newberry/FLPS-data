   <p>Very Rev. Dear Mr. Zapala:</p>
   <p>I have appointed a day and I have written an appeal for the collection to be taken in this diocese for the war sufferers in Poland.</p>
   <p>I am sending you a copy of the letter to be translated into the Polish language.</p>
   <p>But I realize how pressing is the need and how help is needed as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>In order to cooperate with this worthy charity and to show my deep sympathy with this work of relief, I am enclosing a personal donation from my own slender savings in the East.</p>
   
   <p>I wish I were able to make it ten times as large for I know no charity that is more deserving or people who will appreciate this assistance more than the poor suffering people in Poland.</p>
   <p>I hope you may find many in Chicago more able, and for that reason more generous for your people.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours in Christo,</p>
   <p>George W. Mundelein</p>
   <p>Archbishop of Chicago</p>
   <p>Personal check for amount of $1,000.</p>
