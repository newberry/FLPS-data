   <p>The beautiful drama "Gwiazda Syberyj" (Star of Siberia) was presented yesterday at the School Hall on Bradley Street for the benefit of the Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>The leading role was played by Mrs. Ladislava Czajka (nee Miss Chlebowski), who executed it in a professional style. Her acting was excellent and received great applause.</p>
   <p>The masculine roles were played splendidly. Some of them had been given to new amateurs, which was a great surprise to the public. John F. Smulski, in his role of "Grawiczyna," played just like a professional. L. Zahajkiewicz made an exquisite, intelligent, and sympathetic "Casimir"; P. J. Grabowiecki played "Prince Anzelm" dramatically and with emotion; J. Nering made a splendid "Du Rocher"; Kafta, in his role of "Zdzislaw," did it excellently; and Domek, as "General Tatrov," was good too. Although to give the credit they deserve to all the amateurs we would have to describe the whole play, we cannot refrain from mentioning the names of Wieckowski and Kikulski, both of whom played their small roles of guards so well that the audience applauded.</p>
   <p>The play was a great success--the audience was large and the proceeds satisfactory.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski addressed the audience just before the play started. The honorable speaker pleaded for aid for the Polish Hospital in very convincing words, urging all people of good will to support it. He was rewarded with great applause.</p>
