   <p>A thirty-first consecutive bombing took place in Chicago yesterday. These bombings, which are causing great and small losses, injuring and at times killing people, continue despite the two-year search for the bombers by the police. There is some doubt as to their efficiency in the execution of their duties, although their efforts are constant. After each bombing the search is renewed with greater force, greater strength. We must believe this. However, the question is, how close are the police in solving the thirty-first bombing? How many more must occur before the guilty ones are brought to justice? When are the lives of the citizens to be protected and safeguarded by the police? When will it be safe for the people to participate in parades, conventions, and mass gatherings?</p>
   <p>After each bombing, when the wind blows the smoke away, certain facts appear to the keen-eyed observer. The twentieth bombing brought to light the fact <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that the police force is overburdened with work and should be immediately reinforced with more policemen. As the bombings continued, the voices for a larger police force became louder. After the twenty-ninth occurrence, it was estimated that 500 new policemen were needed to fill the present ranks, for the organized culprits were spreading out. The safety of the Chicago citizenry is at stake. The last two explosions succeeded one another in a very short lapse of time. Evidently, the heated search for the responsible persons, or the rapid increase in the police ranks, could not adjust itself to the pursuit, for no results were brought out. Now it is not known whether the thirty-second bombing will be prevented by our public officers. Will they say that they will catch-up with the gang, or will our governing heads add new taxes in order to increase the Chicago police corps, not by 500 persons, as was proposed after the twenty-ninth disaster, but by 1000? A witling could adjudge the Chicago police force, saying that it is much easier to protect the sly bombers than to search for them or patrol a strike or any other public duty of importance. Instead of relieving the public burden, they increase it. Whenever the city officials begin to talk of an increase <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in the police department, their pursuit of the bombers cools. Until the increase is realized by at least half of the last proposal, the bombing hazards will not be solved and the present police force will continue to be idle in this respect.</p>
   <p>Let us look upon the yearly report of the police sheriff, who evidently was discouraged by the poor showing of the police force and resigned from office. Out of 3,800 Chicago policemen, about 1,825 fulfill their duties in the more important precincts, where they patrol the busier streets. Having a natural fear of the dark streets, where crime has been constantly committed for years and never wiped out, they never enter them. The sheriff admitted that there was a shortage of police on the streets, for many of them occupy themselves in duties within the police organization, or are posted in the outlying police stations. Six officers are posted at the treasurer's office, where in reality there is nothing to be stolen. Many of the local police are stationed at railroad crossings, looking after the interest of large corporations, private interests, theaters, etc, These <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>corporations, or individuals, do not pay one cent for this protection. Shippy, the sheriff, also revealed that creating a larger police force, including a larger street beat, would be of great advantage. By sending out hundreds of officers out into the streets, instead of placing them to protect some private enterprise that can afford to pay for its protection, they could easily occupy themselves in solving the prevalent problems of crime. This is really a problem. Although the forces of crime make necessary an increased police department, such an increase is impossible due to shortage of funds.</p>
