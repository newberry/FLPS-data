   <p>Dear Brother Poles of Chicago:</p>
   <p>We have been without work for the past seven months because of the strike that has been called here in Pullman. The unemployment situation has brought upon us very trying conditions.</p>
   <p>The hardest hit are the Poles.</p>
   <p>Other foreign groups have long been re-employed, but we, unfamiliar with the English language and American ways, have a poor outlook, and chances for work are very meager. If they will change for the better it will not be soon.</p>
   <p>Consequently, we are suffering greatly in this crisis. Many of us deserve to be given assistance because many of us have wives and children while others <span class="page-break">2</span>are the sole support of the household. These wait from day to day for a charitable hand.</p>
   <p>With the approach of the Christmas season, we come to you, dear brothers for assistance in our unfortunate position. God will reward you a hundredfold for whatever you do for us.</p>
   <p>The representative of other nationalities always remember their people. There are among the Poles such individuals, as business and professional men, workers, etc., who will hear and come to our aid.</p>
   <p>The Forgotten Workers of Pullman.</p>
   <p>The undersigned vouches for the authenticity of the above appeal and wish to add that a pitiable condition prevails among the Polish people.</p>
   <p>Signed: Paul Andryczka</p>

   <p>The above facts are also confirmed by Dr. J. Goltz, Reverend P. T. Tinaworaz, and Reverend W. Zaleski. Urgent assistance should especially be given the A. Sypniewski family, 630 Fulton Street, Pullman, Illinois, for illness has enveloped this home for over three months.</p>
   <p>This family and all other Poles should be given a helping hand. We gladly support this appeal.</p>
