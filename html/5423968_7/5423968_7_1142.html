   <p>We have received the following letter, which is clear evidence of the remarkably sympathetic attitude of American women toward our country, devastated by war.</p>
   <p>Feb. 16, 1915</p>
   <p>Grand Forks, N. D.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Magdziarz</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Sir,</p>
   <p>Mr. Gewont of Minneapolis prevailed upon me a few weeks ago to hold a Tag Day in this city, for the Polish Relief Fund. I have been working energetically for that purpose, as I am entirely in sympathy with the cause, and finally managed to realize this plan today. The enclosed drafts to the total of $216.83, together with $12.50 paid for the boxes, and $6.50 for the tags, are the fruit of our labors. I do trust this amount will help appreciably to relieve the deplorable state of affairs in Poland. How do the people of America in general seem to respond to this appeal? Graciously, I hope.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Miss Pauline E.A.Reilly</p>
   <p>We know from other sources, that many other American women are sacrificing time and money and showing their sympathy by working for the cause of our country, the native country of Kosciuszko, and Pulaski.</p>
