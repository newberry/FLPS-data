   <p>Although frequent showers were prevalent throughout the city yesterday afternoon, the public began to enter the Union Hall at 5:00 P.M. and participate in the bazaar sponsored to aid the unfortunate people in Upper Silesia.</p>
   <p>Some of our outstanding Polish firms have set up decorated booths displaying their wares to the public. Raffles, games and gifts are featured at each displayer's booth.</p>
   <p>Veterans of Haller's army, in full regalia, were stationed at strategic points of the hall to give the public information about the various exhibits. Young ladies of the church societies in the neighborhood also volunteered their services. Dressed in the latest costumes of Krakow, they helped to promote the sales of Polish goods.</p>
   
   <p>At 8:00 P.M. members of Polish Sokol No. 2 began to entertain the many people gathered in the Union Hall. Their calisthenic routines brought great applause from the audience. Later, pictures of conditions in Upper Silesia were shown.</p>
   <p>At the buffet, Mr. Wieclaw, the proprietor of Danzig Restaurant, served the public.</p>
   <p>People in large numbers kept coming in throughout the evening. It was not until midnight that the hall began to be vacated.</p>
   <p>Information has reached the office of the committee that Mrs. Kwasigroch will sing at 7:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M. tonight. During the intervals she will participate in the sales of the wares.</p>
   <p>A special treat awaits the public tomorrow at the Union Hall. Miss Rydlinska, noted dramatic artist of Krakow, will display her artistic talent in a few dramatic sketches at 8:00 P.M.</p>
   
   <p>Miss Pawlowska, famous Chicago Civic Opera singer, will be a special guest Sunday, Dec. 18.</p>
   <p>The Kermis committee has received a letter from M. G. Kudlik, president of the Chicago Society, which reads in part as follows:</p>
   <p>"At a regular meeting of the Chicago Society, which has 150 members--war veterans--the society has joined forces with the Polish-American Veterans legion and will cooperate in making the Kermis a success. Plans for a bazaar will be dropped as a result. Instead, all the members will make an untiring effort to help the Polish-American Veterans swell the flow of contributions for the orphans and widows of Upper Silesia."</p>
