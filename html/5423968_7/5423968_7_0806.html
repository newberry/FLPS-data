   <p>An object of great importance, and about which, are concentrated many activities affecting the routine of the daily life of Poles in Chicago; and likewise, casting its friendly rays on every Polish settlement in America is the "Home" of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>It was opened on November 5th, 1913, and was built to shelter the general and administrative headquarters of the Union. It also provides the offices of a daily and a weekly newspaper, and a library service. Upon the completion of this edifice, the life of the immediate neighborhood adjusted itself to a new and quicker tempo of activity.</p>
   <p>During the trying years of the war, the "Home" became the Central figure of all enterprises in the interest of the independence of Poland. The present administration of the Union, is making every possible effort, and straining all of its energy, to check and prevent a decrease in membership. Therefore, by inaugurating membership drives, to increase its total membership the "Union" is creating sound, financial stability.</p>
   
   <p>From the ranks of Polish youth, the new members of this organization are recruited in such great numbers, that with every year the average age of members becomes lower. If, only, we contine this membership drive, we will be able to uphold the tradition of religion and the national interest in good government, in which name the Polish people have built many beautiful churches in America. We, likewise, by sustaining this high standard and ideal, create the assurance of an organized existence for many generations in the future.</p>
   <p>It is indeed fortunate, that this organization, as well as all similar organizations in America, have established a benefit insurance department for the children of its members. Without this department the organization would meet an untimely death; therefore, much attention is drected toward this new and most important unit.</p>
   <p>Disputes and differences among Polish organizations, created by competitive member-drives, belong to the past. Today there are no limitations, and among the many hundred thousands of children of Polish descent, they certainly have a vast field before them, and the possibilities of creating many-powerful organizations. Therefore, we see no reason for petty jealousies. They should be replaced with cooperation.</p>
