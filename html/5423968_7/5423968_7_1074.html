   <p>There is a great deal of good news concerning the Clothing Committee. Last week Mrs. Mary Sakowski, chairman of the Committee, received the following letter from Miss Mary Mickiewicz from Paris:</p>
   <p>"Dear Ladies:</p>
   <p>I hasten to inform you that I have received a case of clothing and gifts for Polish soldiers interned in France. This is a great blessing for these thousands of victims of the war. The constant obstacles imposed by the German government make it impossible for us to bring relief to the sufferers in our own country[Poland]. The French authorities, on the contrary,do everything possible to help in the distribution of packages sent to the Polish prisoners. The soldiers come in from the battlefields terribly emaciated and ragged. Our national colors, which they wear on the collars of the new uniforms they receive in exchange for their Prussian uniforms, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>engender good will toward the French people, but frequently these men are sent to work in the mountains where they would suffer great hardship from the cold were it not for the gifts from the United States. Your kindness and sympathy take care of other minor needs. God grant that these compatriots who are enduring such hardships may be able some day to thank the donors on our delivered native soil[Poland].</p>
   <p>"At present there is a great lack of milk for children. If you could send us milk in cans or in powdered form for the children, it would be of immense value here.</p>
   <p>With sincere gratitude and respect,</p>
   <p>Mary Mickiewicz</p>
   <p>Paris, January 7, 1917"</p>
   <p>A letter arrived simultaneously from Le Puy, France, expressing the sincere <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>gratitude of the Polish relief committee there for the clothing which was distributed among the Poles there. The letter was signed by President Grzebin and Secretary Leopold Jaroslawski.</p>
   <p>Here is evidence that the generosity of our community has not been wasted. These people in misfortune have received the things which the kind hearts of the Poles in America have donated.</p>
   <p>It is already known from previous reports that the Clothing Committee has sent more than a score of cases of clothing to France and a like shipment to Siberia. No acknowledgment has as yet been received from Siberia, but the shipping company has notified us that the ship carrying this shipment has safely discharged its cargo at Vladivostok.</p>
   <p>The work of the Clothing Committee is again running smoothly and energetically after the interruption caused by the Allied Bazaar, in which our women took an active part.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Donations to the Clothing Committee are also increasing. A few days ago Mrs. M. Milewski, treasurer of the Committee, received a sincere letter and a check for two hundred dollars from the members of the Emily Plater Society of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Group 564 of the Polish National Alliance. This is not this society's first contribution, and it holds promise of others in the future. This society is celebrating its fifteenth anniversary this month and expects to collect other contributions for our committee during the celebration.</p>
   <p>Truly kind and Polish hearts beat in the breasts of the members of the Polish Women's Society of the Polish Crown, Group 1594 of the Polish National Alliance, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. They have just sent in a second contribution, this one amounting to $6.50. Their secretary, Mrs. W. Skowronski, together with other ladies, is working energetically at selling tickets for the pianola which was given the Clothing Committee by Thaddeus Osada.</p>
   <p>The singing society Zorza (Dawn), a group of the Polish National Alliance <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in Schenectady, New York, sent a case of clothing, apologizing for the meagre gift. Would that there were as many as possible of such gifts and in a short time thousands upon thousands of our dear poor folk in Poland would be adequately clothed.</p>
   <p>The Clothing Committee thanks all donors for their generous gifts and counts on their continued support with even greater confidence, since it has proof that its work and the generosity of kindhearted Polish people is not going to waste. We ask you kindly to send all donations in care of our treasurer, Mrs. M. Milewski, 1406-08 West Division Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mary Sakowski, president</p>
   <p>Jane Dunin, secretary</p>
