   <p>The women's society, Star of Hope, Group III of the Polish Women's Alliance, gave a "pipe ball" on Sunday, November 5. [Translator's note: a"pipe ball" is a ball at which the cotillion favors include pipes for the gentlemen.] An unusually large number of people attended.</p>
   <p>This society, although organized only a few months ago, is developing rapidly, and has at present almost 150 members. The well-known energy and activity of this society, together with the novel idea of the ball, accounts for the large attendance.</p>
