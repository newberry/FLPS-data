   <p>Indications are that within the near future unpleasant misunderstandings at the Polish Hospital, caused in part by the inability of the Polish doctors to practice a few hours at the hospital and in part by the unwillingness of some doctors to offer their services, will be eliminated.</p>
   <p>The sisters of Nazareth have invited Dr. W. A. Kuflewski to serve in the hospital. The invitation was accepted and Dr. Kuflewski will be at the hospital from 10 A. M. to 11 A. M. every day except Mondays and Thursdays. It is hoped that other Polish doctors will offer their services. We are convinced that many doctors would be glad to serve at the hospital but don't do it because they haven't the time.</p>
   <p>We are certain that the patients and all others who come to the Polish Hospital will welcome and consult Dr. Kuflewski.</p>
