   <p>The Polish National Alliance's Immigrants' Home is opened officially and can now perform the duties for which this institution was founded by the people of the Alliance. The opening of the Alliance's Home is a new step forward on our organization's path of national service.</p>
   <p>The Polish immigrants in America have united under the Polish National Alliance's banner, not only for their own welfare and benefit and the welfare of members of this organization, but also for the motherland. The will of our people always was, and always will be, to have the Polish National Alliance serve high and noble national causes.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance has contributed its efforts in proportion to its growth and its strength. Whatever the organization had decided upon it has always carried out.</p>
   
   <p>One of the first and greatest duties of immigrants already settled in a foreign land has always been, and always will be, caring for new arrivals from our motherland in their most difficult moments--the first days of their stay in a strange land. Every Polish immigrant has passed such moments and remembers them. The care we give can be, and should be, of various forms. One immigrant needs assistance during the official formalities of the immigration authorities. Another needs free shelter after he arrives at a city and before he finds proper employment. A third and fourth have addresses of people close to them, but do not know how to reach them. All of them taken together are exposed to abuse on the part of evil people; they are in need of advice and protection.</p>
   <p>No one can understand and feel this better than the members of the Polish National Alliance, a majority of whom have had to go through all these difficulties. It was with this thought in mind that the Alliance people decided at their Fifteenth Convention, at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to organize protection for new arrivals and to erect a shelter for them.</p>
   
   <p>A considerable amount of time has passed since the Fifteenth Convention. Hundreds and thousands of dollars grew out of the pennies of our people, until, finally, the time came when it was possible to purchase a building and land in a city where real estate is most expensive, but also where it is a very good investment.</p>
   <p>The innumerable rules and requirements of federal and local authorities necessitated a thorough reconstruction of the building purchased and the settling of many formalities. The Polish National Alliance was anxious to settle this matter as quickly as possible, but the authorities were not in as great a hurry. The administration of the Polish National Alliance has done everything that was expected of it. At every meeting there was discussion of the incessantly mounting difficulties, letters were sent wherever necessary, representatives were sent to New York, and efforts were exerted everywhere until, finally, all obstructions and difficulties were removed.</p>
   
   <p>Whoever does not know the extent of these difficulties, how many explanations and answers had to be made to various questions and requests for information, and the amount of work and patience required, will perhaps complain about the delay of a month or several weeks. But that is a secondary matter.</p>
   <p>Here, then, is an accomplishment standing before the people of the Alliance, before the entire nation. The goal has been reached. The home is magnificent and expansive; it is furnished with the most discriminating taste, provided with everything, and served by honest and competent people. A good and worthy work has been started.</p>
   <p>May God bless this work, and may God bless the Polish National Alliance for undertaking this work, which it will conduct conscientiously and capably.</p>
