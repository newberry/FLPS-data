   <p>Poles in Chicago, in the south central part of the city, always had the idea and ambition to construct a Polish hall in their section of the town. A few weeks ago they purchased four lots, on which there shall stand the Polish hall. Friday, the 15th of November, there was an unusual meeting, at which they chose nine directors. They are Mr. Napieralski, Smietanka, Blaszezynski, Drzymaly, Rosanski, Grzegorzewski, Fruzyn, Marcinkowski, and Maciejewski.</p>
   <p>They formed an organization under the name of Pulaski Hall Builders Organization. To this organization in that part of town various groups, organizations, likewise church, gymnastic organizations and the Polish Falcons No. 1, joined in. Good luck.</p>
