   <p>The Pulaski Hall building organization, is arranging, the first of January 1893, a public opening of the first Polish hall here in this city, built on Ashland Ave., No. 796 - 800. Invitations were sent to various organizations. The event shall begin at two in the afternoon. The Hall Builders Organization requested the presence of famous speakers also the Chopin Choir who shall donate their art in singing nationally known songs.</p>
   <p>We do hope that we shall be able to please everyone. After the so-called concert and speeches there shall be dancing. Many Poles shall spend their New Year's day gayly here at this event, also having the opportunity of meeting others from different sections of our town. We firmly believe that this event will prove to be very successful.</p>
