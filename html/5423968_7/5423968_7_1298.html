   <p>The showing of moving pictures at the parish hall of St. Adalbert's, 16th and South Paulina Streets, has met with great success. The committee has obtained excellent pictures, and the hall is packed at almost every performance. The pictures are shown every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday afternoon and evenings, and the proceeds go to help the poor of this parish. This is a very good cause and the Poles of St. Adalbert's parish and vicinity should support these performances. A special committee, which investigates every needy family, is in charge of the proceeds.</p>
