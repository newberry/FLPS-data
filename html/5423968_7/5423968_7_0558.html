   <p>On March 2, 1892, Polish doctors practicing medicine in Chicago held a meeting, the first of its kind, to organize a society of Polish doctors in Chicago. Dr. Bruno Strzyzowski was named secretary of this newly formed group.</p>
   <p>Among the matters discussed, we came to the conclusion that the congratulatory notices made public by patients who have been cured of illness do not tend to elevate the level of medicine. Since they appear frequently, we are making it public so that Poles will have an understanding of this resolution. Hereafter, we will consider this kind of publicity injurious to our profession and in no way an honor.</p>
