   <p>A fire insurance company, organized by Poles not very long ago under the name of Great Lakes Fire Insurance Company, with capital of $200,000 and surplus of $200,000 is growing rapidly. In the first ten months of business they wrote insurance for $2,683,891 with premiums of $36,402.14. In January there was a meeting of stockholders where 17,000 shares were represented by 200 shareholders. At that meeting the sum of $500 was donated for needy war victims in Poland. On January 24th the newly elected directors met and, taking into consideration that the work of old officers was very satisfactory and business conducted economically, they elected the same officers by acclamation.</p>
   <p>The elected officers are:</p>
   <p>N. L. Piotrowski, president; A. Wachowski, vice-president; J. Smietanka, secretary, and J. F. Smulski, treasurer.</p>
