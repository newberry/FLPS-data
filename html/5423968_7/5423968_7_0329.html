   <p>The Polish Welfare Association under the guidance of St. John Kanty, organized at St. Stanislaus Kostki's Parish, is working in the best possible manner to alleviate the hardships faced by our people within the locality.</p>
   <p>Thomas Krolik, financial secretary, gave a complete report of the accomplishments of the Association at the regular monthly meeting of directors last night. Fall details will not be revealed until next week when a meeting of the members will be held. It is sufficient to say that the organization has lifted the burden of despair of a few truly deserving families. On the other hand, a number of persons who have applied for aid under the pretext of utter destitution have been exposed as frauds.</p>
   <p>An agreement was reached at the directors' meeting to give assistance to school children, who are deprived of the bare necessities, so that they <span class="page-break">2</span>may attend classes regularly. Whenever a school child's family, after a thorough investigation, warrants assistance it will be given.</p>
   <p>At the quarterly meeting of the members next Sunday, cards will be issued which were proposed at a previous session and which were mentioned in an article of the Dziennik Chicagoski. The following information will enlighten those who do not understand the purpose of the cards.</p>
   <p>Every member of the welfare organization will receive cards bearing the full name and address of the society. The members are to give out these cards instead of money to beggars or others who accost them for alms. The office hours of the Association are plainly printed upon these cards, and anytime during these hours the recipient can call upon the financial secretary for help. Whenever one of these cards is issued to one asking for assistance and that individual cannot read, information about the organization should be given verbally, including when and where to call.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The financial secretary is duty bound to take the name and address of any person who comes to his office for assistance. This is done in order to enable the investigators to check up and determine whether or not aid should be given. In the event of an emergency, the person asking for help will receive a few cents or dollars, depending upon the circumstances. A careful check up will immediately follow. The contents of the report will be the deciding factor as to whether the assistance will be continued or not.</p>
   <p>Every card given to a member will have a value of five cents. Each member will receive these cards in proportion to his contribution or payment to the Association. That is, if he has given a dollar he will receive twenty cards in return. These cards, however, will be valueless to the pauper who receives them. No matter how many cards are presented to the financial secretary by any one person, he will receive the same treatment as the person who brings in only one card.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Cards can also be obtained by those who are not members of the organization. Twenty will be issued for a dollar. It will be a grand gesture if all those persons who from time to time give money to beggars would purchase blocks of these tickets and give them out in lieu of money. In this way our streets would be clear of beggars and panhandlers in a short time. Those virtually in need of help will be gladly looked after.</p>
   <p>The Polish Welfare Association as yet does not have a sufficient number of members in order to continue this work on a substantial scale. The present funds make it possible to take care of only emergency cases. During the past four months, the members have only contributed two hundred and forty dollars. This money was handled in a very efficient way by the officers. In order for this welfare work to continue on a larger scale, it is necessary to have more members in the Association. The more members, the more contributions and the more help will be rendered. Because of this lack of membership we are disclosing the following important matter in the hope that it will bear abundant fruit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Offerings to the organization need not be in the form of money. Bread, flour, coal, clothing, shoes, etc., will be accepted for such necessities are needed. Any old clothing in need of repair will also be accepted. In order to save on space, handling of articles, and repair, it has been decided that it would be better if the donors would pledge so many pounds of flour, sugar, etc. As soon as such pledges are received by the secretary, they will be entered in a book. Those receiving help will get requisitions for whatever commodity is needed. Then they will go to the one who has pledged to give these articles to the Association. Only the amount pledged for a month or a year will be given out. Careful bookkeeping will avoid unnecessary overdrawals.</p>
   <p>Thus, if a proprietor of a shoestore pledges five pairs of shoes per year for destitute children, the financial secretary of the Welfare Association would make a record of this. During the course of a year requisitions for only five pairs of children's shoes would be issued, to be given out by this kind storekeeper. The more pledges of this nature that are received, the more people who are destitute will be assisted.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In this same way a butcher can donate so many pounds of meat, a grocer so many pounds of flour, salt, etc., a baker a stipulated amount of bread, a clothier a given amount of trousers, a coaldealer a certain amount of coal, etc. Such pledges would be beneficial to the Association and the poverty-stricken as well.</p>
   <p>We trust that our owners and patronizers of such stores will approve of this method of contribution and will generously send in their pledges. It is a very simple way of becoming a goodfellow. All those desiring to make donations of such a nature are requested to send in their pledges through the mail, or call in person at the office, located at Noble and Bradley Streets.</p>
   <p>We hope that the quarterly meeting, scheduled for next Sunday afternoon, will include every member and hundreds of others who are interested in giving a helping hand to those in need.</p>
   <p>Further information about the Polish Welfare Association can be secured at the office of the financial secretary, located at Noble and Bradley streets, and at the office of Stanislaus Szwajkart, 143 W. Division street.</p>
