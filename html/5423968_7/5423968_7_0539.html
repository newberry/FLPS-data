The following persons were chosen as members of the executive committee: Mr. A. Kowalski, Mr. T. Krolik, Mr. Albert Jedrzejek, Mr. Frank Wleklinski, and Reverend Vincent Barzynski. Mr. B.

   <p>The next meeting to discuss further arrangements will be held on Friday January 12, at the Bank Hall. Since the benevolent aim of this undertaking deserves the Poles' wholehearted support, we are positive that they will contribute towards the realization of this good work.</p>
