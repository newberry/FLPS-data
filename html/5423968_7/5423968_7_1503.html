   <p>We again appeal to our citizens that they should condescend to join the Welfare Association in greater numbers, and support it more effectively than has been done heretofore.</p>
   <p>To remind the people of the conditions of enrollment into the Association, we mention here that a regular member of the Association pays $1.00 initiation fee, and then he pays $1,00 dues every three months. However, whoever cannot or does not wish to bind himself with quarterly payments and yet wishes to aid the Association in its work, can become a benefactor of the Association by either making a single financial payment of any type or by strengthening the Association through contributions of food, clothes, shoes, coal, and the like. One can come at any time, without even waiting for a quarterly meeting, to the financial secretary, Mr. Thomas Krolik, or to the recording secretary, Mr. Stanley Szwajkart.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Whoever wishes to become a regular member of the Association will have an excellent opportunity to do so tomorrow, Sunday, because at four o'clock in the afternoon, a quarterly meeting of the Association will be held and [a report of] the activities up to the present time will be read.</p>
   <p>Thus far the Association does not possess any so-called benefactors, and as far as regular members are concerned, they are comparatively few. Why? We are unable to explain this to ourselves, especially since we are convinced that there are many among us who are sensitive to the miseries and needs of the poor and who could at the same time aid if they wanted to. It may be that the Association gives little evidence of itself, it too rarely appeals to the compassion of the citizen: in the future this condition will be so much better that in accordance with the decision of the directors, the reports of the activities of the Association will be printed every week in the Dziennik.</p>
   <p>"Let everyone assist the poor with whatever he can." Everyone knows that there <span class="page-break">\3</span>is a great deal of undeserved misery and need among us; but those, who, as officials of the Association, have had an opportunity to observe this misery from closer quarters now know more about this situation. Ailing widows, with several and often as many as eight young children; an entire unfortunate family that as a result of various adversities is compelled to sustain itself from the meager earnings of a twelve-year-old child; the aged and lame, completely unable to work--finally, many people troubled with a burdensome affliction who need assistance only temporarily and will willingly repay the loan as soon as they find the opportunity and strength to work and to whom such aid caused an indescribable benefaction, saving them from despair, at times from death and again from crime--such people are always among us. Many of us, could aid them and many of us know, and all of us should know that: "blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy." Many of us would never feel a shortage of any kind if we placed a sacrifice upon the altar of Christian compassion. Why do we not hurry with assistance to them? Has the pursuit of the American dollar cooled our feeling of Christian love?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Let everyone assist the poor with whatever he can." Let the advertisement, presented in today's edition, entitled: "An Opera In A Room," serve as an example. Such means and methods, if one searched, could be found in abundance. The amateur who presents the already mentioned advertisement, during the course of eight weeks, expects to collect at least $5.00 per week for the poor. He sacrifices a few hours of his time and a bit of effort for this, and thus he will be able each week to wipe away the tears of four families. The effort is small but the merit of the deed will be inscribed to his benefit and may in the future serve to erase some errors from his book of life.....</p>
   <p>For many of our people even less effort would be required in order to find favor before God.</p>
   <p>What damage would a grocer sustain, for example, if he notified secretary Krolik, that he was ready, upon the recommendation of the Welfare Association, to give away gratis several dozens of eggs or ten pounds of flour for a period of one year? What loss would there be to a baker if he bound himself to donate a certain number of loaves of bread during a period of a year, upon the recommendation <span class="page-break">\5</span>of the Association? Would it be a loss to a doctor if he were to notify the secretary that he would give medical assistance in so many instances to persons taken care of by the Association--or to a druggist if he were to issue a certain amount of medicine free, or at a very cut rate? Or would it be a loss to a proprietor of a shoe store, if he were to give away a certain number of pairs of shoes to the children of the poorest families attending school.</p>
   <p>We have various associations to which we pay our dues annually for the purpose of personally obtaining some profit from them, so that either our money will be compounded or that we may obtain assistance in time of illness and that our family may receive a small fund after our death; we can also afford to maintain the association into which the dues paid will wipe away the tears of the poor and needy, and will repay us morally. Let us not forget about this Association!</p>
