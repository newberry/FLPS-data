   <p>In Avondale there has been in existence for some time the Thaddeus Kosciusko Citizens' Club, which does a great deal of good for the poor families in this district. This club has announced that any person needing help should apply to one of the club's directors, and the welfare committee, composed of five members of the club, after a thorough investigation of the case, will lay it before the alderman. This is a very praiseworthy endeavor,and will no doubt prevent many abuses.</p>
