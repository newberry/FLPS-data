   <p>During the past two weeks, that is, on the twentieth and twenty-eighth of this month, two meetings were held for the purpose of organizing a Polish women's society to assist in the work of the Polish Welfare Society and the Patriotic Organization of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>After the matter had been thoroughly explained by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski to a gathering of Polish women of the Northwest Side, twenty-four women undertook to organize such a society and proceeded to formulate a constitution which would set forth its aims more clearly.</p>
   <p>The name "Polish Women's National Welfare Society, affiliated with the Patriotic Organization of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish of Chicago," was agreed upon.</p>
   <p>The new society will co-operate with the Polish Welfare Society and the Patriotic Organization, or with other male organizations of Chicago, primarily on the Northwest Side, (1) in raising the standard of living among the Poles, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>(2) in enlightening and educating the Polish youth, and (3) in spreading patriotism.</p>
   <p>After these aims which the new society had set for itself were accepted, it was decided to forego further discussion of the constitution until future meetings and to proceed at once to organize the most important committee, which will be known always as the first committee of the first division of this society. Since the first division has taken upon itself the task of raising the standard of living among the Poles, its first and most necessary committee is the Welfare Committee. Reducing poverty among the Poles is the first step to be taken in raising their standard of living. The task of the Welfare Committee is to bring relief to poverty-stricken countrymen of the Northwest Side, especially to widows, orphans, and disrupted families.</p>
   <p>The duties of the members of the Society are as follows:</p>
   <p>Every member who hears of an unfortunate Polish family, especially on the Northwest Side, is in duty bound to acquaint herself with the details of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>case and to report her findings to the Welfare Committee, at its meeting. Meetings will be held every Monday at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>If a disrupted family or a sick individual without proper care is found in a community where no member of the society lives, the duty of caring for such family or individual will fall to the so-called "visitors," who will be part of the Welfare Committee's administration.</p>
   <p>The administration of the Welfare Committee will consist of a chairman, a vice-chairman, a recording secretary, a financial secretary, a treasurer, and four advisers, who will also act as visitors.</p>
   <p>At the meeting held on September 28, the following women were elected to office in the Welfare Committee:</p>
   <p>Joanna Maca, chairman; Josephine Kwasigroch, vice-chairman; Mrs. M. Hoffman, recording secretary; Anna Klarkowski, financial secretary; Frances Krolik, treasurer; and Rosalie Frank, Josephine Pyterek, Petronela Drozdowski, and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Agnes Krus, advisers.</p>
   <p>The next regular meeting will be held next Thursday at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Besides those mentioned above, the following Polish women are listed as members of the newly organized society: Matilda Blazek, M. Bartoszewicz, A. Tylkowski, Julia Schultz, Julia Molinski, Josephine Dudzik, Rosalie Domek, Rosalie Ostrowski, Victoria Kaczmarek, R. Kaminski, Anastasia Szemrowicz, Susanna Leszczynski, Josephine Weyna, Frances Zahajkiewicz, and Louise Szwajkart.</p>
