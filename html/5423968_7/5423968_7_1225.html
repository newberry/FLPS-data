   <p>Countrymen! More than two months ago, while the convention of the Alliance of Polish Falcons was being held in Buffalo, I addressed an ardent appeal entitled "Now or Never" to you and especially to the sincere young men of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, this would-be advance guard of ours. I urged them to begin active work for the homeland. Immediately I encountered disappointment: of the three newspapers to which I sent this appeal only Dziennik Zwiazkowy printed it--apparently inspired by objective patriotism. Dziennik Chicagoski was at that time under a pro-Austrian influence. With a great show of loyalty, it answered me with a letter from its editor that my article would violate the neutrality of the United States. Sokol Polski, although it had graciously printed several copies of the article for me, passed it over with dignified silence, as if the Constitution of the United States had been suspended.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Later I read in several Chicago papers about the "local fanatics" who exhort people to mad actions. I thought it useless to blow against this cold wind, which carried the smell of death and odious decay.</p>
   <p>But suddenly appeals came from people like Sienkiewicz, the "mystic" Lutoslawski, and Joseph Weyssenhoff, who magnificently developed the same idea as that propounded by the "local fanatics," who were burying themselves in the study of national matters.</p>
   <p>News came from all parts of Poland and, thank God, the stagnant pool of our ignorance began to move. The bubbles of phraseology are beginning to disappear from its surface and the strong wind blowing from the borders of the homeland is causing a reviving wave of activity. Various parties have united in the Polish Central Committee. Quarrels and party disputes are occurring less frequently in the press. The press, feeling itself truly Polish in spirit, has <span class="page-break">\3</span>abandoned personal quarrels and is calling the people to noble action for the benefit of the homeland.</p>
   <p>No longer against the wind, but now with the native wind, this cry rushes forth from a Polish heart: Countrymen! For the love of God save the homeland at this one and only opportunity. This is probably the first opportunity since Poland's fall: even Napoleon did not promise anything definite and the insurrections were merely impulses of despair. Today all of our friends and enemies recognize this moment as the only possible time to liberate our homeland.</p>
   <p>Therefore, you patriotic press, play as loudly as possible the morning call to awaken the spirit of patriotism, the spirit of generosity among our indifferent brethren--or rather among our not too well-enlightened brethren--so that they will offer not nickels, but real sacrifices on the altar of the homeland.</p>
   <p>Who doubts that the average working Polish-American laborer can contribute a <span class="page-break">\4</span>dollar a month for this Poland, burned, threadbare, hungry, fighting for its existence for the duration of the war, and for the reconstruction of the homeland thereafter. What about our businessmen and professional people? Will they not come forward with a contribution worthy of the cause?</p>
   <p>Societies and individual groups should appeal to the people in general to make voluntary contributions. These should be given by the donor not just to be let alone. Patriots in this country, both organizations and individuals, should prove that they are not just patriots in words: they should carry out this act with real sacrifice. Let them guide the drive but call upon the young people to carry it through, who with their greater enthusiasm and their larger numbers can reach all of the people. I do not believe that the generation born and raised here will deny the magnificent, though unfortunate, country of their fathers.</p>
   <p>Furthermore,I appeal to you brothers, the Polish clergy. You know the history <span class="page-break">\5</span>of our homeland. You know that when she was in need she always appealed to her spiritual leaders. They never disappointed her but always loyally contributed their tithes to the really needy homeland. Even the monastic orders, with the permission of their authorities, contributed from the monastic property and the church treasuries.</p>
   <p>We have no treasuries here, but we can afford to make a contribution. Therefore we, too, if we are worthy spiritual descendants of men like Olenski, Karnkowski, Krasinski, Skarga, and Kordecki, shall today place our tithes on the altar of the homeland with sincere enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>I think that the Alliance of Polish Clergy should propose this idea at the meetings of all of its groups, no matter who is to make this voluntary contribution. The contributions will be sent to our Bishops, who will place them on the altar of the homeland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The author has aged parents in the homeland and many brothers and sisters, practically all of whom are victims of the war, and he is obliged to help them. Nevertheless, although he has but one of the smaller parishes, he pledges that as long as the homeland continues in its present need, he will regularly contribute a tenth of his income to its cause. I mention this not for the purpose of self-praise, since I know the old saying propria laus sordet, but for the purpose of taking the initiative and showing that I not only can advise others but also can myself be an affectionate son of my homeland.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, brother clergymen, let us use all of our influence in our parishes in order to arouse a spirit of generosity among all of our countrymen. Let us help societies in their patriotic work regardless of our personal feelings. We were able to build numerous churches and schools for the glory of God and the Polish name. Let us inculcate in our people the basic virtues of love for the homeland and faith in it and, therefore, in God and our neighbor. Let us <span class="page-break">\7</span>help our oppressed homeland in its resurrection.</p>
   <p>May the mythical figure, Father Mark, who conceived the idea of the Polish clergy, this chaplain of Pulaski's "faith," in the trenches of Holy Trinity, encourage. us in this action. I know that the commanding tone of a certain worthy and patriotic organization does not appeal to all of our brother chaplains and that not all of them agree completely with the program of this organization. Therefore, I believe that no one should attempt to constrict us and that everyone should be allowed to work with the help of those organizations which are most convenient for him, as long as we are all striving toward the same goal.</p>
   <p>Finally, I turn to you, Polish Youth! Have you read the ardent appeals of the great Polish patriot and novelist Waclaw Gasiorowski to the censor of the Polish National Alliance and those of the painter Styka to Mr. J. F. Smulski? Have you seen the appeals of our great men like Sienkiewicz and others whom I mentioned <span class="page-break">\8</span>earlier in this article? If so, can you remain deaf to the voice of these experienced men, who are Poland's most loyal sons, who speak for the majority of the nation--who speak to you, as well as to others, or to you specifically? You Polish Falcons in free America, you Alliance of Polish Military Societies, do you hear the author of the epic novels Polish Legions calling to you? He tells you that your newspapers advise you to preserve your strength for the future and asks:</p>
   <p>"For what future? Do not allow yourselves to be deceived by any sort of words. Remember that if you continue to stay from here you will never get here. What is more, the heart (clapper) will fall out of the bell with which you used to summon the people to mass meetings. Your ranks will fall apart for centuries!"</p>
   <p>These words of his are inspired by love for the mother country, who is stretching her arms out of her grave toward you. If the call to action does not now sound in your ranks, if you cannot get your leaders to cry out "Forward march," <span class="page-break">\9</span>and if all of us do not supply you with the necessary equipment as master Styka did his sons Thaddeus and Adam--then shame to you and to us! Then denying Poland once and for all, you should throw down your swords and guns and your uniforms covered with glory by your forefathers and hurl yourselves together with the stunned mob into an abominable dance on the grave of the homeland.</p>
   <p>No! Surely no one will ever witness such a horrible sight, because love of the homeland burns within us all. Countrymen, for the love of God save the homeland without hesitation. Give money and counsel among yourselves, offer leadership and obedience, offer your blood and your lives. The situation has finally cleared for us and now all we need is action, so that our homeland will bless us some day, not curse us as a dead limb which has fallen from the trunk. Rockefeller, the old exploiter of the American laborer, has decided to feed starving Belgium; the American sons of all European peoples are sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to their countries in Europe; the German-Americans are <span class="page-break">\10</span>selling their wedding rings and valuable family heirlooms for the wealthy fatherland; a wealthy American who has learned to love Poland only through books has pledged to send a thousand dollars a month, and the Polish university students in Belgium have joined the Belgian colors to help the unfortunate Belgians fight the common enemy. Surely the four million Polish people in America will prove that they love their country not less but more. We will prove that all of us who are sons of unfortunate Poland love our knightly homeland more than the Germans love their bloodthirsty fatherland. The Polish people, the young Polish laborers, will prove that in matters concerning the homeland they are as well enlightened as the Polish university students and that they are worthy of shedding their blood at the side of the college students so that our beloved mother country may live.</p>
