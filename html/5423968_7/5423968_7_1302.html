   <p>Last Wednesday there was a concert and ball given with very successful results.</p>
   <p>The concert was well represented by a male and a female chorus as well as a mixed chorus.</p>
   <p>Among the public was the Democratic candidate for mayor of our city. Mr. Graham, who donated $100 for the benefit of our charity association, and his son, who gave $10. They explained that the donation was not given for any political purpose, but only for humanitarian reasons.</p>
   <p>Best wishes and success to all members of the above-mentioned association for the future.</p>
