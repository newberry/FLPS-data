   <p>The following announcement has been received from the Kosciusko Monument Fund Society, which is contemplating building a monument in honor of the Polish hero Thaddeus Kosciusko. The Society has recently announced a contest for a model of the monument, offering awards to the winners; it also has announced that the contest will take place on Polish soil, and that the monument will be made in the United States.</p>
   <p>The announcement reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The Kosciusko monument contest, which has been authorized and supported by our organization, will be announced in our native country by one of its outstanding institutions of art. This institution will be fully authorized to pass judgment on the models sent in by the contestants. The three most outstanding entries will be chosen for awards; the winners will receive the prize money accordingly. After the judges' announcements, the prize models <span class="page-break">\2</span>will be brought to Chicago and appraised for their artistic value. The committee, which will be appointed from competent judges of art, reserves the right to choose the one best suited to the proposed plans, regardless of priority in awards. This is the plan and method of carrying out our proposed contest.</p>
   <p>"After careful deliberation as to what part of occupied Poland and what great institution of art will be chosen to announce this contest, it was decided that Galicia was the most advantageous, for its political and cultural setup fosters the fine arts. This province has two institutions that not only support but have advanced plastic art.</p>
   <p>"It was also agreed, in order to facilitate and simplify the work involved in this contest, to have Dr. E. H. Dunikowski, now in America as a delegate of Poland, act as our representative. He has a permanent residence in Lwow, one of the educational centers of Galicia. We were bold enough to ask him to be our agent and to select the art institution that will conduct the <span class="page-break">\3</span>contest in Galicia. He graciously accepted this post and will act upon the choice of institution.</p>
   <p>"The undersigned wish to announce formally the procedure of the contest for a model of our immortal hero Thaddeus Kosciusko, which will be permanently placed in Chicago, Illinois, United States of America. The regulations are as follows:</p>
   <p>"1. Awards for the three best entries will be distributed in the following way:</p>
   <table>

    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Third prize</td>

     <td>"</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>Besides these awards, the judges of the contest may name a few for honorable mention.</p>
   <p>"2. The announcement of the details of the contest, method of choosing <span class="page-break">\4</span>entries, decision of awards by the judges, and all other matters pertinent to the contest, will lie solely in the hands of the institution announcing the contest. The Kosciusko Monument Fund Society reserves the right to add three outstanding artists, residing in the city where the contest is to be announced, to the committee of judges appointed by the institution conducting the contest. These appointments will specifically be made by the Society sponsoring this enterprise.</p>
   <p>"3. The prize money will be assigned to the institution conducting the contest prior to the closing date.</p>
   <p>"4. The Kosciusko Monument Fund Society is under obligation to cover the cost of the contest.</p>
   <p>"5. The fundamental conditions of the contest are as follows:</p>
   <p>"(a) The contestants' plastic models should comply with the specifications <span class="page-break">\5</span>announced by the institution conducting the contest.</p>
   <p>"(b) The plastic models should be sent anonymously, but numbered, and this number must correspond to the number sent in a separate envelope containing the true name of the author. Along with this, an estimate of the cost of the monument, without the foundation and wall, according to rates prevailing in Poland or Italy, should be included.</p>
   <p>"(c) The contest will be open until May 1, 1893. The judges' announcements will be made not later than May 15, 1893.</p>
   <p>"(d) The Statue is to consist of a life-size figure of Kosciusko astride a horse.....</p>
   <p>"(e) The recognition or award of first prize does not necessarily mean that a monument patterned after the winner's entry will be erected.</p>
   <p>"(f) The realization of the project will be possible only after a consultation with an artist of the Kosciusko Monument Fund Society of Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>"(g) The prize-winning models will become the property of the Society sponsoring the contest.</p>
   <p>"(h) The contest will be announced in Europe and America. All other details will be left with the institution announcing the contest.</p>
   <p>"6. The European representative of the Kosciusko Monument Fund Society of Chicago, sponsor of the model contest, will be Dr. E. H. Dunikowski, who has absolute authority to deal with any matters pertaining to the contest, to make changes in the above five rules, etc.</p>
   <p>"These are the stipulations of the contest which have been agreed upon by the undersigned.</p>
   <p>"By announcing this contest the undersigned feel that a step forward has been made. The ultimate aim is the realization of this project. Once again the undersigned feel it their duty to appeal to the Polish public at large <span class="page-break">\7</span>to help in this noble and patriotic cause, for only through the united efforts of the Polish people will it be possible to build the proposed statue. The widow's mite spurs others to contribute--this is what we want. Offer pennies for the statue, and with them we will prove that there are millions of us. In this way we will not humble ourselves among our kind or among strangers. Let us fulfill our duty and with its fulfillment will rise a beautiful bronze statue of our hero Thaddeus Kosciusko, on free soil on the hundredth anniversary of the Battle of Raclawice. [Translator's note: This battle took place on April 29, 1794, when Kosciusko called the Polish nation to arms after the second partition of Poland in 1793.]</p>
