   <p>A huge mass meeting, sponsored by the Kensington Civic Committee, was held on Sunday, September 22,1918, at Albert Cyplik's hall, 117th Place and Indiana Avenue. The purpose of the meeting was to give to the Poles of that district an opportunity to hear the reports of their delegates to the all-Polish convention recently held in Detroit and let them contribute to the Ten Million Dollar Polish Relief Fund. The Reverend Joseph Pajkowski, pastor of the local Polish Roman Catholic parish, presided over the meeting, and Mr. James Bzdek acted as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>After explaining the purpose of the meeting the chairman called upon Messrs. James J. Lewandowski and Felix Balcerkiewicz, the two delegates sent by the Kensington group, to give a report of their activities at the aforesaid convention. The reports were accepted with enthusiastic acclaim by all those present, and due recognition was expressed to the delegates for their work.</p>

Mrs. D. Suchomska then sang a solo, and Miss T. Smialkowski delivered a well-prepared declamation.
