   <p>A big parade of different Catholic societies and organizations presided at the consecration ceremonials, mainly the Knights of Columbus, the Catholic Order of Foresters and the Ancient Order of Hibernians. They met at 9:30 A. M. at the corner of Clark and Grace and paraded to await the arrival of His Excellency Archbishop J. E. Quigley. Before the parade and Archbishop J. E.

   <p>The new building will have four separate sections: in section one will be placed the unfortunate aged people who can spend the remainder of their life in peace and comfort; the second section is for women sent there by the criminal court; the third section will consist of young girls sent there by the court, and in the fourth section will be placed incorrigible children placed there by their parents.</p>
