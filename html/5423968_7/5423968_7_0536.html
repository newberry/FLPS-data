   <p>Plans for a fair for the Polish Hospital have been finally completed and the opening date has been set for January 13. The fair will be held at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. Proceeds from the fair will go toward the support of the Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>This noble cause ought to encourage all the Polish people to attend and support this endeavor. The needs of the Polish Hospital are great. The undersigned appeal to the Polish public at large and to all the Polish societies and Polish organizations to attend the fair. We trust that everyone will heed this call for help.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Polish societies that wish to attend the fair en masse are requested to get in touch with Boleslaw Klarkowski, secretary of the fair, in regard to setting a fixed date.</p>
