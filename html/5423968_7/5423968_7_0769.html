   <p>The following persons have sent in donations to the Holy Family Orphanage:</p>
   <p>Mr. Carol Machek, Chicago Avenue corner Milwaukee, sent a dozen sweaters for the boys; Mr. Frank Warczynski, $1; Mr. Joseph Stonk, $2.</p>
   <p>These kindly offerings are greatly appreciated. I wish to thank the kind priests of St. Stanislaus Kostki's Church who visited the Orphanage and so generously showered us with good hopes and donations for the children.</p>
