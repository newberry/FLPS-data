   <p>A director's meeting of the Polish Welfare Association was held yesterday at which W. Bardonski, the first vice-president, presided.</p>
   <p>According to the financial report of the financial secretary it was shown that the Association had a $291.80 income thus far, and that the expenses amounted to $184.85, so that the sum of $106.65 remains in the treasury. in twelve cases of extreme poverty and need it was recommended to issue relief in amounts ranging from $2.00 to $7.50; the total sum recommended to be paid out was $56.50. The sum of $50.15, therefore, will remain in the treasury. Since the bills for several printings are not as yet paid, they must be paid shortly, consequently, such a small amount will remain in the treasury that it would not suffice even for the most urgent necessities of the ensuing month.</p>
   <p>A quarterly mass meeting will be held on the coming Sunday and it is hoped that the quarterly membership dues will come in at that time. The administration of this association requests a most numerous attendance for this meeting, because the funds are exhausted and the needs are increasing. A request is also made to those who do not as yet belong to this association and have the feeling of obligation to offer aid for the needy and are in a position to bring this help, that they come to this meeting and enroll in the association. We will have an opportunity to mention more about this during the week.</p>
