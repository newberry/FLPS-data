   <p>The Holy Trinity Parish gave an entertainment program for the poor yesterday at 4 P.M. at the parish school hall. The program was arranged by the nuns and the school children. Declamations, songs, and piano solos filled the bill. A Christmas skit, "St. Nicholas," was also staged. Christmas gifts were given the Polish orphans and children of poor families. Credit and thanks should go to the nuns for this noble and cheerful program.</p>
