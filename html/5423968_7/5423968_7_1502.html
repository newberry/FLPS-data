   <p>To the numerous direct questions and demands, we reply that the "operatic recitals" for the benefit of the Polish Welfare Association are conducted by Mr. Stanley Szwajkart. He will play duets with a certain lady whose name we cannot mention since it is not yet certain whether this young lady will be able to sacrifice the necessary time and effort. The first recital will be held a week from this Thursday and the opera will be either "Der Freisclantz" by Weber or Verdi's "Il Trovatore". Thus far eight people have asked for tickets, five gentlemen and three ladies.</p>
