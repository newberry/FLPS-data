   <p>A hundred orphans from the Holy Family Orphanage were feted yesterday from 2 P. M. to 6 P. M. at the St. John Cantius Parish fair. Many parishioners and neighbors attended this gala event.</p>
   <p>Every child received fifteen cents from the parish committee. Many persons made donations so that the children could have paddles for raffles. These paddles were collected after each raffle was over and used again. Today tickets will be used instead. Even the children from St. John Cantius Parish brought gifts for the underpriviledged.</p>
   <p>The children from the Orphanage not only enjoyed themselves but many also won prizes. Before they left all were invited to dinner. At the table all the children received a small gift from the pastor, Reverend John Kasprzycki, C. R.</p>
