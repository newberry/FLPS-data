   <p>After the fire at the St. Stanislaus school, today we have a new sad story to tell to the Poles living in the West Side St. Adelbert's parish and its vicinity. The structure known as Pulaski Hall, 800 Ashland Avenue, so widely known and popular among the Poles, burned to the ground last night. The fire started at about 8 o'clock P. M. and is said to have been caused by a lighted match.</p>
   <p>The Pulaski Building was 150 feet in length and three stories high. The total loss is estimated to be between $75,000 and $100,000.</p>
