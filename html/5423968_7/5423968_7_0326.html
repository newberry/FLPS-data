   <p>The need for an organization of Polish printers has been felt by us for a long time. It would create a certain amount of unity among the printers--if only in a social way.</p>
   <p>Several members of our trade proposed that a union should be organized following the American, English, or German plan; but it was shown that this suggestion was impractical because of the special conditions existing among Polish printers. The need for some unity among the friends of our vocation, however, forced us to decide to invite our associates to a meeting for the purpose of ascertaining if we could not better our conditions, morally as well as materially, and organize at least a fraternal aid association, following the plan of numerous Polish associations. Many trades have had similar associations for a long time, and they have proven to be exceptionally important factors in creating unity in these trades.</p>
   <p>Thus far only the printers have not endeavored somehow to combine with each other. It is true that up until the present time our number has been too small for us to form such an association; however, in view of the fact that the total number of Polish printers is increasing daily, it would not be very progressive for us to be satisfied with the present conditions.</p>
   <p>If, at the beginning, besides assisting the members in the event of illness, the association will maintain an employment office, it will thereby render a service to our members as well as to owners of printing establishments. At any rate, we are not proposing any definite plans in this article, but merely suggesting what could be discussed at a general meeting.</p>
   <p>Not wishing to hold our meetings in a saloon, we have gained permission to use for this purpose, free of charge, a room in the home of the Polish Press Association at 141-143 West Division Street.</p>
   <p>Consequently, we are hereby inviting all gentlemen printers who feel the need for an organization to a meeting to be held on Sunday, July 24, 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon, at the home mentioned above.</p>
