Over one hundred and twenty five dollars has been received this month. Many Chicago Societies have contributed. An eleven dollar offering came from a generous person in Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>A novena has been started in commemoration of the coming holiday of St. Joseph. The entire orphanage is going to offer prayer for the kind contributors.</p>
