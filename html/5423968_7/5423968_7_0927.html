   <p>A national drive for funds for the needy Polish families in America will start on December 15 and continue until January 15. The aim of this campaign is to get $250,000 which is to supply the dire needs of destitute Polish children and other national needs.</p>
   <p>December 15th, will be a historical event for 'Polonia', for on this day the entire forces of this campaign committee will go to work. They will endeavor to wipe out some of the hardships that have been encountered by our people during the past year.</p>
   <p>All preparations for the Christmas drive are being arranged by the Polish National Committee. (originally called the Polish National Department.) Work in all departments has been started. Every means possible is being made use of to make the Christmas holidays for the poor children a bright spot in their lives. An appeal to the Polish Clergy of America and to a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>thousand patriotic organizations that are scattered throughout the United States has been sent out.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Council is also making an appeal to the hearts of American-Poles to help them solve one of their pet problems, the Polish orphans which were exiled on the Siberian wastes and brought to this country and placed in orphanages. With the help that has been received, and with the aid, that this new appeal will bring the return of these destitute children to Poland will be possible. The completion of this work will be one of the finest humanitarian acts of the Polish people. Not only will they be saved by Polish people, but also for Poland. It is hoped that the road for better Polish citizenship will start soon for them.</p>
   <p>Because of this two-fold purpose, it is imperative that this campaign start in full force, and as efficiently as possible. All Polish churches and societies are behind this drive. Instructions and information will be given out to all those desiring it. Anyone seeking information about the work is requested to go to the Polish National Committee headquarters located at 1214 North <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Ashland Avenue. Answers to queries will be gladly given.</p>
   <p>One can expect that the enemies of any welfare drive will try to uncover some undesirable loopholes in this coming campaign. Let these enemies, these screech owls, build their nests in the cemetery of past brawls; let these jackals further pursue their own egoisms; let these infants of green praise continue to mix their plans. But the spirit inbedded in the Polish hearts will shun this agitation as it did prior to the World War. This spirit has always come to the front to protect anything that is truly Polish. It will be this spirit that will help to release these Siberian orphans from our orphan asylumns in the United States, and help to find real homes in Poland for them where they will blossom out into full manhood and womanhood.</p>
   <p>In the event the instructions which have been sent out are not received by the committee representatives of the church and national societies and other organizations, notice should be sent to the Polish National Committee <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>headquarters and a new set of instructions will be sent them and return postage will also be given for sending the notice.</p>
