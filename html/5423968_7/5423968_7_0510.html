   <p>The recent plea for a wagon by the Sisters of Nazareth, who operate the Polish Hospital, has brought unexpected results. Francis Kwasigroch, superintendent of the Milwaukee Avenue Post Office, donated a fine wagon.</p>
   <p>Public acknowledgment is also being made that Francis Wleklinski, who made no promise to contribute bread daily, has been doing so for the past year.</p>
   <p>A. Suwalski, butcher, has been making weekly donations of thirty pounds of meat.</p>
   <p>Michael P. Strong, Joseph Lesinski and John Chrapkowski, local Polish butchers, often contribute quantities of meat.</p>
   <p>The Sisters of Nazareth wish to extend heartfelt thanks to the kind supporters of the Polish Hospital.</p>
