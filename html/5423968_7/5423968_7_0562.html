   <p>As we all know, there is in St. Mary of the Angels' parish a day nursery, founded five years ago, to which widowed mothers, who are forced to go to work may bring their children, and they are kept safely during the day. [In connection with the nursery] there is also a home for girls who work during the day in various sections of the city; on their return from work they find their meals ready, warm rooms, and the proper environment. As many girls as possible should live in this home, protecting thereby their good names and their honor. The Ladies' Protective Society, which sponsors this institution, is arranging a party for February 8, at eight o'clock in the evening at the fieldhouse of Pulaski Park, Noble and Blackhawk Streets. In the name of the nursery we ask for generous support. We assure you of many pleasant surprises, since the committee is not sparing any efforts to provide a truly pleasing and unusual program.</p>

   <p>We hope to see the Pulaski Park hall filled to capacity.</p>
