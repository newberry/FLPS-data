   <p>We have received a copy of the constitution of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Society which celebrated its silver jubilee last Sunday. The document was printed in Paris in 1869.</p>
   <p>This constitution is a very important document because it is the first constitution of a Polish society and has served as a model for drawing up other constitutions.</p>
   <p>The title of this constitution adopted in Chicago, Illinois, in North America, on June 1, 1866 is: The Constitution and Bylaws of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Brotherly Aid Society. The introduction to this constitution reads:</p>
   <p>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen.</p>
   <p>Introduction</p>
   <p>In order that the Polish Roman Catholic people may be united by the bonds of <span class="page-break">\2</span>brotherly love; in order that charitable deeds such as visiting and helping the sick, burying the dead, and helping the widows and orphans may prevail in this brotherly group; and in order that brotherhood, harmony, unity, and moral habits of body and soul may be found among us, we have founded a Brotherly Aid Society under the patronage of Saint Stanislaus Kostka.</p>
