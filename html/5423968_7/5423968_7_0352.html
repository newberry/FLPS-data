   <p>Chicago, Illinois, June 1, 1891.</p>
   <p>We Poles and Lithuanians living in Chicago have organized a fraternal organization, "Tow. Polakow I Litwinow, Bratniej Pomocy Krola Zygmunta." (King Sigismund's Polish-Lithuanian Fraternal Society) Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr, was chosen as the patron saint of our Society. Our object is to organize a society to be affiliated with some parish. We do not know to which parish we shall belong because we are scattered throughout Chicago. We are willing to join that parish which has the largest number of our members, provided we secure the approval of the pastor.</p>
   <p>The following members have been elected as officers of the organization:</p>
   <p>Joseph Matulewicz, president;</p>
   <p>Andrew Murawski, vice-president;</p>
   <p>Vincent Syperski, recording secretary;</p>
   <p>Jerome Lukowski, financial secretary;</p>
   <p>Joseph Syperski, treasurer;</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Michael Drogiala, Casimir Romanowski, and Anthony Milewski, members of the advisory board.</p>
   <p>All correspondence in regard to the Society should be addressed to Jerome Lukowski, 403 West 16th Street.</p>
