   <p>Yesterday, the Secretary of State issued a charter of incorporation to the Kosciuszko Monument Association, which has as its aim the erection of a memorial statue to the great Polish and American hero, Thaddeus Kosciuszko. The following are the founders and directors of this corporation:</p>
   <p>Max A. Drezmal</p>
   <p>W. Smulski</p>
   <p>M. A. LaBuy</p>
   <p>Leon Szopinski</p>
   <p>Casimir Midowicz</p>
   <p>E. Z. Brodowski</p>
   <p>Paul O. Stensland</p>
   <p>Michael Majewski</p>
   <p>and John F. Smulski.</p>
   
   <p>For the present time, John F. Smulski will be retained as secretary. Mr. Smulski stated to the American press that "this organization has been trying for four years to get permission from the park board to exhibit the statue at one of the better sites in Humboldt Park. This has finally been granted. We propose to collect $25,000 for this memorial through subscriptions, and by giving special programs. We are going to make an effort to have this statue exhibited at the Columbian Exposition," he concluded.</p>
   <p>The editors of the Dziennik Chicagoski, wish this organization all the success in the world, however, they are doubtful of its materialization in time for the Fair, because there is so little time.</p>
