   <p>The Polish Hospital is again in need of many things.</p>
   <p>It needs a medicine cabinet but has no money to buy it. Lack of this cabinet causes a lot of trouble and inconvenience....</p>
   <p>The medicine containers have to be placed on the floor, where bottles are broken, get dirty, etc.</p>
   <p>Isn't there some kindhearted person who will supply this deficiency and help the good Sisters who devote their lives to the relief of the suffering of others?</p>
   <p>We appeal to our generous-minded citizens: Who will donate such a medicine cabinet to the Sisters? Who will be so kindhearted?</p>
