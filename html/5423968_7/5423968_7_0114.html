   <p>We have often repeated, that we will continue the appeal to the hearts of the Poles, by speaking through the voices of the unfortunate Polish children from all spheres of Polish life; that the Polish people take on humanitarian obligations, and,as good citizens, join the Polish Welfare Association. The Polish Welfare Association was not disappointed in its effort, because as a result the Young Ladies Mayflower Society organized a Polish alliance group who, by unaminous vote accepted membership in the Polish Welfare Association, and volunteered to donate their services and help clothe many of the unfortunate Polish children who are annually, under the supervision of the welfare association.</p>
   <p>What could be a more splendid and noble example, than the action taken by this Young Ladies' Society? The Polish Welfare Association, is hoping that many other clubs and organizations, will follow the precedence taken by these young ladies. On March 17, 1927, a meeting will be held at the Guardian Angel Home, 4800 Gross Avenue. Meetings are usually held at the Morrison Hotel, but the change was made to encourage the young people of the South Side to join our Polish Welfare Association.</p>
