   <p>The concert for the benefit of St. Mary of Nazareth hospital, which was given Wednesday at the Auditorium, came out unexpectedly well.</p>
   <p>Among all the first-rate numbers in the program was the talk in English rendered by the Very Reverend Bishop Paul P. Rhode, who, after relating a brief history and aims of the hospital, took this useful institution as a fine example of the tendency and activities of the Polish immigrants in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Driven from their fatherland; terribly oppressed, deprived of everything - even the right to live and to speak their mother language - the Poles came to America .... not to cause or foment revolutions but, instead, to work with everybody here toward the general betterment of this country; to serve the cause of this republic - to take its ideas of liberty as a basis for development.</p>

   <p>This country is the incarnation of that which the Poles love....the fulfillment of that for which they yearn: it gave them liberty. Grateful for that, the Poles - the purest and most noble type of the Slav race - are working in this country energetically, and give real proof of their worth; more and more evidence, not only of their own industriousness, but of the desire to serve society.</p>
   <p>The lofty and convincing words of His Excellency raised the true value of the Poles in the eyes of many people of other nationalities, for which we are very grateful to our bishop.</p>
