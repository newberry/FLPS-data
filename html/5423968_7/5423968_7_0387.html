   <p>It has been estimated that the so-called fraternal insurance societies in the United States have about twenty million members, who are insured to the total sum of about seven billion dollars. These societies are of various kinds. Some are large, some are small; some are well-provided for, resting therefore, on a firm foundation; others are poor and are in danger of collapse at the first increase of the mortality rate. Finally, some use a system of graduated assessment, which is the only rational system for insurance assessments, while others hold to the old system, so full of faults that its use should be prohibited by law. And of those that use the first system, some, like the Polish National Alliance, have a permanent table, while others use an assessment table that changes according to the amount of competition in the insurance field, thus endangering the future of the organization.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>With only a few exceptions, all of these societies are affiliated with two large organizations for their mutual protection against private insurance corporations, which, as natural competitors, seek to destroy all fraternal aid societies. The struggle is being waged in the legislatures of several states, and, so far, the outlook for fraternal aid societies is favorable, thanks to their co-operation.</p>
   <p>These two large organizations are the National Fraternal Congress, of which the Polish National Alliance is a member, and the Associated Fraternities of America.</p>
   <p>It is to the common interest of all fraternal aid societies that they be financially sound; for the opponents of fraternal aid use weakness of financial structure and inefficient management as arguments in the struggle that is now going on in the state legislatures. They point to organization X, for instance, existing for fifteen or twenty years, having, perhaps, a few thousand members, a small capital, and a low table of assessments. Can such an <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>organization, they say, guarantee payment of a death benefit if the mortality rate should increase, with no corresponding increase in membership or capital?</p>
   <p>Using such arguments as these, private insurance corporations, which exist solely for the purpose of bringing profit to their stockholders, attempt to force laws through the state legislatures, limiting more and more the activities of fraternal aid societies.</p>
   <p>It is no wonder, then, that the strong and well-organized fraternal aid societies, united in the two organizations mentioned afore, are doing what they can to combat these attacks, and that, for their own protection, they are demanding that the smaller and less stable fraternal aid societies cease to harm, in the eyes of the law, the stronger and more stable societies that wish to continue operations on a solid foundation.</p>
   <p>At present, a committee of six, representing the National Fraternal Congress and the Association of Fraternities, is endeavoring to secure the enactment <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of a single law that will regulate fraternal aid societies uniformly in every state. Primarily, this law will make compulsory the use of a graduated assessment table, a table approved by the National Fraternal Congress. Our [Polish National] Alliance already uses such a table, and so, in this respect, is entirely in order. Further, the law will insist that the benefit fund be separated from operating capital, and that it be adequately insured. This system has already been in use in the Alliance for a long time; however, there must be organizations that do not separate these funds, since the committee sees fit to make an issue of it.</p>
   <p>A third demand which the law will make is that all organizations issue financial reports annually, showing their financial condition accurately. The fourth point prohibits the merging of two organizations if the union is harmful to the members of either. This means that there can be no union of two societies if one is financially sound and the other weak. Such a union would be harmful to the members of the first, though beneficial to those of the second. But it will be possible for two societies to unite if both are strong or both weak.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The last point provides for compulsory examination of each society's accounts by the authorities of the state in which that society operates.</p>
   <p>These demands are all entirely justified, and are beneficial to all organizations. Those that stand today on a firm foundation, with sufficient capital, a good administration, operating on the graduated assessment system, have no need to fear this new law. Those that are not so sound, however, will have to reorganize under the law, or disband.</p>
   <p>When all organizations have thus been made sound, and those which are unable to reorganize to meet the new requirements are disbanded, the struggle with private corporations that operate for profit will be much easier. They will not cease to attack us, of course, but they will have lost the strongest arguments which they now can use.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that it is in the best interests of the public at large that the fraternal aid societies emerge victorious in this struggle, and that they become so widespread throughout the country as to destroy insurance corporations that are operated solely for profit. In fraternal aid societies, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the insured themselves are stockholders, and, as a result, their insurance rates are much lower. In private corporations, the stockholders, a relatively small group of people who have invested their money in order to realize a profit, are owners of the corporation's property. Insurance rates must consequently be higher, so that expenses can be covered and a dividend paid. The future of the insurance business in the United States belongs to the fraternal aid societies, for the people themselves benefit, and the people themselves can conduct them.</p>
   <p>But for the benefit of the insured, it is necessary to put a stop to the organizing of numerous, small local societies which naturally cannot grow. It is best and safest to be a member of a sound organization that uses a graduated table of assessments, and is progressing normally. In the Polish National Alliance, the Poles have such an organization, and everyone should be a member of it.</p>
