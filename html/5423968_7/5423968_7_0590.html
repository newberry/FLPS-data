   <p>On February 10 a meeting was held at the Holy Trinity parish. It was an assembly of Polish clergy called together by Very Rev. Bishop Paul P. Rhode, to discuss the matter of building a Polish orphanage in Chicago. With joint consideration it was decided upon that the Felician Sisters should be in charge of the orphanage, and that there should be room for three hundred children.</p>
   <p>All Polish parished in the diocese of Chicago, will be able to send their children to this orphanage and it is expected all Polish parishes will add their material support. At this meeting there were elected three committees, the executive, advisory and welfare committee.</p>
