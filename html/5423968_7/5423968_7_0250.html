   <p>[We have been requested to publish the following announcement.]</p>
   <p>On Saturday, August 1, the Polish Bakers' and Confectioners' Fraternal Benefit Society of Chicago elected the following officers: J. Hornung, president; T. Sztrejter, vice-president; M. W. Pikulski, first secretary; W. Sztrejter, second secretary; S. Stepanski, treasurer; T. Grzela, John Wysocki, and Joseph Gizynski, board of trustees.</p>
   <p>This society has already made its influence felt and is of great benefit to its members.</p>
   <p>We are surprised that some of the Polish bakers and confectioners are slow in joining the society. Look at the other tradespeople and you will see that very few have not joined their trades associations. You should do likewise.</p>
   
   <p>Brother bakers and confectioners! Don't put it off any longer, but come now and join our ranks. In this way we can show that we know our own business, and know how to gain the most good.</p>
   <p>Regular meetings are held the first Saturday of every month, at four o'clock in the afternoon, in Mr. Frank Lechert's hall, 120 West Division Street, at the corner of Cleaver Street.</p>
   <p>M. W. Pikulski, first secretary,</p>
   <p>700 Noble Street.</p>
