   <p>The Mayor of Chicago, Carter Harrison, issued the expected proclamation on January 20, 1915, to all the people of Chicago. In it he urges every one to make contributions on the tag days on behalf of our war-afflicted people in Poland. The Mayor's proclamation is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Among those suffering because of the European war, which destroys nations and thousands of people, no one suffers greater misery and needs more aid than the Poles who remain under the control of the main warring countries, that is, Germany, Russia, and Austria. The flower of the Polish nation constitutes the first lines of the armies of these combating powers. Polish families are doomed to starvation and are exposed to all the horrors of war. Thousands <span class="page-break">2</span>perish of starvation and lack of shelter. A plea to help these unfortunate people comes to us residents of Chicago. The Polish National Alliance has undertaken to conduct tag days on January 23 and 24 for the benefit of [the Poles in Europe].</p>
   <p>"I therefore, Carter H. Harrison, Mayor of the City of Chicago, by the power granted me by a resolution of the City Council appeal to the citizens of Chicago to contribute to the creation and the augmentation of a fund in behalf of this worthy nation. I hereby nominate a committee composed of citizens of Chicago, which committee shall occupy itself with the collection of funds during the tag days."</p>
