   <p>The Holy Family Orphanage outing of June 7 at Pregler's Grove was a success. All those who attended were anxious to know the date of the next outing.</p>
   <p>After all deductions had been made, the net profit amounted to $624.81, which sum will be turned over to the Holy Family Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to all for their fine co-operation in making this event a happy one. Thanks are also extended to all those who have made donations. It is obvious from the results that whenever there is a noble purpose to be supported, it will not be overlooked by the generous hearts of the Poles of Chicago.</p>
