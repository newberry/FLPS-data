   <p>The executive committee of the recently organized Polish Welfare Association held its meeting yesterday afternoon at the Hamilton Club. The meeting was attended by about twenty persons more than had attended the previous meeting. The chairman of the meeting was, as usual, Judge Edmund Jarecki, and the secretary was Mr. Theodore Szmergalski, a lawyer. The chairman of the committee on the constitution gave a report of the committee's activity. The constitution was read almost in its entirety and accepted with a few minor corrections and amendments. The official name of the organization will be Polish Welfare Association. Its aim, as we have written several times before, will be to provide effective help and protection for Polish juvenile delinquents, who for minor offenses frequently receive stiff sentences and severe punishment.</p>
   <p>The Polish Welfare Association will be composed of life members, active members, and honorary members. Life membership will cost $200. Those Polish organizations on the financial support of which the Association principally relies may also be <span class="page-break">\2</span>enrolled as active members. After the reading and adoption of the constitution the meeting was adjourned to next Monday, January 16. Among those present at last night's meeting were the Reverend Francis Wojtalewicz, the Reverend Stephen Kowalczyk, Judge Edmund Jarecki, and Messrs. W. F. Soska, Paul Drzymalski, F. J. Tomczak, Thomas F. Blachowski, F. Peska, J. Lackowski, Julius Smietanka, N. L. Piotrowski, J. Kudlick, W. Zygmunt, A. J. Gorny, Garbarek, Theodore Szmergalski, Alexander Smietanka, A. J. Kowalski Junior, Lawrence Przybylski, and Stepczynski. The Polish press was represented by Dziennik Chicagoski, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, and Dziennik Narodowy.</p>
