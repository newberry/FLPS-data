   <p>Last Thursday, July 12, at the 3:30 P. M., at the school hall of the cathedral, a meeting was held by clergymen of Polish parishes, called by Archbishop Quigley, for the purpose of considering the matter of a Polish orphanage.</p>
   <p>Almost all Polish parishes were represented at the meeting.</p>
   <p>At the hour above mentioned the archbishop entered the hall and opened the meeting with a long speech. He explained the lack of charitable activity, especially among the young Polish generation.</p>
   <p>He spoke of being interested in the activity of Polish youth. He also read from the records of the representatives of several institutions to show that there are two hundred Polish children in various institutions. Part of these children are in orphanages; others on account of petty violations are in the Juvenile Home of Correction, where they come in contact with other criminal types of children, lose not only their nationality but also their faith. That it is time right now Chicago Poles should take care of their unfortunate children.</p>
