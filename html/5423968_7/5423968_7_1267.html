   <p>Countrymen! The European war has come upon us so suddenly and unexpectedly, that we are totally unprepared for the consequences which it will have for our homeland. The consequences of this terrible war, unprecedented in the history of the world, are quickly making themselves felt. Enemy armies are reveling and rioting on Polish soil, destroying with fire and sword the property and goods of our brothers and sisters. Our young men, and in general all of our male population capable of bearing arms, have been impressed into the armies of our oppressors, who are today fighting each other. They have been forced to take the blood of their brothers, to the shame and disgrace of the civilized world and to the most horrible augmentation of the tragedy of our unfortunate nation!</p>
   <p>Through this death's shroud which has covered Poland, there begins to shine ever more brightly the morning star of freedom and independence, but it rises on a devastated homeland, where today tears, hunger, blood, and destruction reign supreme.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>This homeland has no army to hasten the moment of its freedom. It does not have bread or shelter for its children! Who will hurry to its aid, if not we who are the loyal sons of this unfortunate mother, we who live here in the free land of Washington, in peace and security without any cares?</p>
   <p>We cannot, at present, send across the ocean legions of our young men, armed for battle, because we are bound by the neutrality laws of our adopted country. But we can and must contribute money. We must contribute at once, willingly, hundreds of millions of dollars, which will, at least in a measure, pay our debt to our homeland and will ease the first horrible suffering resulting from the war in our land.</p>
   <p>The Polish Falcons of Circuit II of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America, mindful of their honorable duties as the advance guard of the nation, and serving no party nor political faction but the entire homeland and all of its children regardless of their political convictions, will arrange a Tag Day in Chicago and vicinity, on Sunday, August 23. This Tag Day will be arranged for the purpose of increasing the Falcons' "Kosciuszko Fund," all of which is destined for the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>needs of our homeland during these difficult times. We Falcons hereby appeal to the hearts of all of our brother and sister Poles in this district to offer their pennies generously on the altar of the homeland's cause.</p>
   <p>In particular, we address an ardent request to the Polish clergy, that they follow the example of Bishop Bandurski--who guards the Falcon corps in the homeland with such sincere care and warms them at every step with the fire of love of country--and sincerely support our efforts in America. We ask them to exhort the people in all parishes to contribute to the Falcons' "Kosciuszko Fund" this coming Sunday.</p>
   <p>Remember Countrymen, that every penny contributed by you to this cause may mean the drying of some orphan's or widow's tear! It may mean one rifle for a Polish soldier! It may mean one person saved from a death by starvation!</p>
   <p>Give to the Falcons' "Kosciuszko Fund"!</p>
