   <p>The erection of the Polish Hall, on the Northwest Side of Chicago, has again made a step forward. The so-called license has come from Springfield and it is now possible to subscribe for shares in the Polish Hall. It is requested that all those who wish to become shareholders appear at Mr. Victor Bardonski's drugstore, where subscriptions can be secured at any time. The shares are $10 each and the capital stock amounts to $50,000. Payments for the subscribed shares will depend upon the will of the general public and the directors, according to the needs in the progress of erection. Subscriptions for the shares will be collected only until August 8, after which time the list of the shareholders will be sent to Springfield for the purpose of obtaining a charter. The commissioners, who succeeded in obtaining the license, request compatriots to subscribe as numerously and as quickly as possible; they particularly petition the more wealthy compatriots, the businessmen and proprietors, to contribute to this work by name and deed. The drugstore of Mr. Victor Bardonski is located at the corner of Bradley and Noble Streets. Victor Bardonski, Victor Karlowski, C. W. Dyniewicz, Thomas Wozny, Joseph Piatkiewicz, Michael Magdziarz, A. X. Centella, commissioners.</p>
