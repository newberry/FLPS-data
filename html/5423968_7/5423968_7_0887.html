   <p>We should remember the families of the strikers in the stockyards and help them immediately. The poor families are suffering terribly in the present cold spell; they need warm clothing and coal, which nowadays are very expensive.</p>
   <p>Persons who wish to help the poor families of strikers in the stockyards should kindly send their contributions either to the union headquarters of District Council Number Nine, to Mr. Ladislas Bakowski, 1700 West 48th Street, or to the secretary of Local Number 116, Mr. W. Bartkowiak, 1700 West 48th Street.</p>
