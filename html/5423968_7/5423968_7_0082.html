   <p>Brotherly help, the preservation of native traditions, the everyday use of their mother tongue, and the elevation of their people to a parity in world affairs are unquestionably the highest ideals of any nationality group and of any patriotic person.</p>
   <p>The recognition of those men who have done outstanding work in their respective fields follows in the footsteps of tradition. Accomplishments of benefit to mankind, such as those in religion, militarism, medicine, and literature, should be remembered. Those who worked for the betterment of mankind should be treated with the greatest respect. They deserve to be immortalized because by so doing the result of their efforts will continue to be alive before the eyes of the people. Those who have regard for their own people and their freedom, will not only worship these great men, but will also try to emulate them. They will not only preserve the memory of <span class="page-break">2</span>the great, but also spread their good will [toward them] to others, thereby helping to bring men closer together.</p>
   <p>The outstanding events of history are the deeds of noble persons who have sacrificed their lives for their people and humanity. It is these deeds that awaken in the individual the desire to do great things. No project, no matter how large its capital or how great its benefit to mankind, can compare with a great man. It is true that capital draws interest and some projects are beneficial, but all this is not as important as the moral lesson the people get from the example of the great. Their work, even after death, remains immortal in the minds of posterity. The striving of the people to better the mental horizons of mankind spreads through and grows richer with the ages. The elevation of a nation from the quagmire of life to the field of action and recognition, is also a feat of inestimable value to its people. The instilling of hope, knowledge, and patriotism, coupled with the enrichment of tradition, tends to bring to the forefront not only the people, but also the country. The greater the <span class="page-break">3</span>accomplishments in this direction, the richer the people become in spiritual, moral and patriotic values. All this helps to promote a better living standard, a better outlook on life, and a desire to do creative work. Each individual effort, each individual accomplishment, is another stone to the pillar of national fame. The quality of material used in building this tower reflects the accomplishments of a people. It shows how the people live and think, what they want, and how they expect to get it.</p>
   <p>Among the men recorded in our history, we find those who have done a great deal helping to promote patriotism by offering their lives to free the people and their country. Through their efforts, the people were brought closer together and helped to improve living conditions. Polish great men have shown their people that a son of Poland is as fit to take part in the affairs of the world as the son of any other nationality.</p>
   <p>Thaddeus Kosciuszko was such a great man. He has not only become a brilliant figure in his native country, but also abroad. Through his military endeavors, he has won the hearts of his people and of others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>As the years pass, his noble and heroic endeavors become more famous and his desire to create a democracy for his country becomes stronger than ever. In the hearts of our younger generation, his memory is becoming more respected each day. Who among us does not want to see the realization of his dreams? Who does not care to see our people free again and on equal standing with others? Who does not want to see the defeat of despotism? The answer to these questions is gaining momentum every hour.</p>
   <p>The oppressed are not able to stand any longer the barbaric [treatment to which they are being subjected] and have left their shackles behind to search for a more pleasant place in which to live. Most of them went far beyond the borders of their country, across the vast expanse of the ocean, to seek a better livelihood. Many sought the protective shores of America, made free by George Washington. It was here that Washington and Kosciuszko fought hand in hand to make America what it is today. Kosciuszko's heart must have foreseen that his participation in helping a country free itself <span class="page-break">5</span> <span class="page-break">6</span>would someday benefit his own people. His accomplishments have actually helped Poland and her people to be regarded as great lovers of freedom.</p>
   <p>It is here that most of our people have emigrated. At the present time, there are over half a million Poles in the United States. Most of them, if not all, ought to take part in a cause [the object of which is] to perpetuate the name of a native son [of Poland]. They ought to show Kosciuszko their kindness, just as Kosciuszko showed his for them.</p>
   <p>Since the dawn of civilization, man has always built memorials for his outstanding sons. Why should we not follow this age-old example?</p>
   <p>We can show to other nationality groups how much we love and respect the memory of the man who, in addition to defending his own native country, was instrumental [to the success of] the American forces. Let us erect him a monument, but let us all share in its cost. Let every Pole, regardless of social standing, do his part by signing his name to the document in which are listed the names of those wishing to pay homage to the Polish hero.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>One can do its part by taking part in a wholesale demonstration, by making a cash contribution, and by signing his or her name on the proposal. In this manner we will build a pedestal for posterity. To the world at large, it will show that we all love, honor, and desire liberty just as much as the great leaders. We can also show that we can progress as a solid group; that we know how to stand for our rights and how to voice our opinion in protest against any violence; and that there is a great number here ready to defend the right of religious expression and liberty.</p>
   <p>The Kosciuszko Monument Association embodies all these principles and tries to build a monument in honor of Kosciuszko in one of the parks of Chicago. The board of directors urges all Polish societies, clubs, and groups to take part in this honorable cause. All liberty-loving individuals can play an important role by giving [this movement] their wholehearted support. If all of us take part in this movement, we can make it a reality in a short while.</p>
