   <p>Yesterday afternoon an inspiring event took place at the Polish National Alliance Building when at 3:30, Mrs. Laura Turczynowicz arrived to visit our headquarters. The distinguished guest was officially greeted in the large meeting hall. Among those present we noticed, besides Mrs. Turczynowicz, Mrs. [M.] Milewski, Mrs. [M.] Sakowski, Mrs. [S.] Osuch, Mrs. [A.] Neuman, Miss [E.] Napieralski, Dr. [Anna] Wyczolkowski, Mrs. Chodzinski, Mrs. Osada, Mrs. Modrzejewski, and Mrs. Zalewski. Among the men present were Messrs. [Casimir] Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, [Joseph] Magdziarz, treasurer of our organization, [John] Zawilinski, general secretary, [S.] Orpiszewski, editor-in-chief of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, and Editors [S.] Lewental and Jesien.</p>
   <p>The gathering was called to order by Zychlinski, who welcomed Mrs. <span class="page-break">2</span>Turczynowicz to the Alliance Building and thanked her sincerely for coming. He assured her that the Poles will know how to appreciate her efforts to aid suffering Poland and will give her their united support so as to relieve at least in part the misery there.</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. Sakowski, president of the Women's Division of the Polish National Alliance, next greeted Mrs. Turczynowicz, assuring her that the Women's Division will co-operate with her to the fullest extent in everything that can aid Poland. The Women's Division has already been engaged in Polish relief work and is gathering clothes and shoes to send to our unfortunate brethern. Chests of clothes have already been sent to Paris and Irkutsk, while those in stock here will soon be shipped to the Poles across the ocean.</p>
   <p>Following these two addresses, Mrs. Milewski, member of the board of directors of the Polish National Alliance, introduced the officials of the Alliance, at the same time explaining the insignia on the P.N.A. banner, <span class="page-break">3</span>about which Mrs. Turczynowicz had asked.</p>

   <p>Reception at Press Club</p>
   <p>After visiting the headquarters of the Polish National Alliance, Mrs. Turczynowicz was accompanied by the ladies to the Press Club, where a banquet had been arranged.</p>
   <p>[List of women present at banquet omitted because identical with list included above.]</p>
   <p>The men present were Messrs. T.M. Helinski, president of the Polish War Relief Committee, Zychlinski, Orpiszewski, [H.] Setmajer, secretary of <span class="page-break">4</span>the Polish War Relief Committee, [N.] Zlotnicki, K. Wiechecki, H. Lokanski, J. Wedda, W. Jesien, S. Lewental, and E. Wolczynski of Detroit, Michigan, whose family also attended.</p>
   <p>[List of speakers omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>The distinguished guest addressed the gathering, and after her speech a discussion was begun on the subject of forming a State committee [for the reconstruction of Poland] as proposed by Mrs. Turczynowicz.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that Mrs. Turczynowicz will continue as president of the Committee for the State of Illinois. Mr. Lokanski, editor of Dziennik Narodowy, was elected chairman, Attorney [L.] Pinderski vice-president, Mrs. Chodzinski second vice-president, Judge E.Jarecki treasurer, and S. Lewental secretary. The press committee consists of S. Orpiszewski, Zlotnicki, and Brodnicki. Mrs. Neuman then announced that <span class="page-break">5</span>the money collected at the mass meeting in the Polish Women's Alliance Hall is in her possession, and that the total sum is not $142 as previously announced but $143, a dollar having been donated after the count was made.</p>
   <p>The committee adopted as its official name "Polish Reconstruction Committee".</p>
   <p>The first meeting of the newly organized committee will be held today in order to begin immediate activity. After attending to a few formalities arising from the organization of the committee, the meeting was closed, and a few moments were spent in pleasant conversation, after which Mrs. Turczynowicz was escorted to the automobile waiting to take her to a meeting at her hotel, where further relief activity for Poland was to be discussed.</p>
