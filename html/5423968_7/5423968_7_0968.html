   <p>John F. Smulski, president of the Polish National Council, received the following telegram from M. F. C. Walcott, director of the Food Administration.</p>
   <p>"John F. Smulski, Chicago. We must commence the relief of Poland in a broad, practical way. We must insure Hoover's enthusiastic support in Europe by strong, concerted action here; we have a seven thousand ton ship ready in New York, but no funds. This first shipload will cost approximately two million dollars, according to Hoover's table of requirements for food stuffs. You must meet me in Washington Friday, to get relief started. Situation critical. No time can be lost. F. C. Walcott."</p>
   <p>This means that the Food Administration decided to send to Poland seven thousand tons of food stuffs stored in New York, but it is necessary to pay two million dollars as charges and costs, and this must be done now. The Polish National Council can use about one million from funds collected, but we need another million which we have to collect from the patriotic Poles in this country. We must make another effort to get that money to help feed our people in Poland.</p>
