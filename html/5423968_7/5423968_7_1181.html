   <p>Countrymen: Who of you has not heard about what is taking place in our unfortunate homeland?</p>
   <p>The press of the entire world unanimously asserts that our country is one great cemetery--one great mass of ashes--through which millions of hungry people, clad in beggars' rags, wander without shelter from the freezing cold and blizzards. Armies of millions of men continue to spread death and destruction.</p>
   <p>Any one of us, however poor, if he has food to eat and a roof over his head, must be heartless if he does not take pity on his own destitute brethren, and hasten to their aid. He who remains deaf to the destitution of millions surely must be inhuman. He who does not rush to the aid of his brethren must surely have no fear of God.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Believing that all of us emigres; without exception, knowing the desperate situation of our Polish people, want to come to their aid and make possible the quickest joint action, we decree for all Polish organizations, parishes, societies, families, and individuals,--that Sunday, January 24, shall be set apart as Polish Day, for the purpose of collecting a fund for our destitute nation.</p>
   <p>We express the conviction that every single Polish organization, society, parish, and individual will make a contribution on that day. We believe that our priests, especially, will make the discharge of this duty easier for all the Polish people by taking up collections in our churches.</p>
   <p>The money collected will be cabled at once to Warsaw in care of the Central Civic Committee, which includes many of the finest people of the entire nation, and under whose care the whole relief activity has been co-ordinated in Poland and in the part of Galicia occupied by Russians. This Committee, having at its disposal millions of rubles (which, however, is only "a drop in the bucket" compared to the sum needed), has the confidence, not only of all Poland, but <span class="page-break">3</span>also of Russia, which is hurrying to Poland's aid.</p>
   <p>Besides this, we shall make every effort, with the help of our own representative, to see that this fund is justly distributed among all the Poles affected by the war, in Poland as well as in Galicia.</p>
   <p>There is now no excuse for anybody's not contributing, on the pretext that he is afraid his money will not reach its destination, or that the Committees do not have his confidence.</p>
   <p>The entire Polish Central Relief Committee guarantees this fund-raising drive, which in Poland it will continue under the supervision of the most esteemed persons of our nation.</p>
   <p>We would like to send as large an amount of money as possible, because it is now--when winter is at hand and poverty is unbounded--that we should send help. That is why we ask all organizations, parishes, societies, and committees which have funds for the relief of our countrymen, to add these funds <span class="page-break">4</span>to the Polish Day Contributions.</p>
   <p>For some time we have been appealing to the generous hearts of the citizens of other nationalities in this country. The results of our appeal, so far, have been negligible because we dared not mention the sum contributed by ourselves. Let us contribute a million dollars on Polish Day, and then the Americans will follow with the next couple of millions.</p>
   <p>The money must be sent in at once on the day after Polish Day. It should be sent by telegraph from the more remote localities, so that within a few days we shall be able to send it on to Poland. Money orders should be sent to any one of the treasury centers belonging to the Polish Central Relief Committee: namely, the Treasury of the Polish National Council; the National Fund of the Department of Independence of the Polish National Alliance; the Treasury of the Polish Roman Catholic Union; the Kosciusko Fund of the Alliance of Polish Falcons; the War Fund of the Polish Women's Alliance; and the National Chest of the Polish Union at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Committees, organizations, societies, and private individuals not affiliated with the above-mentioned treasury centers can send their contributions direct to John F. Smulski, Treasurer of the Polish Central Relief Committee, 1201 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Again we appeal to you! Over there our countrymen are dying--our brothers, and sisters, our kin. There will exist only as much of Poland as is rescued from the ravages of fire, blood, disease, and starvation. Let us save them! Let us all come to their rescue so that we may not be haunted the rest of our lives by apparitions of those who have died!</p>
   <p>We hope that all our treasury centers and all organizations will at once mail, to each of their branches, separate appeals for generosity on this Polish Day. We hope that our press will exert every effort to popularize the idea of Polish Day, and that our patriotic clergy, from their pulpits, will explain to the people the necessity of contributing.</p>
   <p>Let us remember, brothers, that there will exist only as much of Poland as is <span class="page-break">6</span>rescued from the ravages of fire, blood, disease, and starvation.</p>
