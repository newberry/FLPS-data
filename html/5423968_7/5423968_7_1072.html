   <p>Yesterday a check for $10,122,15, issued to the Central Polish Relief Committee in America and signed by the Executive Committee of the Allied Bazaar of Chicago, was handed to the Polish Relief Committee as the proceeds of the Polish Section of the Bazaar.</p>
   <p>It is to be expected that besides this important sum, more money will flow into the Central Polish Relief Committee's treasury from the net profit of the American sections, which is to be divided among the several nationalities.</p>
   <p>Certainly well worth while have been the efforts of the Women's Committee headed by Mrs. Jadwiga [Harriet] Smulski. This committee, with the cooperation of a large number of women, worked gallantly and tirelessly during the entire duration of the bazaar in order to collect funds for the Polish Section.</p>

   <p>May this splendid result and the knowledge that it may save thousands of Polish families in the homeland from starvation be a reward to all those who in any way contributed to the success of the Polish Section of the Allied Bazaar of Chicago and an encouragement for continued zealous efforts in further relief activities.</p>
