   <p>The Chicago archdiocese, as is already known, has lately received a new archbishop. Heading the voice of a papal summons, he adds his share to the offerings for Poland, being collected throughout the whole world. The fact that this is being fulfilled just in the very first moments of the new Polish government by the new superior of the Chicago archdiocese, the Dziennik Chicagoski observes in reckoning with the friendly depositions and permanent friendly relations which exist between the new archbishop and the Poles in Chicago, indicates the conditions of the Polish Catholic union of the diocese.</p>
   <p>For a long time the arrangement to collect offerings for Poland in the Catholic parishes in Chicago was directly impossible to be made. The main reason for this was the drawn-out and grievously absorbing indisposition of the previous late arvhbishop; his successor, however, a young man, energetic, and as is known from his activities up to this time, a man of highly humanitarian ideas, truly and universally human, who was moved by the misfortunes of Poland, about which the entire press has so much reported, as one of his very first good acts upon taking over the reins of government in a new capital. He set a date for a Polish Day in the archdiocese, with which initial struggle he affected many Polish hearts, binding them to himself permanently and gaining in them a sincere devotion, benevolence, and the readiness to support all his worthy causes. This hearty greatitude is expressed by the Dziennik Chicagoski, adding that he is doing this as an adherent of the Polish society in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We have already reported about the first decision of His Excellency, the Archbishop, in the matter of offerings for Poland, informing everyone in general about the action undertaken by the Polish clergy in Chicago whose delegation went to see the new archbishop. He received the delegation with extraordinary kindness and benevolence and immediately brought to memory the call sent out by the Pope for the cause of Poland and also expressed that this matter should have been taken care of long ago. This not having been done, he would with satisfaction announce a Polish Day, as one of the first acts of his rule in Chicago.</p>
   <p>On Saturday the 11th instand the archbishop summoned the Most Reverend W. Zapala C. R., the general secretary of the Association of Polish clergy in America, whom he informed that April 2 should be the day set aside for Polish Day, which happens to be the 4th Sunday in Lent, on which day all parishes in Chicago, regardless of nationality, will make collections for Poland at the time of the celebration of the mass.</p>
   <p>The money will be turned over to the archbishop, who will then further dispose of the sum thus collected. Also the Sunday preceding the above mentioned date, (that is the 3rd Sunday in Lent) announcements will be made from the pulpits of all the churches in Chicago to bring this matter to a successful termination on the Polish Day.</p>
   <p>In due time there will appear a letter from the archbishop in the press with all the above mentioned instructions; it is already prepared at the chancery of the archbishop; it has been translated into other languages of catholic nationalities. residing in Chicago and environs, and has already been sent out to the clergy with the recommendation that it be read from the pulpit in the churches on the 25th day of March.</p>
   <p>His Excellency, the Archbishop, has informed the general secretaty of the Association of Polish clergy about all these details, above that from himself, as a personal offering he turned over to him a check for $1,000; together with a letter about the instructions that have been issued and the text of the archbishop's order.</p>
   <p>This letter written plainly but with dignity and with evident benevolence toward the cause, attesting the generosity of the donor, our new archbishop, expresses a strongly penetrative impression; the letter with the personal offering we cite below word for word:</p>
   <p>March 11, 1916</p>
   <p>Very Reverend Dear Father Zapala:</p>
   <p>I have appointed a day and I have written an appeal for the collections to be taken in this diocese for the war suffers in Poland. I am sending you a copy of the letter to be translated into the Polish language. But I realize how pressing is the need and how help is needed as soon as possible. In order to co-operate with this work of relief, I am enclosing a personal donation from my own slender savings in the East. I wish I were able to make it ten times as large for I know no charity that is more deserving or people who more appreciate this assistance than the poor suffering people in Poland. I hope you may find many in Chicago more able, and for that reason more generous for your people.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours in Christ,</p>
   <p>Archbishop of Chicago - George W. Mundelein.</p>
   <p>The good words of the reverend archbishop will imprint themselves deeply in our hearts, and his liberal offer awakens the highest gratitude and will gain a lasting memory of the noble donor in the hearts of the Poles.</p>
