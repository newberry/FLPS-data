   <p>The Polish newspaper, Zgoda, in its recent issue, honors the Dziennik Chicagoski with various criticisms. Of particular interest is the article, "Where is Truth?" The author of this work attempts to show his knowledge of the multiplication table, but his success in this is the same as though a mathematical theorist, for example, endeavored to make a practical estimate for the construction of a building.</p>
   <p>A brief synopsis of this article runs thus: if some two thousand people attended the exercise at the church hall, in commemoration of the adoption of the Polish Constitution on May 3, as the Dziennik Chicagoski stated, and if the admission fee ranging from fifteen to twenty-five cents was for charity, that is, as a contribution for the Unitarians, then the $48, collected for that purpose is so insignificant that it demands the serious consideration of all those acquainted with figures.</p>

   <p>All appearance of righteousness would seem to be with the author of the article to those people who are entirely unacquainted with our customs and conditions. The matter takes on another aspect when one examines it more deeply. The author of the article is in error when he states that the presentation of such exercises is free, that the entire income from the sale of tickets for such occasions is clear, net profit. All those living in Chicago for a considerable length of time are well aware of the fact that the expenses connected with any affair are vast. This will prove that if a net profit of $50 was made, the attendance must have been large in order to collect a sum of that size from the admission fees of fifteen and twenty-five cents.</p>
   <p>We have before us a report of the committee that conducted the program. The Zgoda, or its correspondents or its editors have actually no right to make any demands or requests for the publication of this report. The Dziennik Chicagoski would disregard this criticism by remaining silent were it not interested in pointing out the injustice and the fallacious principle of such charges.</p>

   <p>The committee's report stated that a sum of $159.96 was collected from the sale of tickets. The expenses, however, were as follow: for rental of the hall $49.96 was spent (instead of $50. That Zgoda, may again be in a position to write voluminous articles, at the present time, the Dziennik Chicagoski fails to justify the reason for dropping the four cents from the rental of the hall. This will offer them an opportunity to write on why so strange an amount was collected at the meeting who pocketed the four cents or how many other people shared in it, and the like). The cost for musicians was $40, for printing $8, and for the transcription of notes for the choir, and other incidental expense, $9. Consequently, the total expense was $106.96, thus leaving a net profit of $48. This sum was donated to the Unitarians.</p>
