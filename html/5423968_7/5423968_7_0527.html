   <p>The Polish hospital occupies a beautiful four-story building. The reception room is located on the main floor where the patients will be received and advice given. The business office is also on the main floor. The next two stories will be used for hospital wards, and each ward will contain thirty beds. On the three adjoining lots there are grounds for use by the convalescents. In the back of the main building there is a smaller building, still occupied by the tenants, which will be connected with the hospital as soon as it is vacated.</p>
   <p>The following Polish physicians will be associated with the hospital: Dr. E. Czerniewski, Dr. M. Janczewski, Dr. K. Midowicz, Dr. R. Lande, and Dr. Kuflewski. The physicians have offered their services free of charge.</p>
   <p>There will be no regular business manager. The management of the hospital will be in the hands of the Sisters of Mercy. The books will be kept by Dr. R. Lande, assisted by Dr. Kuflewski.</p>

   <p>The Polish hospital, the official name of which is "St. Mary's Hospital," is an established fact.</p>
   <p>We only wish to add that the majority of the local papers reported the dedication of the Polish hospital. The Staats-Zeitung published a long article about it under the Polish title "Szpital Polski" (Polish Hospital). The Tribune published an article yesterday, with pictures of the hospital and of Dr. Lande.</p>
