   <p>The monthly meeting of the Polish Social Workers' Club was held on Sunday, February 7, 1915, at 4 P. M., in the Echart Park hall. Among other matters the following were settled: the program of the social workers' conference and the speakers' program at the Club's meeting; the matter of the forthcoming public health exhibit, to be held from February 15 to February 27, 1915, inclusive, in the Harrison High Technical School auditorium, Marshall Boulevard and West 24th Street; and the Club's plans to be properly represented at this exhibit. It was decided to have Polish Days at the exhibit on February 22 and February 23, 1915, that is, on Monday and Tuesday. Efforts will be made to interest all Polish doctors and priests and all Polish organizations, so that as many as possible may visit the exhibit on the Polish Days. Speeches in Polish, recitals, concerts, songs, and cinema pictures will be included in the program.</p>
   <p>Toward the end of the meeting an invitation was extended to the members and <span class="page-break">\2</span>guests [who were present] of the Club to attend a banquet. An appetizing meal, prepared by the tireless members of the Club, was enjoyed by all. The guests of honor were Mr. &amp; Mrs. Straszewicz, of Poland, and the Reverend Mr. Van Dingen. The banquet was followed by informal speeches and discussions on the topic of the immigration bill. These discussions had a marked effect upon those present. The informal speeches were very educational and contained priceless information. With the business matters of the Club completed and the repast consumed, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
