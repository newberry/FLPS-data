   <p>Mr. Erasmus Jerzmanowski, who spent a few days with his friends in Chicago, made his stay here doubly interesting by making another donation for a benevolent purpose. The visitor made a contribution of one hundred dollars to the fund for the proposed Polish hospital, leaving this amount with Reverend A. Nowicki when he left.</p>
   <p>The Polish hospital will be established by the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, and this donation is the best proof that Mr. Jerzmanowski has a true conception of good citizenship. All honor to the noble donor!</p>
