   <p>Last Saturday [July 7] a reception was held at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall on Ashland Avenue for Mrs. Laura Turczynowicz who, as we wrote in Saturday's issue of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, is organizing Polish Reconstruction committees in all the cities of this country.</p>
   <p>Present at Saturday's reception were representatives of organizations and of the press and also prominent Poles who came to hear Mrs. Turczynowicz speak on what is happening in Poland, how the Germans are conducting themselves in our land, and how they are torturing our people.</p>
   <p>Among those present we noticed the following: Mrs. Chmielinski, Mrs. Raczkowski, Mrs. Czachopski, Mrs. [N. L.] Piotrowski, Miss [E.] Napieralski, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mrs. [A.] Neuman, Mrs. [S.] Osuch, Mrs. Kaczorowski, Mrs. Wolowski, Mrs. Zolinski, Mrs. Szymanski, Mrs. [M.] Sakowski, Mrs. [M.] Milewski, Mrs. Fuflewski, Mrs. Petlak, Mrs. Chodzinski, and Mrs. H. Baranowski. Among the men present were Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, Judge [E.] Jarecki, [H.] Setmajer, [S.] Lewental, Papara, Brodnicki, and [L.] Pinderski.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Turczynowicz spoke to the gathering, eloquently describing conditions in Poland and citing a great many facts as proof of German barbarity in our land. After her address she opened a short discussion on the subject of organizing a committee for the reconstruction of Poland, the matter which was presented yesterday at the mass meeting held at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall.</p>

   <p>Punctually at eight o'clock Mrs. Neuman, president of the Polish Women's Alliance, escorted Mrs. Turczynowicz to the platform. Mrs. Turczynowicz spoke at first in Polish, although she finds it quite difficult, and then in English, describing the terrible conditions in German-occupied Poland. She told of the cruelty of the Germans...and of how they have pity for no one. Many times tears could be seen in the eyes of more than one person in the audience, as if in answer to the lecturer's facts....</p>
   <p>She gave word pictures to the gathering of the conduct of the Germans in Suwalki and in the vicinity of Warsaw, of the behavior of Hindenburg's soldiers and officers, of German doctors, and so on. Each statement heightened the gathering's hatred for Prussianism. A description of the solemn celebration by drunken German soldiers of the sinking of the "Lusitania" made a deep impression upon those present, as did the [account of the] behavior of the German soldiers towards women and girls in Suwalki.</p>

   <p>After presenting the naked truth in all its horror, Mrs. Turczynowicz spoke of her plan for work here in the United States. She said that it is her intention to form Polish and American committees which will immediately begin to accumulate materials, supplies, money, and necessary tools so that when peace is declared, a ship may at once be dispatched to Poland, loaded with clothing, shoes, food, farm implements, seeds, and even portable houses, for there is a shortage of dwellings in Poland. To accomplish this, Mrs. Turczynowicz desires to organize a Polish Reconstruction Committee. This committee will in no way conflict with any of the committees already existing; instead, it will complete the list of committees.</p>
   <p>The next speaker, [H.] Lokanski, also presented the matter of forming such a committee clearly and precisely. He was followed by /John/ Przyprawa, whose words had a great effect upon the assembly.</p>
   <p>After Przyprawa's address, the following resolution was read:</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"We, gathered here in mass meeting on July 8, 1917, in the Polish Women's Alliance Hall, unanimously approve of the proposal of Mrs. Turczynowicz to form a committee for the reconstruction of Poland, its task to be to supply Poland with food, machinery, implements, seeds, clothing, and so on, and we hereby unanimously vow to support it to the fullest extent of our means.</p>
   <p>"We desire a virile Polish nation, for it is only thus, virile and capable of independent existence, that a free, united, and independent Poland can arise.</p>
   <p>"Calling upon every one for energetic co-operation with the temporary committee already created, we here gathered give to it a vote of confidence, with the conviction that its efforts will be of benefit to free, united, and independent Poland."</p>
   <p>A collection taken up by Mesdames Bucholz, Jankiewicz, Raczkowski, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Szymanski, Osuch, Milewski, Sakowski, Chodzinski, Wolf, Rupinski, and Dombrowski netted $142.</p>
   <p>This inspiring mass meeting, which will long remain in the memories of the participants, was concluded with the singing of "Boze Cos Polske" [God Save Poland] and the "Star-Spangled Banner".</p>
