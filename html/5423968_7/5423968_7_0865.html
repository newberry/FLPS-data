   <p>It is evident that some employment agencies are shamelessly taking advantage of the workingmen by accepting a fee and sending them to work on the canal, where actually there is no work for them. It often happens that laborers sent out have no money left with which to pay their fares back to Chicago. In Lemont and other towns bordering on the canal there are many laborers encumbered with their families, waiting patiently for a job. Yesterday in Lemont the number of unemployed was increased by a few hundred workers fired by the Western Stone Company. In Summit, Romeo, and Sag, the same conditions prevail.</p>
   <p>These dishonest practices of the local employment offices should be stopped permanently.</p>
