   <p>We hereby inform the public, which has supported and continues to support us in our efforts, that the net proceeds of the Penny Bazaar arranged by the Girls for Girls Society on Palm Sunday amounted to $151.80. Although this sum is not very large, nevertheless we thank those who came to the bazaar despite the inclemency of the weather in order to help us raise this amount. At the same time we are sending the patroness of our circle, Mrs. Helen Paderewski, $200--that is, the proceeds of a ball sponsored by this society plus the proceeds of the bazaar.</p>
   <p>We also express our sincere thanks to Mr. Leon Bzowka and Mr. S. Mallek for their loyal support of the bazaar, as well as to the press, which by advertising the bazaar helped us gather this sum.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Girls for Girls Society:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Emily Napieralski, president</p>
   <p>Mary Rozentretter, vice president</p>
   <p>Halina Wolff, recording secretary</p>
   <p>Mary Uchacz, financial secretary</p>
