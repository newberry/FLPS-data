   <p>The women's groups of the Polish National Alliance held a meeting on Thursday evening in the building of the Alliance, for the purpose of making plans to collect funds for national purposes. Present at this meeting were Commissioner (Mrs.) W. Lipczynska and representatives of the following women's organizations: Group 519, Women's Society of the Crown of Poland; Group 579, Club of Patriotic Polish Women; Group 682, Society of Queen Hedwig; Group 850, The Link; Group 871, Society Leadership; Group 987, Rock Society; Group 1103, Liberty Bell;Group 1178, Victory of Polish Women; and Group 1422, The Home Fires.</p>
   <p>Mrs. K. Obarska, president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance, opened the meeting, emphasizing at the outset that, following the customs of our great-grandmothers, she considered it fitting that the deliberations be opened with a prayer, which the honorable Commissioner led.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"At the present time," said the president, "all eyes are turned upon the Polish woman and everyone counts on her co-operation in the work which awaits the entire Polish community. For this reason, the Women's Auxiliary has called together this mass meeting in order to discuss a program of work."</p>
   <p>Then she called upon Mrs. Lipczynska to act as chairwoman of the meeting.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lipczynska, after greeting cordially the ladies present, gave a short resume of the history of the Alliance and the purpose for which it was founded. Then she made the transition to the present happenings. "The time is coming for an accounting of our injuries and servitude; the moment is approaching which brings with it the freedom of our beloved homeland. Our brothers in Europe are offering their lives for the homeland; we will not be granted the privilege of sharing this honor. All we can do is to come forward with material aid. Therefore, to work, Sisters, to work! Collect and amass your widows' mite, which might turn the scales on which the fate of our motherland will be weighed."</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Next, Mrs. Obarska delivered an address. In her excellent speech, which we cannot print in its entirety for lack of space, she appealed to the hearts of the Polish women. And this appeal was so sincere, so ardent and straightforward, that tears could be seen in the eyes of many.</p>
   <p>"We are safe and secure here," cried the speaker; "we have those dearest to us near us, while there, in the homeland, our Sisters comfort in their arms, as best as they can, their hungry children, whose guardian, defender, and provider had to leave for the bloody battle front, With a mother's heart, let us feel their misfortune, let us not shut ourselves up in our comforts; let us prove with deeds that we are Poles. Let us only really want it, and thousands [of dollars] will pour in!"</p>
   <p>Finally, Mrs. M. Milewska, vice-president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance, spoke, emphasizing the fact that the Poles can only count on their own strength. She asserted that the Poles were forced to fight <span class="page-break">4</span>many times for the Prussians and by their daring contributed to the victory of the latter. But what did they gain in return? "Oh, yes, the Prussians showed their gratitude! They repaid us by persecuting us for our faith and language; they tortured Polish children and finally crowned their cruelty with the decree of disappropriation."</p>
   <p>The ardent addresses of the speakers were sincerely applauded by the ladies. The honorable Commissioner called on Mrs. M. Sakowska, director of the Polish National Alliance,to say a few words. Mrs. Sakowska asserted that although she considered it a great honor to speak before so worthy a group, she considered that enough had been said and that now it was time for action. She brought to their attention the fact that the secretary of the Department of Independence of the Polish National Alliance was present and would gladly give them directions and explain what part the women should take in the work of collecting funds.</p>
   <p>"It is deeds that we need, not words!" cried the director of the Polish National <span class="page-break">5</span>Alliance and secretary of the Department of Independence, Mr. Michael Kmieciak. "Let us pray, but with actions! You who have stood under the banner of the Polish National Alliance, together with your husbands, brothers, and fiances, stand now shoulder to shoulder with them in work! Our people understand sacrifice for sacred causes, as can be proved by the fact that within a few days $1,965.87 has come into the treasury of the Department of Independence."</p>
   <p>Then director Kmieciak explained to the women what motions the Department of Independence passed and what directions it had issued; in what manner the contributions to the Independence Fund should be collected and, in general, gave the ladies pertinent information.</p>
   <p>Then several women, in turn, took the floor. Mrs. Sakowska suggested that the local groups in each district get together and devise a plan as to where and when each group will send its collectors, so as to prevent one group from interfering with another in the work. Mrs. Sakowska's suggestion <span class="page-break">6</span>was considered good. Mrs. Plocinska, of Group 1103, asserted that Branch 41 had suggested taxing its members.</p>
   <p>After an exhaustive discussion, Mrs. Sakowska proposed that they put their words into action at once and take up a collection. This was accepted and twelve dollars were collected.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the honorable Commissioner called upon the women present to enter enthusiastically into the discussions and assignment of work at the meetings of their respective groups, to see to it that every member would take part in the work.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Obarska made the motion that a resolution be drawn up for the Polish women in America. The following ladies were appointed to the committee: Mrs. W. Lipczynska, commissioner, Mrs. K. Obarska, Mrs. M. Sakowska, Mrs. M. Zaremba, and Mrs. M. Milewska.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Then with the singing of "God Save Poland," the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>RESOLUTION</p>
   <p>We Polish women of Chicago and surrounding territory, members of the Alliance, gathered together at the behest of the Women's Auxiliary at the Polish National Alliance building on Thursday evening, August 3, 1914, for the purpose of discussing ways and means for dividing the work whereby we hope to free our unfortunate homeland from its shackles of servitude, [have adopted the following resolution]:</p>
   <p>Whereas, Now that war has begun to rage on Polish soil in all its horror we Polish women must not stand aside in inactivity but must unite in work, with all our hearts, in order to win a free and independent Poland; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, In order to win a free Poland we must unite all our strength and show the entire world that we, too, know how to love our country with all our souls; and</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Whereas, The Polish National Alliance is gathering together the people to serve the homeland and is preparing them for concerted action; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That our action, following our brothers step by step, hand in hand, will be to collect money for the National Fund, to get to work for a truly Polish and patriotic cause, which should weigh on the heart of every true Polish woman here in the free land of Washington, and to prove through action that we are Poles and that our country will not be disappointed in our patriotism.</p>
   <p>Therefore, to work! to action! and God and our country, which we hope to regain free and independent, will bless us.</p>
   <p>Long live free and independent Poland! Long live the Polish National Alliance!</p>
