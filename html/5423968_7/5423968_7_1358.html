   <p>We have just been informed by letter that the Polish Central Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward has organized a Welfare Committee for the purpose of raising funds to aid the destitute Poles of this ward. Arrangements have been made with the Cook County Relief Agent whereby needy families will be given assistance.</p>
   <p>The members of the committee are as follows: John Krajecki, 140 Hamburg Street, president; Albert Nowak, 265 West Webster Avenue, secretary; Stan. Fruzyna, 1020 North Robey Street, treasurer; F. Zarazinski, 277 West Webster Avenue; and Stan. Glomski, 893 Girard Street.</p>
   <p>All contributions will be acknowledged in the Polish press.</p>
   <p>An appeal to the public for assistance was also included in the letter; however, it was not published because it was similar to that of the Polish Welfare <span class="page-break">\2</span>Association of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>Poverty statements will be issued by Albert Nowak, secretary, 265 West Webster Avenue.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, Sunday, at 4 P. M., a meeting will be held at the St. Hedwig Parish School Hall. The committee invites all Poles of the Fifteenth Ward to attend.</p>
