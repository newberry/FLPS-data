   <p>A special dinner frolic was held at Pulaski's Hall, Sunday, November 20, by the Welfare Society of St. Albert's Parish. The affair as a whole turned out to be a success. A large number of parishioners and friends attended the affair. The net proceeds were given toward the support of The Holy Family Orphanage. Several church societies have promised to give contributions. Those that have given donations are as follows: John Sobieski's Society, Polish Union, Industrialists' Society, The Foresters Organization, St. Michael's Society, Christian Mothers' Society, St. Ann's Society, St. Mary's of Perpetual Help Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. Szlak and Mr. Rutkowski, together with Rev. Casimir Gronkowski, pastor, also made offerings. The Welfare Society will hold a meeting next Tuesday at the Holy Family Orphanage. A new administration will go into office at this meeting.</p>
