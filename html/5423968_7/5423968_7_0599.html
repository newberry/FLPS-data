   <p>The orphanage of Avondale will hold their annual picnic on Labor Day, Sept. 4, 1905. This Polish orphans' picnic will be held at Kosciuszko Park, to help the people enjoy themselves, to see and to please and gladden the unfortunate children of this orphanage. This year, as in the past years, if the weather permits, the orphans are sure that a great crowd will be on hand to celebrate.</p>
   <p>The street cars are most convenient. They stop only two blocks away from the grove. Therefore, everyone that intends to come should get to the grove as early as possible, so the orphans can get acquainted and have an early start, playing with the other children. There will be races, games, drinks, sandwiches, concession stands, etc.</p>
   <p>The orphanage administration, consisting of sisters and members of the Holy Rosary Society, is cordially inviting all the Poles and their friends not to forget the orphans in their plea for fun and amusements for at least one day.</p>
