   <p>A rather large group of Polish businessmen belonging to a recently organized Association met at the headquarters of the Polish Women's Alliance, on Thursday, January 28, 1915. The purpose of this meeting was to consider the matter of the bazaar. The discussion lasted for several hours. It was directed by the bazaar committee, composed of the president, Mr. Venceslaus Perlowski, a director of the Union Furniture Company, the treasurer, W. Sajewski, an owner of a musical instruments concern, and the secretary of the committee, A. T. Hibner, a director of the Polonia Clothing Company. Among the congregated businessmen, Mr. Alexander Busch, the president of the Association, Mr. Charles Olszowy, the vice president, and nearly all of the directors were present.</p>
   <p>The secretary's report showed that so far there has been a steady flow of articles contributed for the bazaar. If this continues, the bazaar, conducted by the Polish businessmen for the benefit of the needy in Poland, will be one of the most successful in Chicago.</p>

   <p>An itemized report showed that $100 in cash has thus far been collected, $325 in furniture, $85 in musical instruments, $140 in men's clothing, $200 in men's haberdashery, $98 in shoes, $50 in jewelry, $46 in liquor, $145 in home appliances, and $100 in groceries; eight hundred cigars of excellent worth have also been contributed.</p>
   <p>The collectors are supplied with books and continue to conduct their work. Thus far none of our businessmen have refused to work for this cause. Everyone understands well that the honor of Polish businessmen in Chicago demands that all co-operate in contributing, to assure many thousands of dollars for the starving in Poland.</p>
   <p>The secretary's report was accepted with acclaim. The president of the committee then informed everyone that the bazaar would be held in Polish National Alliance Hall. He extended the heartfelt thanks of the Polish Businessmen's Association to the administration of the Polish Women's Alliance for the generosity it has shown for a worthy cause.</p>

   <p>The bazaar will commence on Saturday, February 20, 1915, and will be open Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays for four weeks. On Thursdays and Saturdays it will last from 6:00 P. M. to midnight, and on Sundays from 2:00 P. M. to midnight.</p>
   <p>The Polish Businessmen's Association also had two distinguished guests at this meeting. They were Professor B. Rybowiak and Mr. K. Iwicki, who have announced their willingness to summon the directors of Polish orchestras and choirs for a conference and to take care of the musical part of the bazaar. They expressed their conviction that none of our musicians and singers would refuse to co-operate. After this a committee on music and choirs was selected to continue the work in co-operation with Mr. Rybowiak. The following were chosen for this committee: B. Rybowiak, Hensel, K. Iwicki and D. Krotochwil. After the necessary committees had been appointed, it was finally decided that all communications to the press should remain under the control of the main committee, composed of V. Perlowski, W. Sajewski, and A. Hibner.</p>
