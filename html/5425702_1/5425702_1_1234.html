   <p>p. 4. - This great metropolis, which because of its leadership in commerce and industry and its cultural and artistic development has become one of the principal centers of the world, is celebrating its jubilee this year.</p>
   <p>Many groups, representing various nationalities, have already participated in the great event with superb exhibitions worthy of admiration for the solidarity and discipline displayed.</p>
   <p>Can we Italians be indifferent to the general celebration and lag behind people of other nationalities, who neglect no opportunity to increase their prestige and to show their attachment to this great country?</p>
   <p>We Italians are also part of the cosmopolitan population of Chicago, and now is the time for us to do our duty by participating in this solemn celebration, and by so doing we shall gain recognition.</p>
