   <p>The first number of the Corriere di Chicago directed by the well known writer Prof. Luigi. Carnovale, has been issued.</p>
   <p>The new weekly newspaper has a vast program and exalted purpose which will be of credit to the Italian Colony.</p>
   <p>Luigi Carnovale is a very learned man and author of various publications. We feel confident that even in the journalistic field he will open a new road; will gain the interest of the Italo-Americans and get the financial and moral support necessary for the success which we wish to him.</p>
