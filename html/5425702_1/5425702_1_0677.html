   <p>A second meeting in support of the candidacy of Judge Bernard Barasa for State's Attorney took place last Tuesday evening at the La Salle Hotel. Judging from the number who attended this meeting, Judge Barasa may count upon the full support of the Italians for the coming primaries of September 15.</p>
   <p>Alberto Gualano, the lawyer, took charge of the meeting, and Mr. Michele Schiavone took care of the expenses. The speakers for the evening were: Mr. Dan Iandola, Mr. John D'Urso, Mr. John Panegasser, and Lawyer Tufo. Judge Barasa, candidate for State's Attorney, spoke bitterly against his opponents who contend that Judge Bernard Barasa is a candidate merely to harm one of the other candidates. Judge Bernard Barasa declared he is certain of winning on the basis of his popularity and merits.</p>
