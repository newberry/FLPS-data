   <p>If only May first were in reality a labor holiday!</p>
   <p>The Socialist conception of it, is the protest of labor, a protest on a day filled with strikes when workers are advised by their leaders to propagandize more aggressively.</p>
   <p>A holiday should mean peace and rest. That of the Socialists, instead, is the struggle of the proletariat, of the disinherited against those who impoverish them. It is not an exhaltation of the spirit of labor, but a reproach to the privileged element of society against that organized fraud which robs the workers of much of the benefits which they have a right to enjoy, by virtue of the law of compensation.</p>

   <p>Socialism errs when, in its struggle for vindication, it threatens to substitute the tyranny of the oppressors; when it rejects the help of disinterested cooperators; when, with the keen knife of criticism, it seeks to destroy a society of whose inner organism it has lost the secret; when, to swell its ranks, it appeals to and excites the passions of the rabble.</p>
   <p>Let us disregard words and consider actual facts. Let us forget what May 1, 1925 has told the world and see what it has done.</p>
   <p>In America, Italy, and in almost all civilized nations, we find a system that has become a habit, the pressure of the influential and privileged classes, who burdened by taxes but protected by law and civic institutions, take advantage of the labor of the under-privileged, who toil, suffer, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>die uncomplainingly, and for whom civilization holds no hope of redemption. For these Socialisms, which strives to reveal social inequalities and prepare the souls of the people for the conquest of the future, meets their needs and succeeds in rousing them to a realization of the injustice of their position. It reveals to them the good and the evil and instills in them hatred for those who see them suffer without raising a protesting voice in their behalf.</p>
   <p>And thus does Socialism develop!</p>
   <p>Every year on May first, always with hope, voices of insurrection are raised in protest and threaten with the familiar cry, "Proletariats of all the world stand united."</p>

   <p>And what have the representatives of the Christian churches, - the Catholics and Protestants, done in the face of civilization's injustice?</p>
   <p>Are not the ministers of Jesus Christ ashamed to allow the "dangerous hands" of Socialism to take from them the tutelage of the weak and oppressed? To work, Christian ministers! and whenever there are people compelled to sell their energies and dignity, not for a decent living but for a bare existence; whenever the down-trodden are waiting for assistance and safe leadership against the danger of an unjust economic and political system, don't wait for the Socialist to do the job in the name of class struggle, intervene in the name of the law of nature, God's law.</p>
   <p>How much better, if the world, each year, celebrated a labor holiday redeemed and ennobled by Christianity. Is it a dream?</p>
