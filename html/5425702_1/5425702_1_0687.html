   <p>Much joy has been felt in the Italian colony of Chicago, because of the election of the lawyer Bernard Barasa to Judge of the Municipal Court.</p>
   <p>A committee of leading Italians formed at our suggestion, will with their presence, honor the new judge when he first holds court next Monday in Room 915, City Hall.</p>
   <p>Judge Barasa is the first Italian to attain to that high office in this city and it is no more than proper that our countrymen show their pleasure by being present at his first day in court.</p>
   <p>Admission is free, and Chief Justice Olson, will swear in the new candidate at 10 A. M. of that day.</p>
