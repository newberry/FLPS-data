   <p>September 30, 1924, will mark a memorable date in the history of our association. On this date the Supreme Council deposited with the State of Illinois the sum of $75,000 as part of the $100,000 requested by the State to create a guaranty reserve fund.</p>
   <p>Our members should be very happy because this reserve fund marks the financial standing of the association which will not stop ascending until all Italians of the various states are united under its leadership.</p>
   <p>The accomplishment of today was possible because of the energetic initiative shown by the Executive Council in studying and organizing the proper ways and means which in a short period put our association in a leading place.</p>
