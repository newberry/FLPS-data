   <p>Our compatriot, Mr. Armand Bertolini, at the request of many Italians of Chicago, has applied to the Federal Radio Commission at Washington, D. C., for permission to operate an exclusive Italian radio station in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is a shame for us Italians, sons of the land that gave to the world the father of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi, not to have a radio station to broadcast our programs across the continent in our own beautiful and musical language, while this is being done by Germans, Polish, Bohemians, Swedish, and other stations.</p>
   <p>We beg our fellow-Italians to support the splendid efforts of Mr. Bertolini.</p>
