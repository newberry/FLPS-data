   <p>Last Thursday the Italian Regiment of the Republican Legion, elected the following officers:</p>
   <p>S. Valone, Colonel; V. Peroti, Lieut.-Colonel; A. Gentile, N. Catelani e Luigi, as Major Officers.</p>
   <p>The regiment is formed of twelve societies attired in elegant military uniforms.</p>
   <p>The societies are in the 1st, 5th, 10th, 13th, 17th, 19th and 31st wards.</p>
   <p>The first outing was set for Friday evening at 8 o'clock, when every regiment of the Legion will take leave in a parade.</p>
   <p>It is the general opinion that the Regiment will make a fine appearance.</p>
   <p>The Republican Italian Committee of Cook County, presided over by Mr. Ettore Durante, who has organized the regiment, is working to its utmost to assure the victory of the Republican ballot, and we could judge that seventy-five percent of the Italians will vote for President McKinley.</p>
