   <p>Sunday afternoon, 2 PM, at the Masonic Temple Drill Hall, a meeting will be held in support of the candidacy of our member, Stefano Malato, a prominent lawyer in the Italian colony, for Judge of the Municipal Court. Although he is a democrat, every Italian should give him his vote.</p>
   <p>The Executive Council of the Societa Frinacria Fratellanza Siciliana has taken the initiative of giving this meeting and has sent out two circular letters.</p>
   <p>One letter is to the members of the Society and reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Co-Member!</p>
   <p>You are cordially invited to be present at a meeting to be held at Masonic Temple Drill Hall, State and Randolph Streets, Sunday afternoon, at 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this meeting is to ask for the cooperation of every member in supporting Mr. Malato, a prominent lawyer of our colony who is a democratic candidate for Judge of the Municipal Court, in the coming election.</p>
   <p>We urge every member to be present."</p>

   <p>A second letter was sent to the Presidents of all Italian Societies in Chicago, and read as follows:</p>
   <p>"Our countryman, Mr. Stefano Malato, a well-known lawyer in our colony, is a candidate for Judge of the Municipal Court in the coming election, and we ask the co-operation of all Italians to support Mr. Stefano Malato, by getting votes for him.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, will hold a meeting at the Masonic Temple Drill Hall, N. State and E. Randolph Sts. Sunday afternoon, 2 PM, regarding the coming election."</p>
