   <p>For disregarding an order of the Melrose Park Health authorities, the Italian Quarter of the town has been placed under quarantine. This means that about fifty children of the colony will be absent from their studies until this rigorous order is removed.</p>
   <p>This drastic course was determined upon because of the death by diptheria of a child in the colony. Dr. Scott, head of the Health Dept. had ordered a private funeral without a wake.</p>
   <p>But since the dead child's family is very well-known and liked, the funeral, contrary to Dr. Scott's order, became a general demonstration of sympathy for the bereaved family, with large numbers of the colony, many children included, following the casket to the cemetery.</p>
   <p>The result was the order to quarantine.</p>
