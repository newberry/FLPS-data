   <p>Extraordinary preparations are being made for the celebration of the first centennial of our city. Committees of every nationality are being formed. A committee for the Italian colony has been formed but we believe that it should be enlarged because there is lacking the adhesion of many organizations and representatives of the local press. Lately a ladies committee was formed under the name of Italian Women's Committee.</p>
   <p>The well-known Mrs. Bartolomei is honorary president and Mrs. Soravia is the president. The members are Mesdames A. Pope, M. Serra, S. Mirabella, J. Bassi, P. Mei, A. J. Prignano.</p>
