   <p>We recently had the occasion of visiting Thomas Serritelli, manager of the Italian Department of the West Side Trust &amp; Saving Bank, a strong banking institution located at the corner of Halsted Street and Roosevelt Road.</p>
   <p>Mr. Serritelli explaines in detail the various services which the department offers to all Italians, many of whom who find in Mr. Serritella and his co-workers the greatest co-operation.</p>
