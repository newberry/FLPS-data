   <p>Italian Chamber of Commerce,</p>
   <p>Suite 1612-1613 Masonic Temple,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>My dear Sir and Friend:</p>
   <p>I am pleased to acknowledge receipt of your recent letter advising me of the resolution adopted at a recent meeting of the Italian Chamber of Commerce at Chicago. I need hardly say that the prohibition question is one of those persistent questions which it seems will not down. Lincoln once remarked that no question was ever settled till it was settled right. Obviously, the quest for a settlement of the prohibition question has been a long one judging by this standard.</p>
   <p>The prohibition Amendment referred to has already received the approval of both Houses, but it is attached to the Food Production Bill which has not yet passed both Houses. You may be puzzled by this parliamentary question which I will not explain. I assume that the bill will sooner <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>or later go to the President with the Prohibition Amendment attached. What action the President will take, I am not in a position to know.</p>
   <p>You may be interested to know, in the Finance Committee, an Amendment has been adopted to the War Revenue Bill which permits the importation of wine so long as the manufacture is continued in the United States. This was a continued matter of great concern both to Italy and to France.</p>
   <p>Believe me, with hearty good wishes,</p>
   <p>Yours Very Truly,</p>
   <p>T.P. Goil.</p>
