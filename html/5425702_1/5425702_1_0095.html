   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the Board of Education, yesterday June 13, I decided to delay my decision for two weeks.</p>
   <p>I have done so, because I am very anxious to receive an opinion from the Italian Colony. Would it be possible for the officials of the different societies to meet and adopt several resolutions in the name of all the Italians in this city, or could they possibly summon a mass meeting?</p>

   <p>I would prefer only one resolution, signed by all the Presidents in the name of their societies.</p>
   <p>Please do take care of this inside of two weeks. This is of vital importance to all foreign elements, and the Italians should give it some consideration.</p>
   <p>C. R. Walleck.</p>
