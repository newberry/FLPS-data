   <p>The dishonest propaganda spread by the national manufacturers of tomato preserves is well known to this Chamber of Commerce which has for its objective the protection of Italian industries.</p>
   <p>Therefore, discussing the situation with the Executive Council, it was resolved to send a letter immediately to our manufacturers and to many Chambers of Commerce in Italy, calling their attention to the present peculiar conditions which should be of great interest to our government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The letter follows:</p>
   <p>"Since our government, for reasons created by the war, has forbidden the exportation of tomato preserves, and because of the augmented cost of this product, the national manufacturers are taking advantage of these donditions, and are conducting a campaign in favor of their product, thus harming seriously the Italian industry.</p>
   <p>"The means used to eliminate the Italian products are bare and false and are damaging Italian commerce and the reputation of our exported merchandise. Thus it is our intention to call the attention of these chambers of commerce to what may cause serious inconveniences to our industrialists if they do not in some way end the condition.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The time is opportune, in our estimation, to press our government to permit and facilitate the exportation of our products and keep the markets well supplied. The Italian importers of the United Stated should take more interest in selling our products, not for financial benefit, but for the benefit to Italian commerce and its exports.</p>
   <p>"We hope that the chambers of commerce are willing to cooperate with us and inform those interested so that they can take the proper steps to protect themselves."</p>
   <p>A copy of this letter was sent to the important manufacturers of tomato preserves in Italy, and to the sister chambers of commerce of New York, and San Francisco, who have promised us all their cooperation. We hope that our efforts are appreciated and will awaken the interest of our government into helping the industry.</p>

   <p>Mr. Emilio Gualdi of Voghera, Italy, informed us, by letter, of the steps taken by the Italian manufacturers.</p>
   <p>By suggestion of the Societa Parmense Lusignani &amp; Company, from Parma, the most interested in the manufacture of tomato preserves, it was agreed to send to Rome a committee to apprise the Minister of Industry and Commerce of the danger faced by their industries if the full exportation of tomato preserves is not permitted.</p>
   <p>The Minister, after considering the matter, promised to permit the exportation of such products on the basis of the 1913 exports.</p>
   <p>We recommend that the Italian importers show preference for our products, thus protecting the interest of our manufacturers and of Italian commerce.</p>
