   <p>A new society for mutual benefit was organized a few days ago in Chicago. Its aim is highly liberal and humanitarian. It consists of sixty (60) boys, who have in general some relation with the Keppi Society.</p>
   <p>Judging by the number of boys asking for admission to this society, the Three S. S. S. in a short time will be one of the most prosperous Italian societies in our colony. Members must be between the ages of 18 and 35.</p>
   <p>The emblem of the Three S. S. S. is Fraternity, Liberty, and Labor.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting on October 2, the work of the lodge was initiated and the officers elected as follows:- Mr. Donato Fusco, president; Vincenzo Raimendi, vice president; Ferdinando Vercillo, secretary; and Pasqual Simma, treasurer; Dr. Giallosetti was unanimously elected as doctor of the society.</p>
