   <p>In the Chamber's bulletin of May and June 1911, from the statistical data of the Collector of Customs at Chicago, duties collected for Italian marble and its manufacturers in the months of April and May 1911 were on values of $7,445.</p>
   <p>Judging from this statement, the impression is that the market at Chicago for Italian marble is almost insignificant. On the contrary an enormous amount of Italian marble is used annually. At the present time in Chicago there are contracted for the next two or three months over $200,000 worth of marble work, in the construction of buildings where Italian marble is used exclusively. In addition to building work, numerous manufacturing concerns are using an immense quantity of the same material.</p>
   <p>There is good reason therefore why such a splendid idea of an industrial section trustworthy and reliable, was instituted for the sole purpose of facilitating the business relation between Italy and the United States.</p>
