   <p>Dr. Alfred Barr and Mr. Goodman said a few words, both manifesting their sympathy and esteem for Italy and the Italians. The Rev. P. R. De Carlo, pastor of St. John Presbyterian Church, operating in conjunction with the Garibaldi Institute, was the chairman for the evening and introduced Dr. Comba with appropriate words.</p>
   <p>Dr. Comba then addressed the audience. He said that more than giving a lecture he would try to inform the public of the activities and the civic, religious and moral efforts made by the Valdesian Church among the Italian people. He spoke of the persecutions the Valdesian church suffered, and of the sacrifices made by the Valdesians to spread the Voice of the Gospel among the mountainers of the Italian Alps.</p>

   <p>He related the vast program which the Valdesians are accomplishing in Italy. The aim of the lecture was to raise funds to finance the extended civil, religious, and moral program made by the Valdesians for needy Italians.</p>
   <p>Those present responded generously and contributed to the collection made by the Rev. P. R. De Carlo and the Rev. Merlandi.</p>
