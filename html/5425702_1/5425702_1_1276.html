   <p>Last Sunday the hall of the parochial school of the Church of the Assumption at Illinois and Orleans Streets was the scene of a dramatization of the Passion Play, much in the same way as it is being given throughout Italy and Sicily. The play was directed by Father Giangrande and acted by people who played their parts many times in their native towns where the giving of this play at this time of year is a centuries-old tradition. Many Italians and some Americans were present.</p>
