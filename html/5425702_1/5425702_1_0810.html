   <p>Our esteemed confrere the Inter-Ocean in one of its recent issues, published a long article entitled "Bagging Beggars," the illustrations of which we have been able to reproduce in our present issue, thanks to the kind permission of that valuable paper.</p>
   <p>The said article is concerned exclusively with the Italian padones, beggars, rag-pickers, newsboys, organ-grinders, etc.</p>
   <p>Once in a while the American press at large feels it necessary to publish articles of such a nature as the one we refer to. Of course the intentions that prompt them are honest; they aim to stir the public opinion and stimulate the proper authorities to take the proper steps that may lead to the abatement of such a nuisance. Therefore as Italians who have the honor of our nationality at heart, we thank the good American press in general and the Inter-Ocean in particular.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>But in the meantime we have to blame in the most positive and emphatic way, the good American press in general and the Inter-Ocean in particular for their failure editorially to spur the proper authorities to apply the municipal ordinances and the State Laws which were enacted just for the abatement of the deplored nuisances.</p>
   <p>We Italian aliens, as they call us, generally look with intense stupor and amazement upon the fact that laws and ordinances are left a dead letter while the people and the press loudly denounce those nuisances which would be stamped out with the enforcement of said laws and ordinances. The Italians in Chicago, contrary to what the president of the Local Humane Society has said, have done their best to suppress those evils. At this point it is not improper to mention that the Italians here have promoted and seconded the movement in favor of the Compulsory Educational Law. The late Charles Kozminski consented to be their mouthpiece in the Board of Education. That sterling man brought their grievances before the Board with regard to the fact that swarms of Italian children were allowed to grow wild on the public <span class="page-break">3</span>streets, and this was the "parva-favilla," that ignited the fire-works of the Compulsory Education, which has now ended like any fire-works display, leaving everything in darkness as before.</p>
   <p>The Italians have also been instrumental in pushing through the City Council the ordinances against the filthy rag-pickers and professional beggars. Four years ago they held a mass meeting and collected from among themselves nearly $400 for this purpose. At that meeting a committee composed of fourteen Italians was appointed and charged to do the lobby work. A prominent lawyer was engaged to direct the work legally, and the desired ordinances were passed.</p>
   <p>But they were enforced a week or a trifle over that, and then were dropped because the rag-pickers were voters and consequently, under the protection of their ward politicians. Furthermore, the Italians have morally and materially helped Miss Jane Addams and Miss Helen Starr, the founders of that unique institution of Chicago, Hull House, and the above mentioned noble <span class="page-break">4</span>ladies can testify to this effect.</p>
   <p>The Italians have done many other things in this respect, and whenever called upon they never refused to work in sympathy with the community.</p>
   <p>Even at the present time it seems that a movement is on foot again for the suppression of the lamented nuisances, as Count Marazzi, acting counsul of H. M. the king of Italy, in Chicago, has been called upon by certain parties who have asked him to cooperate for the above mentioned purpose.</p>
   <p>Naturally the Consul has applied to his countrymen of Chicago, but we think that the latter are unable to do anything else, unless the laws and ordinances promoted by them, are applied and fully enforced.</p>
