   <p>An avalanche of pamphlets, printed in both English and Italian, has been distributed through the first ward. The pamphlets inform the "white wings" that their jobs are not imperiled if they vote for Miss Marion Drake, candidate for Alderman in that ward. They are Civil Service and therefore cannot be discharged for their political leanings. They may vote for any candidate without fear of losing their jobs.</p>
