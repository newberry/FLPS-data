   <p>Mr. Luigi A.Aiani is running for West Town Clerk candidate. As he is an Italian and is running for such an important office, the Italians of this city should all cast their votes for none but their conational Luigi A. Aiani. Luigi Aiani came to this country from Rome, Italy at the age of 10 years, in 1874. He holds offices in different societies. He is a representative of the Chicago Macaroni Manufacturing Company. He is a notary public, and a member of E. Bartoli Company, 127 Milwaukee Ave., reproducers of classical statues. He has much political influence, and if he will be elected it will be an honor to the Italians of this city.</p>
