   <p>A new society has been formed, under the name of Benefit Society for the Italian Women. The purpose of this society is to assure the widow and her children a certain measure of security upon the death of her husband. This is a mutual benefit society and is entirely supported by its members.</p>
   <p>His Excellency, Mayor Des Planches, the Italian Ambassador to the United States, on his last visit to Chicago, encouraged the Italian women of our colony to organize such an institution and to His Excellency goes much of the credit.</p>
   <p>We urge every Italian woman to join this society and assure herself of a safe future.</p>
