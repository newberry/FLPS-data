   <p>In the last months too much has been said and written regarding the political question of America.</p>
   <p>May a Catholic be president of the United States? This important question was treated in speeches and in writings by Catholics and Protestants. Many affirmed that even the candidacy to the presidency could be denied to a Catholic; that the states in the South, purely Protestant, would not even tolerate a Catholic candidate; that in accordance with history no Catholic was ever elected to the office. Others predicted that to deny the candidacy to a Catholic would result in the organization of a new party (Catholic) in the United States.</p>
   
   <p>But everyone of these predictions was fallacious. The Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of full liberty of conscience and does not deny to anyone the right of being elected to the presidency because of his religious belief. In the past as well as the present, Catholic senators and representatives have been elected to Congress.</p>
   <p>They could not be deprived of their political office because of a question of faith. The Catholics in America, until twenty years ago, were a small minority. With immigration their number increased. Today, one-sixth of the present population of America is Catholic.</p>
   
   <p>As a group, it is still in the minority. The Republican Convention nominated a Protestant as presidential candidate. The Democratic Convention of Houston, nominated a Catholic. This does not surprise us.</p>
   <p>The citizens of America, in politics, act according to their political affiliation and not their religious leanings.</p>
   <p>The Democrat votes for the Democratic candidate, the Republican for the Republican candidate. It is probable that some, because of religious scruples on election day, next fall, will change party for that one day. But the number of those will not be enough to alter election results.</p>
   
   <p>The Catholic minority in America has all the political rights and privileges. We can not say the same for the minority groups in other countries.</p>
   <p>Under modern political conditions, it is indispensable, that the minority have the same rights and legal privileges as the majority. This is an essential condition for a real democracy.</p>
