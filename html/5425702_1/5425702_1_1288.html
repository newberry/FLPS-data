   <p>This club has been revived on a solid foundation. Although the meeting held at Hull House was not heavily attended, the enthusiasm of those present made up for lack of numbers.</p>
   <p>A committee composed of A. Grandinetti, M. Granata, and B. Ronchetta was nominated to draft a constitution. It was decided to hold meetings at Hull House until a suitable hall can be found.</p>
   <p>Our next meeting to be held on Sunday, June 1, will be held in Smith's Hall on the third floor of Hull House.</p>
   <p>At this coming session an administrative committee will be chosen. Other business to be discussed will be the new constitution and the matter of propaganda.</p>
