   <p>Our friend, the sculptor, Luca Vescia of Chicago, challenges any sculptor to work on a piece of marble for seven days, 11 hours a day, the finished work to be placed on exhibition at the fair and to be judged by a committee chosen for that purpose.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vescia has posted $200 to back his challenge.</p>
