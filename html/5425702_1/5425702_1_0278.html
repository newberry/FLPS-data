   <p>The Barbers' Union, whose headquarters are at 166 W. Washington Street, held a meeting in the Ashland Boulevard Auditorium on April 28.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers were the general organizer of the union and his secretary who promised to obtain the unconditional support of the Internationale.</p>
   <p>The meeting was prolonged until 6 A. M. A resolution was passed to launch a strike on the 1st of May,to support demands for a weekly wage increase of $1.00 amounting to $18.00 per week, plus half of any earning over $26.00 and a nine hour a day.</p>
   <p>This strike will not affect the Loop district, because at present, the union has little or nothing to offer to the barbers of that district.</p>
   
   <p>This strike will necessarily involve many hundreds of Italians.</p>
