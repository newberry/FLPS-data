   <p>Through the efforts of Prof. Gennaro Albachiara, teacher of Italian at Crane College and Loyola University, it has been possible to unite the Italian students of University of Chicago and the previously mentioned schools into an association.</p>
   <p>The aim of this organization is to facilitate the study of Italian culture by these Italo-American youths.</p>
   <p>Prof. Albachiara's method of teaching is penetrating and not pedantic, and the proof of that is the large number of students who attend his day and evening classes at Crane College, and his course in Italian at Loyola University's "downtown college".</p>
