   <p>Judge Louis Senese, Jr., lecturer and traveler, member of Lodge 9, Da Bormida, No. 9, Melrose Park, recently returned from another of his frequent visits to sunny Italy.</p>

   <p>The human side of the new Italy, a camera journey from New York to Naples and through Italy from the Alps to Sicily, rich in beautiful scenes and episodes, has been presented with great success in many churches, societies and clubs, and will be presented by Judge Senese in the form of an educational or entertaining lecture before any group desiring it.</p>
