   <p>John De Grazia, attorney, member of Lodge G, La Masa, No. 2, and one of the oldest members of our organization, continues to distinguish himself as a lecturer. December 15th he was guest of honor at a luncheon given by the Assistant Principal's Club of Chicago, at the YMCA Hotel. He spoke with much thoroughness on the followingsubject: "Crimes and Penalties - Our Modern Procedure - Its Defects and Remedies."</p>
   <p>The cultured attorney touched upon the contributions of Italy to the basic law codes and reforms through the years. He first mentioned the Justinian code and then passed on to the Napoleonic code, with here and there mentioning the maritime laws of Amalfi, the treaty of Beccaria, and the modern Mussolinian code.</p>
   <p>He bared the defects of the existing legal procedure of the United States, insisting on the necessity of bringing it forward to a more modern point of view. The lecture was enthusiastically applauded.</p>
