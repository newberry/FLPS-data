   <p>The Javelin, Crane College weekly newspaper, reports that at a meeting of the Italian Club, last week, the plan was discussed and approved for an "Italian Night", which will soon be organized and given, successively at the University of Chicago, Loyola University, and at Crane College, where Professor G. Albachiara, organizer of the club, is teaching Italian.</p>
   <p>The members of the Italian Club of the University of Chicago and Loyola, with the assistance of Lamis Dramatic Company, will present the short drama "A Game of Chess" ("Una Partita a Schacchi"), by Giacosa, which will be followed by music, singing, and dancing.</p>
   <p>The coming event has aroused much interest among the Italians because it's the first time that an Italian drama, played by Italo-American students will be presented in a public school like Crane College.</p>

   <p>In publishing this article, it is our intention to urge and encourage Italian-American youth to take advantage of this opportunity and frequent the school with more interest.</p>
