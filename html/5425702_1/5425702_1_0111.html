   <p>The Italo-American National Union since its organization has had the noble aim of working not only for the betterment of its members but also for the recognition of the Italian in America.</p>
   <p>At every opportunity the organization has manifested its ideals of fraternity and patriotism. Knowing that the Italian government has requested, insistently, that the Italian language should be taught in the parish schools of America, our strong organization, always first in accomplishing its duties, has given its cooperation in the accomplishment of this request.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, through the efforts of the Royal Consul General, Dr. Mario Carosi, assisted by the director of the Italian study, Prof. P. Pomante, the study of the Italian language was established in every parish school. Now, with the new year, under the auspices of the Italo-American National Union, which furnishes the necessary funds, the study of Italian was established regularly, also, at the school of the St. Anthony Church in the community of Kensington. Miss Lena Panozzo was appointed as teacher.</p>
