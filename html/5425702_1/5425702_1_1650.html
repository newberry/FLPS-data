   <p>Mr. Pasquale Bloise, who lived on Taylor street, recently enrolled a thousand men (Italians) for shipment into the country, exacted a fee of $8 from each of them, and then went into hiding.</p>
   <p>One of these hapless men who had been unemployed for five months, even sold his hat in order to pay Bloise his $8 fee.</p>
   <p>Is so gross a fraud possible?</p>
   <p>Cannot mankind rid itself of these vampires,-employment agents, bankers, and priests?</p>
