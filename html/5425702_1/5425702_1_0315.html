   <p>In Chicago, there is a small strike of Italian bakers who belong to a union.</p>
   <p>These bakers work from twelve to eighteen hours a day and receive wages, which are not sufficient even to pay for their meals.</p>
   <p>They work at night, in filthy places, in a suffocating temperature.</p>
   <p>These strikers demand a ten-hour day, a small increase in wages, and one day of rest every week.</p>
   <p>The bread made in union shops bears a union stamp on every roll or loaf.</p>
   <p>In order to improve their condition, all working-men's wives should avoid buying scab-made bread, and no member of a working-man's family should eat scab-made bread served in restaurants.</p>

   <p>All Workers should warn the managers of boarding-houses, of restaurants, and of saloons which they frequent that they will cease to patronize these places unless union-made bread is served.</p>
