   <p>The front page of this issue is filled with articles supporting the Republican candidacy and condemning that of the Democrats. Samuel Allerton, Republican candidate, possesses all the beautiful virtues known to man. Incidentally he is a friend of the Italian voter.</p>
   <p>Carter Harrison, the Democratic candidate is governed by all the vices known to man. He was indirectly responsible for the Haymarket riot during one of his former terms and, very important, he does not like the Italian voter, has even promised to exclude Italians from municipal affairs, if elected, as he has in the past. And, for that reason is a black-guard and a hypocrite. He dares to make a play for the Italian vote with his lies. But ah! the Italian voter will not be bamboozled. He will vote for his only friend, Samuel Allerton. [Incidentally, Harrison won by an over-whelming majority and the Italian vote helped.]</p>
