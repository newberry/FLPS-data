   <p>This festival took place in the principal streets throughout the city. Count Manassiro, the Italian Consul, and his secretary, Mr. Vanni, arrived and were greeted by Victor Ziggro, Italian Commissioner of the Exposition. People from all over the world are here to represent their respective countries.</p>
   <p>Children from the public schools, dressed in red, white and blue, are seated so as to form the American flag. Ever so often these children sing a National Hymn. The police do their best to keep the crowd of people in order, and to see that the great parade is in order also. The Italian Marshall, head of the Italian Division, leads the Italian Societies of Chicago. One of the most charming bands in this parade was the Pullman band which preceded the Society of Christopher Columbus.</p>
   <p>A large number of cars representing the various States of the Union formed an important part of the parade.</p>

   <p>A space was left between the cars and a description of the State was written on the car that represented the State. Then came students from the Industrial school of Carlisle Post, Indiana, all young Italians, dressed in light blue uniforms and carrying symbols of their trades. Behind this group came other Italian Societies. A little boy dressed in the American flag sat on horse-back and was followed by other bands and societies dressed in red, white and blue.</p>
   <p>Then came Switzerland and its Societies, and these were followed by a Polish Society with a band at the head and foot of the group. Military bands represented the different countries of Europe.</p>
