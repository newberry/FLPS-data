   <p>We regret that we are forced to admit the existence of a contrary attitude towards education on the part of Italian parents, especially those of the south of Italy, an attitude that is a hold-over from the old country where illiteracy is so pronounced, that in any discussion of that subject the Italian is the most outstanding that comes to mind - and to keep themselves on that level of ignorance, many southern Italian parents willingly use means that if brought to light could mean imprisonment.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the Board of Education is using more coercive means against parents who falsely swear their children to be older than they really are. We condemn the notaries public who allow themselves to become a party to such transactions and we will not accept any of that business.</p>
