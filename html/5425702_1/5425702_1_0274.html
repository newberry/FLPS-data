   <p>Yesterday the workers in the various Italian Macaroni factories decided, after the insistence of the owners, to return to work. But later after coming back on the job, they again agreed to strike.</p>
   <p>The strike organizers, it seems, have not succeeded in bringing the owners to terms.</p>
   <p>The workers are asking for a 44hour week. The Macaroni factories' owners have so far refused this demand.</p>
