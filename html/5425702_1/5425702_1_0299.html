   <p>The tailors in Cincinnati are striking. The strike has been in progress for ten weeks. The tailoring firm, Globe Tailoring Company, and Stow &amp; Schuefer Company, are sending their work to their Chicago shops. We advise our tailors to stay out of Cincinnati and to do what they can to discourage the tailors in this city from working for the Cincinnati firms whose tailors are on a strike.</p>
