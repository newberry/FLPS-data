   <p>The patriotic Legione G. Garibaldi will give a picnic tomorrow at Kuhn's Park, for the purpose of raising funds for a monument to be erected in Chicago to the hero of the two worlds. The Legione Garibaldi is doing its best to raise funds for the monument.</p>
   <p>The monument was designed by the renowned Italian Sculptor, L. Braconi. He depicts the general leaning on his sword, meditating on the destinies of his beloved native land. This monument costs over $3,000.</p>
   <p>At tomorrow's picnic it is planned to receive about $400 in profits. Donations were given by Mr. Antonio Equi, who obtained 5 barrels of beer from the Pabst Brewing Co. Mr. John Cella obtained 5 barrels from the Seipps Brewing Co., Mr. E. Lomar donated 20 large cases of pop, Mr. Carlo Ginocchio donated all the wine necessary for the day, and Mr. G.B. Chiappi donated a large quantity of cigars.</p>
   <p>The executive committee has already planned for the September 20th celebrations. Their plans are to have a banquet, followed by a dance. The monument will be placed in one of the principal parks of the city.</p>
