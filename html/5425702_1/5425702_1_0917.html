   <p>Apropos of this, Mr. Canini recalled that at one time a Ministerial Decree had been received by all chambers which gave to the Minister of Commerce, and so forth, the right to regulate the functions of the chambers in foreign countries and which peremptorily threatened to stop the yearly subsidy paid by the Italian Government to these chambers, if that right were refused.</p>
   <p>It was felt by some chambers that to submit to that Decree meant the placing of Italian chambers in foreign countries, and especially those in America, under the jurisdiction of the Italian Government as well as the government of this country in which they are located. The Italian Chamber of San Francisco refused to accede to those demands and thus renounced the annual subsidy.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Chamber in a memorandum to the Congress of Italian Chambers of Commerce in Foreign Countries held in Paris in 1919 attempted to demonstrate the difficulties that would be encounted by an organization which operated under a dual jurisdiction. The memorandum was to have been presented to the Congress by the Chicago Chamber's delegate, Mr. Pecci De Nictolis. He arrived too late for the session and it was therefore mailed to the various chambers and to the Minister of Commerce and so forth.</p>
   <p>Mr. Canini proposed certain modifications to the Statute, He suggested that a letter be written to Minister of Commerce and so forth, outlining these changes, and also explaining the reason why all the changes desired in the Statute could not be made in the case of the Chicago Chamber.</p>
