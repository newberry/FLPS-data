   <p>The Italians were made the recipients of very insulting terms by Judge Baldwin at a public Democratic rally in the Standard Theater, Milwaukee. He had the vulgar impudence to use the terms lousy and unwanted when speaking of the Italian voter. This rascally shyster judge should know that the Italians are many times superior in culture, history and patriotism, to him and the rest of the Irish knaves.</p>
   <p>The Italians are not lousy as he terms them, but rather, hard workers who at the cost of their lives have helped to build the American railways and to dig the mineral wealth of America. It is only during elections for public office that these ill-bred knaves accept the Italian as an equal, so that he may vote for the rotten Irish, who when arrived in power, insult our co-nationals or vilely massacre them as in New Orleans on the 14th day of March, 1891. Italians, don't allow yourselves to be deceived, cast aside the Democratic lists, toss them into the gutter which is the proper place for them. They <span class="page-break">2</span>represent the most rascally and odious element that insults the Italian, the element that is mainly Irish.</p>
   <p>To our friends who in good faith are members of the Democratic Party, we say: Remember the 14th of March, 1891, and the cowardly and vile words of Judge Baldwin who called us lousy.</p>
