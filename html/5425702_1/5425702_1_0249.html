   <p>A public meeting to stimulate interest in establishing a trade-union among Italian tailors of Chicago was held on Saturday, September 10, in the Hull House auditorium.</p>
   <p>The meeting was promoted by the Garment Workers' Union, through its organizer, Mr. Andrea Marotta.</p>
   <p>Besides Mr. Marotta and our comrade Bertelli, several others spoke, emphasizing the fact that a tailors' union is necessary even if not profitable.</p>
   <p>All the speakers were applauded by a large gathering of Italian tailors.</p>
   <p>The Italian tailors of Chicago have always been the model of chronic disorganization, apathy, and smug indifference to the conditions imposed by their employers.</p>

   <p>Whenever the numerous Italian tailors of Chicago join their union en masse, not only will they contribute materially to the general uplift of the proletariat, but they will also improve their financial condition, which is now far from satisfactory.</p>
