   <p>Brother P. F. Lupo of Lodge G. Verdi, No. 11, of which V. Lupo, his father, is now the president, has undertaken the task of organizing a new lodge for the English speaking young men of Italian descent.</p>
   <p>All the work in the new lodge shall be carried on in the English language. Records show that there are but a small number of the Italian youth born or raised in this country, in our membership, the reason being that the work of our lodges has always been carried on in Italian, which they do not speak fluently. Therefore, we urge all members having sons or friends who wish to join this new lodge, to communicate with brother P. F. Lupo or send in their pledge for membership.</p>
   <p>Brother P. F. Lupo asked us to publish the above notice and we are cheerfully complying with his request, since we believe that the initiative taken by him is worthy of the highest degree of praise.</p>

   <p>It is indeed gratifying to know that there are young men in our midst, who, though they do not speak Italian, through no fault of their own, feel sufficiently interested in the affairs of the people of their blood to "take the bull by the horns" by setting up English speaking lodges.</p>
   <p>Other young men, sons of our members, should emulate this noble idea. Our society offers ample protection, social prestige, and opportunities to all. Our lodges are a school of social and business activities where any young man of ability may begin to make his mark.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that all the members will lend the best possible assistance to brother Lupo in the organization of this new lodge.</p>
