   <p>After lasting more than a month, the strike has collapsed, in spite of the efficiency and honesty of its committee.</p>
   <p>Every overt or covert attack by the factory owners had failed in the face of the slogan: "We shall return to work as soon as you recognize the Union."</p>
   <p>Five days ago, about one fourth of the strikers went back to their jobs. (They had previously voted for the return to work.) Later, most of the other strikers also returned to work. Only the committee, astounded by this unconditional surrender, stood by its guns.</p>
   <p>Thus, not only did the Union fail to achieve recognition, but the concession tentatively granted by the employers and listed on circulars mailed to each individual worker - failed to materialize.</p>
   <p>The only concessions actually gained were: (1) a nine - hour work day, and (2), a very small increase in wages for a few workers.</p>
   <p>No Allowance was made for overtime.</p>
   <p>It is deplorable that the strike failed, because, sooner or later, the owners would have been forced to capitulate, in order to fulfil contracts which contained a time clause.</p>
