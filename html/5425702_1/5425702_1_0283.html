   <p>After vainly trying various desperate schemes in order to break the fine solidarity of labor, the factory owners have resorted to a court injunction against the picketing of their factories. Truly it appears that judges in Chicago are the servants of capitalism.</p>
   <p>However, even if the factories could be filled with scabs, the quality of production would always remain doubtful. Not being able to hire scabs in Chicago, the owners are sending their agents to neighboring towns for this purpose.</p>
   <p>But we have a letter from Paolo Buti of Moline, Illinois, in which he relates how he turned down one of these agents.</p>
   <p>The counsel for the Union has filed an appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court against the injunction.</p>
   <p>Likewise, the American Federation of Labor has protested strenuously against it, claiming that it is a violation of the Constitution.</p>
