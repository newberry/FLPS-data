The one erected on the Exposition grounds was destroyed, and the other, in front of the city hall, is now located on a triangle at 92d St., Chicago and Exchange Ave., a remote location facing a railroad.</p>
   <p>"What motive does the City of Chicago give for not granting twenty-five feet of land for the erection of a monument to the man who discovered America?</p>
   <p>"Let's show the Americans that the Italians can and will erect a statue in honor of Columbus and place it in a public place to remain not only for the present, but the future.</p>
   <p>"Let's show the Americans that we can erect a statue of Columbus, with new and better material, pleasing to the public eye, and place it without removing any other statue.</p>
   <p>"For the erection of this new statue I will give $200.00; and for the Italians who wish to be respected in the future, and for the honor of our Italian colony here, contribute what you can towards the erection of a memorial to our patriot, Christopher Columbus."</p>
