   <p>After several years' absence from the political arena, former Judge Bernard Barasa is offering himself to the voters of Cook County as candidate for Judge of the Circuit Court, on the Republican ballot, election day, June 5.</p>
   <p>Italians in general and particularly our members are familiar with Barasa's good qualities so that it would be superfluous for us to mention them in this instance.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen of every party are advised to vote for Barasa. His election will strengthen the position of the Italian in county politics.</p>
