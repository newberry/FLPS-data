   <p>The Italian 19th-Ward Democratic Club, which met recently to elect new officers, has declared itself as favorable to John Power, Democratic Candidate for Alderman of the 19th Ward.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, held at DeKoven Hall, last Thursday night, Powers, in his talk before the Club, promised to remedy the bad conditions under which Italian Municipal Workers were forced to work with the present administration. He condemned the practice of grafting indulged in by the city bosses and promised, if elected, to rectify those conditions.</p>
   <p>Among the Italian speakers were Messrs. Seritella, Scaglione, Leonetti Marchese, Paulella, and others.</p>
   <p>This Club, because of the good character of its members, is bound to have a favorable influence on the American opinion of the Italians in this City.</p>
