   <p>P.1--After thirteen weeks of struggle the strike has been ended by an agreement on forty-eight working hours weekly and an increase in wages.</p>
   <p>Although the Union has not been recognized by the Manufacturers' Association, nevertheless a large measure of recognition has been accorded to the shop chairmen.</p>
   <p>When we realize that the manufacturer can no longer discriminate against an employee on the ground that he is a member of the Union, we have obtained implicitly the abolition of the black book,--which is of vital importance.</p>
   <p>Still more important, however, is the disappearance of unemployment. In fact, the total number of working hours made available by the reduced week can now be distributed to a great number of new applicants for jobs.</p>
   <p>Moreover, the forty-eight-hour victory in Chicago will serve as an example and find an echo in other manufacturing centers of the United States.</p>
