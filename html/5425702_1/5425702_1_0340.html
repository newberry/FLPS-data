   <p>The co-operative publishing house will be in operation in two weeks, if the comrades outside of Chicago give a little impetus to the drive for the collection of funds necessary for achieving our goal.</p>
   <p>The Italian Socialist Branches of Chicago, at their last reunion on Aug. 24, gave the order to proceed with the setting up of the print-shop as soon as the sum collected reaches seven hundred dollars. Many of those present at the meeting made noble attempts to raise the sum to that total by contributing generously.</p>
   <p>And now, comrades outside of Chicago; to arrive at the fixed sum of $700; $150 is needed. Can you collectively cover that small sum?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We are not asking for loans, but we ask you to buy shares, so that the required amount may be collected by Sept. 10th. Many have subscribed to one or more shares, but have not as yet paid for them. Now is the time for them to keep their promises, so that the Co-operative may be operating in two weeks.</p>
