   <p>DELTA PHI ALPHA. By S. Vitello. (Student.)</p>
   <p>Working laboriously and enthusiastically, in the latter part of May, 1929, a group of four students - Emilio Amelotti, John Nicolosi, Tom Sinicalshi, and John Granata - met and discussed the possibility of an organization to be composed of students of Italian descent at the University of Illinois in Urbana. The idea was discussed by the small assemblage with earnest and fervent enthusiasm. As a result of the proceedings a club, which was given the name "Silvio Pellico," in remembrance of the immortal martyr, statesman, and patriot, was organized. The termination of the school year temporarily delayed further activity at the University.</p>
   <p>However, the members of the organization were far from being dormant after leaving the campus for their respective homes, but on the contrary, undertook with the greatest enthusiasm the work where they had left it. They were all from the same city, Chicago. This advantage in being able to work collectively, rather than individually, insured the success of the organization for the following year and years to come. Prospective University students were pledged. Although the organization was a club, it was operated on a fraternity basis. The accomplishments of these individuals, during the summer vacation, was manifested by the innumerable successful activities which took place at the opening of school in the fall, September, 1929. At the beginning of the fall term the Pellico Club's functions were well under way. Meals were served, and all fraternal functions were carried out.</p>
   <p>It was during its infancy that the club secured the incessant, sincere, and profound cooperation of the prominent merchants and civic leaders of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A banquet was given in their honor and many prominent professional Italians were present. It was these men who inspired the members to carry on their task diligently.</p>
   <p>After carrying on as a club for a period of a year and a half, a petition to secure permission to function as a fraternity was filed with the council of the administration. It was always the objective of the club to be recognized as a fraternity.</p>
   
   <p>The petition was granted on January 2, 1931, and the charter members were: D. Salamone, W. J. Eovaldi, E. Maccono, G. Aimone, A. Santi, D. Vespa, and S. Vitello. The officers are: E. Maccono, president; W. J. Eovaldi, vice-president; S. Vitello, Secretary; A. Santi, treasurer; and G. Aimone, historian; all of whom will carry on with ardent enthusiasm the work of the organization next semester. The fraternity is local in charter, at present, but its members are making plans to become affiliated with a national organization. "Delta Phi Alpha" has successfully competed with long established fraternities on the campus, in scholastic, athletic, and social activities. Scholastically, it has attained the highest standing of all the ninety fraternities on the campus, for the last semester. A telegram that commended highly the fraternity for its high and scholastic attainment and stated at the same time that it hoped that such a record would be perpetuated, was received from the Supreme Council of the Italo-American National Union.</p>
   <p>Among the members and other students, participation in activities sponsored by the University is encouraged. Fair play is encouraged and the meaning of fraternity is taught.</p>
   
   <p>During its short existence "Delta Phi Alpha" has had the honor of having three prominent members who are highly esteemed and respected among their citizenry. They are: John Granata, attorney-at-law from Chicago, brother of Congressman Peter Granata; Emil Amelotti, professor of mathematics and physics at the University of Illinois and adviser to the fraternity; and D. Vespa, attorney-at-law, Toluca, who graduated with high honors.</p>
