   <p>One of our countrymen, Mr. Guiseppe Baiate, was named vice president of the Atlas Exchange Bank, one of the most reliable banks in Chicago, located on the corner of Halsted Street, and Blue Island Avenue. There is no need of recommending this bank of which our countryman is an officer. All of the Italians on the West Side who patronize it, know that it is a very reliable bank in good order, and that in its four years of existence it has developed to the point that is for today a promise of its future success.</p>
   <p>The operation of the bank is firmly controlled by the state authorities. It is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank and of the Clearing House Association.</p>
   <p>Mr. Baiate came to America five years ago and during that time he held the position of president for the Commonwealth Life Insurance Company, and president of the Roma Investment Company two of the strongest institutions in Chicago, which is an honor to Mr. Baiate and to the good Italian name. We are sure Mr. Baiate will be very successful in his new position. We congratulate him!</p>
