   <p>Comrade Angelo Galante, of the Italian section of the nineteenth ward, together with sixteen other Italians, left this city for the State of Indiana to work on the tracks of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis Railway.</p>
   <p>Their foreman was James Dye, and their board and lodging were supplied by the brothers Antonio and Michele Caruso, who owned the dormitory cars to which they were assigned and demanded of their fellow-Italians $1.10 for one night's lodging, as well as exhorbitant prices for food.</p>
   <p>Our comrades asked that their lodging be changed, but the Company refused. Then they announced that they preferred to quit the job and asked for return tickets to Chicago.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The roadmaster promised to supply the tickets, but on the following day he declared that he would not do so. The laborers protested, saying that it was not the way to deal with poor working men. However, having noticed the firmness of the Company's representatives, they retired to the cars for the night.</p>
   <p>But the protests of the laborers had irked the landlords and the railway agents, who spread the rumor that these Italians had threatened to fire the cars. A businessman of Williamsburg, Indiana (where these events took place), telephoned to the sheriff at Richmond, Indiana, who rushed to the place on a special train, accompanied by a fully-armed posse. In the meantime Bailey, the chief of police of Richmond, and the public prosecutor, Jessup, went to Williamsburg by automobile.</p>
   <p>In the dead of night this brave militia, armed to the teeth, courageously approached the cars, in which they found the laborers--asleep.</p>

   <p>When the landlord, Michele Caruso, arrived, all seventeen submitted to arrest and were pushed into a caboose and transported to the Richmond jail. At the end of the trip, which was cheered by the singing of Socialist hymns, Galante telegraphed to this newspaper, reporting what had happened and requesting as a member of the Socialist party of America assistance for himself and the rest.</p>
   <p>The director of this newspaper forwarded the telegram to Mr. Barnes, the national secretary of the Socialist party. The latter telegraphed to his American comrades in Richmond, suggesting that they communicate with the Italians under arrest and initiate an inquiry into the facts.</p>
   <p>These American comrades fulfilled their task by forwarding to the national secretary a detailed report.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the Socialists of Chicago sent to Galante a telegraphic message of encouragement, and Mr. Barnes asked his American comrades in Richmond to retain counsel for their defense.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>However, justice is expensive, particularly in America. Moreover, at this time of intense electoral strife, the Socialist party cannot have recourse to its regular funds in order to pay the cost of a trial. Therefore Secretary Barnes, with the approval of the executive committee, decided to launch an appeal to the Italian socialists enrolled in the Socialist party of America. The translation of this appeal follows: "To the Italian comrades of the Socialist party, greetings!</p>
   <p>"The facts concerning acts of violence committed upon some Italian laborers at Richmond, Indiana, have been reported to this national secretary, and an inquiry has ascertained that all accusations against these men are absolutely false.</p>
   <p>"Contrary to their labor contract and through the enormous prices demanded of them for food, merchandise, and lodging, these men were being despoiled and robbed by their landlords of a considerable part of their wages.</p>
   <p>"These laborers were arrested in their sleep and idly accused of meditating violence and incendiarism.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"In spite of their absolute innocence seventeen of them were arrested and are still in captivity, awaiting their trial.</p>
   <p>"Since they are not supplied with money, it is necessary that every comrade shall contribute to a defense fund for the purpose of obtaining speedy justice for the victims of this persecution, so that they may promptly regain their liberty.</p>
   <p>"Send your contributions directly to Arturo Caroti, 145 Blue Island avenue, Chicago. The newspapers La Parola dei Socialisti and La Propaganda will publish an account of the money received."</p>
   <p>"Yours fraternally,</p>
   <p>J. Mahlon Barnes,</p>
   <p>National Secretary."</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The Italian section of the nineteenth ward, of which Angelo Galante is a member, resolved to send subscription blanks to the Italian sections of the Socialist party and also to collect funds for the defense of these laborers at the open-air meetings held by comrade Caroti.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday evening at the meeting held on the corner of Sholto and Polk street, eighty two cents was collected.</p>
   <p>Editor's note: Just before this issue was sent to the press, we received a visit from the seventeen comrades, who had regained their freedom!</p>
