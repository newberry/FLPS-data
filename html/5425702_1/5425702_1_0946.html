   <p>Since it is a duty for the various sections and commissions to make an annual report in detail of its activities, I will only talk briefly of the accomplishment of this Chamber of Commerce in general during 1916.</p>
   <p>An important role was performed by the Imports and Exports Commission, which appealed to our Government for larger concessions on exports of products of which we are much in need.</p>
   <p>This Chamber of Commerce has supported all the worthwhile projects instituted by the Italian Chamber of Commerce of New York.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Agricultural Section, through the efforts of Mastro Valerio, secretary, has given free of charge all the information requested by our countrymen interested in agriculture and has accomplished much.</p>
   <p>It is my opinion that there is no better work for this Chamber of Commerce, than that of helping the Italians in this colonization movement and we urge them to leave the big cities and dedicate themselves to farming which is a source of wealth and health.</p>
   <p>The Commission on Commercial Information was accomplishing useful work, and this statement is confirmed by many letters received thanking this Chamber for the valuable information obtained.</p>

   <p>About our financial standing as was reported by the Financial Commission December 31, 1916, this Chamber had on hand about one thousand dollars in cash. The subscription made, as was resolved and approved last August, produced eight hundred dollars. As for the preceding years and during 1916, this Chamber received the regular government subsidy and 1,000 lire as extra subsidy given by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, through the efforts of the Italian Consul of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is my interest to state that besides the work accomplished by the sections and commissions, this Chamber has done her part with correspondence, with translations and information of every kind, and many other important matters concerning our attribution.</p>

   <p>I like to remember the activity of this Chamber in behalf of the Allied Bazaar, and I am proud to say that the contribution given by it and its members was will appreciated by the Bazaar Committee and by our Consul.</p>
   <p>It is my duty to thank the vice presidents, Formusa and Bragno and the treasurer, Mr. Rigali, for valuable cooperation given me during the first year of my presidency.</p>
