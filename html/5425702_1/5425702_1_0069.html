   <p>Il Corriere Italico in its issue of January 20 started a crusade to promote instruction in the Italian language in public and parochial schools.</p>
   <p>We believe that it is the duty of our fellow-Italian-Americans to foster in the hearts of their children love for our mother-country.</p>
   <p>In America, despite all the propaganda for Italianism and the past and present glories of Italy, Italian parents appear apathetic toward their mother-country, and what is worse, they sometimes deny their nationality.</p>
   <p>We must enlighten our youth on the necessity for the study of the Italian language for cultural and commercial reasons, a necessity to which those foreigners who are attending Italian schools in order to learn our language are wide awake.</p>
   <p>These foreigners devote themselves to commerce and take jobs which might be held by our compatriots.</p>
   <p>It is your duty, Italian parents, to show this need to your children and to compel <span class="page-break">\2</span>them to learn the Italian language. You will be happy when you know that every Italian adult or child can talk, read, and write the language of our forefathers, who made our mother-country a great and immortal nation.</p>
