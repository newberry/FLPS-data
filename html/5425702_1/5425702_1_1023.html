   <p>An Italian Bank will soon be established under the laws of the State of Illinois. It will be known as the State Bank of Italy. </p>
   <p>We were asked not to mention any details unless they were final, but now we are breaking that silence because the Chicago Trust and Savings Bank has publicly announced the establishing of such an institution. Today, Feb.3, the stockholders list will close. The bank will be established in the center of the West Side Italian quarter, with a capital of $200,000., and a surplus of $50,000. The sum has been covered with two thousand shares at $125 each of which fifteen hundred shares have been bought by Italians, and the other five hundred have been set aside for distribution among Americans, Jews, Greeks, etc. for the purpose of attracting outsiders.</p>
   <p>In this way, we will see a strong banking institution that will give a guarantee to its depositors, and will end all the abuses to which this colony has been subjected.</p>
