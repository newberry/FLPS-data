   <p>At its regular meeting on June 29 the Italian Socialist section of the nineteenth ward nominated a news committee for this newspaper. It also nominated a propaganda committee for the arrangement of lectures to be delivered on the streets or in halls.</p>
   <p>In consequence of the manhandling to which part of the audience subjected comrade Fraenkel at his last street meeting, an agreement was made with the English-language section that all members enrolled in the Italian and English Socialist sections of the nineteenth ward shall attend on masse every meeting held in the ward, whether the language used in English or Italian, in order to protect and defend the freedom of speech of Socialist orators.</p>
   <p>Since twelve new comrades have joined our section, it now has forty-five members.</p>
