   <p>This coming issue of the newspaper Il Lucano, edited by Mr. Antonio Ferrara, will be doubled and called L'Indipente. It will follow the same policy of The Lucano. Following the old proverb "Castigat ridendo mores," the newspaper will expose with gay and humorous form, the colonial vicissitudes.</p>
   <p>Lawyer Antonio Campagna will share journalistic honors with Mr. Ferrara. We wish our newspaper colleague a lot of luck and success.</p>
