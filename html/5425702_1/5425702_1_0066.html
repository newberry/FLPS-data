   <p>Mr. George Howland, Superintendent of the schools of Chicago, has told Mr. Mastrovalerio that all the Italian children living south of Clark St. between Taylor and 12th St., should enroll in the Jones School, on Harrison St. between 3rd Ave. and State St.,instead of enrolling in the Haven School on Wabash Ave., between 14th St. and 16th St. In doing so there is a way of avoiding accidents, from trains and vehicles. We hope this is clear to all Italians living in the District just mentioned.</p>
