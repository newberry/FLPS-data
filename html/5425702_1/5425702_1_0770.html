   <p>The Supreme Court of the United States has declared valid the constitutional amendment giving the vote to women. Had the same court declared the law "unconstitutional," the amendment desired by the majority of the people would have become null and void. This is "democracy" in America. Nine Judges can trample upon the sovereignty of the people, with the power of declaring any law invalid. We desire the Socialistic democracy. The true democracy.</p>
