   <p>Tomorrow, at 2 P.M., in the hall at 122 W. Lake Street, Professor Modestino Mastro, Albert and Ettore Gualano will give a benefit-concert to help our poor compatriot, A. Cianci. A conference will also be held on social betterment. The benefit committee consists of V. Di Pirro, S. Falone, F. Berardi, D. De Cristoforo, S. Muffeletto, A. Liberatore, and G. Quartullo.</p>
   <p>With ardour and earnestness, President V. Di Pirro is inviting the colony to attend. Tickets are $.25. We are sure that the colony will not fail to attend in response to this charity-call. I am sure you will all spend a splendid afternoon listening to the fine music.</p>
