   <p>My Dear Mr. F. D'Andrea:</p>
   <p>I am sure I am starting the new year right by thanking you and the Supreme Council of the Italo-American National Union for the patriotic and generous cooperation in behalf of our Italian school.</p>
   <p>Miss Lena Panozzo is certainly accepted as teacher of Italian in our school. I am sure she is the best choice you could make. She is more than capable and her virtues, knowledge, and her good understanding of the child-mind will make her invaluable in carrying on this great work.</p>
   <p>The Italian Consulate, the Italian people of the Kensington district, and I in particular, appreciate very much your offer and we shall all pray God for the continued success of the Italo-American National Union.</p>
   <p>Accept my best wishes and thanks.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Rev. Joseph Chiminello.</p>
