   <p>At the recent election the counting of ballots was so corrupt that W. A. Cunnea, Socialist candidate for the office of State's attorney, to whom many conceded the victory, appeared to have lost to Maclay Hoyne, Democratic candidate.</p>
   <p>The socialists were not caught napping, however, They began to raise funds in order to obtain recount of the ballots in four wards, with the understanding, that if errors were found which were detrimental to Cunnea, the recount would be extended over Cook county.</p>
   <p>The slow and laborious operation was begun under the supervision of Judge Baldwin with results so remarkable that they rendered certain the election of Cunnea and the removal of Hoyne, who at present illegally occupies the office of State's attorney.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The recount in the four wards added twelve hundred votes to Cunnea's total.</p>
   <p>A recount in six other ward has been ordered by Judge Baldwin, and it is certain that the result will cause the vote of the entire county to be retallied.</p>
