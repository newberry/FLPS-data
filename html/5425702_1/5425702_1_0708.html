   <p>Tuesday's election was a victory for the Democrats who were able to elect 2 of their candidates. Out of 68 Aldermen who were elected, one is Independent, thirty-two are Republicans and thirty-five are Democrats. It is the Republicans' fault, because if they had continued being well organized, the Democrats would never have had the opportunity to gain these offices.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to Mr. George B. Valentini for being elected as West Town Clerk. He received 23,364 votes while his opponent had 23,211 votes.</p>
