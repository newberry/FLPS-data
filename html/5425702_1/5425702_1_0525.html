   <p>In the Daily News of January 24th a priest comments on the killing of one of his comrades in Denver, Colorado, by an alleged anarchist while the victim was administering the sacrament of communion. We have never admitted the right to kill except in legitimate cases of self-defense. But the priest who writes in the Daily News, with the typical cowardice of the anointed, seizes the opportunity offered to him by a vindictive or demented individual to point out to the police as slayers or the hirers of slayers those (that is, Socialists) who have the courage to enlighten the victims of the clergy's self-interested prevarications. He calls us assassins, not because he fears further killings, but because he is afraid that the masses, who have ever been the dupes of craftiness and prevarication, may open their eyes and sweep away with one stroke all the rogues who delude and exploit them and trample on them, making their lives a Hell while they extort them to wait patiently for a Paradise beyond.</p>

   <p>This vile imposter asserts that the Circolo Giordano Bruno of Chicago den (as he calls it) of anticlericals and Socialists, by means of its antireligious propaganda armed the unfortunate killer of Denver. He says that other similar acts will happen, and he invites the police to intervene in defense of the corpulent reverends threatened by murderers!</p>
   <p>The accommodating American press welcomes the expectorations of this servant of God. Policemen are spying upon the actions of the Circolo Giordano Bruno, and sorrow perhaps is hovering over poor families. We, sworn enemies of all violence, shall continue to fight you (that is, the clergy) with only two weapons, against which you do not possess any shield or bulwark,-the truth and the alphabet!</p>
   <p>The Circolo Giordano Bruno of Chicago is accused of provoking violence by a minister of that religion which has filled the world with slaughter. We answer by stating the fact that the editors and the managers of the Parola, with their families belong to this defamed club and feel honored by the privilege of participating in all its functions.</p>
