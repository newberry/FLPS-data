   <p>On Sunday, October 18, our friend Libero Tancredi delivered as previously announced, his scientific lecture on "The Fatherland" before a good-sized audience in the kindergarten room of Hull House.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tancredi spoke for more than two hours without exhausting his subject. He promised to give the second part of his lecture in a few days.</p>
   <p>The speaker's ideas are that "The Fatherland" is not a natural or a real entity but something artificially created to protect the interests of the dominant class. Neither is this entity limited or homogeneous in itself, nor differentiated from the other surrounding entities or nations.</p>
   <p>In other words, nations cannot be distinguished sharply from any viewpoint, be it geographical, geological, linguistic, or even literary.</p>
   <p>The second lecture will bear the title of "War" and will treat of the political and economic factors in nations.</p>
