   <p>On Sunday, December 1st, a play was presented at Hull House, under the auspices of the Italian Socialist Section of the nineteenth ward.</p>
   <p>A rather small, but refined and intelligent audience was entertained with "The Foundling of Holy Mary," a play in three acts by P. Giacometti. The performance was so true-to-life that we noticed many ladies of the audience drying te`ars that came to their eyes during certain touching scenes...</p>
   <p>Scenes with social significance written by our comrade, S. Lami, and grouped under the title "For the Conquest of Bread," followed the play.</p>
