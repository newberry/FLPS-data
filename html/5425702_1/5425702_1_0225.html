   <p>Last Monday, August 15, in the Odgen Avenue Park, a picnic was given by the Irish people, among whom was Reverend Judge, who talked before a crowd of five hundred people. He said, "A few weeks ago an attempt was made to name a public school after G. Garibaldi, who is as odious man for the Irish people as is Cromwell."</p>
   <p>This proves once more what we have said about Reverend Dunne, who on some occasion has spoken on the same theme as Reverend Judge. The Irish people, and particularly some priests, have tried on several occasions to discriminate against Italian patriots.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education, which names public schools, voted the motion in favor of G. Garibaldi.</p>
