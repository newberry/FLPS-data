   <p>General Assembly, April 18, 1919.</p>
   <p>The Italian newspapers under the jurisdiction of our Chamber continue to publish the following notice free of charge. Those who wish to devote themselves to farming may apply to the agricultural section of the Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, Rooms 1912 -13, Masonic Temple. The requests for such information were only two to which this section has answered.</p>
   <p>On page 14 of our Bulletin of last March, the following was printed:</p>
   <p>TO YOU WHO WISH TO OWN FARM.</p>

   <p>The Agricultural section of this Chamber of Commerce, through its secretary, A. Mastrovalerio, appeals to ex-soldiers and sailors of the United States who wish to devote themselves to farming. It is the richest source in this country and ignored by the Italians, who prefer to live in the city abusing themselves in factories and mines.</p>
   <p>The American Government makes it easy for those who desire to buy a house or a farm and invites all who have returned from the army to fill out a form and send it to the following address:</p>
   <p>Department of Interior,</p>
   <p>Reclamation Service,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
