   <p>Under the determined leadership of State Director of Insurance, Earnest Palmer, a law to govern every form of insurance will shortly be presented to the Illinois Legislature.</p>
   <p>This new law, known as Senate Bill 231, and House Bill 543, has had two readings and is at present in the hands of the Committee on Insurance.</p>
   <p>The main objective of the proposed law is that of forcing the commercial companies and insurance associations to issue their policies on the basis of the "American Experience Table of Mortality," not later than Dec. 31, 1937.</p>
   <p>The "American Experience Table of Mortality" is the calculation table in use among leading insurance companies of America. It mathematically assures the payment of the nominal value of the policy, as well as the inalienable rights contained in the modern type policy, such as the cash surrender value, the termination of the annuity, and the automatic extension of the monthly payments.</p>
   <p>The proposed legislation forbids any more charters to be issued to mutual benefit societies, thus creating an indefensible situation for the small societies formed of members coming from the same small town in the old country, which, unable to conform to the requirements of the new law, will be invariably dissolved or liquidated by the action of the state, or because of their own limited financial resources.</p>
   <p>Consequently our countrymen will find themselves without any insurance and more than likely, too old or infirm to be insured with some other company or society.</p>
   
   <p>They will be faced with the realization that they are losing every cent paid in on their policy, because more often than not, these smaller societies have not a reserve fund or, if such a fund does exist, it is too small to repay entirely the money which members have paid in through the years.</p>
   <p>These societies have served a good purpose. They have done a good job of maintaining the beautiful characteristics of Italianism. But, as institutions of actual and efficacious security, they have outlived their usefulness.</p>
   <p>And yet if these societies had the acumen to merge into one group, they would have created, undoubtedly, a powerful group for mutual benefit, while at the same time maintaining their own identity, characteristics and independence.</p>
   
   <p>Where can they turn for support or relief in this predicament?</p>
   <p>The Italo-American National Union, among Italian mutual benefit societies in America, is unique in that it is most favorably placed to give its members the maximum guarantee. It is the only organization that maintains a fund of $100,000 with the state to guarantee payment on death benefits; it also carries every type of modern insurance.</p>
   <p>In the forty years of its existence, during which it paid out benefits amounting to $1,500,000, no one can say that the Italo-American National Union ever defaulted on its obligations.</p>
   <p>During its close to half century existence, the Italo-American National Union has been the lighthouse that stood for patriotism and protection.</p>
   <p>Considering the obstacles which are confronting the smaller societies, and knowing the sound financial condition of this organization, the Italo-American National Union extends a cordial and fraternal invitation to all societies which desire to affiliate themselves with it.</p>
   <p>It is the sacred duty of all Italians in America to be one in thought and action, so as to best achieve the position to which they are entitled because of members and ability. That goal can be reached only when the Italians have acquired a sound financial basis ....</p>
