   <p>Miss Jane Addams in an interview yesterday discredited intimations recently made that anarchists plotting to murder had found a convenient refuge at Hull House. She said the conflict between the clerical and anti-clerical factions was fast dying out and declared it unjust to revive it in connection with the assassination of the priest in Denver.</p>
   <p>"The Italian colony around Hull House is composed almost entirely of immigrants from southern Italy," said Miss Adams "They are strong admirers of Garibaldi and adherents of the king. The centenary both of Garibaldi and of Mazzini were enthusiastically celebrated at Hull House.</p>
   <p>"Two liberal clubs of young Italians organized at Hull House. The Mazzini club, which still meets there is composed of young Italians, who are devoted to the study of modern Italian literature and history. This club, although viewing modern Italy from the monarchist point of view, has maintained a noncontroversial attitude. The Giordano Bruno Club is a much more recent organization and held its meetings at Hull House until last September. The most successful public meeting of this club was held September 20, for the benefit of the eight Garibaldian veterans still surviving in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Club Not Anarchistic</p>
   <p>"Although the club is avowedly an anti-clerical organization, it removed its meeting from Hull House solely on the ground that it was a partisan political organization and should have a meeting room of its own. In this it merely followed the custom of Hull House in regard to partisan meetings. It was not at all because Hull House considered it an a anarchist organization!</p>
   <p>"Do not the anti-clericals sometimes carry their partisan sentiments almost to the point of violence?" was asked.</p>
   <p>"There seems to be an unfortunate confusion in Chicago as to the anti-clerical party of Italy", Miss Addams replied. The present party dates its activity from the beginning of the movement for political unification of Italy. It opposes the temporal power of the vatican and the domination of the clergy in political affairs. Its platform distinctly affirms the authority of the church in spiritual matters. Doubtless it has many foes of the church in its ranks, but also many devout Catholics and priests.</p>
   <p>Many of the leading citizens of the Italian colony in Chicago who are devout Catholics and yet belong to the anti-clerical party say that it is hard to be at once a good Catholic and a good patriot. They contrast their position with that of the Irish whose loyalty to home rule does not conflict with their loyalty to the church.</p>
   <p>Clash with the Clergy.</p>
   <p>"There were incidents in the Italian colony which were attended with much irritation between the clericals and the anti-clericals. The first of these was the proposition to name the old Polk Street School after Garibaldi. This proposition was received with enthusiasm by a large proportion of the Italian colony, but met with serious opposition by the clergy. The name was finally abandoned, but the controversy over it lasted for almost two years.</p>
   <p>"It was difficult for Americans to understand the bitterness of feeling shown by both sides. La Tribuna Italiana became the organ of the Italians wishing the school called Garibaldi and carried on the controversy with a zeal and invective of which the Southern Italian is past master. The other side was taken up with equal zeal in the pages of the New World. I myself and several other residents of Hull House had conversations with both Father Dunne and Signor Valerio, in which we deplored the bitterness of feeling which it would certainly take years to allay.</p>
   <p>"The perusal of both sets of articles left upon one's mind an impression of an hostility whose bitterness was based upon a struggle much older and sterner than the mere matter of the naming of a school, but neither of the journals contained even a veiled threat of personal injury to its opponent. Indeed the threat which has been quoted from the Tribuna Italiana as presumably the worst one was a quotation from Dante implying that the leader of the opposition must in the end "weep tears of repentance more bitter than the salt mines of Cervia." On the other hand the article in the New World most hotly resented by the Italians was one entitled "Garibaldian's Nose is Broken in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Garibaldi National Hero.</p>
   <p>"The Italians look on Garibaldi as the national hero. Almost every Italian town has his statue and a street named after him. The Italians in Chicago point to the fact that the Poles here are permitted to call a school after Kosciusko and the Hungarians one after Kossuth, and they cannot understand why they are not permitted to call one after Garibaldi.</p>
   <p>"The second instance which again stirred antagonism between the two parties occurred at the burial of Count Rozwadowski, the Italian consul, when the effort was made to bar the Italian flag from the church."</p>
   <p>In Italy itself, where the battle had been raging for more than 50 years, competent observers agree that the antagonism between the black or Vatican party and the white or anti-clerical party is fast dying out, and it seems deplorable that it should be continued in Chicago and most unjust to revive it in connection with the dastardly murder at Denver.</p>
   <p>"The patriotic Italian dreads and fears the small body of desperate anarchists in Italy quite as much as does the patriotic American here. He recognizes them as entirely distinct from the anti-clerical party and from that of the socialists, who again form a separate political party, with their own members in parliament. The Christian democrats constitute a large party of devout Catholic laymen and clergy, but which also, like the anti-clerical party, is opposed by the Vatican. The repudiation of this party was most strikingly shown by the placing of Fogazzaro's book "The Saint" seven years in study in Rome is doubtless aware of the distinctions between these parties.</p>
   <p>"To confound the anti-clerical party with the anarchists is almost as unjust as to so call the party in England which has long stood for the separation of church and state."</p>
