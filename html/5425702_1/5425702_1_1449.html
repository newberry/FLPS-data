   <p>The first three lectures given by Hon. Arturo Caroti on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings, turned out successfully - judging from the enthusiasm displayed by the [large audience] that attended them.</p>
   <p>To give a resume of those lectures would be very arduous, because the lecturer expressed many things, facts and ideas with a sincerity and beauty of form, that only the Hon. Deputy is capable of.</p>
   <p>More than 500 socialist workers and sympathizers attended the lectures, and next Saturday, Hon. Arturo Caroti will give another lecture at the Chicago Commons' Hall.</p>
