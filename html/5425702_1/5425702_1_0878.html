   <p>Our institution has resolved to participate in the activities of Foreign Trade Week, which will be celebrated in the United States from May 19 to May 25, under the auspices of the United States Chamber of Commerce.</p>
   <p>The aim of Foreign Trade Week is to give prominence during that period of time, to the various products exported or imported by America. This Chamber, naturally, intends to devote itself principally, to the propaganda in favor of such products and articles as are imported from Italy to Chicago. Therefore this Chamber extends an invitation to all retailers of Italian imported products to display those products in their stores or show windows during this period.</p>

   <p>Valuable prizes will be awarded to the contestants for the best and most complete displays. The Chamber will furnish all advertising material.</p>
   <p>It is very important propaganda in favor of the genuine Italian products, and a good advertisement for the retailers who enter this contest.</p>
   <p>This Chamber is made happy to have the opportunity of helping the forgotten retailers, who deserve more of our attention and care.</p>
