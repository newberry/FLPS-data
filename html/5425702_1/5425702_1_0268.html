   <p>The January 18th issue of L'Idea, Chicago Italian weekly, which happened to fall into my possession by chance, contains an article which states that all Italians should honor Joseph D'Andrea for organizing the tunnel workers' union.</p>
   <p>Before we proceed to discuss that suggestion, we should like to ask a few questions. Why are not the wishes of the workers respected in regard to the starting time? Why must they begin the day at the hour set by the bosses instead of at 8:00 a. m? Why are the union officials working against the welfare of the union members? Why are members afraid to speak at the meetings? We are in favor of unions and gladly support them when they are ministered by the workers and for the benefit of the workers.</p>
   <p>As far as we are concerned, we honor only those who deserve to be honored. L'Idea would do well to reflect on what it writes.</p>
