   <p>A new fortnightly publication in Italian has appeared in Chicago: The Grin. We like the subtle irony that transpires from all its articles. Alas! it will be understood very little by our prominent cultured(?) citizens, who are afflicted with chronic intellectual myopia.</p>
   <p>We also like its elegant typography. Introducing itself to the Italian consul Sabetta, the new periodical states sarcastically that it will not be monarchical or republican or socialistic or anarchical.</p>
   <p>Libero Tancredi is publisher and editor. The only thing about it that we dislike is its reform of grammatical rules, particularly in an envioronment which worships transatlantic traditions of style.</p>
   <p>Each number contains eight illustrated pages. There are no advertisements, at least at the present time. The periodical is published at 210 West Twenty-third Street The subscription rate is $2 a year.</p>
