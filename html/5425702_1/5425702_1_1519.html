   <p>Mr. J. Alberteli, who is in business at 649 W. Randolph St., will give $200. for the purpose of erecting a statue of Christopher Columbus in bronze.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alberteli, who found a statue of Columbus tossed in a corner of the attic of a public school, in order to make room for the McKinley statue, feels that the Italian colony has been highly insulted.</p>
   <p>The following letter was received and published:</p>
   <p>Mr. Durante:</p>
   <p>"The destruction of the Columbus statue, to make room for the McKinley statue, is an insult to our colony.</p>
   <p>"The Americans have taken away from the public eye the thing which gives the Italians most honor.</p>
   <p>"During the Columbus Exposition of 1892 three statues were erected in honor of Columbus and, through some reason or other, none of them stands now.</p>
