   <p>A committee has announced that an imposing mass-meeting to protest against the execution of Francisco Ferrer will be held on Sunday, October 31, in the spacious hall of the Hod-Carriers' Building, Harrison and Green Streets, at 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>The speakers will be Attorneys Stefano Malato and Alberto N. Gualano, Comrade Arthur M. Lewis, and the director of our weekly, Giuseppe Bertelli. All the societies of the city and the entire Italian colony are cordially invited to attend, that we may render the demonstration fittingly solemn. Another committee, formed on the North Side, is likewise inviting the Italian colony to convene on the same day, Oct. 31, at 8 P.M. in the Chicago Commons, Grand Avenue and Morgan Street. In this auditorium the drama "Sacrifice", an episode of the Russian Revolution, will be given by the New Idea Company.</p>
   <p>Speeches on Ferrer's own sacrifice will follow the performance. Tickets of admission are priced at 25 cents, and the proceeds will be devoted to the political prisoners of Spain.</p>
