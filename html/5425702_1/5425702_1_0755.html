   <p>We condemn the inhuman practice, indulged in by certain of our compatriots, of sending boys of 10 or 12 years of age, out on the streets to shine shoes. It has the tendency of creating delinquents, since these boys, in fear of the brutal beatings received when their earnings are below a certain amount will join with others in picking the pockets of pedestrians to assure themselves of the required sum.</p>
   <p>The usual procedure is to give the boy a box containing brush and polish. His master has probably any number of boys out on the main streets of the city at the same time. He is always a brutal, ignorant, uneducated beast who beats his boys without mercy whenever their earnings do not satisfy him. The boy's only renumeration is a scanty meal, a dirty cot and the rags on his back. The meal, he goes without, when he returns empty-handed.</p>
