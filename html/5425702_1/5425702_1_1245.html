   <p>Under construction and having the shape of a child's gigantic coaster wagon, an exhibit is being built at "A Century of Progress" and the Island of Marvels by the Radio Steel &amp; Manufacturing Company of Chicago, an Italian firm which is the most important in the United States for the construction of coaster wagons.</p>
   <p>The Coaster Wagon to be built will be 6 yards wide; 14 yards long, and 15 yards high. A mechanical boy, 42 feet tall will stand with bent knee in the wagon in the act of steering it. The interior of the tall figure will be empty and divided into appropriate compartments for young visitors. The space between the wheels will be enclosed with glass and occupied by a miniature factory with workers making small coaster wagons, to be given away to the visitors. The Radio Steel &amp; Manufacturing Company is headed by Antonio Pasin from Venice, and the workers are all Italian.</p>
