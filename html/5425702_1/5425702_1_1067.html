   <p>p.-1-.....Letters have been pouring into our office since the success of Josephine La Placa as Violetta in La Traviata, which was presented by the Beradinelli School of Opera on April 4, 1937, in the Amalgamated Auditorium. These letters request a repetition of this performance or the presentation of any other opera that Mr. Beradinelli may choose.</p>
   <p>Josephine La Placa seems to be a person of considerable stage experience, and she is to be congratulated on the cordiality with which her audience received her. She has a rich, expressive voice, a thorough knowledge of her art, and a distinguished manner.</p>
   <p>Mr. Beradinelli, is an excellent conductor and an ordent lover of opera music.</p>
   <p>The Italian Courier(I1 Corriere Italico) sincerely urges him to make arrangements for another performance later in the fall.</p>
