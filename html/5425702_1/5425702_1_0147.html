   <p>The well known Catholic newspaper in New York, L'Italiano in America in the issue of August 15, stated:</p>
   <p>"We will never tire of fighting against this humiliating religious display, this theatrical vulgarity on the streets, until this same display is conducted in a serious and decent manner, which will touch the heart."</p>
   <p>This ought to satisfy the show offs and the grafters, who organize these religious processions, it ought to satisfy even the priests of the Italian church "dell Addolorata" of Chicago located on the corner of Peoria and Grand Ave.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Gambera Cav. of the Corona d'Italia has convinced his parishioners of the vulgarity of these processions.</p>

   <p>May we also suggest to the other Italian ministers to do the same with their parishioners? Rev. Gambara, deserves for this act, to be nominated an honorary member of the Circolo Giordano Bruno, which has fought to suppress these processions.</p>
   <p>In church we can have splendid festivals with music furnished by the numerous Italian bands of Chicago.</p>
