   <p>The most characteristic event, during the period of the band contest, was the concert given by the "Chicago Women's Band," directed by our countrymen, Prof. Alfred Sponsilli, which played an interesting and varied musical program. The band is composed of 40 women and the Assistant Director is Miss Dolly Grey, 4109 Drexel Blvd.</p>
   <p>Prof. Sponsilli received much applause and congratulations from the Daily News. The band was not competing in the contest.</p>
