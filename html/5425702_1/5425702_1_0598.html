   <p>New Italian Democratic Clubs.</p>
   <p>The Italian is becoming daily more politically minded. Whether in his home or on the street, the subject most discussed is politics. It is a good omen.</p>
   <p>Lead on, Italians, be always in the lead, whether as Democrats or Republicans, and our best wishes to the newly formed Italian Democratic Clubs of the 1st and 19th wards.</p>
