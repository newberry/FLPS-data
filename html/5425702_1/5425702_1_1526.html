   <p>In spite of a pouring rain, hundreds of Italians and Americans attend the dedication ceremonies of the statue of Garibaldi, the Italian liberator.</p>
   <p>Innumerable Italian societies and bands were present at the dedication. The American lawyer, Mr. William S. Elliot, gave a speech in English, eulogizing the life and deeds of the great Italian patriot. He was followed by Dr. A. Lagorio and Mr. Louis Boarini, who spoke in Italian.</p>
