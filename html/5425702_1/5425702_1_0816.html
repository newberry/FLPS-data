   <p>p. 1. - On the evening of Sunday, June 6, 1937, a banquet was served in honor Attorney John De Grazia by the Justinian Society of Advocates to mark his completion of thirty years' practice before the bar.</p>
   <p>He is the founder of the Society and its honorary president.</p>
   <p>More than a thousand guests attended the banquet.</p>
   <p>The music was furnished by Mr. Gulino's orchestra, featuring Don Fosco.</p>
   <p>Between dances the guests were entertained with musical novelties by Miss Margaret Conrad, violinist, and by accordion music played by Mary Gulino, the charming and pretty artist who recently became Mr. Fosco's bride.</p>
   
   <p>And through it all, singing, dancing, handshaking, and the greetings of many old friends, the popular well-known attorney who was the guest of the evening smiled that broad smile of his which has endeared him to the hearts of all who have had the pleasure of coming in contact with him during many long years.</p>
   <p>At the speakers' table we noticed many distinguished personages.</p>
   <p>We regret that it is impossible to print the names of all the notable guests.</p>
