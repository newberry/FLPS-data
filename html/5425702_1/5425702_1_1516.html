   <p>The Garibaldi Legion which was active in erecting the monument to Garibaldi In Lincoln Park, has opened a subscription for funds to buy the house on Staten Island in which the great liberator was the guest of another Italian patriot, Antonio Mencci.</p>
   <p>Because of insufficient funds, the home was placed on the auction block and at the present time the sum of $6,000 is needed to redeem it. The Giornale Italiano has made itself the leader of this movement in New York, soliciting contributions from all Italian Colonies in America.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, the initiative has been taken by the Legione Garibaldi and it is hoped that the sacredness of the cause will find the Italians solidly behind it.</p>
