   <p>President E.R. Brainerd, and Secretary C. Wathier of the 1st-Ward Republican Club, ask all Italian members of the said Club to be present at tonight's mass-meeting, at 8 PM, on the North-East corner of Randolph and Dearborn Streets, concerning Tuesday's primary election.</p>
   <p>We should always remember that while this Club was under E.R. Brainerd and C. Wathier, The Italians of that Ward held, always, splendid jobs.</p>
   <p>In the Club's last primary, out of ten elected delegates for Town and Aldermanic Convention, four Italians were elected: Joe Blasi, Carmine Senese, Georgio Gatto, and James Ricci.</p>
   <p>At next Tuesday's election, Mr. Wathier promised to present an Italian name as delegate for State Convention.</p>
   
   <p>This is one of the greatest honors that this Club could give the Italians this time. This is also to show how much this Club is interested in the Italians.</p>
   <p>Next Tuesday's election will be from 1 PM to 7 PM, and our Italian citizens are urged to vote the ballot of the 1st-Ward Republican Club.</p>
