   <p>The Italian syndicatist section in Chicago has issued a circular exhorting the Italian miners of this state to stand solidly behind the striking miners of Ohio.</p>
   <p>The Italian section has been approached by agents of the mine operators who are trying to recruit men to replace striking miners in Ohio. The Italian section advises Italians not to listen to these promises since it would mean giving themselves the reputation of strike-breakers and betrayers of their fellow-workers.</p>
