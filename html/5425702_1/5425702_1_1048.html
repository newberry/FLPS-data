   <p>Italian Hotel in Chicago.</p>
   <p>On New Years Day the Italian Colony had occasion to take part in the grand opening of a new Italian hotel, the Hotel Latirio, located at 200 E. Van Buren St. The proprietors, Carlo Liberta and Geraldo Fincato, have had extensive experience in hotel and restaurant management. Their cooking is entirely in the Italian style. Good food at reasonable prices.</p>
