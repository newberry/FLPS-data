   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce has taken the initiative to again celebrate this year, Italian Imported Products Week, to be held from May 17th to May 23rd.</p>
   <p>This celebration deserves all our encouragement because it will make the Italian "Products Week" known and appreciated. Therefore, we beg all the members of our Order to give all their moral support to this highly patriotic movement.</p>
   <p>A display of Italian imported products will be made in the show-windows of all retail stores, which are divided into three categories: grocers for imported foods; restaurants for imported wines and liquors; department stores for workingmen's articles. Prizes will be awarded to the most complete and artistic display.</p>
   
   <p>The aims of this Chamber of Commerce are varied and deserving of all our consideration. They are to show to the public in general the variety and quality of the Italian imported products and stimulate their sale; to help the Italian industries and the local merchants, who are dealing in such products; to urge the retailers to keep a permanent display in the stores and thus to increase their sales.</p>
   <p>The Italian products cannot be compared with the products of other nationalities and there is no fear of competition because of their superior quality.</p>
