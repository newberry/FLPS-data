   <p>La Parola for the first of May will be an extraordinary number for the diffusion of Socialist propaganda; dedicated to the celebration of the workers' holiday throughout the world.</p>
   <p>A double issue (eight pages) in color, richly illustrated, filled with articles by leading Socialist writers and the message of American comrades, among them that of old Eugene Debs.</p>
   <p>Two thousand five hundred copies are being printed. In every Italian colony boasting even one Socialist soul or sympathizer, this number will be profusely distributed.</p>
   <p>To facilitate the distribution and place the comrades, even those not economically able to do so, in a position to acquire this issue, we have fixed the price at two cents a copy for propaganda bundles.</p>
   
   <p>Time is short: The special number of the First of May will be out on April 23. Don't delay to send in your request with the money. Address La Parola, 1044 Taylor St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
