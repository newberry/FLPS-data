   <p>The results of the elections held last Tuesday prove that the majority of the voters in Chicago are [controlled] by the bourgeois party politicians - who always find new issues with which to deceive and intoxicate the voters so that they can easily be dragged from one bourgeois party to another.</p>
   <p>In this election some of the issues were the religious question, and the Ku Klux Klan, which did much to influence the foreign element, especially the Jews, to vote for Mr. Dever, Democratic candidate. He won the election by a great margin. His party, one must remember, spent more than $500,000 [in the campaign].</p>
   <p>The Socialists are satisfied with the number of votes cast in favor of the Socialist Party. This Party, even though not as yet well-organized because of Party divisions and lack of financial support, drew 40,841 votes for its candidate, Mr. Cunnea.</p>

   <p>Considering the number of foreign Socialists who are not yet voting because they are not citizens, and the number of votes stolen from our candidate - as is the general practice in every election - we can sincerely affirm that our party has a strength of more than 75,000 votes. This gives us much encouragement for future struggles.</p>
