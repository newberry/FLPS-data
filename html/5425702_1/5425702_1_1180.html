   <p>Thursday evening, September 3, Paolo Cremonesi, comedian, will begin his theatrical season at the Alhambra Theatre.</p>
   <p>He will present in English the comedy-farce which he presented in many theatres of the East, and which we last year applauded in various theatres and vaudeville houses of Chicago - such as the Academy, Colonial, the McVickers.</p>
   <p>The comedy, written by Cremonesi himself, is full of very funny situations which stimulates hilarity from beginning to end.</p>
   <p>The title of the farce is "Curing the Tenor."</p>
   <p>Knowing that Mr. Cremonesi does not sing, we can understand the hilarious complications that arise.</p>

   <p>From Chicago, Mr. Cremonesi will extend his tour to the East, and then to the West as far as San Francisco and will return to Chicago next spring.</p>
   <p>To our genial artist, who with his plays in Italian has helped, financially, our newspaper La Parola, we extend our good wishes for a fortunate tour and a financial and artistic success.</p>
   <p>The Alhambra Threatre is situated on State Street, between Archer Avenue and 20th, Street.</p>
   <p>We beg our conrades to attend in large numbers the performances given by Mr. Cremonesi.</p>
