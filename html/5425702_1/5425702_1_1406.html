   <p>The School of Italian, English and Citizenship which opened in the gymnasium of St.John Presbyterian Church, Harrison St. and Hoyne Ave., is now functioning and boasts of an attendance of two hundred pupils of which 150 attend the evening classes.</p>
   <p>The classes are made up of men, women and children. The method of teaching follows the Italian style, except for those who are studying English where the same method is followed as that in the American public schools. The teaching staff boasts of a wide experience in each field.</p>
   <p>The attendance has reached such large proportions that at the present time there is a lack of seats for the many newcomers but that condition is being remedied.</p>
   <p>The School is sponsored by the St.John Presbyterian Church of which the pastor <span class="page-break">\2</span>is Rev. De Carlo. He has been elected General Director of every department. This will be another feather in his cap.</p>
   <p>The work of Pastor De Carlo has the assistance of his secretary, Mr. Bellavia and a number of willing youths who are with the teaching staff.</p>
