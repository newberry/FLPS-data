   <p>New offers for the support of Mr. Ettore Durante, Republican candidate for County Commissioner, keep arriving everyday, not only from our Italian colony, but also from some very prominent American politicians.</p>
   <p>Mr. Durante always remained faithful to the party to which he belonged, therefore his candidacy acquired more votes everyday, in fact, so many that his victory for the Primary Elections on September 11, appears to be certain.</p>
   <p>Mr. Durante possesses all the qualities necessary to administrate public matters competently and will earn greater consideration for our community.</p>
