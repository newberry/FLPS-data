   <p>When we announced that work on the erection of the "House of the People" would start on May first of this year, we were not aware of the difficulties to be encountered in finding a suitable site for the building. Only recently, the committee succeeded in completing the purchase of a lot which is located very near our printing shop.</p>
   <p>In order to build the "House of the People," which will become the property of the Socialists, it is absolutely necessary that our Federation have the money needed for the construction. Therefore, we beg everyone who pledged himself to purchase shares, to deposit, soon, the relative cash amount.</p>
   <p>Every comrade who believes in the betterment of our Party, the necessity of advancing in order to become stronger, the need for our political conquest of the world, and the emancipation of suffering humanity from the control of the few in order to assure it peace and equality, must understand that he is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>duty bound to buy shares - in proportion to his ability to pay for the construction of a home which will be the property of the workers. Nobody should hesitate; everyone must try to help his own ideal - which is to go [forward] towards the final triumph.</p>
