   <p>Bail of ten thousand dollars was set by the United States Commissioner Lewis F. Mason, in the case of Guiseppe Cenito, in whose home at 1001 South Racine Avenue, the police uncovered a black hand arsenal. Cenito's trial will be in a Federal Court, because he used the mails to send threatening letters to G. Galvani, who gave them to the authorities. Mr. Galvani resides at 906 South Morgan Street.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, the police did not stop in their investigation to get allthe evidence possible against Cenito. The federal authorities have questioned a certain Mary Macciagi, who lives in the same house as Cenito, and who sometime ago worked for Galvani. It is assumed that this woman's confession furnished the police with clues necessary to the arrest.</p>
