   <p>A new religious cult, the so-called "Celestial Cult," which has been in existence for the past three years on the West Side, and practiced by a number of Italians under the spiritual leadership of an ex-barber, Joseph M. Abbate, was discovered in the Maxwell Street Police Court.</p>
   <p>Mr. Abbate, in full regalia, followed by his "bishop," Lucian Monte, his attendant, also a "bishop," and by many "disciples," appeared in the court after the arrest of Mary Falzone, twenty-two years old, a member of the same "Celestial Cult," who was indicted for having contributed to the delinquency of her two brothers, by bringing them often to a church called New Jerusalem, situated on De Kalb street. "His Holiness," Joseph Abbate, entering the court, showed his indignation for having been brought to such a law court. He seated himself, while the "deaconess," Mrs. Elena Manno, humbly fanned him in oriental style.</p>
   <p>During the examination, "His Holiness" held in his arms a four year old child whom the "disciples," devoutly crossing themselves, called the "Virgin Mary," but the child, heedless of everything and everyone, fell asleep.</p>

   <p>The "Celestial Messiah," Joseph M. Abbate, told the judge of the many miracles performed by him. Years ago he saved his father from a gang of robbers, but for some time God had deprived him of such power and thus he dedicated himself to the barber's art. In 1906, while he was seated in his barber shop, he saw Jesus Christ come in, and standing in front of him, with tears in His eyes, asked him if he could talk Hebrew, and at his negative answer, Jesus started to talk in Latin. The District Attorney, MacGinley, paid a visit to the church of the "Celestial Messiah" and told the judge that "His Holiness," in his interview, stated modestly that he officially started his new cult in 1917, and during the past years, he had performed many and various miracles. He maintained also that the Spanish-flu had been sent to punish those Italians of Forquer street that were persecuting him. Because of his intercession, the plague stopped.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the "Celestial Messiah" was found not guilty by Judge Harem and was cleared of the charge of illicit practices. Mrs. Mary Falzone was also freed of her charge. The "Celestial Messiah" triumphantly departed with his "disciples."</p>
