   <p>As I have mentioned in previous letters, we, the poor people of the colony, not only received help and protection from the noble institution known as Hull House, but every day a group of women from this Center visited those Italians in greatest need in order to help them. They taught them how to properly care for their babies, how to keep a clean house, and in certain cases actually got down on their knees and scrubbed floors. All this was done without any fanfare and without asking for contributions from those whom they helped. And not one of the wealthier Italians of the colony offered financial aid to this deserving institution. Now, Mr. Consul, show me one Italian welfare association that has done these things in the past or is doing them now. Show me one pious lady or gentleman who has encouraged this institution of true charity and progress. No one has, except perhaps, Alessandro Mastro-Valerio, who in truth has been the one <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and only patriot to concern himself with our misfortunes, and has always tried, by his own efforts, to ameliorate the conditions of the Italian colonists. He has taken a leading part in the activities of Hull House, and with Miss Jane Addams has done everything in his power to improve living conditions in the colony.</p>
   <p>But all this did not find favor with the prominent people in the colony or with the pious ladies; nor did it interest the hundred or so societies, because they are too ignorant to understand. If it were some religious institution, like the one of the Consolato on via Monza in Milan, where that despicable Don Riva with the help of Sister Fumagalli raped seven little girls (the oldest nine years and the youngest three) and infected them with syphilis, for which crime Italian justice sentenced him to sixteen years in jail and the pious sister to nine months; if it were such an institution, you can rest assured it would have received the support of the colony's best element, consisting of doctors, lawyers and pious ladies who with their fables would have been of great help to the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>holy enterprise because, as you know, they would indirectly profit by it. For this reason they prefer darkness to our colony's enlightenment. They have made every attempt to block any improvement in our people's living conditions.</p>
   <p>What is the difference between Miss Jane Addams and the better element in our colony? I'll illustrate.</p>
   <p>That dear and cultured friend, Prof. Giuseppe Vecchione, called together a group of musicians and formed an orchestra, making himself the leader. From the moment of its founding this organization has had to combat the petty hatred of those in the colony who are the first to oppose cultural advancement. These persons have done their utmost to break up the orchestra.</p>
   <p>Do you know what Hull House did to encourage Vecchione? Not only did it allow him free use of its halls for practice, but, more than that, it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>bought and paid for much needed instruments that cost one hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>Therefore it would seem logical that the prominent people in the colony and the consul at that time should have been glad to tell the people to frequent that institution. But no! They saw, with pleasure, the Italians neglecting Hull House, and accepted with joy the coming of the priest, with whom they could make common cause. That is, all except Mastro-Valerio.</p>
