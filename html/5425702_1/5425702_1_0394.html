   <p>Early Monday morning we were visted by an admirable agent of the Federal Department of Justice. It was a very pleasant visit.</p>
   <p>The agent asked to see the director of La Parola, and from him he wanted to learn to which American [political] party the Italian Socialist Federation is affiliated.</p>
   <p>He insisted on seeing a copy of the anti-Fascist placard which our Federation published, and which was distributed in every Italian colony in America.</p>
   <p>Our director gladly furnished him with one.</p>
   <p>It is hard to determine the true reasons for the Department of Justice agent's visit to us. It was such an honorable visit in this very quiet manner.</p>
   <p>Maybe the Italian Embassy, under orders from Mussolini's Government, placed pressure on the American authorities in order to give us some trouble.</p>
   <p>We, conscious of the efficacy of our propaganda against Fascism, and of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sluggishness of the authorities of all bourgeois countries, follow our road without any fear.</p>
   <p>To that end, we would like to inform the public that we can furnish thousands of these anti-Fascist placards. We are ready to deliver them on request.</p>
