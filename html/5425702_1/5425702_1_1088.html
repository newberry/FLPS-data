   <p>Sunday afternoon, July 28, we celebrated Italian Day at Ravinia Park, with the presence of Dr. and Mrs. Castruccio, Dr. and Mrs. Ferme, Chevalier Dell'Agnol and many other prominent Italians.</p>
   <p>The program was dedicated to the playing of Italian music. The soloist was Virgilio Lazzari, who sang, "Giovinezza", thrillingly, and was recalled many times by the insistent applause of the audience.</p>
   <p>The attendance was inspiring to the Consul, who in a short address, thanked Mr. Eskstein for the great honor given to the Italians.</p>
   <p>The large operating contribution of the Italian people is well known, and the honor of an Italian Day at Ravinia Park is deserved and deeply appreciated.</p>
