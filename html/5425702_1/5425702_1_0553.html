   <p>The mania of some Italians for personal publicity has led to a feeling of diffidence towards certain Italian candidates in the coming election. In the 17th Senatorial District, for example, Joseph D'Andrea, Business Agent for the Mine and Tunnel Workers Union, declared himself a candidate for State Senator.</p>
   <p>Of this candidacy, which is looked upon unfavorably by D'Andrea's opponents, A Chicago paper has shown itself interested to the point of publishing certain incidents in his life which place him in a very bad light. It recalls to mind that in 1902 D'Andrea killed a lame boot-black, named, Antonio Mezza, for which he narrowly missed serving a term in Joliet by pleading self-defense. He then became involved in labor unions and succeeded in being named as a business agent. Now anyone who knows anything about unions is aware that an honest business agent's salary does not allow for luxuries. Nevertheless, D'Andrea is the owner of an expensive automobile. There are few Italians who can boast of a decent banana wagon. He dresses in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>height of fashion and seems to have an extensive wardrobe to choose from, and who knows, he may even be considering building a home on Lake Shore Drive, with a yacht anchored in the lake nearby.</p>
   <p>Facts of this sort, brought to light by a reputable newspaper like the Tribune, especially that which tells of the murder, certainly does not tend to draw support of D'Andrea. Italian voters cannot and must not support an individual of that sort if they do not want the reputation of giving their adherence to unworthy persons.</p>
   <p>Gone are the days, when for the sake of nationality, Italians attempted to cover up their countrymen's shortcomings. Better judgement has prevailed and Italians are now setting an example morally, for Americans, by repudiating those Italians who cannot point to a clean slate.</p>
