   <p>The interesting monthly review Vita Nuova, founded and directed for many years by Rev. P. R. Decarlo, has been transferred to Charles Bellavia, who has become, from now on, the owner and editor of the review.</p>
   <p>The first issue edited under the direction of the new owner has impressed us favorably.</p>
   <p>The Vita Nuova will be the official organ of the Italian Justinian Society of Advocates.</p>
   <p>To the new review and its editor, Charles Bellavia, we send our best wishes for new success.</p>
