   <p>Observations of an Italian Traveler in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Out of the thousands of Italians in this city, only a few have entered into its business life. Granelli, one of the leading grocers, deals exclusively in Italian products. He carries a complete line of imported Italian foods, in cans and in bulk. A place of business much frequented by religious Italians, is the religious goods store operated by John Caraccioli.</p>
   <p>The social and political life of the Colony is carried on by many societies and clubs. One, most recently formed, is the Italian Singing Society. The society with a martial flavor to it is the Societa dei Bersaglieri, whose members have served as Bersaglieri under the Italian flag.</p>
