   <p>For the benefit of its members in Italy, this Chamber of Commerce has compiled a complete list of commercial and industrial firms of Chicago who wish to enter the foreign market.</p>
   <p>This list, compiled after some difficulty, is in alphabetical order with the addresses and products of each firm.</p>
   <p>Our members in Italy desiring to represent any of these firms will receive a copy of this list on request. Non-members who wish to have the lists may obtain it by this Chamber, paying an annual tax of $6.00 as adhering members.</p>
   <p>The firms which compose the lists, are all well known and responsible. Some already exporting, while others have expressed a desire to sell in foreign markets.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to assume the representation of these firms may write directly to the secretary of this House.</p>
