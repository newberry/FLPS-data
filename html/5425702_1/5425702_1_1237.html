   <p>p.-2-.....Under the auspices of Lilibeo Lodge No. 1618 of the Order of the Sons of Italy, a great celebration was held before the statue of Garibaldi in Lincoln Park in commemoration of the landing of the thousand Red Shirts led by Garibaldi at Marsala, an event which started the campaign for the unification of Italy. Every lodge of the Order and many other societies of Chicago were well represented.</p>
   <p>After a long parade, the throng surrounded the statue of Garibaldi, on which a large floral wreath was placed by the president of the Lodge, Mr. T. Maragioglio. Attorney S. Monteleone, chairman of the celebration, introduced the grand officer of the Order, Supreme Venerable John Disilvestro, G. Spatuzza, Grand Venerable of the Illinois Grand Lodge, and other speakers, who delivered patriotic addresses.</p>
   <p>On the evening of the same day a dance was held in the Mayfair Casino of the Midwest Athletic Club. This affair also was sponsored by Lilibeo Lodge. All members of the Lodge with their families and many other Italians attended, and we are proud to say that the demonstration in honor of the Hero of Two Worlds was a great success.</p>
