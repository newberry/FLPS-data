   <p>To the Italian musicians of Chicago, Monday May 13, will be the inauguration of the Musicians Convention at the Morrison Hotel. This convention will assume great importances. In the past the predominant elements of the Federation of Musicians were German. They had racial prejudices, and because of this, the Italian, French, and English musicians who were in the minority, were compelled to suffer many injustices for slight infractions of the rules. Now that the war has created different conditions, the need is felt for union musicians. Those who were compelled to resign have asked to be reinstated and this will be approved without delay, in order to fill vacancies left by those who have gone to war. We urge the union musicians to be present at the convention.</p>
