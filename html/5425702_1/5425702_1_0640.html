   <p>The Mayor has appointed as trustee of the Public Library, Dr. Cav. Lagorio, thus honoring the Italians of Chicago. This distinguished countryman is Vice President of the Societa Nazionale Dante Alighieri.</p>
   <p>Dr. Lagorio, in this new office, is able to render many useful services to the Public Library, in the Italian branch. We promise to help him by reading all the Italian books in the library. The list of which is given on the second page of this newspaper. We encourage the Italians to read these books and urge the new generation to do the same so that the library will furnish us with many other Italian books.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to Dr. Cav. Lagorio on his appointment.</p>
