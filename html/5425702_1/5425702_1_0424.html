   <p>I was speaking yesterday with a prominent Italian of the Chicago colony, (one of the many who live merrily at the expense of poor boobs), on the possible advent of socialism. He retorted:</p>
   <p>"You may be able to socialize property and transform anything you wish, but you will never change human nature. Mankind is too selfish, and you will never be able to destroy this inborn quality."</p>
   <p>My answer was as follows: Man is certainly selfish, but when does this feeling appear in him? Certainly not when he has the privilege of exploiting objects merely for the asking.</p>
   <p>"Now, for instance, look at that expensive restaurant. Many customers, ladies and gentlemen, are enjoying exquisite dishes there. Through the windows of the restaurant, a poor devil and his ragged children are peering - and at the same time, yawning from hunger - for the father is one of the unemployed millions. Their craving for food and comfort is proportional to the satisfaction they observe in the guests.</p>

   <p>"On the other hand, the 'ladies' and 'gentlemen' who are passing by the restaurant and are supposedly well-fed, will never wear an expression of desire, even if they should glance at the windows. This is only natural for they possess the means of satisfying any appetite.</p>
   <p>"Now, suppose that our poor devil and his children should meet with the honest opportunity of allaying their hunger with a decent order of bread and meat. If another poor devil should then approach the former with the intention of snatching the meal for himself, you would see how doggedly it would be protected.</p>
   <p>"Instead, if everybody could satisfy his needs and interests according to the program of a Socialist regime, that cannibal egoism which is now turning men into wolves would disappear from the face of the earth."</p>
