   <p>The Italian colony of Chicago is fast advancing in the commercial and financial market affirming itself solidly among people of many nationalities. The new Schiavone State Bank is another proof of our activity and we are glad to see the energetic advancement of some of our countrymen in the financial life of this large city.</p>
   <p>The opening of the Schiavone State Bank, organized and headed by Italians among whom are Mr. Michael Schiavone, Anthony Schiavone, a lawyer, and Mr. Joseph Di Tolve, has given us much prestige, because this will show that among our immigrants there are men of high intelligence and education with the ability to compete with the best financiers of this country.</p>
   <p>The Schiavone State Bank besides transacting banking affairs, remittance of money to any part of the world, etc., has a real estate department and a legal office for the benefit and protection of our countrymen. The honesty, courtesy, and the promptness in transacting business with the Schiavone State Bank, is a guaranty of success and assurance that it will be in first place among the banks of Chicago.</p>
