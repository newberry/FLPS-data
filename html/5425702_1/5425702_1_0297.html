   <p>A strike of cigar-makers in the LaCurda factory, State and South Water streets, was declared two weeks ago.</p>
   <p>This strike was promoted by the two unions, the International and the Progressive, and it would have been successful if scabs had not interfered.</p>
   <p>It is painful to note that in Chicago, for the first time, Italians have stooped to the low business of scabbing.</p>
   <p>Two of these Italians are ousted members of the International Union.</p>
