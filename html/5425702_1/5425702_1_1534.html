   <p>A monument in honor of Guiseppe Garibaldi will be erected by the Italians of Chicago, as a token of their love and esteem for their native land and its great hero and liberator. A sum of $1,300 to finance the memorial was collected at a celebration last February.</p>
   <p>The Italians of the large and growing colony will pay homage to the memory of the hero of two worlds who with his own hand led the country to freedom. That tribute of gratitude and affection, together with the most profound veneration that every Italian should have in his heart for Guiseppe Garibaldi, has received the able assistance of the Italians of New York who are taking an even more active part in American politics than are the Italians of Chicago.</p>
