   <p>At the meeting of the Executive Council of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, held on July 10, it was resolved to protest against the removal of the three "Columbus Caravelle" (ships), and to send a copy of this protest to the Italian and American Press of Chicago and to the South Park Board Commission.</p>
   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce considers the presence of the "Columbus Caravelle" in Chicago a historical document for the city; an attraction for the visitors to Chicago, and an educational element for the younger generation and for the people. The Chamber will renew its protest against the removal of the "Caravelle" even temporarily from this city for private exploitation.</p>
