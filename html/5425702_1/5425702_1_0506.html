   <p>On Sunday, June 28, a good-sized crowd of Italian laborers gathered in the majestic hall of the German hod-carriers on Harrison street.</p>
   <p>There Giuseppe Corna, a miner of Spring Valley, and Arturo Caroti explained how necessary it was for them to join the I. W. W.</p>
   <p>Libero Tancredi, a typesetter, then spoke very becomingly in favor of the individualistic theory (anarchism) and was briefly refuted by the other two speakers.</p>
   <p>A collection was taken for the strikers in the Parma (Italy) territory, and several pamphlets of I. W. W. propaganda were sold.</p>
