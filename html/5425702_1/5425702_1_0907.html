   <p>"Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"In one of my previous reports I mentioned the improvement in the financial condition of Italy and now it is a pleasure to know that through a report introduced to the Congress of Rome by the Ministry of Finance, the Honorable Volpi, that Fascist Italy is surely advancing on the difficult road of economic reconstruction in defiance of the deceitful and false assertion of those who try toplace obstacles in the progress of our mother-country, Italy.</p>
   <p>"Through the wisdom of the present government, Italy has now a gold reserve, which will protect her from international speculation, as she does not need more loans from foreign countries. We frankly can say; 'Italy for Herself'.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"This Chamber, modestly, will follow her mission by collaborating in everything which will help in developing the commercial relations between Italy and the United States and, particularly, in increasing the imports from Italy.</p>
   <p>"We respond promptly to all requests for special information which are coming to us daily, and our secretary is also busy in taking care of ouroffice.</p>
   <p>"I call your attention, particularly, to the list of merchandise requested and offered on the market, which is regularly published in our Bulletin and spread by the Italian press, because that list can give the opportunity to some of you to establishsome advantageous commercial relations for yourself and for the Italian industry.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The publication of our Bulletin, which was stopped for along time, has been restored since last April and we hope that it will be continued monthly. However, it will be necessary, from time to time, to publish two months in one as is the case in the coming issue which will include the months of May and June.</p>
   <p>"The advertising of our Bulletin, to which we intend to give a large circulation, will be useful to everyone who has commercial interests among the Italian communities of the Middle West; besides it must be a source of profit to this Chamber. Therefore, I beg you, gentlemen, to use our advertising space inserting an "Ad" in our Bulletin, for your business is a profit to you and to our institution.</p>

   <p>"The Commission of Food Products, established by a resolution of the Executive Council on February 28, is in the process of organizing and soon will start to function.</p>
   <p>"At the same meeting the Executive Council resolved to dismiss from the list all members not in good standing, or the members who have not paid their dues for the years preceding 1928. But they can be reinstated by paying the dues in arrear. The complete list of the regular active members and for the associate members of our Chamber will be published in the next issue of our Bulletin.</p>
   <p>"For this period and until we receive the yearly Government subsidy from Italy, the Chamber will be in financial difficulties, and it is in need of funds for its very existence. Thus I urge the members, who are not in good standing, to pay to the secretary, soon, the dues of 1928.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"The difficulties are temporary and it is imperative to overcome them so that our institution may advance with more energy in her beneficial mission, which was established a quarter of a century ago.</p>
   <p>"This wonderful city of Chicago is preparing itself to astonish the world with a gigantic undertaking: The celebration in 1933 of her first centennial with a huge international Exposition. Many of you, recall the Columbian Exposition of 1893, which until now has been the largest and most beautiful of its kind.</p>
   <p>"Chicago, only, may surpass what Chicago has done, and we are sure that Exposition of 1933 will be much better than the previous one. The committee in charge of the future Exposition is working for the cooperation of the Italian community, as well as that of other various groups.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"I am confident that the Italians of Chicago will not fail to answer the appeal and that first, among them, will be the members of the Italian Chamber of Commerce."</p>
