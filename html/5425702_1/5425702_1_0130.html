   <p>Mrs. Fortunata Tomilla is asking for an annulment of her marriage to Antonie Tomilla, averring that it is not binding, since only a legal ceremony was performed. Mrs. Tomilla left her husband after they came out of Judge Murphy's courtroom, because he would not go through a religious ceremony according to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>We fail to see where it matters whether a religious ceremony is performed as long as they are married according to law. If Antonio Tomilla is an honest and dependable worker who will not fail to provide the necessities of life, we think that should be sufficient.</p>
