   <p>The initiative for a consumers co-operative is launched among the Italian people in America. The sponsor of this is Salvatore Pisano, a real estate agent with an office at 2540 South Wabash Avenue.</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Pisano, the co-operative will function exactly like the co-operatives in Italy. Mr. Pisano says people will be greatly benefited. Two societies have already given their support, as have also many private individuals.</p>
