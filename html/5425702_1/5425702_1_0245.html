   <p>Comrades:</p>
   <p>The die is cast. The Italian local is an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, at Smith Hall in Hull House, a small but determined group of young workers met, all moved by a single purpose to form a local among those who fought so valiantly in the last strike.</p>
   <p>One does not win all his battles. But that has not weakened nor destroyed our faith, which has encouraged us in our fight for emancipation. It is true that among us there are laggards, but it is also true that the majority of us have the courage to dare.</p>
   <p>To us then, young in faith if not in years, a vast field opens: let us conquer it.</p>
   
   <p>In Chicago our number is sufficiently revealing. It is for us to regiment and educate it. United and compact, moved by the same faith and thought, we can fight for our great cause beside our comrades, who like us, are being defrauded.</p>
   <p>At the meeting held last Sunday, those who attended formed a committee of propaganda. The next meeting will be held in the same hall next Saturday, Sept. 9th.</p>
