   <p>This is a fight to the finish in the paper industry. The situation makes one believe that the victory of the working-men is not far off.</p>
   <p>The boycott of the bourgeois dailies is becoming stricter, and the papers which are really suffering most are the Chicago American and the Chicago Examiner, owned by Hearst, the man who started the struggle.</p>
   <p>The World, which before June 1 wascalled the Socialist and is the only Chicago daily in English produced by union labor has increased its circulation from thirty to three hundred thousand copies per day, contrary to all expectations of the paper trust, which declared the lockout.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile the American Federation of Labor has issued a circular letter to all its registered unions, asking for financial contributions to help the locked-out printers, stereotypers, distributors, and newsboys.</p>
