   <p>President Foniatti of the Agricultural Commission and the Messrs. Pecci De Nictolis and E. Fiori, at the invitation of the Robert S. Larimer Co., Brownsville, Texas, made a tour of investigation with the idea of establishing an Italian Agricultural Colony.</p>
   <p>The same Commission at the last session of the Executive Council presented a report giving in detail facts, particulars, and the opportunities afford by that region.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to publish this report in its entirety, because it covers and discusses every angle of the situation at great length; but we note with pleasure that the conclusions reached are very promising.</p>

The Italian Consul, Dr. Castruccio, and many members of the Chamber were present to hear a reading of the report. Attorney Rosinia, who is well acquainted with that region, gave his views in a short talk. Other speakers talked in favor of the idea of Italian colonization.</p>
