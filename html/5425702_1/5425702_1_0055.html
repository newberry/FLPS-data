   <p>We willingly publish the following, promising that all our interest is in the support of our compatriots, and, through Mr. Capparelli's encouragement, to preserve with ardor and careful activity the duty that has shown itself in procuring the principles acquired from his distinguished honesty.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>November 22, 1899</p>
   <p>Mr. Ettore Durante</p>
   <p>I would be very grateful, indeed, if you would announce in your esteemed paper that evening classes have commenced at the Dore School, W. Harrison St. near S. Halsted St., and at the Garfield School, Johnson near 14th St., since Nov. 6, for all Italians who are interested to learn the English language.</p>

   <p>It would be impossible for me to reveal all the benefit they would receive through such an education.</p>
   <p>The superintendents of different schools complain that of all the children who do not attend school regularly, the majority are Italians. Knowing that the Italian Colony in Chicago, depends a great deal on their childrens education, for the future, I am sure the parents will realize how much it really means, if you used some of your available influence in your periodical.</p>
   <p>There are laws here that constrain and oppose truancy, but there are come individuals who do not agree with the means used to enforce these laws, although as a truant officer,	 I believe it best to resort to persuasive methods. I am sure you will publish this in your paper, and I do hope it will produce the required effect, or also I will be compelled to enforce the law with legal methods. I thank you and remain respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Francesco Capparelli</p>
   <p>Truant Officer</p>
   <p>Board of Education</p>
