   <p>Stephen Spagiari has sent a letter to the editor of the Trans-Atlantica stating that the news that he has formed an Italian dramatic company, is true, only in part (because he does not intent to absorb the productions that will be given by the Dante Alighiere Club to celebrate the constitution).</p>
   <p>He explained that the Dante Alighiere and the Italian Dramatic Theater, will have no divergence of aims, but will work together for the same purpose. The Italian Theater, he continued, is a branch of the Dante Alighiere Club, and its work is for the better diffusion of the Italian language and the Italian culture in the Italian colony of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>It will strive for the noble end for which the Dante Alighiere Club was founded by Countess E. Rozwadowsky. Furthermore, the Italian Theater will serve to make the American people understand the degree of perfection.</p>
