   <p>While thumbing through some newspaper clippings, I found an article which appeared in L' Italia di Chicago last autumn. It reads as follows: "The three sons of the late Emilio De Stefano, well known banker of the Italian colony, Attorney Rocco De Stefano and Louis and Edward De Stefano, continue to bring honor to the memory of their father by paying off the depositors who had intrusted their savings to his bank.</p>
   <p>"Thanksgiving Day was truly a day of thanksgiving for Salvatore Bruno of Hammond, Indiana, who received a check for $250 from Attorney Rocco De Stefano. He had despaired of ever seeing a cent of that money, and could not believe his eyes when a check was handed to him covering the entire amount.</p>
   <p>"Another depositor, who was paid in full is Gaspare Scurto, 171 North La Salle street. He came personally to the office of this newspaper to show us the check for $157 and to thank us for printing the news that the heirs of De Stefano were paying their creditors."</p>

   <p>We are moved to wonder why the heirs waited so long to honor the memory of their father. Why was not Gaspare Scurto paid when he requested payment at the time of the elder De Stefano's death? And what of the nineteen years' interest, which at three per cent adds up to quite a sum?</p>
   <p>And now a few words to the workers, especially to those unfamiliar with the English language. How many times must we warn you not to deposit money in these small private Italian banks which are likely to close their doors at any moment and leave you in squalid misery and tears of regret? That is what happened to the depositors of the De Stefano bank nineteen years ago. De Scurto, at the time, contemplated returning to Italy and could not go because the money was in the hands of the De Stefano heirs, who put him off from day to day with useless promises when he asked for his money.</p>
   <p>Do not allow yourselves to be caught in the same trap. Draw out your savings from these Italian banks, or like G. Scurto you will weep bitter tears.</p>
