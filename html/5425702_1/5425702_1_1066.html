   <p>The concerts assigned to Italian orchestras and bands at the Navy Pier continue to be appreciated and enjoyed by the public. We have heard so far the bands of Directors G. Sirignano, Quaglia, Serra, De Caprio, Forcellati, Alberti, Conti, Di Giorgio, and Pizzarello, and we are sure that concerts will be assigned to other directors such as Degrazia, Lombardi, Zuccarelli, De Rosa, Vonnisi, Tose, Falaguerra, Cucciardi, and Petrino.</p>
