   <p>p.1...The behavior and the morale of these workers, who have been on strike for the last two weeks, are admirable. Instead of being thinned by defections, the ranks of these strikers have been consistently filled, retaining even the few timid workers and those who had unwittingly betrayed themselves and their own comrades. For now they all understand how repellent a figure is that which scabs present.</p>
   <p>In order to show the brutality of the police, we here reprint the photograph taken by a reporter for a bourgeois newspaper. The strikers appear as tranquil spectators, while the police are aggressively venting their spleen upon unarmed men and women.</p>
   <p>The numbers of the wounded, not only among the strikers but also among peaceable but curious citizens, prove with what brutal violence the police acted. A gentleman who has lived in Russia declared that he had been present at charges made by the Cossacks upon the Russian populace, but that the Cossacks were never so ferocious as the police of Chicago.</p>

   <p>The mayor of Chicago by justifying the police and approving of their attitude has shown that he favors the capitalistic interests.</p>
   <p>The bourgeois press, which also favors capitalism, has proved false to its mission of civilization, ceasing to be an impartial and truthful chronicle, ready to join its protests to those of the people. The same press is deceiving the public by promulgating false statistics on the number of non-strikers. For instance, although in Lamm, Decker, and Cohn's factory, in Meyer's, in Kuppenheimer's, etc., there is not a single worker left, the bourgeois press states that only a small percentage of the employees has joined the strikers.</p>
   <p>About fifty thousand are on strike, and their mass-meetings are always crowded. The other day, at one place out of many where strikers meet, five thousand of them gathered at 4 a. m. and then scattered through the city to their picketing posts.</p>

   <p>The chief of police has demanded that citizens supply proof with their complaints of violence committed by police.</p>
   <p>The mayor has refused to interview a committee of strikers, who intended to request his kind offices as mediator.</p>
   <p>However, in a stormy session of the city council our comrades, aldermen Kennedy and Rodriguez, interrogated the mayor on the conduct of the police. The result was the nomination of a committee of five aldermen, who will investigate the charges.</p>
   <p>Signs of victory for the strikers have already appeared. About twenty small firms, the so-called independent manufacturers, (that is, not affiliated with the trust of clothiers) have made peace with their working-men.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>They have made a regular contract with the Garment-Workers' Union, granting them a week of forty-eight working hours, a ten-per-cent increase in all wages, national holidays with pay, recognition of the union, and arbitration in all controversies between managers and workingmen.</p>
   <p>The Miners' Union has already voiced its moral and material solidarity with the garment-workers, for instance, by moving to support the continuation of the strike.</p>
