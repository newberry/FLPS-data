   <p>The Election.</p>
   <p>We want to say one more word to the Italian voters before they cast their vote. Tuesday April 2, every citizen of this large metropolis will be called upon to vote for a new mayor for the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In this election for mayor, the Republican nominee is Fred A. Busse. To all Italian voters of this city we recommend the Republican ballot. Support Fred A. Busse, Republican candidate for mayor.</p>
   <p>The election of April 2 is of great importance to the people of the city of Chicago, because the man elected will be the head of the city administration for four long years. By casting your vote for Fred A. Busse, it will be four years of prosperity. If you cast your vote for other parties it will be four long years of anguish and misery.</p>
