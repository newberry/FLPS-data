   <p>In the 18th ward, following the results of the primary election, it seemed that Frank Gazzolo, candidate for Alderman, would not have an opponent, but he is now preparing to defend himself. This change in the situation occured with the announcement that Thomas O' Conner, 2210 W. Jackson Blvd. would run on the Independent ballot in that ward. It is believed however that O'Conner's entrance on the ballot, does not weaken Gazzolo's chances of victory, with the support of the powerful Hearst-Harrison faction.</p>
