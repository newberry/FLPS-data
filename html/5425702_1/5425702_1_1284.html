   <p>The World's Fair Club.</p>
   <p>The promotion of a center for the use of Italian visitors to the coming World's Fair, is the aim of the Italo-American World's Fair Club.</p>
   <p>The center will have dining rooms, reading rooms with Italian newspapers, smoking rooms for the men, and rest rooms for the women. Guides and interpreters will be furnished to those desiring them. All the programs will be posted daily.</p>
   <p>We cannot laud too highly the efforts of this group and we offer the pages of this newspaper as well as our time and money to help this marvelous cause.</p>
