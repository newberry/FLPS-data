   <p>Dr. Buehler, who was recently appointed personal military aide to Governor Emmerson, has sent the following communication to our Bollettino:</p>
   <p>My dear Mr. Alberti,</p>
   <p>It was very kind of you indeed to send your good wishes with reference to my appointment by the Governor to his staff.</p>
   <p>I want to take this opportunity to thank my fellow-Americans of Italian lineage in the columns of my friend Mr. Alberti's splendid publication, the Social Bulletin, for the support which they gave to Governor Louis L. Emmerson.</p>
   <p>Assuring you of my appreciation, I remain yours very truly,</p>
   <p>William E. Buehler.</p>
