   <p>The first outdoor meeting of the Italian Socialist section of the nineteenth ward was held on Sunday the 14th, at the corner of Halsted and De Koven streets.</p>
   <p>The speech given by a comrade in English was followed by speeches in Italian made by our comrades Bertelli and Caroti.</p>
   <p>The meeting lasted an hour and a half. More than a hundred listeners applauded the two Italian speakers.</p>
   <p>As usual a couple of anarchists were present, ready to introduce their anti-socialistic views. One of them asserted that Turati was hand-in-glove with the (Catholic) clergy; that Clemenceau, the French Premier, was the head of the French Socialist party; that the Socialist party was harmful to labor, and other similar inanities.</p>

   <p>Bertelli made an ironical reply to these statements and was cheered by the crowd.</p>
   <p>Eight citizens enrolled then and there in the above mentioned section.</p>
