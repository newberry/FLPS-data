   <p>The Progressive Union of Cigar-Makers is justly proud of its fine victory over the Congress Cigar Company,located at Racine and Van Buren streets.</p>
   <p>Not only was the Union able to prevent the threatened reduction in wages, but it has also obtained improvements in various departments of the company.</p>
   <p>This victory is highly significant in the eyes of the cigar-makers because it is known that the strike was instigated by the Cigar Manufacturers' Association.</p>
