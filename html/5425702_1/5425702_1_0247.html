   <p>Italian tailors are begged to attend the meetings at Hod Carriers' Hall, Harrison and Green streets on any evening in the week up to eight o'clock. Special speakers will explain the reason for the propaganda.</p>
   <p>The joint board makes a special appeal to Italian tailors, always ready for workers' demonstrations, to attend in large numbers and to bring their fellow-workers, so that the movement may increase daily until it surpasses all preceeding movementsin enthusiasm and loyalty.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of the agitation is to form a powerful combination of the scattered groups of tailors and thus to prepare them for future battles.</p>
   <p>Workers! Not words but deeds! You, the strength and the wealth of the world, must all be organized and create the solidarity of workers.</p>
   <p>Thousands of you are coming to us; follow them! To the strong, to the daring, the future belongs.</p>
   <p>The Tailors' Committee.</p>
