   <p>For the past six months I have been busy making a study of "Us", who call ourselves Italians. In that time I have been able to gather certain information which precisely defines "We, the Italians in America". This information was acquired from authoritative sources, and is sufficient to give a thorough but uncomplimentary picture of us and for that reason I am not going to show it entirely. But in order that the reader may follow me on this journey with the Italians in America, it is necessary that we consider the foregoing words a prelude to a stormy voyage.</p>
   <p>The first question that presented itself to my mind in studying this problem of the Italians in America was - why and wherefore Italians in America? Going back over the path made by the Italian immigrants, I found myself in southern Italy. The path leading out of northern Italy was made by such a small percentage of those emigrating, that I decided to concentrate on the south. Therefore, this discussion is based largely on those who were born under the beautiful southern sky of my mother country.</p>
   <p>The social, economic and geographic conditions of America were, in many cases, <span class="page-break">2</span>unknown to the majority of my Italian brothers. Therefore, I had to reject the idea that they had been desirous of going to an unknown land. I also discovered that those who had gone to America, had not gone for the purpose of assuming any social responsibility; they had merely emigrated their bodies and changed their place of employment, but their souls had remained in Italy. Following more closely the tracks of these immigrants, I found occasional traces that appeared American. With this suspicion in mind and with the desire of knowing the character of this America that had walked alongside so many Italians, I followed its direction and soon found myself in America.</p>
   <p>Still keeping in view the shadow of my suspect, I left the track of the Italian immigrant, knowing that I could easily pick it up again, and followed that which, undoubtedly, was made by the foot of an American.</p>
   <p>The foot-prints had finally led me to my destination. I found myself in front of a sumptuous palace. The richly liveried footman stopped me at the door. "My master, the mine-owner, is not at home", he replied in answer to my question. I asked him where I could find him. "Probably at the Millionaires' Club. But I doubt whether you can speak to him. Since his trip to Italy with the owners of <span class="page-break">3</span>the railroads and steamship lines, he has found such a close friendship with them, that he will have very little, if any, time to talk to you." Having gotten all the information for which I was searching, I decided to journey among the Italians in America.</p>
   <p>Since the time of readers is limited and since this periodical is circulated mostly in the Middle West, I shall ask the reader to please accompany me on a tour among the Italians of Chicago. On this tour you shall witness scenes that can be duplicated in New York and other large cosmopolitan centers of America.</p>
   <p>There are 200,000 Italians in Chicago, divided into four groups. Of that number, seventy-three per cent are laborers. That includes all those who, according to the laws of Illinois, are of working age. Twenty-two per cent are illiterates. Nine per cent are physically handicapped and seven per cent have criminal records. These figures, although not exact, are very close to the truth and the difference, if any, is very small. Going a bit further, we find that three organizations have issued statistics on the amount of money necessary to a family of more than five for a year. This sum, which covers every possible expenditure, is necessary <span class="page-break">4</span>to live, not comfortably, but decently. Of the three figures arrived at, that of the National Industrial Conference is the lowest with $1,697.95.</p>
   <p>The average pay of the laborer is $.50 per hour. With a twenty per cent loss of time for one reason or another throughout the year, the laborer earns about $1,050. Therefore, seventy-three per cent earn $500 less than the sum necessary for a decent livelihood. Consequently, the result is as follows:</p>
   <p>Obliged to live in houses too small for the number of persons in a family, the small house means -</p>
   <p>(1) Insufficient ventilation.</p>
   <p>(2) Difficulty in keeping it clean.</p>
   <p>(3) Danger of immorality.</p>
   <p>Obliged to eat food which, in many cases, is deficient in nutritive value especially for children, this fact is largely responsible for the fourteen per cent physically deficient individuals. (By physically deficient, we also mean those who fall below the scientific requirements for height and weight.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Obliged to abandon school as soon as the law allows them to seek employment, is another reason for their poverty. Summing up these facts, we are still faced with a solution of the problem. The problem is that because of a lack of education, the seventy-three per cent of laborers will be increased. Because of an insufficient amount of good food and ignorance of hygiene, physical deficiency will increase. Because of a lack of courage and the augmenting of poverty, (not a lack of courage to face hard work) there will be an increase in the seven per cent of criminal delinquents.</p>
   <p>Many have been called upon to give a solution to this enormous and dangerous problem. The Government of the United States has answered the call; but to date, without any success. The proprietors of the Trans-Atlantic lines, the railroads, and the mines, answered the call; but without enthusiasm for the solution of this problem. They, who answered with all their hearts and souls, and with open purses, were the Christians of America. But, unfortunately, even this did not bring about the desired results; because the majority of Italians are not Christian and if they believe otherwise, they believe falsely. Practically they do not show it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>My dear Italians, I must halt at this point, because to continue this journey would be fatiguing. I ask your kind indulgence if I have taken you to see landscapes that did not please you, and if in order to conduct you to the place which I had chosen, I was forced to lead you through by-ways that were dark and dirty. I rest with the hope that in some future journey, we shall find better paths and more beautiful landscapes. And, while I am on the subject, allow me to say one thing more.</p>
   <p>I would that you reflected yourselves in the mirror of modern civilization. You would undoubtedly see many traditions that are not now in use. You would see yourselves slaves of a religion that never has and never will make you Christians. You will see yourselves placed under the same conditions as your ancestors, who were abused in their ignorance. Do not try to follow something new with an old system. Do not try to be ashamed of yourselves. Do not allow the cry of Jeremiah to be heard again, after Jesus came to dry his tears; but instead, go in search of Jesus that he may dry your tears. Do not immerse yourselves in your traditions, which, for the most part, carry a taint of ridicule and ignorance. I have seen you many times in your processions carrying the saints and never in the ranks have I seen those on whom the good future of the nation depends entirely. I have <span class="page-break">7</span>seen politicians who hoped through religion to better their political standing, and I have seen merchants who, to me, resembled those whom Jesus drove out of the temple of Jerusalem.</p>
   <p>I have seen you in long files that resembled the files of prisoners I saw during the war, and I thought that you were actually prisoners of that liberty which America has given to those who have come to enjoy it. And I wept, because, like you, I am Italian, because as an immigrant I carry in my kit many of the troubles that are also yours. I wept because I have your best interests at heart.</p>
