   <p>The band contests held in the new Daily News Plaza continue without interruption.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Lincoln Mahony and the commission that will render the final decision are engaging various bands for the contest in order to select the best among them for a European tour.</p>
   <p>The Italian Maestri Sirignano, Forcellati, Cavallo, and Marcelli have already given their concerts with varied programs, showing their artistic ability to the public.</p>
   <p>But we feel obliged to state that in the subscription list for funds to finance the contest we saw only one Italian name, that of our well-known compatriot the Reverend P. R. De Carlo, editor of Vita Nuova.</p>
   <p>Why such lack of interest?</p>
   <p>Why do not our prominent Italians realize the importance of such a contest and contribute to its support?</p>
   
   <p>Where is that interest which our associations should feel in affairs of the Italian community?</p>
   <p>Why such apathy?</p>
   <p>Is it not your desire that the band selected shall be that of an Italian Maestro?</p>
   <p>Nevertheless we are very confident that the band selected will be that of Maestro Ulderico Marcelli, well-known director and linguist. Take notice, Italian leaders, and make your contributions, thus facilitating the selection of Maestro Marcelli.</p>
