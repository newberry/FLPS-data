   <p>We are very glad to be informed that the State auditor of public accounts on the 6 of last November granted a permit to organize the Banco di Napoli Trust Company of Chicago. Mr. Eduardo Maglione, a member of the old and glorious Banco di Napoli, was the promoter. This news will be very welcome to our colony. It is the realization of another useful project.</p>
   <p>The bank is capitalized at $450,000, of which $300,000 is credited to capital, $100,000 to surplus, and $50,000 to a reserve fund. The capital stock is divided into 3,000 shares with a par value of $100 each and sold for $150 each, thus providing the surplus and the reserve fund.</p>
   <p>We are informed that the shares have been bought by the most prominent Italians in Chicago. The Italian colony of this city will surely benefit greatly by this new bank, by means of which other profitable enterprises may be promoted to the advantage of Chicago Italians and the honor of the Italian name.</p>
