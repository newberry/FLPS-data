   <p>The Italo-American National Union has already deposited $1,000 to the fund for the proposed Casa Italiana. We also know that to increase this fund, the Italo-American National Union will organize a special performance of the opera, La Boheme, at the Chicago Civic Opera House, in which the well known Italian-American soprano, Vivian Della Chiesa, will make her debut in the role of "Mimi." This performance is assured of a great success.</p>
