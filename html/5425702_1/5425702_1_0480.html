   <p>The celebration of the First of May in Chicago will never be forgotten.</p>
   <p>At least 60,000 comrades paraded through the streets, displaying to the bourgeosie the strength of the proletarian army.</p>
   <p>All races and nationalities were represented: Americans, Germans, Slavs, Hungarians, Finns, Russians, Scandinavians, Jews, Negroes, Poles, Italians, French, Irish, and others.</p>
   <p>The parade was imposing for its size and for its thousands of red flags. The street-car service had to be suspended wherever the procession moved, for it marched in ranks of twelve abreast.</p>
   <p>The police was entirely absent, - naturally so, because 60,000 police - clubs do not exist in Chicago!</p>
