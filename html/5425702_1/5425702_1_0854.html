   <p>Mr. Onofrio Servitella, son of Louis Servitella, of the Italian Colony, on June 13th received his diploma, attesting to the fact that he had successfully completed the necessary studies and was entitled to practice law in any Court of the United States.</p>
   <p>Of all the lawyers in Chicago he is the only one who speaks Italian correctly, and we take pleasure in recommending him to the Italians of the Colony.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the young lawyer who, through his own hard work, arrived at his present position.</p>
