   <p>After wavering for several months the Chicago Public Library has decided to purchase Italian books to the amount of one thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>This collection will include the Italian Encyclopedia (24 volumes in folio); the latest edition of the Crusca Dictionary, of which eight volumes are already published; the original edition of the Divine Comedy; the Petrocchi Dictionary; many masterpieces of Italian literature; and the latest popular fiction.</p>
   <p>These books are now being catalogued and will be placed on the shelves for public use in two weeks or so. The library committee intends also to open branches in the principal Italian centers of Chicago, which will facilitate the distribution of books and the circulation of good Italian periodicals.</p>
