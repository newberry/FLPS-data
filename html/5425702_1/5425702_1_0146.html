   <p>A commission of respectable citizens who belong to seven churches of different religious denominations, have strongly complained to the Mayor of Chicago, Honorable Mr. Busse, against the religious buffoonery which is being made by racketeers every Sunday in the Italian quarters at 67th, 68th, and 69th streets at Page, Armitage and other streets. The Mayor promised personal investigation.</p>
   <p>The Tribuna Italiana, is cooperating with the Commission in its remonstrations to the Mayor, to whom we write confirming what the commission itself have exposed.</p>
