   <p>A number of Italian business-men attended the meeting of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, 1608 Masonic Temple, last Sunday. There was an exchange of ideas with the aim of establishing a sound banking institution, to centralize and promote the finances of the colony. This idea is, without any doubt, laudable, and will fill a gap that now exists. It will be a bank where people may deposit their money without fear.</p>
