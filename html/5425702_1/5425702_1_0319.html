   <p>"One third of the total number of strikers, that is, about fifteen thousand, have gone back to work for Hart, Schaffner, and Marx under the stipulations violently imposed by the Chicago Federation of Labor, not under the conditions demanded by the strikers themselves." This falsehood is published by the Chicago Daily Socialist.</p>
   <p>The strikers from other factories will submit their demands directly to the management and then decide at a general meeting on their course of action.</p>
   <p>We also know that the Italian garment-workers who reside in the Hull House district have not received any meal-tickets.</p>
   <p>Moreover, the lady who manages Hull House has refused to allow them the use of halls for their daily meetings simply because these Italian garment-workers have rejected the agreement proposed by the management.</p>

   <p>Likewise, workers of other nationalities; Poles, Bohemians and Lithuanians, have combined and elected a committee to direct the strike, denouncing the Chicago Federation of Labor, the Women's Trade-Union League, and the United Garment-Workers of America for their lack of sympathy for the strikers.</p>
   <p>These workers demand a closed shop, a fifty-hour week, a fifteen per cent increase in wages.</p>
