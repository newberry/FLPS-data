   <p>In the New World of last Saturday, a weekly newspaper edited by the Roman Catholic diocese of Chicago, we read as follows:</p>
   <p>"The anti-clerical Italian newspaper of this city that worked strenuously to have one of the city schools named "Garibaldi," was defeated. The Board of Education, last Wednesday, discarded the petition signed by thousands of Italians, and gave the name of an American to the school in question.</p>
   <p>"This is proper because Garibaldi, the patriot, was more interested in warfare than in education."</p>
