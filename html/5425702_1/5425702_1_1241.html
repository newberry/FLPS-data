   <p>The day set aside as Italian Day at A Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, July 15, will also be the first anniversary of the arrival in this city of the air squadron led by Air Marshal Italo Balboa. The order was officially announced by the Fair Administration, which is in accord with the Italian Consulate and the Italian-American Committee, presided over by Judge John Sbarbaro.</p>
   <p>On that day, the Roman column donated by His Excellency Benito Mussolini to the City of Chicago as a permanent record of the glorious and epic trans-Atlantic flight of the Italian air squadron will be dedicated.</p>

Among those participating in the ceremony will be the Governor of Illinois, the Mayor of Chicago, the Royal Counsellor to the Italian Embassy in Washington, representing the Italian Ambassador, and the highest civic and military authorities of the city as well as Bishop Sheil.</p>
