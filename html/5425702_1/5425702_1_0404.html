   <p>To the Comrades of the Italian Socialist Federation: It is with great pleasure, in reply to the courteous invitation of Comrade Valenti, secretary of your Federation, that I send this brief augural message of the First of May.</p>
   <p>The First of May is the International Holiday of the working class; it is the day, above all other days of the year, in which the workers unite in one mass and resolve to continue, with renewed energy, the struggle for emancipation.</p>
   <p>The days recently passed have been in fact gray days and a trial to the endurance of our movement, but our ideal has surpassed this trial of fire <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and in days to come we shall be united as we have never been to date, in order to construct together an organization more powerful than that which we have had in the past.</p>
   <p>Accept, dear Italian comrades, with the affectionate augurs of this day the wishes for prosperity and success.</p>
   <p>Yours for Socialism and freedom,</p>
   <p>Eugene V. Debs.</p>

   <p>To Italian Socialists: The comrades of the Italian Socialist Federation merit congratulations because of the fact that this First of May finds them still united in the ranks of the Socialist Party, fighting for the emancipation of the working class. The past years have been years of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>trial, but the future is full of promise.</p>
   <p>The Socialist Party has escaped the storm. It is indestructible because it has remained truly Socialist, truly faithful to the principles of International Socialism and to the cause of those workers who are celebrating the First of May.</p>
   <p>The splendid Italian Socialist Party and its victories should be an inspiration and a spur to the Italian comrades in the United States.</p>
   <p>It remains for you, Italian comrades, to be as sincere and faithful to the principles of our party, as your brothers in Italy are to those of their party.</p>
   <p>Your past performances assure us that you will be, in the future.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>With your co-operation the Socialist Party will go forward and every following May 1 will find us stronger until the day in which we shall celebrate the fall of capitalism and the emancipation of the working masses with the institution of socialism.</p>

   <p>Dear Comrade Valenti: Please accept my deepest congratulations for the work accomplished by your newspaper. Unfortunately, I'm not able to read it, being unfamiliar with your glorious language, but I know of the splendid work which you have accomplished and of the struggle which you are supporting for the workers.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>My most sincere wishes to you and to the Italian comrades who have remained faithful to their Socialist organization, and to all your readers.</p>
   <p>Fraternally yours,</p>

   <p>Dear Comrade: Kindly transmit to the comrades of your Federation, my congratulations for the success of your newspaper. We, here in Milwaukee, are convinced that the workers' movement cannot expect to be successful without its own formidable and active press; and despite the drudgery and difficulty <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>entailed in creating a press formidable enough to compete with the capitalistic press with the enormous capital invested in its enterprises, we must, nevertheless, realize that only with this painful effort that the workers can unite, especially in America where they are divided even in their work by the prejudices of race and religion.</p>
   <p>On this First of May, I renew the wishes of better future successes.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Daniel W. Hoan, Mayor.</p>
