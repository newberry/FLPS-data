   <p>The plan of founding an Italian Institute in this city by the Italians of the colony, has met with failure.</p>
   <p>Miss Jane Addams and Mary Wilmarth feel the need for such an institution to the Italians of that district. Miss Addams and Mrs. Wilmarth invited 50 well-known Italians to attend a meeting at the Auditorium, concerning the Institute and its work, and of these only 6 were present.</p>
   <p>Consul Rozwadowski asked all Italian Societies for their cooperation in building this institution.</p>
   <p>Out of 42 Italian Societies in the city, only seven responded. Even the pastor of the Italian church refused to cooperate.</p>
   <p>In the list of subscribers there are only 3 Italians listed. The Italians should be ashamed for the little cooperation they have given the Institute.</p>
   <p>Hull House is no longer an Italian Institution, but a neighborhood-house to help not only Italians but other nationalities as well.</p>
