   <p>A recital for the benefit of the Asilo Infantile Italiano (Italian Children Shelter) under the direction of the Provident sisters, was given at the Chicago Commons, Grand and Peoria Street, last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The Asilo is under the supervision of the Addolorato Church located on Grand Avenue of which Reverend G. Gambera is head priest.</p>
   <p>The Italian Cercolo Club for Dramatic education, composed of Italian women under the direction of Mrs. Dusolina Cecchetti, gave a wonderful performance in the drama "La Vocasjione" (The Vocation). Following that drama a farce "I1 Casino di Campagna" was given.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank Professor Graham Taylor, (head of the Chicago Commons) for the wonderful cooperation he has given in making this benefit performance a great success.</p>
