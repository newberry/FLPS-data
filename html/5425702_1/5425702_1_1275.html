   <p>Last Sunday, at Kensington and Prairie Avenues, was laid the cornerstone of the new Italian Church of St. Anthony of Padua. Bishop Muldoon of the diocese, accompanied by many distinguished prelates, and by flags and bands, took an active part in the ceremonies. Much applause greeted the appearance of the Italian flag donated by King Victor. The streets in line of march were very crowded.</p>
