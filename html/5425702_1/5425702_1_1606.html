   <p>The Visiting Nurse Association is making an appeal to the Italians of Chicago for financial aid. During the year 1911 the nurses of this association cared for 911 Italians, who were visited 4555 times, at a cost to the association of $2,227 at the rate of fifty cents per visit.</p>
   <p>A generous Italian woman has donated twenty-five dollars. There really would be something to be proud of, if all the 100,000 Italians of Chicago would follow her example, and help the association whose fifty-four nurses are scattered all over the city, attending nearly 2000 sick persons every year.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Board of Health has always considered the Visiting Nurse Association of great value. Ninety cents of every dollar serves for the benefit of the sick, and the remaining ten cents go for the administrative expense.</p>
   <p>We encourage our countrymen and the numerous Italian Societies, to contribute whatever they can to this institution.</p>
