   <p>A large group of our comrades attended the scientific lecture recently given by Dr. A. Molinari. The title of the lecture was, "The Life Beyond and Positivistic Science." Most of the comrades acquired useful scientific knowledge from the lecture; knowledge which will remove from their minds the fog of prejudices which camouflage these phenomena that masquerade under the names of "spiritualism," "black magic," and "miracles."</p>
   <p>Comrade Dr. A. Molinari effectively explained in detail to the audience, composed mainly of workers, that this branch of science, although at present based on inductions, may, if given consideration, find itself accepted as a positive science sooner than we expect.</p>
   <p>The public is showing a strong interest in these lectures, and it is beginning to overcome the reluctance with which it formerly accepted new ideas. It has <span class="page-break">2</span>begun to aid the intellectual efforts necessary for the assimilation of the real "truths" which only science can reveal.</p>
   <p>Encouraged and satisfied with the results of Sunday night, the promoters of this type of popular propaganda hope to be able to organize other lectures.</p>
   <p>The net receipts for last Sunday will benefit La Parola.</p>
