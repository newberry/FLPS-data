   <p>It is fortunate for the Italian Colony that no American reporters were present the other evening at Ulich's Hall when the Circolo Filodrammatico made its second appearance of the season, because I'm sure that the American newspapers would by now have carried an exaggerated account of the behavior of the audience.</p>
   <p>The Circolo Filodrammatico if it intends to carry on, will have to insist on a more decorous attitude from its audience. The boorish behavior of last night's audience was disgusting to this reporter and to the better class of the Italians present. The Hall was filled to capacity. During the action on the stage, conversation was carried on in a loud tone; men stood in front of the stage, many with their hats on, obscuring the view for the spectators seated behind them. The Hall was filled with a fog of smoke so that I'm sure the performance suffered because of it as well as the inexperience of the actors.</p>
