   <p>Woodrow Wilson's book, A History of the American People, originally published in 1902, was found guilty in a meeting held in the Roma Pavilion restaurant on the third of this month of offending the Italians living in our southern States.</p>
   <p>At 11 A. M. a group of some hundred persons had gathered at the restaurant. About twenty of these were radicals, another twenty were musicians, and a dozen were lawyers, engineers, and reporters, all prepared to defend the good name of Italy from the platform.</p>
   <p>All the speakers denounced Wilson as a scoundrel, a liar, and an impudent rascal, adding many more similar epithets. The chairman went so far as to exclaim: "If Wilson were here, I do not know what might happen to him!"</p>
   <p>All the speakers tried to makethe crowd believe that the meeting did not have a political purpose, and that it only intended to avenge an insult to the fair name of Italy.</p>
   
   <p>However, when some one asked for the date at which the accused book had been published the chairman was obliged to admit the ten-year old date of 1902, and the audience realized with dismay the tardiness of the present protest.</p>
