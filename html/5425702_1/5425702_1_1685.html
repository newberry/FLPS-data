   <p>A large number of women will be posted next Monday, at various corners of our streets, to solicit from the public a spontaneous donation of money to be used for a big reception that will be given to the soldiers returning from France.</p>
   <p>For the success of this Tag Day, the Italian women must give all the necessary cooperation and it is very important for our people to show, once again, their bigness of heart and generosity.</p>
   <p>The head of this reception committee is Mrs. Frankental, and one of the most active members is Mrs. Emma Martini. Italian women desiring to take part in this Tag Day, can communicate until Monday morning, with Miss Maria Martini at 120 W. Adams Street.</p>
