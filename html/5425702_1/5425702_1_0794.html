   <p>The Italian Land and Home Development Association of Chicago (a common law investment) which is composed of prominent Italians of Chicago, is undertaking to settle an Italian colony in the vicinity of Springfield, Illinois, and near Beneld, Hamilton, Gilespie, and Wilsonville, all located in the leading coal mining districts of Illinois. The new colony will be known as Roma, and will be a short five-minute walk from the Sawyerville station of the Springfield-St. Louis Electrified Railway.</p>
   <p>The Italian Land and Home Association acquired a fertile tract of land which was subdivided into two-acre plots. The price of a plot is not beyond the average Italian's ability to pay and the terms of payment are extended over a long period of time. Colonists are assured of employment in the coal mines.</p>
   <p>For further information apply to the Italian Land and Home Association, Edison Bldg., Chicago, Illinois.</p>
