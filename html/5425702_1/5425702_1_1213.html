   <p>The Javelin, the weekly newspaper of Crane College, reports that at the meeting of the Italian Club a plan was discussed and approved of for an "Italian Night" to be promptly rehearsed and presented successively at the University of Chicago, at Loyola University, and at Crane College, where Professor G. Albachiara, the organizer of the club, teaches Italian.</p>
   <p>The members of the Italian Clubs of Chicago and Loyola Universities, with the cooperation of Lami's dramatic company, will give the dramatic sketch by Giacosa, "Una Partita A Scacchi," (The Chess Match), which will be followed by music, songs, and dances.</p>
   <p>This event is considered of great importance by Italians because Crane College will be the first public school in this city to present an Italian play acted by Italian-American students.</p>
   <p>This will mark the first step toward the goal which Professor Albachiara is striving to attain - the diffusion of the Italian language among our Italian-American students.</p>
