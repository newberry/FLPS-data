   <p>A Union for the benefit of Italian tailors has been organized in this city. The chief purpose of this Union is to better working conditions morally and materially for its members.</p>
   <p>The present Administration of this Union is very poor, for the single reason of its not having enough members to enforce the present Administration, so we urge every Italian tailor to join this Union and give his co-operation.</p>
   <p>A meeting will be held every Sunday afternoon, 2:30 P.M., Hull House.</p>
