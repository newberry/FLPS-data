   <p>Last Easter Sunday was a gay day for the family of Salvatore Bisceglia, who live at 128 Steve Street, Chicago. On that morning, a telegram from Italy arrived at their home stating that Salvatore's daughter had made her debut with great success, in a theater in Sacile, province of Udine.</p>
   <p>The news was immediately communicated to Mr. Gastone Gottschalk, director of the Chicago Lyric School at Kimball Hall, who first taught Miss Bisceglia the art of singing. It was he, who advised her father to send her to the Reggio Conservatorio, of Milano, where she distinguished herself, coming back with a repertory of more than twelve operas.</p>

   <p>We believe in conveying the sentiments of all the Italians of Chicago by sending in their name, the sincerest congratulations to Miss Bisceglia with the warmest wishes for a greater success.</p>
