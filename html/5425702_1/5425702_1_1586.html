   <p>The Mutual Benefit Society 'Victor Emanuel the Third' of Chicago, recently proclaimed King Victor its honorary president. Last Wednesday, Consul Count Rozwadowski consigned a letter and a gift of $100 received from the king to Messrs. Francesco Benardi and Emanuel Venetacci, secretary and treasurer respectively of the society. The letter written by one of the Royal Household, expressed the king's gratitude at the choice and stipulated that the $100 be used to buy a flag for the society. One can imagine the joy and enthusiasm with which all was received.</p>
   <p>The flag is to be inaugurated in June of this year and the celebration will be especially solemn. It shall be perhaps an occasion where from laborious Chicago shall be freed a cry that will rebound from wall to wall in Rome and shall carry to our never forgotten fatherland and king the affection and devotion of Italians in foreign lands.</p>
