   <p>At this theatre, 379 South Halsted street, a series of Italian comedies and movies are being given, as well as ballads and songs,-all for one nickel.</p>
   <p>The clever impersonator Campanella and his fellow artists are the drawing card every evening. The public applauds particularly when (and it happens often) priests, bosses, and exploiters are attacked on the stage.</p>
