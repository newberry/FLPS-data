   <p>The Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Company recently devised a scheme to reduce the already meager wages of its employees.</p>
   <p>Tired of their long and unjust exploitation which made no distinction of sex or nationality, all the workers enrolled as members of the United Garment Workers of America and demanded of their employers the recognition of the union.</p>
   <p>These strikers number about twelve thousand, of whom three thousand are Italians, all united and determined to resist their employers' insolence.</p>
   <p>While the strike is in full swing, some Italian newspapers, which continually boast of their patriotism and of protecting their countrymen, and yet make no mention of this gigantic strike, are publishing want-ads for scabs needed by the Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Company.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Thus L'Italia, armed with its linotype, the same paper which took the side of the mine-operators in the latest strike in Illinois, in a single number published five want-ads for the Hart, Schaffner, and Marx Company.</p>
   <p>The same thing was done by the ridiculous Tribuna, that outlandish ungrammatical mess.</p>
   <p>Have not these newspapers any other means of earning their livelihood?</p>
