   <p>We are especially grateful to Mrs. Doetch, who acted as mistress of ceremonies.</p>
   <p>Before introducing the Italian consul-general for Chicago and the Grand Venerable of the order, she spoke a few words in favor of Italy and the Italians. The Italian consul, in a short talk thanked the De Paul University representatives for giving the Order Sons of Italy this opportunity, one for which it was very grateful. He said that he was happy to find himself again among members of that order, which in America is the strongest supporter of Italian ideals.</p>
   <p>Chevalier Spatuzza, in a few words, sketched the accomplishments of the order in the past and its hopes and aims for the future.</p>
   <p>In closing we cannot fail to mention Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who has showed <span class="page-break">\3</span>himself very favorable to Italy and was also intrumental in having Columbus Day declared a legal holiday.</p>
