   <p>In a hurried visit to Chicago, Gov. Woodrow Wilson, Democratic Candidate for President of the United States, welcomed a delegation of Italians headed by Stefano Malato, and Francis Borelli, prominent lawyers of our colony, and Mr Paolo Dasso. The delegation invited Gov. Wilson to attend a celebration given by the Italians in honor of Christopher Columbus, on October 12. Governor Wilson could not give them a definite reply, because he did not know whether he would be in Chicago until then, and thanked them for their kind invitation.</p>
