   <p>From the printing presses of the Blakely-Oswald Printing Company of Chicago, has come, in a 750 page volume, the Relazione Dantesca (Dante Report) by Luigi Carnovale, a report which this notable Italian writer and philanthropist has had published to be donated to the Italians of Chicago and the United States, so that they may know the ways and means by which he promoted and carried to a notable end the commemoration of the six hundred anniversary of Dante's birth.</p>
   <p>Carnovale does not limit the report to his labors alone, but to the work and contributions of others who assisted him. He spent $10,288.95 to promote the commemoration. Of this sum Italians in America donated $1,954.56 so that Carnovale paid out of his own $8,334.39.</p>

   <p>This great Italian, at his own expense, erected a monument and college on the site of the old Convent of St. John in Stilo, Department of Calabria, Italy. He also paid for a tablet which was placed on the wall of the University of West Virginia to the memory of the Italian poet, P. Bellini, who taught in this institution about one hundred years ago.</p>
   <p>Seventy reproductions of the Codice Trivulziano of the Divino Commedia and two hundred copies of the complete works of Dante were donated by Italian-Americans leading libraries and universities of America through his efforts.</p>
