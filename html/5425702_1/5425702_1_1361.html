   <p>We announce to our brothers that starting with the January issue, our bulletin will be published in Italian and English.</p>
   <p>The main reason for this resolution is to distribute our bulletin among the younger generation which cannot read the Italian language.</p>
   <p>Our association must be as useful to our children as it is to us.</p>
   <p>It is the younger element that we would like to have among us, and if necessary we will organize lodges for youngsters where only English will be spoken. It is a good policy to keep them near us and in contact with Italian customs and traditions.</p>
