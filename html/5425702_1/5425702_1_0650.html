   <p>The free concerts given every evening in Grant Park by the Chicago Park District under the personal supervision of James C. Petrillo, Park Commissioner and President of the Chicago Federation of Musicians, in keeping with the desire of Mayor Edward J. Kelly to "Keep Chicago Ahead," constitute one of the most creditable achievements of our city.</p>
   <p>The best music, gloriously played in an enchanting open-air setting at no cost to the citizenry of Chicago and vicinity, is really something of which we can all be justly and legitimately proud.</p>
   <p>James C. Petrillo, father of the idea and its most strenuous supporter, with Mayor Kelly and the Park Commissioners, has the inalienable right to feel very proud, and to be heartily congratulated for lending full assistance to this great civic achievement.</p>
