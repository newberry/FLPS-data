   <p>The Socialist organization of our city will have a big gathering Sunday, to celebrate the ending of the war and the disappearance of autocracy.</p>
   <p>This reunion will take place at the Coliseum in the afternoon, and will probably be presided over by William B. Lloyd, who was a Socialist candidate for Senator in the recent election. Speeches will be made in various languages. Mr. John La Duca will be the Italian speaker.</p>
