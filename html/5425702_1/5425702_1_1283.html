   <p>The "Christopher Columbus" at Central Music Hall.</p>
   <p>In anticipation of the inauguration of the Chicago Columbian Exposition, October 12, the Society Christofero Colombo has reserved for that date the Central Music Hall. It had tried to get the Auditorium, but the management would not go back on its word, since the theater is reserved on that evening for the Patti concert.</p>
