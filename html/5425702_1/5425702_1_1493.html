   <p>Owing to the interest which Congressman Britten has taken in the matter, the Garibaldi Statue which is located in a semi-concealed spot of Lincoln Park will soon be removed to a more attractive location in the same park.</p>
   <p>Congressman Britten who is a candidate for re-election as Representative of the 9th Congressional District has announced that the new base and foundation for the statue have been designed by the prominent firm of architects, Graham, Anderson, Probst and White.</p>
   <p>The new location of the monument will be about three hundred yards south of the statue of General Grant on the Outer Drive.</p>

   <p>The Congressman has offered to buy the material necessary for the foundation. It is proposed to have Italians of all classes assist in the laying of the corner stone; each will, in his turn, throw a shovelful of cement into the foundation until the necessary amount has been reached. The names of the Italians who participate in that ceremony will be engraved on a bronze tablet. Congressman Britten also wishes it to be understood that the work is not at the expense of the public, but is being financed by admirers of General Garibaldi, who in the hearts of many is second to George Washington.</p>
   <p>Congressman Britten undoubtedly deserves to be remembered by all Italians of Chicago with their vote on Election Day, November 8.</p>
