   <p>Mr. Cairoli Gigliotti notifies us that at the concert organized by the National Fiume League, a net profit of $555.10 was realized and was consigned to Mr. Guiseppe Rossi, who transmitted it to the Progresso Italo Americano of New York.</p>
   <p>The sum includes $292.35, which was donated by the audience, and the list of names with the exact amount donated by each was sent to the Progresso Italo Americano with the profits of the concert.</p>
   
   <p>The tickets sold are as follows: Angelo Adamo, $50; Cherubino Jacobucci $50; P. R. De Carlo $45; C. Gigliotti, $42.50; Joseph De Bellis $41; Rag. A. Caruson $38.50; D. Jacobellis $29; Dr. L. S. La Piana $23; Almerino Levato $19; Henry Grill $17; at the door $36.50; - Total with the addition of $20 worth of tickets sold by Mr. Franco whose orchestra played splendidly during the concert $411.50.</p>
   <p>The expenses were divided as follows: - Rent for the hall $50; Printing expenses paid to Mr. Bertelli $55; Movie slides $3.50; A large table placed at the entrance to the hall $50; incidental expenses $5; total expenses were $127.50, and that sum was given to Mr. Enrico Bambara, director of publicity; $125 to De Bellis, secretary, for mailing expenses; $15 to Mr. Clinton, singer, who was presented by Mr. De Carlo; and $5 to Mrs. Brown who accompanied Miss Greco at the piano.</p>
   
   <p>Total expenses $148.70; gross receipts $411.50. The sale of the D'Annunzio buttons outside the hall, was not made for either the League's account, or the concert committee's account who sold them, donated $3.50 and is listed among the donators for that amount.</p>
   <p>The inclement weather caused the return of many unpaid tickets, which would otherwise have increased the amount taken in.</p>
   <p>Any way, in spite of difficulties encountered, the result can be considered as very satisfactory.</p>
