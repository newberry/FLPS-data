   <p>Vincenzo Innoca, 28, a non-union railroad worker, employed by the Chicago and Northwestern, was fined two-hundred dollars by Judge Calvary, for carrying a gun.</p>
   <p>He attempted to justify himself by claiming that since he was a strikebreaker, he had a fear of being assaulted, and therefore carried a gun for safety.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the judge allowed the fine to stand.</p>
