   <p>In keeping with our program of supporting political candidates of Italian origin, regardless of party affiliations, we name those who are on the ballot for the coming election:</p>
   <p>Joshua D'Esposito for Trustee of the Sanitary District.</p>
   <p>Daniel Serritella for State Senator from the First District. He is at present City Sealer for the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Paul Colianni for Trustee of the Sanitary District.</p>
   <p>James Buffa for Judge of the Superior Court.</p>
   <p>Salvatore Corrao for State Auditor.</p>
   <p>Michale Durso for State Senator.</p>
   <p>Carlo Coia for State Representative.</p>
   <p>The number of Italians in public life is increasing daily. There are five judges, six state representatives, one alderman, Pacelli, one city sealer, <span class="page-break">2</span>Servitello, one U.S.District Attorney, and some Assistant State's Attorneys.</p>
   <p>And with the increase of the Italian prestige, there will be an increase in the number of Italian-American public officials.</p>
