   <p>Unsanitary Factories.</p>
   <p>The investigation into the deplorable conditions existing in the stock-years has given the city health authorities the idea of investigating the food manufacturing establishments of the city.</p>
   <p>The macaroni factories which are for the most part owned and operated by Italians were under consideration. One of the first to be visited was that of the John B. Canepa and Co., located at 101-103 Indiana St. The health officer was at first refused admittance but after more mature consideration the owners allowed the inspection.</p>
   <p>The report which the officer turned in was very uncomplimentary to the Canepa factory. It stated that the work tables, troughs and dough mixers were in a filthy condition and that the walls, floors and windows had not been cleaned for a long time. On the basis of this report, city officials ordered a thorough cleansing of all equipment and premises: and that this practice should be indulged in periodically.</p>
