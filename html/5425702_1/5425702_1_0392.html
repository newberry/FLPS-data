   <p>Mr. Ferinando Seville, professor of modern history at the University of Chicago, during a lecture delivered last week, said: "The Fascist movement of Italy may be defined as the dicatatorship of the bourgeoisie.</p>
   <p>"The proletarian class, dissatisfied with the war and the terrible consequences felt by everyone in everyone in Italy, joined the revolutionary parties. The Fascists, organizing themselves in military style, used violent methods against them, and through such violence, Fascism acquired power and control--as instruments of the bourgeois class."</p>
   <p>It is worth reading the definition of Fascism given by the bourgeoisie.</p>
   <p>It is similar to that given by us: "The dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."</p>
   <p>Thus we can see that Fascism will not work for the interests of Italy and its workers; the workers who [support] Fascism will help only the hangman--in his work of hanging and strangling workers even more than before.</p>

   <p>In a word, they will help the bourgeoisie to better speculate with the human proletarian flesh--for the gain and profit of the bourgeoisie.</p>
