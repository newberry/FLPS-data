   <p>Once more we beg Italian parents to see that their children succeed in mastering the language of their forefathers, both for its cultural value to them and for their personal honor and advantage.</p>
   <p>Although we might allow ourselves to be satisfied to a certain extent with the results so far achieved by our efforts, it is nevertheless pitiful to note that as yet not enough students have asked their schools for instruction in Italian.</p>
   <p>In our March issue we stated that we would ask the Board of Education to take more interest in the matter, and here is the reply which we have received from President McCahey:</p>
   <p>My Dear Mr. Alberti: I have your recent communication advising that your newspaper has instituted a campaign to have the Italian language taught in the public schools.</p>
   <p>For some years past Italian has been taught wherever the demand has reached the required number. The Department of Education's rule is that there must be at least three classes or one hundred students before a class in language can be started. The North Central Association of High Schools requires four semesters of a language before any credit can be allowed.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>James B. McCahey</p>
   <p>We nevertheless renew our appeal because we believe that it is important to protect our race and the language of our forefathers, which in this new land of ours is destined to progress and not to stagnate.</p>
