   <p>This Italian Chamber of Commerce, in view of the Exposition which will be held in Chicago in 1933, has sent to the Interstate Economic Councils of Italy a letter in which is stated, that this Chamber is at the service and disposal of any Italian national firm requesting information about the Exposition. This Chamber seriously urges the Italian industries to participate in the Exposition.</p>
   <p>The Italian Government is favorably contemplating to officially participate in the Exposition of Chicago. Considering that other nations have already sent assurance of their participation, we hope that Italy will do the same and will try to have some space reserved for one pavilion large enough for the Italian industries and exhibitors. Our Chamber is in touch with the local Exposition Committee and will use all its energies in favor of Italian firms which are considering to participate in the Exposition. </p>
