   <p>Quarrel Between Italians and Swedes.</p>
   <p>The Italians and Swedes came to blows, last Sunday, between Oak and Sedgwick Sts.</p>
   <p>A hatred between residents of the two races in that locality had been seething for a long time, but a reason for bringing it to a head did not present itself until then, with the result that, the two groups met, armed with knives, guns and sticks. The police, summoned by neutral witnesses, quickly quieted the combatants so that peaceful citizens went to bed with the assurance that their sleep would not be disturbed.</p>
