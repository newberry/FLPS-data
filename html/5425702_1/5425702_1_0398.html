   <p>Italian Socialist Federation Co-workers: One after another, political prisoners are gaining their liberty. In the Federal bastille there are still those who are in because they haven't a committee chosen for the purpose of effecting their release. One of these is Luigi Parenti, of the I. W. W., sentenced to five years in the famous trial in which the cruelty of Judge Landis was outstanding.</p>
   <p>To the Executive Committee of the Italian Socialist Federation of the United States, the opportunity of effecting the release of Parenti is evident, if only through a discreet effort on the part of the workers. The authorities are disposed to put him at liberty on condition that he show himself the possessor of $1,500, which is the sum necessary for his return to his homeland with his family.</p>
   <p>Do we Socialists, we working comrades, want to leave in prison, to rot for three more years, a man, our brother, a husband, the father of three innocent children, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>because we are not inclined to make even a small financial effort? Of the sum needed to free our comrade, the biggest part has been donated by others; it rests with us to collect our share in order to arrive at the necessary sum.</p>
   <p>The F. S. I. as always, free of sectional prejudices, appeals to its members and to the workers of every party and political creed to give any offering for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Luigi Parenti is not a member of our party, but he is a son of the working class, and was imprisoned by the bourgeoisie while seeking to serve the proletarian cause, as a soldier in the ranks of the I. W. W. He is therefore a member of our class, towards whom we have a duty: to give an offering that will help him rejoin his family, and his father who is 84 years of age, fighting with death, in the hope of again embracing his Louis. We must, therefore, do our duty by giving him back his freedom, life, and work.</p>
   <p>Whoever feels duty bound to assist in this work may send his contribution to the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Italian Socialist Federation, 220 So. Ashland Blvd., Chicago, Ill. P. S. To date the contributions have reached the sum of $43.50.</p>
