   <p>Vita Nuova is an American magazine published, besides English, in the Italian and Spanish languages, familiar to its readers.</p>
   <p>Vita Nuova stands for sound American interests just as surely as any paper printed only in the English language.</p>
   <p>Vita Nuova is urging its thousands of readers to learn the English language and is helping them to do it. Any foreigner who can read a magazine in his or her own tongue and side by side finds the same article in English, will the more readily acquire the language of our country.</p>
   <p>Vita Nuova aims to educate its readers by making them more familiar with American ways and ideals. We believe a common language one of the best means to this end.</p>
   <p>Vita Nuova desires its readers to be good citizens of this country, worthy of the name, with full and sufficient knowledge of the new country and its requirements and with an intelligent loyalty to its principles and to its flag.</p>
