   <p>616 S. Michigan Avenue</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Pursuant to our letter of February 1, we beg to enclose herewith check No. 953 for $315.19, as total contribution to the American Red Cross by the lodges of the "Order Sons of Italy in America," in the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>We beg to inform also, that some of our lodges contributed by either sending remittances directly to your office or through the medium of local committees.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Excusing ourselves for the delay, due principally to the fact that we wanted to make sure that no other contributions were forthcoming, we wish to assure you that we will at all times answer the call for any American cause.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours</p>
   <p>Paul Lonero.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul A. Lonero</p>

   <p>Dear Mr. Lonero:</p>
   <p>We are very grateful for the contribution of $315.19, from the lodges of the "Order Sons of Italy in America," in the State of Illinois, to the Red Cross "Flood Relief Fund."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The Red Cross is now engaged in the greatest rehabilitation task in its history and every dollar is being utilized to great advantage.</p>
   <p>In expressing thanks, the Red Cross speaks for the many thousands of flood victims, who are gaining a fresh start in life through the generosity of organizations like yours.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours</p>
