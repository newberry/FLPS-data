   <p>"Oscar Durante, the youthful and well-known director of the Italian newspaper, L'Italia, one of the most widely circulated Italian-language papers in the United States, has left the field of journalism for the practice of law.</p>
   <p>"In the year 1886 when only sixteen years of age, Durante founded this newspaper in company with Carlo Gentile. Four months later, having paid Gentile his share in the paper, he remained sole owner.</p>
   <p>"Durante has always worked for the benefit of the Italians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"It seemed to him that the majority of Italians sentenced in the Courts of the State were victims of their own lack of education and ignorance, rather than an innate delinquency.</p>

   <p>"In the distant State of Washington, Dominick Corrello was condemned to death by hanging for a deed of which Durante believed him innocent. Hieing himself to Washington he was successful in having the death sentence commuted to eight years' imprisonment.</p>
   <p>"In the case of Dominick Migliavesi, also sentenced to death by hanging, Durante succeeded in having it changed to a sentence of three years in prison.</p>
   <p>"Believing a federation of all Italian Societies would be of greater benefit to the Italians in America, he was successful to the point of being elected Honorary President of the combined organization."</p>
   <p>This judgment of a newspaper as important as The Daily News, is more than a repayment for all blows received by Mr. Durante in journalistic bouts.</p>
