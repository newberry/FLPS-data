   <p>Sunday evening, December 29th last, we were fortunate to be present in the large audience which attended the performance of this operetta at the McCormick Club House.</p>
   <p>The action and music of the play were effectively presented by a troupe of professionals and amateurs belonging to the philodramatic club "Tommaso Salvini", under the guidance of Stage Director S. Lami and Musical Director A. C. Ricordati.</p>
   <p>"The Sandal Lost in the Snow" is a provincial melodrama that portrays the life, customs and vernacular expressions of the Tuscan peasantry.</p>
   <p>Its author, strange to say, is anonymous.</p>
   
   <p>The play takes place in a Tuscan village, during the first decade of the nineteenth century.</p>
   <p>The young heroine, Nannetta, is in love with a young man named Nardino, but she is sought in marriage by an elderly bachelor, Signor Polidopio, who takes it for granted that his position as teacher and literator of the village will win him Nannetta.</p>
   <p>The mother of the heroine, Ghita, is one of these women who only consider social position when they marry off their daughters. She therefore favors the teacher, but the father, Tommaso, is enlisted on the side of love.</p>
   <p>And what of the sandal? In the heart of the night, Nannetta creeps out of her home. For convenience, she wears her mother's sandals.</p>
   
   <p>She meets her lover, Nardino, and after exchanging "furtive little kisses" with him, she hurriedly leaves to return to her room. In her haste she loses one of the sandals in the snow.</p>
   <p>The learned teacher finds the lost sandal and makes of it a casus belli. He loses no time in spreading scandal among the neighbors and invoking their assistance in seeking the woman who, in the flurry of a tryst, had lost a sandal in the snow.</p>
   <p>The teacher himself undertakes the task of trying to ascertain the ownership of the sandal. He tries the sandal on the feet of a number of female villagers until, lo and behold, the lost sandal fits on one of the appendages belonging to Nannett's mother.</p>
   <p>Charming Nannetta, however, promptly divulges the true story of the sandal, to save her mother from a false accusation. At the same time she publicly avows her love for Nardino.</p>
   
   <p>The mother flies into a rage, while the teacher insists upon knowing why Nannetta took such a long time to choose between himself, and educated man, and Nardino, a peasant. At this point the good "old man," Tommaso, interrupts to say that he is not seeking a scholar for his daughter, but a husband.</p>
   <p>Thus true love, sanctioned by the "old man," wins out, and the play ends happily for all except the mother and the disappointed teacher.</p>
