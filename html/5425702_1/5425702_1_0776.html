   <p>In the list of names of June graduates from the different universities, we have noticed with pleasure that of Miss Catherine Barasa (the beautiful and talented daughter of our Supreme President) who has graduated from the De Paul law school, with honors.</p>
   <p>Miss Barasa, who will be the youngest woman to be admitted to the Bar, will grace her father's office as his law partner and if she attains the same professional popularity of her daddy she will be one of the most successful, as well as one of the most beautiful, Portias in the practice of law. To her go the best wishes of our membership.</p>
