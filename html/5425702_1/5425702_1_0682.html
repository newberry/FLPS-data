   <p>One of our compatriots, Mr. Michele Narussi, is a Democratic candidate for state's senator in the 17th District. It is a district where the majority of the voters are Italians, therefore, Mr. Narussi's victory is almost certain.</p>
   <p>The present moment is favourable because the Italian voters are showing their good will, by selecting an Italian representative, and renouncing their service toward different nationalities. We are very negligent and foolish in the part, to have any faith at all in the tricky politicians, who only seem to remember us when the meeting of the voters is concerned.</p>
   
   <p>The voters of the 17th District who are voting for Mr. Narussi, will be certain of sending a representative gifted with ability and intelligence to Springfield.</p>
   <p>Mr. Narussi is opposing Senator Glachin, who has been in office for many years, and is retiring.</p>
