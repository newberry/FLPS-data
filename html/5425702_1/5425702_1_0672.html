   <p>The election held Nov. 4th revealed that the Italians are gaining every day more in the political field of this country.</p>
   <p>The Italians of today are not the Italians of years ago, who were compelled to submit themselves to the "Irish Boss," who guided the local political destinies.</p>
   <p>The Italian of today knows his duty and his rights and claims what by right belongs to him, and which he has acquired through the unity of our people, who finally understand the necessity of a solid front.</p>
   <p>Michael Durso, William V. Pacelli and Charles Coia were elected State Senators and our popular judge, the Hon. John J. Lupe, was re-elected judge of the Municipal Court.</p>
