   <p>Our success and fight to force a more favorable attitude toward the Italian in America has resulted in favorable attention being given our letter complaining to William R. Hearst on the appearance of the word "Dago" in his paper, when referring to an Italian.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hearst answered through his secretary L. J. O'Reilly. In his letter he thanked us for bringing the matter to his attention and assured us that from this day on that term would be abolished by all his papers.</p>
   <p>A letter which we had written to the New York Herald which is fighting Mr. Hearst's candidacy was definitely ignored.</p>
