   <p>Attorney Chevalier Mario Lauro sent to the Chicago Tribune the following letter:</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 5th.</p>
   <p>I would be glad if you noticed that Chicago's newest wonder, the great Union Station, has not only walls of marble imported from Italy, a structure of classic Roman design, as is written below the picture published in the Sunday Tribune of today.</p>
   <p>Note also that the man who drew the plans and under whose management the "newest wonder" was built is an Italian.</p>
   <p>He is G. D'Esposito, born in Sorrento, Italy, of Italian parents, and educated in Italy. He came to this country about twenty-six years ago <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>after he had completed his studies in Italy, and it is quite certain that the American citizen, P. D'Esposito is a source of pride both to his fatherland and the country of his adoption.</p>
