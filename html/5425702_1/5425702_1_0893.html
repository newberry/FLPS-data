   <p>The North Avenue State Bank, Larrabee Street, North Avenue and Ogden Avenue, is making astonishing progress.</p>
   <p>Its clientelle is increasing every day and its prestige is increasing in a way that places it among the most solid and accredited financial institutions of the city.</p>
   <p>This bank was founded twenty-five years ago on the north side, which was populated at that time by Germans and Scandinavians. But in recent years the Italians began to move into that district and today they represent the majority.</p>
   <p>The initial capital of the bank, $250,000, has been increased in proportion to the progress of the institution and at present the capital and surplus amount <span class="page-break">\2</span>to $1,000,000, the resources are more than $10,000,000.</p>
   <p>The officers have wide experience in the banking business and the competent staff is deserving of all the credit for its financial progress.</p>
   <p>The Italians are always welcome at the North Avenue Bank, because they represent the majority of the depositors and because one of their countrymen, Mr. Vincent Ferrara, ably assisted by another Italian, Mr. John Russeau, Assistant Manager, of the foreign exchange department. These two men are always ready to assist Italians in all their needs. In Mr. Ferrara, Assistant Cashier of the Bank, the Italians have a friend and a protector of their interests.</p>
