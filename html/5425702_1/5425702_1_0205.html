   <p>For once the entire Italian Press in America has taken a united stand, in the disdainful silence with which it greeted the Democratic candidacy of Woodrow Wilson, for President of the United States.</p>
   <p>In assuming this attitude it vindicates the Italian and other foreign peoples for the offensive statements expressed by the candidate, Mr. Wilson, in regard to the immigration of these peoples.</p>
   <p>Of these immigrants, in his "History of the American People" volume five, page 212 he viciously expresses himself as follows:</p>
   <p>"Immigration poured steadily in as before, but with an alteration of stock which students of affairs marked with uneasiness. Throughout the centuries men of sturdy stocks of the north of Europe, had made up the main strain <span class="page-break">2</span>of foreign blood, which was every year added to the vital working force of the country, or else men of Latin-Gallic stocks, of France and Northern Italy. But now there came multitudes of men of the lowest class, from the south of Italy, and men of the meaner sort out of Hungary and Poland, men out of the ranks where there was neither skill nor energy, nor any initiative of quick intelligence; and they came in numbers which increased from year to year, as if the countries of the south of Europe were disburdening themselves, of the more sordid and hapless elements of their population. And yet the Chinese were more to be desired as workmen, if not as citizens, than most of the coarse crew that came crowding in at the eastern ports."</p>
   <p>These words with which the Democratic Candidate bares his mind, on the question of immigration, show his race hatred in such a manner that it is impossible to give them any other interpretation. So true is it, that even he has felt the necessity, of a re-shuffling in his attitude by saying, that since the time he made those statements, his views had undergone a <span class="page-break">3</span>radical change.</p>
   <p>But this tardy regret on the part of the Democratic Candidate, the honesty of which is to be doubted, is not sufficient to change the conception of him formed in the minds of foreign born American citizens.</p>
   <p>Only certain inconsequential Italian papers have come out in support of this slanderer of our race. Furthermore, we have been permitted to witness the force of individuals who, though before the primaries were ready to crucify him are now transformed into enthuastic supporters for his election.</p>
   <p>Pride of race, sense of offended national dignity should have counseled more sober manifestations, following, if need be, the example of other foreign born groups which maintaining a significant silence give to understand that one cannot insult entire racial groups with impunity.</p>
   <p>True, one must not judge Wilson entirely, on the basis of his opinion on this question to-day, or accepting as sincere his change of attitude, <span class="page-break">4</span>what his opinion was twenty years ago. We have not, in this column, indulged in fruitless exaggerations on the person of the Democratic Candidate because we believe in weighing the facts "pro" and "con".</p>
   <p>One cannot consider any single statement or act as sufficient to form a sweeping opinion of an individual, especially when that individual is the Democratic Candidate, for the highest office in the nation. Therefore, it would be unfair to hide Wilson's entire political program, behind a screen of deprecations because of that insult. But at the same time when one considers the "elasticity" of political programs expounded on the eve of an election, it is imprudent to calculate on completed elections.</p>
   <p>Of Wilson, therefore, one is sure only of his unfavorable personal opinion on the immigration of the afore-mentioned peoples. And since above any other thought or consideration we are Italians, it is difficult for us to show a smiling face for one who wrote of our race as "cursed <span class="page-break">5</span>rabble".</p>
   <p>Wilson has classed the Italian as lower than the Chinese? Very well, let him go the the Chinese, for votes.</p>
