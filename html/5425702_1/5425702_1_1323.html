   <p>With a refinement that reveals a niceness of feeling, William Hale Thompson, the new mayor of Chicago, sent us the following letter, the day after his election, thanking us for the support of L'Italia in the past campaign. We reprint an Italian translation:</p>
   <p>Most Esteemed Director of L'Italia:</p>
   <p>I consider it a great privilege to be able to express my sincere esteem for the support which you gave to my candidacy in the columns of your paper. I have welcomed particularly the support I received in your leading articles.</p>
   <p>I am more than persuaded that your working in my behalf has contributed much to my victory, which I feel will open to joy the hearts of not only the people of Chicago, but of the entire country, since it now gives way to the assurance that the best medium to prosperity is to the election of a Republican President and a Republican Congress.</p>
   <p>(Signed) William Hale Thompson.</p>
