   <p>It is a pleasure for us to know that a new band has been organized under the leadership of well known Maestro Annibale Ridarelli, an ex-non-commissioned officer of the Italian Army Bands.</p>
   <p>The new band is located at 77 Ewing Street, and we are sure that under the direction and management of said maestro, the band will have a great success.</p>
