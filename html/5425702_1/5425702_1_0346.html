   <p>p.-3-.....No more does one see in Chicago the long queues of foreigners who a year ago waited patiently for a call in front of employment agencies.</p>
   <p>The Italians, Greeks, and Poles, to whom any compensation might be offered, have disappeared.</p>
   <p>The few who are now seeking employment are mostly Americans or northern Europeans. These, however, are no longer humbly submissive to factory owners and foremen, nor do they have to pay, when hired, the former special commission. Laborers now available are demanding better wages and the abolition of the former excessive commissions.</p>
