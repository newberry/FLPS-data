   <p>In its Sept. 9th issue, the Tribuna Italiana published an article titled "The Depotism of the Railway Men", in which it called the railway worker "black-handlers" and racketeers because they succeeded, through the strength of their union in securing the passage of the eight-hour law.</p>
   <p>This article does not surprise us, because the Tribuna Italiana of Chicago, edited by Mastro-Valerio, does not intend to educate the laboring class, either civically or socially. Its only aim is to make money by advertising banks and corn plasters. It recommends for nomination only those candidates who favor capitalism, and therefore it can only wish the gallows for the masses. It is well that workingmen should know that Mastro-Valerio and his Tribuna Italiana are against them, and that both are unworthy of their respect or consideration.</p>
   <p>Incidentally, the eight-hour law safeguards the life and health of all railroad travelers, whether passengers or personnel. In fact, statistics based on the largest railroad accidents in the world will show that the original cause of such disasters is always the exhaustion of the personnel due to over-long time-schedules.</p>
