   <p>Last Tuesday was registration day. Every night rallies are held favoring either one or the other of the candidates for Mayor.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow at 2 P. M. a rally will be held by the Italian Columbian Democratic Club, at Uhlich's Hall, which declared itself in favor of the Democratic candidate, Carter Harrison.</p>
   <p>We have come to a decision. We feel that Chicago will benefit the most if the Republican candidate, Samuel W. Allerton is victorious. It will be to the advantage of all the Italians in Chicago to vote for him.</p>
