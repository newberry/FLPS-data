   <p>The solution of the conflict between the Catholic Church and Italy is an accomplished fact and judgment has been passed upon it.</p>
   <p>Intangibly, Rome belongs to Italy; any idea of temporal dominance or other pretension has come to naught. The small zone of land given to the Pope will be known as the Vatican City, and from it he may exercise his spiritual mission among the Roman Catholics of the world, always under the protection and supervision of the Italian Government.</p>
   <p>Religious freedom exists, actually and by right. And any criticism or comment on a contract that has received the reciprocal sanction and approval of the contracting parties, is remembered superfluous and odious, since the critics cannot change the essence of a contract that has become effective. Nevertheless intruders will continue to use this historic act of Fascist Italy as pretext for attacks on Mussolini and the Italian Government without which they would have nothing to fill the columns of their newspapers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Despite this we have no intention of obstructing the freedom of discussion, a freedom that has exercised in all times the power and influence of enlightening public opinion and guiding the current of new and progressive ideals, but, rather, we wish to suggest that the question should be posted in its true terms and that the debate should be directed on a more refined field of thought for the assertion of principles that are above personal views and disputes. Especially, when we touch on the delicate chord of religious freedom and creeds to which everyone has a right according to the dictates of his conscience.</p>
   <p>I dismiss, therefore, this systematic opposition fanaticism, aberration and self-praise which has become the fashion of mediocre figures whose only aim is personal glory.</p>
   <p>I dismiss public discussions between those of the same faith that merely compromise the dignity of the high ministry to which we are called and instead of clarifying a fact or an idea, produce the painful consequences <span class="page-break">\3</span>of diminishing the prestige of our faith and enfeebling our ranks. We wish to draw everyone back to reality and to express a clear judgment.</p>
   <p>We do not intend to change our sympathy and judgment regarding Mussolini since he came into power unless his actions become contrary to the public good. We do not intend to follow the lead of those opportunists who, chameleon like, change their attitudes like weather vanes.</p>
   <p>We judge facts and actions of men and not poetic ideals loosed on their air. Thank God our mind is at rest and our conscience clear and we are again induced to say that above all and everyone we are here for the purpose of serving and glorifying God.</p>
   <p>But where men are concerned we render to Ceasar that which is Ceasar's.</p>
   <p>We have judged (and shall continue in that judgment) Mussolini's government as a blessing of God because of all that he has been able to accomplish for our nation with his creative mind from a moral, political <span class="page-break">\4</span>and economic standpoint.</p>
   <p>Italy of today is a country in which reigns that sense of discipline, which imposes upon its citizens the duty of working and producing and loving the fatherland and to contribute to its greatness from every viewpoint, political economic and moral.</p>
   <p>Mussolini has rebuilt Italy; he has taken it away from the hands of corrupters; he has freed it from the claws of the Reds who intended to drag it down to that Bolshevism that is in vogue in Russia where horrors, excess violence, and suppression of public freedom are the order of the day.</p>
   <p>Last and most shameful is the suppression of man's unborn right to believe in God according to the dictates of his conscience; a most holy right which is the foundation of all civilization, and which has been violently manhandled so that the world is being defiled by nefarious atheistic propaganda. Mussolini has solved the Roman question, the solution to which had been attempted by other governments which were non-Catholic, and we firmly believe that he has been capable of putting an end to the pretenses of temporal or secular dominion of the Pope's limiting this <span class="page-break">\5</span>dominion to a very small zone known as the City of the Vatican but which is no more than a long leased concession controlled by the Italian Government.</p>
   <p>Now, speaking of liberty, we ask: What do we mean by liberty? Is it perhaps that license by which every man may think and act as he pleases or does it mean living under the discipline and observance of the powers and laws constituted by the majority?</p>
   <p>We are for the last named. A society in which everyone intends or wills to do what is to him most convenient is not admissible and cannot subsist. And as for Italy, it has chosen the government which rules it today.</p>
   <p>We see that the man who rules the destinies of Italy with his legislative acts, which form a model of great geniality, has cancelled an unhappy past and gives us to expect a future filled with hope and promise that will certainly be transformed into a reality as are all acts accomplished <span class="page-break">\6</span>by the Fascist Government.</p>
   <p>Coming to the point, then, on the question of religious freedom, we approve that historic act from the moment in which it had his sanction and we have joined our voice and sentiments of joy to those of our brothers in Italy who were the first to enthuastically praise and bless that solemn act of the Mussolini government, in the press and in public speeches.</p>
   <p>Any criticism, comment or discussion, therefore, that may be made in America by our colleagues or anyone else, gives us to think that they interest themselves in matters that do not concern them. Those really and trully interested in that question are our colleagues in Italy and they have unanimously demonstrated their approval.</p>
   <p>If they are satisfied everyone else should be, also.</p>
   <p>A prominent personality whom we naturally cannot name, but who enjoys much prestige and authority in Italy among the followers of our faith, <span class="page-break">\7</span>has explicitly stated that they who, living in America and on the pretext of defending religious freedom, concern themselves with this touchy question are doing harm and rendering bad service to the Evangelists in Italy, in fact they are influential in compromising their cause and entangling their mission. Those gentlemen, he added, would do better to employ their time in spreading the Gospel among the Italians in America.</p>
   <p>From which we draw the conclusion that the Italian Evangelists have no need of the labor of voluntary protectors.</p>
