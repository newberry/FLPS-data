   <p>Yesterday, January 16, the Circolo Giordano Bruno, a solid anticlerical organization with a large membership, gave its fourth propagandist reception, this time in the club's own quarters. For on the anniversary of Bruno's martyrdom the club inaugurated its permanent social headquarters, a splendid hall with a capacity of four hundred, lighted by twelve enormous windows, with a stage, located at 350 South Halsted street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pecori, in choice language, explained to a large audience the purposes of the occasion and the club's program. He was heartily applauded.</p>
   <p>Comrade Bertelli was also applauded for his eulogy of the great philosopher,- of his life, his works, and his death.</p>

   <p>Music and informal dancing followed.</p>
   <p>The club was founded only six months ago, and it already shows great promise. We wish for it the utmost success.</p>
