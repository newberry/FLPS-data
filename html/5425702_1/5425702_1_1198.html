   <p>This operetta was presented on Sunday, December 4, under the auspices of the Italian Socialist Sections of the 11th Ward.</p>
   <p>Its success surpassed our expectations; this was largely due to the energetic efforts of Maestro A. Ricordati. May we be allowed once more to say that our friend Ricordati is the man best fitted to stage operettas.</p>
   <p>Everything considered, the performers did a pretty good job. Miss M. Santarsieri, in the role of Natalia, surpassed the other actresses.</p>
   <p>It would be irrelevant to describe here the work of the other performers.</p>
