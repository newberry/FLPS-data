   <p>The study of the Italian language in some of the Chicago high schools is developing with increasing interest, through the efforts of Chev. Oscar Durante, member of the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>The Englewood High School is the most recent one at which the study of the Italian language has been added to the curriculum.</p>
   <p>In the near future, through the efforts of Mr. Durante, the Italian language will be taught in every high school and college of the city.</p>
   <p>We encourage and approve the efforts of Chev. Durante.</p>
