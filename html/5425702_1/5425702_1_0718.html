   <p>During the war, Socialists were called pro-German; later they were pro-Russian, (Bolsheviks). Tomorrow, if Japan should resent the activities of the dollar-sharks that are actually pillaging and plundering the East, to the extent of declaring war against this country, the Socialists would be called Japanese.</p>
   <p>We Socialists, the target for all calumnies, always pictured with a bomb in hand, have nothing but our hands, with which we produce so that others may enjoy. The majority of the people are against us,and only the future will vindicate our judgment.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Our yellow press says: "Go, sons of democracy, defend your fatherland; it shall know how to recompense you. We have gone to war to give peace to the world."</p>
   <p>Socialists who declared that win or lose--the real winners would be the gold barons, were deported or put behind bars. The war ended, and with it the songs, promises and patriotic demonstrations. The heroes--not all of them came back--to their families, each with sixty dollars in his pockets, not enough for a suit to replace the one which many gave away the day they donned the uniform in the name of Democracy!</p>
   <p>Years have passed since the first talk of a "Soldier Bonus" began. Our good patriots make use of it during election campaigns; they did in the last presidential election and they will do it in future ones also. The sage Senate of the United <span class="page-break">3</span>States throws aside the "Soldier Bonus" and approves a loan of millions of dollars to the railroads, the funds to come from the public Treasury; this means that the railroad companies have good lawyers to represent them in the Senate, while the ex-soldiers receive nothing, unless another war comes along so that they can play their parts on the fields of battle in the name of Democracy.</p>
   <p>The heroes knock in vain from door to door in search of work, while the "hundred-per-cent" patriots enjoy their fabulous profits acquired during the war.</p>
   <p>The American Legion cannot defend the rights of the ex-soldiers; only by uniting with their comrades in labor, and by struggling in the field of politics--as in the economic field--can the ex-combatants achieve anything.</p>
   <p>The American Legion, with its big-bellied ex-officers and colonels swelled with <span class="page-break">4</span>their importance, cannot act in any other way than to the advantage of the capitalists, and thus place a heavier cross on the back of the people.</p>
   <p>We socialists cannot remain inactive against a regime that permits reductions in wages and [tolerates] and defends with fire and steel industrialists of the Rockefeller type, when the workers go out on strike for the purpose of bettering their conditions. The middle class reforms are not effective enough to heal the ills that afflict the working class. Laws will never apply equally to all, as long as they do not guarantee peace and equality to all the people of the world.</p>
   <p>Laws can be bought and sold, like goods in the market; and so shall it be as long as laws need a uniform and the big stick to apply, and a judge to interpret and administer it.</p>
   <p>We shall have a law of equality only when boundaries of our middle class are <span class="page-break">5</span>abolished-as well as class privileges-and the people unite to enjoy in common all that is good or bad, beautiful or ugly, in this world.</p>
   <p>The American Legion,which appears, to exist only for the rights of the ex-combatants, does not scorn to defend and sustain the social system with actual weapons. If the ex-combatants, the militant group in the American Legion, came into the ranks of the Socialist Party, the capitalist class and the Senate would have a greater regard for us.</p>
   <p>Socialism in the solution to all our ills; the Socialist Party is working to hasten the coming of Socialism. Our ex-combatant friends should be among us Socialists.</p>
