   <p>p. 1. - The schools will reopen in September. If enough students can be enrolled, according to the regulations of the Board of Education courses in the Italian language will be given in high schools.</p>
   <p>This information was given to our publisher in a letter dated March 23, 1937, by the president.</p>
   <p>For many months the Italian Courier has published important articles on the Italian language, which is a living, vigorous tongue, one of the foremost in the world. It is the key to a wealth of music and poetry.</p>
   <p>To students who elect it, it will open new vistas of culture.</p>
   <p>We hope and trust that the youth of this great city will respond to the appeals which have appeared so frequently on our editorial page.</p>
