   <p>The Sant' Antonio Society has donated one hundred dollars ($100) for the monument to Garibaldi in response to the President, Mr. Giovanni D' Ambrosos' suggestion to the Sant' Antonio Society. We know that other Italian societies are taking this matter into consideration, and are waiting for the next meeting to settle on a sufficient amount as a donation to the monument fund.</p>
