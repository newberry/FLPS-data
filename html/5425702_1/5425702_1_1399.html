   <p>Italian Consul General Castruccio spoke over the Daily News radio station, WMAQ in commemoration of the Birth of Rome.</p>
   <p>In his talk, which was preceded by the playing of the Italian Royal March, and the singing of "Giovinezza" by Virgilio Lazzeri of the Chicago Civic Opera, our Consul illustrated the story of the great Roman civilization from its beginning, through the centuries in various historic periods, to the recent Fascist conquest of Rome.</p>
   <p>As a compliment to this demonstration the Daily News, in its Saturday's issue, gave an entire page of the illustrated supplement to photographs of ancient and modern Roman monuments.</p>
