   <p>To the directors of Italian-American newspapers and to emigrated Italians to nobly commemorate in the United States the Six Hundredth Anniversary of the death of Dante:- Luigi Carnovale,(author of the book, Why Italy Entered Into The Great War.)</p>
   <p>A solemn celebration of the Six Hundredth Anniversary of Dante's death will be held in Florence, where he was born in 1265, and in Ravenna, where he died and was buried in 1321.</p>
   <p>In America, the intellectuals have already begun to commemorate that event. The Chicago Literary Club (a leading organization of that type) is giving a series of lectures.</p>
   
   <p>The first lecture was dedicated entirely to this great poet. I was present by invitation, and listened to four very good talks on Dante. They were, "Dante Six Hundred Years After", Merritt Starr; "Dante's Life and Works in the Light of Recent Research", Prof. Theodore Kock, Northwestern University; "Dante and Italian Politics", Prof. Kenneth McKenzie, University of Illinois; "Dante The Apostle", Prof. E. H. Wilkins, University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all Italians in America to join in some sort of demonstration for this historical event, if for no other reason than to show that despite that illiteracy, of which we are accused, we do know and are familiar with the author of the Divine Comedy and that we venerate him as highly, if not more so, as the Italians in Italy.</p>
   
   <p>I propose:</p>
   <p>A. That Italians in America bring pressure to bear on public officials to have September 14, 1921 officially proclaimed (by the President of the Republic) as Dante Memorial Day and further, that on that day, in the public schools of America, teachers be obliged to speak of Dante to their pupils.</p>
   <p>B. That Italians in America, offer on that day, two gifts- (1) to each of the forty state universities; (2) to one college or private university in each of the nine states that do not have state universities; (3) to the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.; (4) to public libraries (maintained with public funds) in cities with a population above one hundred thousand.</p>
   
   <p>First Gift - a bronze tablet with a full size likeness of Dante in relief and with the following inscription: Presented by the Italians of the United States of America on the Six Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Dante, September 14, 1921.</p>
   <p>Second Gift - the complete works of Dante, (a special edition of which is being published this year in Italy, with the following autograph in Italian script: Presented by the Italians of America on the Six Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Dante, September 14, 1921.</p>
   <p>That which I have proposed in paragraphs "A" and "B" is to be carried to completion by a committee to be formed for that purpose and composed of the directors of all Italian newspapers in America (this will include all daily, weekly, semi-monthly and monthly publications).</p>
   
   <p>The first meeting of this committee will be held during the first two weeks of March by directors of New York papers, the place of meeting will be chosen by the director of the oldest paper. In the name of present and absent directors the committee will be known as the National Italo-American Committee with headquarters in New York for the Six Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Dante. Four officers will be elected (president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary). The secretary will handle all correspondence. He will receive a salary; the others will give their services for gratis.</p>
   <p>Only directors of Italian newspapers in America may be members of the committee. These newspapers will receive a list of the names of members of the committee. They will also print articles on the moral, spiritual and intellectual significance of this commemoration; they will solicit funds and print thenames of all persons who donate to the fund to pay the a fore mentioned gifts, and use their editorial columns to influence the United States Government to set aside September 14, as Dante memorial day.</p>
   <p>One hundred and eighteen tablets and as many sets of the works of Dante will be bought to be presented to the previously mentioned universities and public libraries. If the funds collected more than cover that expense, extra tablets and books will be bought and presented to public libraries of cities with a population of less than one hundred thousand.</p>
   <p>The two gifts will be accompanied by letters written in English. The letters will state that these gifts are being given by the Italians of the United States on the Six Hundredth Anniversary of the Death of Dante, September 14, 1921. The letter-heads will read as follows: Italian American National Committee for the commemoration of the death of Dante.</p>
   
   <p>On the eve of September 14, 1921, all Italian newspapers in America will print a special edition in English and Italian with illustrations and articles praising Dante.</p>
   <p>All Italians are expected to disregard political and religious differences and strive towards a greater glorification of this great Italian.</p>
   <p>Finally I place at the disposition of the National Italian Committee to be formed in New York my own personal contribution of one hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>Luigi Carnovale.</p>
