   <p>The annual excursion of the Socialist party of Cook County will take place on Sunday, July 12.</p>
   <p>This year we shall go to Milwaukee on the magnificent steamer Christopher Columbus as guests of our English, German, and Italian comrades living in that charming city. Only for the lack of some ten votes in the election of last May did these Socialist comrades of ours fail to have a radical nominated for the office of mayor of Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>Comrade Eugene Debs, Socialist candidate for the presidency of the United States, will deliver an address in English. Other orators will speak in German and in Italian.</p>
   <p>We shall leave in the early morning and return about 11 p. m. with several thousand Socialists as passengers. Since the Italians of Cook County who are registered in the Socialist party of America amount to more than three hundred, we hope that they will attend in numbers.</p>
