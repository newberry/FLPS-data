   <p>Marriage Licence Refused to a Minor.</p>
   <p>The clerk of the Marriage License Bureau had occasion a few days ago to refuse a license to Salvatore Calderore, 29 years of age, when the latter announced his intention of marrying Maria Cordella, 13 years of age.</p>
   <p>Rumor of the impending marriage reached the ears of Miss Alice B. Canney teacher at the Harrison School of which Maria is a pupil. Miss Canney quickly notified the clerk at the bureau giving him the girl's age, and so Salvatore will have to wait until Maria is of a legal age before joining with her in wed-lock.</p>
