   <p>Last Sunday, at the Columbus Theater, Miss Mary Malatesta made her debut as a soprano.</p>
   <p>Miss Amy Leslie, a very competent music critic, said, "Miss Malatesta shows promise because she has all the good qualities needed. She is young and has a pleasing manner and her voice is very lyrical." Chicago critics also were enthusiastic over her performance.</p>
