   <p>Countrymen:</p>
   <p>As in other Italian communities Chicago's Italians have also the desire of collecting funds for the Italian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>For the noble idea of this expressive movement, I wish, at this moment, to undertake the direction of uniting all the various initiatives into one, and I am sure that the solid and patriotic Italian community of Chicago with its institutions and associations as well as the individual, whether from the wealthy or from the modest class, will donate generously in answer to this appeal.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At this moment of decisive importance for our mother-country, a target for an unjust, furious, abominable and hostile propaganda, an offer for the Italian Red Cross represents the most noble gesture of protest which any Italian can make.</p>
   <p>Such a gesture will represent the best symbol of solidarity and loyalty with the brothers over sea, who in unison with His Majesty the King and the Duce, are fighting for the glory and increment of Fascist Italy.</p>
