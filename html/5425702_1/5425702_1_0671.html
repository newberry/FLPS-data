   <p>It is a pleasure to know that our countryman, Mr. Albert Mancini, was elected to the office of representative for the second senatorial district.</p>
   <p>Mr. William V. Pacelli and Chas. Coia were elected representatives for the seventeenth senatorial district, and Michael Durse, representative for the twenty-ninth district.</p>
   <p>It is the first time that the Italian community has had four legislators in this State, in addition to Senator James Leonardo, who was elected to the State senate two years ago.</p>
