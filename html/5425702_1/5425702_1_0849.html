   <p>A Physician-Surgeon diploma was granted to the Italian, Guglielmo Borelli, at Powers Theatre, Apr. 9. He is a native of Olivetto Citra, province of Salerno.</p>
   <p>It is with sincere satisfaction that we published this. It shows that by indefatigable study, and a strong will, one can openly achieve professional honor.</p>
   <p>Born in Italy, Dr. Borelli was brought to America by his family, when only four months old. He first attended the James School, and from there was sent to High School, where, after four years of excellent study, he was granted a diploma. Then he studied at St. Ignatius College and at the Rush Medical College, and, finally, after four years, at the University of Chicago, he achieved his diploma for physician and surgeon.</p>
   <p>We all wish him a very brilliant and prosperous career.</p>
