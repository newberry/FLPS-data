   <p>Chicago, these past days, has been immersed in mourning. Not because of a public disaster. No. It has been in mourning for the death of seven-year-old Gwendolyn Armour, daughter of the packinghouse millionaire, who has become wealthy by poisoning the people with meat from carrion animals. What a calamity for the city of Chicago! When one considers that during the illness of this heiress to millions, ten specialists were in constant attendance at her bedside. Further than that, the streets of the neighborhood were closed to traffic, so that noise would not disturb her.</p>
   <p>And even police were on guard to see that those streets remained silent. It is a pity that the little one died, but at any rate, my dear reader, tell me whether you think the same would be done for your children if they were sick in bed. Also tell me whether the city would send police to insure quiet in the vicinity of your home. I await your answer.</p>
