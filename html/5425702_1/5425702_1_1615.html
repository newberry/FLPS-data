   <p>The Italian residents of Chicago have for some time felt the need of a hospital for the sick of their nationality. There are many thousands of the race in the city, a large number of whom are unacquainted with the English language and when one of these is obliged to seek the county or other hospital the services of an interpreter are necessary, which at times causes dangerous delay.</p>
   <p>Dr. Andrew Mauro, President of the Italian Medical Society, Dr. Antonio Lagorio, and other physicians are keenly interested in the project of the erection of a hospital and have given time and money to its furtherance. Dr. Lagorio said last evening that about $1,000.00 had been subscribed, the amount needed being about $10,000.00. The plan is to erect a building with accomodations for twenty patients.</p>
   <p>The location will be as central as possible and the management of the hospital will be in the hands of a board composed of the most prominent Italian citizens. The institution, while primarily for the benefit of Italians, will be open to all <span class="page-break">\2</span>people irrespective of nationality or religion. The Italian societies of the city are interested and have promised a considerable sum of money. A site for the proposed building that finds much favor is at Crawford Avenue and Twelfth Street. It is hoped that ground may be broken and the building fairly started in about six months. A concert for the benefit of the hospital fund was given in Kimball Hall last night. David A. Dasso gave his services as manager and secured the voluntary aid of some of the best musical talent in the city. Eliodore de Campri was the accompanist and a committee of Italian ladies aided in securing the success of the concert. A handsome sum was realized from the sale of tickets. It is proposed to give another entertainment of like nature in the near future.</p>
