   <p>After seventeen weeks of strike, although certain factories are full of scabs, production is not even half what it was before the strike began.</p>
   <p>Statistics show that up to date the loss sustained by the management amounts to $13,482,000, while the loss in wages is about $4,494,000.</p>
   <p>All the factory workers of Hart, Schaffner, and Marx, amounting to 12,000, have gone back to their former jobs, heartily welcomed by their foremen. These old workers have displaced the scabs. The agreement signed by Hart, Schaffner, and Marx establishes that:</p>
   <p>1) All workers now on strike must return to their jobs within ten days;</p>
   <p>2) There will be no discrimination between members and non-members of the United Garment Workers of America;and</p>
   <p>3) An aritration committee will be formed, composed of one laborer, one company official, and a third member to be selected by the other two members.</p>
