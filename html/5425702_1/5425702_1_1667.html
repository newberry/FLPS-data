   <p>The Black Hand Again.</p>
   <p>Luigi Capparelli, residing at 9457 Exchange Ave., South Chicago, received a black hand letter which he has turned over to the police who advised him to disregard it.</p>
   <p>He believes the letter, bearing a Pullman post-mark, was sent to him by certain persons whom Capparelli was forced to dismiss when the railroad for which he works as station-boss, ordered a cut.</p>
   <p>He has fulfilled the demands made in the letter, that he leave his present domicile, under threat of death.</p>
   <p>The police are carrying on an investigation in Pullman.</p>
