   <p>The Italian Women's Benefit Society is planning to hold a rummage sale next week. All Italians who have any clothing to donate please phone or write to Mrs. Rocco De Stefano, 732 S. Ashland Ave.</p>
   <p>The rummage sale will be held in a negro district because negros are fond of these sales.</p>
   <p>The Italian Women's Benefit Society will also give a dance Nov. 26, day after "Thanksgiving". The proceeds of both these affairs will be donated to the poor of our colony.</p>
