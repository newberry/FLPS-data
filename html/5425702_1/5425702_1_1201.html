   <p>This operetta was presented on Sunday, May 2, at the Meldazis Hall, under the auspices of the Italian Socialist Sections of Cook County.</p>
   <p>A few minutes before the curtain went up, the distressing news arrived that the prima donna, Giuseppina Donici, was sick in bed.</p>
   <p>Immediately, two of our comrades went to the Teatro Dante, in order to engage Miss Elisa Donici as a substitute. She is a sister of the stricken actress. However, as it was impossible for her to leave the Teatro Dante before 10 P. M., the entire situation was explained to the audience at Meldazis Hall. Dancing was then resumed.</p>
   <p>At 10 P. M., Maestro A. C. Ricordati shifted to symphonic music. It was played very well by an orchestra of fifteen pieces, in spite of the fact that half of the musicians were young students, pupils of Maestro Ricordati and of Maestro Pacini, the first violinist. An appreciative audience listened silently, and then applauded loudly.</p>

   <p>T. Bellandi sang so naturally in the role of Tonio the Shepherd, that it almost seemed as if the maestro had composed it purposely for him. His baritone voice was particularly impressive when he sang the lovely ballad: "The devil on a fatal day." Nina, the turkey girl, was splendidly portrayed by the substitute, Miss Elisa Donici - although she had never rehearsed the part. Her duet with Tonio was greatly applauded, and encores were called for.</p>
   <p>Remo Conti is the artist who has adapted this operetta to the stage. Moreover, for the last two months, he co-operated with Maestro Ricordati in training the amateur actors. Mr. Conti played the role of Louis XIV admirably. While he does not possess a remarkable voice, he is a perfect master of the same. Mrs. Conti showed true artistry in her role of the little princess.</p>
   <p>All the other actors, although amateurs, contributed in great measure to the success of the operetta.</p>
   <p>The chorus of peasants and peasant girls sang very well, and was much applauded.</p>
