   <p>A Political Club was formed by Italians of Chicago to place their candidate in office so that he may represent the interests of the Italians in the City Hall. The purpose of this club is to see that every Italian becomes a citizen of this country in order that he have the right to vote and the opportunity to hold office. Out of this one club two were formed. One club was called Democratic and the other Republican. From these two clubs, one man would be elected who would best serve the interests of the Italians in Chicago.</p>
