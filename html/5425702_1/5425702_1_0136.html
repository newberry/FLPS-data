   <p>Last Monday, The Record-Herald, one of the most influential newspapers of Chicago, told of two Italian families that were in dire circumstances. A policeman found Vito Vittoria of 2122 Armour Avenue, his wife and children, the eldest 5 years, without food in the house. The father has consumption and the mother, a laundress, is incapable of supporting the family. The baby will soon die of hunger. Francisco Gotto of 2123 Clark Street, is sick and his wife is bedridden. This family is also without any food.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Daily News last Monday, told of an Italian, Filomena Masoa, of 397 La Salle Street, and four children who were found starving to death. The poor woman was forced to ask for assistance at an American charitable institution, which undertook to care for one of her children. Her husband left for the country in search of work sometime ago, and left his wife $5.00 with which she fed herself and children.</p>
   <p>While these Italians were starving, others were pinning money on the Robe of the Blessed Virgin, to the amount of $800, because of their terrible fear of hell, and disputing among themselves for the honor of carrying the saint upon their shoulders in the procession.</p>
