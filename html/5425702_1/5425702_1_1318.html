   <p>The deficit incurred in the operation of La Parola is slowly disappearing, thanks to the group and individual contributions that are flooding this office. More than two hundred dollars has been received since the last issue. Of this sum, the largest contribution was from the 11th Ward Branch, in Chicago, which donated the sum of one hundred dollars, representing the net income from a dance given by that branch recently. The Italian Socialist Branch of Centralia, Illinois, donated forty dollars.</p>
   <p>Comrades! Only by contributing to the overthrow of the deficit can La Parola carry the torch of Socialism.</p>
