   <p>In these columns last week I launched an appeal to the anti-clerical element to assist in the rebirth of the Giordano Bruno club. I am happy to say that to date I have the promise of many members.</p>
   <p>The printer made an error in my address and printed it as 114 instead of 1144 W. Polk street. I hope that those who wrote to the wrong address will communicate with me again.</p>
   <p>In the next issue of La Parola I shall announce the time and the place of our first meeting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>To those who are unfamiliar with the aims of the club let me say that they are as follows:</p>
   <p>(1) An incessant campaign of anti-clericalism, conducted according to the best methods of propaganda, written and spoken to rid the Italian immigrant of all the superstition and ignorance in which he is kept by the papists; and,</p>
   <p>(2) The establishment of an evening school for Italians and of a dramatic group headed by a salaried director and composed of experienced actors. The latter is a necessity for the club, since the theater is the school of the soul, to which youth is drawn to be entertained and educated.</p>
   <p>The priests of our colony have already established a dramatic club to entertain and instruct in their ways the young people who attend their churches.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>They have established schools where the mind of youth is poisoned by the catechism taught by the nuns. In their congregations the priests encourage dances and banquets, etc., in order to distract the minds of the young people and at the same time relieve them of their spare cash.</p>
   <p>The Giordano Bruno club reappears! It is reborn! It intends to vindicate the victims of the tyranny andthe atrocious cruelty in which the church has indulged throughout the centuries. It will strip the mask from your face before the innocent populace and identify you for what you are, the murderers of Giordano Bruno, Savonarola, Huss, and many more who dared to reveal the truth to the world.</p>
