   <p>Not long ago a telegram reached here saying that a certain Mr. Satolli was to organize Italian Schools under the Italian government. His name is not Mr. Satolli, but Monsignor Satolli, and he is sent by Pope Leo XIII to Chicago to organize the Catholic Schools according to the Roman system, but not in the Italian language. The schools will teach in English.</p>
