   <p>Only an immigrant, one who has for years after his arrival been a stranger to language and customs of the country, can fully understand and appreciate the part that the newspapers printed in his own tongue plays in acquainting him with conditions adopted in this adopted country of his. It may seem a paradox that a newspaper is of far greater practical value to the newcomer than any books from which he might have acquired whatever amount of education he possesses, but it is nevertheless true. In fact, the fellow who has spent many a night-hour trying to put into polished phrases a chapter from Xenephon is no better off, as far as the practical value of his learning is concerned, than the fellow who comes from the peak of the mountains and cannot write script but must print his letters. Both, although coming from the opposite stations in life are bounced into the midst of an unfamiliar turmoil, in which they find themselves on the same level, that is, unable to express themselves in words of the new tongue which is spoken everywhere about them, and if left to find their way alone, unable even to satisfy their most imperative wants. The natural <span class="page-break">2</span>result of this plight, in which all foreigners find themselves at their arrival, is the tendency to settle where others of their nationality have already settled, thus forming those characteristic little foreign colonies in American towns, which for the better and the younger element, are like ante-rooms where their acquisition of the English language and their assimilation of American customs are little by little prepared and accomplished and from which they will, sooner or later, step out into the larger life of the town and become units of the true American population. The older set, or the purely migratory element, either fossilizes in these segregated communities or returns to the homeland after a more or less protracted stay here.</p>
   <p>It is during this period of incubation, among the members of these communities, that the foreign-language newspaper plays its most important and lasting educational part. The newspaper becomes then for the immigrated, not merely an agency of information concerning the happenings in the old country, but a unique practical, almost automatic teacher of American <span class="page-break">3</span>ways, American laws, and American institutions. Because a foreigner exhibits knowledge, for instance, of American juridical procedure or political organization or what-not, it does not argue that that foreigner has received school instruction on such topics, or that he must necessarily have been in court, or have voted. Nor could any manual or newspaper be found which treats these subjects in an academic way. All that a foreigner comes to know about his new country, he absorbs from reading the varied happenings of each day in the newspaper printed in his own tongue. Today it may be the news concerning the strike of the street-cleaners that teaches him about labor organization and that particular branch of the city administration. Tomorrow, by reading a sensational case he will come to understand the functions and the mode of procedure of our courts.</p>
   <p>In this respect the lawyer from Italy who might possibly have edited a newspaper there, needs to read the newspaper here as much as does the mountaineer from Albania, who perhaps never saw a newspaper-man in his country. A tangible evidence of how indispensable is the newspaper to the foreigner in America is the extent to which the newspaper of each nationality circulated among the people of that nationality. Every literate <span class="page-break">4</span>foreigner is a constant and attentive reader of the journals in his own tongue. Of course it is to be expected, at such times as during the recent Turkish-Italian war, and during the present Balkan war, that the members of the races involved who are residing in this country should be led by their patriotism to a closer scrutiny of the news that usual. Hence an abnormal increase in the circulation of the Italian newspapers in the United States during the war of their mother country with Turkey, amounted to no more than thirty per cent; which is small enough considering the vital and enthusiastic interest with which the Italians here followed every step of the conflict's progress.</p>
   <p>As an educational factor, the advertisements in foreign-language newspapers are also of invaluable assistance to the newcomer. There are a lot of wants that he begins to feel after being here a short while, and while at first it is the suggestion of a friend or relative that makes the newcomer adapt himself to a certain branch or quality of goods, the time comes when he feels the necessity of making his own choice in order to satisfy his own taste. Here is where the new arrival turns to newspapers for help, <span class="page-break">5</span>with a confidence which made him, up to four or five years ago, an easy prey of the sharks and the crooks.</p>
   <p>But even the advertising of the foreign-language newspapers is now becoming standardized. The readers are warned through editorials to discriminate in their purchases and preferably to look for trade-marks or trade names of established reputation. Thus the time is not far off when foreign-language newspapers will be as reliable and educating in their advertisements as they are at present in their news.</p>
