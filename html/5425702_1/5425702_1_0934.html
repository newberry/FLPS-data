   <p>As every one knows, Citti Brothers was forced to stop the sale of imported groceries, wines and liqueurs, on account of the war that halted the importation of said articles. After the conclusion of the Armistice as business is coming back to its normal state, the Citti Brothers want to restore again their old activity in business and for that purpose, they rented a new place annexed to their Salami Manufactory.</p>
   <p>To take care of the many requests of their old customers, the store will soon be opened and will sell only as in the past, imported articles of first quality, at very low price.</p>
   <p>The store will have all the sanitary devices; will be the best of its king and will be located at 309-311 W. Illinois Street. It will be annexed to the Citti's Salami and Mortadella factory.</p>
   <p>Mr. Silvio Citti, is the head of the firm.</p>
