   <p>Picnic and pilgrimage to be held on vacant tract in Melrose Park.</p>
   <p>Many Italians arrived at Melrose Park preparatory to a pilgrimage and picnic to be held today on the forty-acre tract of land west of the Latrobe Steel Works. The occasion is the feast of our lady of Mount Carmel. A statue of the virgin will be conveyed through the streets this morning at ten o'clock, and about it will be placed money amounting, it is expected, to something over $2,000 in contributions. It is thought that about 6,000 Italians will be present.</p>
