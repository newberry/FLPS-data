   <p>We are glad to inform our readers that the Committee for the Columbus Monument, which is to be erected in Grant Park, is working assiduously. Chev. Brioschi has completed the model of the Statue of Columbus which is being sent to Italy to be cast in bronze.</p>
   <p>The sculptor has also completed the model of the four symbolic figures representing: faith, courage, science, and desire for knowledge; which guided and sustained Columbus on his dangerous journey. Those four big figures will adorn the base of the monument together with four medallions representing: the Caravel Santa Maria; the emblem of the City of Genoa; and the profiles of Paolo Taselli, Columbus's teacher and Amerigo Vespucci, Columbus's pupil.</p>

   <p>Judge Francis Borrelli, president of the Committee on July 16 went to St. Paul, Minn., with the Italian Consul General to inspect Chev. Brioschi's work and both were well pleased. The model of the base also is ready to be shipped to Italy to be carved out of Boveno grante.</p>
   <p>On July 20, Judge Borrelli with Hon. P. Colianni, Chev, Brioschi and the Italian Consul, attended a meeting of the South Park Commissioners and after a discussion with the Hon. Igoe, Kelly and others, they had a formal promise that the location of the monument would be in Grant Park, north of the Field Museum at the corner of the Inner Drive, the best spot in the park.</p>
