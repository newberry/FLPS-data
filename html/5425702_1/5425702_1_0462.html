   <p>No, we Socialists are not Utopians any more. Our great philosophers of half a century ago were called Utopians when with audacious intuition they divined the coming of Socialism. But to-day Socialism is not a Utopia; it is a reality, which exists under our very eyes. To-day Socialism is assailed, not tolerated as a dream, and the assault upon it shows that it is recognized as something tangible, like men and things.</p>
   <p>Others are the Utopians to-day. Others, to-day, dream dreams and contemplate impossibilities. These dreamers are those who delude themselves into thinking that they can arrest the development of Socialism.</p>
   <p>In America this type of Utopian bears the name of Democrat or Progressive.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>He is a follower of Wilson, of Bryan, or of Roosevelt, whose Utopian efforts seem to be sincerely directed toward the defense of their own bourgeois class, to which, as we know, the advent of Socialism has dealt the death-blow. That is, these Utopians are people sincerely desirous of saving themselves from Socialism, but definitely outside the pale of communal thought.</p>
   <p>We have followed them in the last presidential campaign and in recent governmental policies, and their reasonings and their actions are very familiar to us. Here are some examples.</p>
   <p>On the question of the trusts they reason thus. The manufacturers and distributors have ceased to compete against each other and have <span class="page-break">\3</span>organized themselves into colossal enterprises creating a monopoly on goods and a control of prices, thus forming the trusts. But all this leads to Socialism. Therefore we will pass a law prohibiting manufacturers and distributors from making any kind of agreement or plan which will remove uncertainty from the future. By law we will force them again to engage in the war of business competition, and we will also dissolve by law the trusts now in existence.</p>
   <p>Any person with common sense can see the puerility of this line of reasoning. The fusion of the forces of capital is a necessary evolutionary stage in the development of capitalism itself and not, most certainly, a new discovery or whim of humanity. It is as ridiculous to demand the return of competition as to expect the ripe ear of corn to return to grass or the railroad to be supplanted by <span class="page-break">\4</span>the stage-coach. It is absurd and Utopian. And if it is true (as the progressive Democrats have declared, and as we firmly believe) that the formation of trusts leads to Socialism, then it matters not how many laws Wilson puts through his legislative bodies, for into Socialism we shall inevitably be drawn.</p>
   <p>On the tariff question Wilson reasons thus. The cost of living rises menacingly; the people are united and support the radical parties; in order to arrest this swelling of the Socialist ranks, we must kill the high cost of living; to achieve that, we must remove the tariff from the most necessary commodities.</p>
   <p>Behold! Wilson and the Congress revise the tariff, but the cost of living rises higher. And why? Because the tariff has no connection with the cost of living. The dispute about the tariff is nothing more <span class="page-break">\5</span>than an argument among factions of capitalists. The cost of living is governed by factors much more complex, which we have explained in these columns a number of times. Therefore, being wrong in their diagnosis, they have also chosen the wrong cure. If the high cost of living is a maker of Socialists, it will continue to be so, Wilson may be assured, regardless of his Utopian legislation.</p>
   <p>The last and most colossal creation of Democratic-Progressive Utopianism was brought to birth a few days ago in the banking and finance bill known as the currency bill. According to Wilson the periodical depressions which hit this country are caused by a defective system of banking and finance. These terrible crises which every now and then, like earthquakes, shake the foundations of our bourgeois society have given food for thought to quite a few men besides Wilson, not only because of the immediate harm which they cause to the world of finance but also because of the suffering <span class="page-break">\6</span>of the workers, who are becoming more and more firmly convinced that something is amiss in the workings of this society of ours, in which the wheels of industry come periodically to a sudden stop and are set in motion again only after much suffering. These little paralytic strokes may at some time or other prove fatal to our decrepit bourgeois society and result in the emergence of a system more logical and just. We absolutely must stop these industrial depressions, says Wilson, and then he presents us with the currency bill.</p>
   <p>Poor Wilson! Your anti-Socialist zeal, laudable from the bourgeois point of view, will again prove to be nothing more than an expression of your Utopian mind. With or without the currency bill, the industrial crises will continue to come, each worse than the one preceding, until to your sorrow the bourgeois society gasps its last breath.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>In the face of all this tragedy an authoritative newspaper of Berlin carries an item facetiously stating that because of the currency bill Wilson should be called an irresponsible and dangerous Socialist. Behold the gratitude of the world! You, Wilson, while employing any or all fantastic means to arrest the advent of Socialism are called a "dangerous Socialist." It is the height of injustice and ingratitude.</p>
   <p>The same injustice was suffered by Roosevelt when he preached his radical program to the people in the last campaign. But he knew what answer to make, for with his usual cleverness he said, "Fools, you call me a Socialist! My program is an antidote for Socialism."</p>
   <p>That, Mr. Wilson, was what Roosevelt thought of his program, and it is what you think of yours. But history will prove that neither one of <span class="page-break">\8</span>you is a Socialist or an anti-Socialist. It will prove that you are both Utopians.</p>
   <p>Socialism cannot be stopped. It is here before your eyes.</p>
