   <p>On June 1st, 1928, the Chamber had 107 active members residing in Chicago; 20 associat members in the United States; 15 associate members in Italy. Altogether 143 members.</p>
   <p>The active members residing in Chicago at the end of 1927 were 123, but by a decision of the Executive Council, February 28th, it was resolved to drop from the list of active members fifteen who were not in good standing with the treasury.</p>
   <p>For the same reason, some associate members, residing in Italy, were cancelled.</p>
   <p>The number of the associate members in Italy, is supposed to be greater and we believe that the Italian exporters, who are doing business with the United States and are being benefited by the activities of the Chamber, should be encouraged to become regular members, paying the regular dues.</p>
   
   <p>From a recent estimate made by the Accounting Commission it appeared, that the income from social dues for 1928 was about $2,500.00; the Italian Government subsidy for the past year was $1,080.00, a total of $3,580.00. The expenses for the present year were computed at $4,400.00 which will leave a deficit of $20.00. We are depending on the income from our advertising, celebrations or banquets to clear up that deficit. Our income does not allow us to employ the help needed to take care of the various activities of this Chamber, which with the coming International Exposition of Chicago, will be enlarged.</p>
