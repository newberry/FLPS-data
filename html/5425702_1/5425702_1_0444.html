   <p>We do not know any other name by which to call the capitalists of America.</p>
   <p>They are the real "Jackals".</p>
   <p>We know of their avarice and cruelty in draining money from the living.</p>
   <p>Now these "Jackals" are feeding themselves on corpses.</p>
   <p>The war, for them, is a Fair. They say: Ah! In Europe they are killing each other? Well, we want the workers of America to pay in order to enjoy peace, thus they will appreciate it more.</p>
   <p>They said so, and already they have raised the cost of all staples from meat to sugar.</p>
   <p>If the American people were not like sheep, and if the aliens who immigrated here, were not becoming like sheep themselves, we would see the streets and <span class="page-break">2</span>the squares of the American cities crowded with mobs protesting and asking for the hanging of the "Jackals".</p>
   <p>Well, this year the crop was abundant; the pastures rich, the cereals and wheat super-abundant; exports to Europe have almost stopped; everything is abundant in fantastic proportions, and the capitalists, 100 times thieves, are raising the cost of living with the excuse that there is a war in Europe.</p>
   <p>The newspapers make a little noise, women's clubs raise their voices, but there is not a single protest in an energetic effective manner.</p>
   <p>At Milan, in Italy, the Socialistic Administration has reduced the cost of bread and will also reduce the cost of milk, meat, and other necessities of life.</p>
   <p>But in America, cities, states, and the Federal Government are in the hands <span class="page-break">3</span>of the capitalist-democrat-republican party, which is helping the trusts though it pretends to be against them.</p>
   <p>Well, everything that is happening suits me! When a people is tolerant to such an extent and it supports, without protest, anything - and then on election day it votes for those who starve it - that people, we say, deserves to be treated and ruled even in the worst way.</p>
   <p>Dear "Jackals", squeeze and suck still more; the foolish, imbecile people will stand for it, and will thank you, because when a man is starving, he will blame - the socialists.</p>
