   <p>The inauguration of the renovated premises of the Banco di Napoli Trust Company of Chicago turned out to be quite an event of Italianism for the number and class of people who attended.</p>
   <p>The premises was decorated with flowers and banners. The Italian Consul General Dr Castruccio always present at every demonstration which is to the interest of the Italian people delivered a speech which elicited much enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Chev. Eduardo Maglione, Director of the Banco di Napoli, gave a talk.</p>
   <p>All countrymen were urged to support morally and financially the only bank in Chicago which is Italian in name, interest and character.</p>
   <p>The press was represented by our colleagues Chev. Rossi, Chev. Mastrovalerio, N. Lofranco, C. Meola, D. Stefani, C. Catalano and our co-editor, Bellaria.</p>
