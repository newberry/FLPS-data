   <p>A drama in three acts, William Kent by Ario Flamma, will be read on Sunday May 22, in the English Room of the Congress Hotel by the author, under the patronage of the Italian Consul, G. Bolognesi.</p>
   <p>We know that the elite of the colony will be present. This drama in English will appear on the stage in September in one of the principal theaters of New York, with famous American actors.</p>
   <p>Admission is by bid only since the space of the hall is limited and the author does not desire to give the reading to a large public, for fear that the play may become known before its performance on the stage. We foresee a huge success.</p>
