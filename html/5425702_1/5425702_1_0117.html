   <p>A New Evening School for Italian Immigrants in operation under the auspices of the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education of the City of Chicago has appointed Mr. Ettore Durante as instructor of English in the evening classes at the Harrison School, located at 23rd place and Portland ave. We would like to hope that this gesture by the Board of Education will be appreciated by the non-English speaking Italians and that they will take full advantage of the opportunities offered. To become good American citizens you must know how to speak, read and write English.</p>
