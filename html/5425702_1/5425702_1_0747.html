   <p>A reader who likes to remain anonymous, and who seems to follow European events with great interest, writes us the following letter:</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>December 7, 1914.</p>
   <p>L'Italia,</p>
   <p>54 West Harrison Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Gentlement:</p>
   <p>Ever since the beginning of the great war,we have read on and off that Italy will join in the fray. These articles cabled in by Bristow Allavie and by Bertelli (evidently a Frenchman) have become a standard joke. But the articles appearing in today's American by Bertelli seems to have some foundation.</p>
   <p>The writer has nothing against England; has no great sympathy for that conglomeration of races called Austria-Hungary, but it looks as though Italy <span class="page-break">\2</span>is about to launch on a course which is far from wise, because a war of this kind will bring immense losses in money and men. Italy is just commencing to raise her head and her neutrality has brought her tremendous advantages, both commercial and political. Will this be so after she has lost the flower of her manhood and immense sums of money? France even if victorious will be weakened and Italy would be so to speak far ahead of her, but with Italy considerably bruised after the war, even if victorious. France, will still be able to loan money to Greece and will obstruct Italy's progress on her home ground in conjunction with Greece. Rowmania, no matter how friendly toward Italy, would not count as she is not contiguous to Greece.</p>
   <p>It is perfectly right for Italy to safeguard her interests in Tunis and keep a fair sized army there to balk the Turk, but for Italy to be the catspaw for others, particularly the French is equivalent to suicide.</p>
   <p>Have you forgotten how the Italians were hated by the French at the outbreak of the war, in Nizza and other cities of Savoy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>A. Wellwisher.</p>
   <p>P. S.-- It is to be hoped that Bertelli's Ballon D'Essay is promptly disavowed by Italian officials.</p>
