   <p>Out of five thousand strikers only four hundred have deserted the cause of labor and returned to their jobs.</p>
   <p>The Italians in this strike have shown so far, a fine example of solidarity. Four or five ignorant Italians had sponsored the cause of capital, but they joined the strike after receiving a lesson.</p>
   <p>We urge all our fellow--countrymen to enroll in the Union so that their victory will be assured. Neither should they be deterred because Poles, Russians, Austrians, and other aliens are also members of the Union, for we are all brothers under the skin.</p>
