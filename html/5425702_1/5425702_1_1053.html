   <p>We feel that Haymarket Square is destined to be the future commission market of Chicago. About thirty merchants, among these, two Italian firms Raggio and Morrison; and Dasso Brothers, are doing business in that locality. We are of the opinion that South Water street in time will also be absorbed by Haymarket Square, which is large enough to handle the immense amount of business that is transacted daily.</p>
   <p>The Square, a few years back, was the scene of the riot in which officers of the law were killed and for which there are now a number of anarchists serving sentences. A bronze statue of a police officer, who seems like Joshua of old, to be telling the sun to stand still, stands in the center of the Square. Many of the merchants have formed a club and have planned to run a dance Monday night at the West Side Chicago Club House, 50 Throop street, near Monroe street. It will be the first dance given by the Merchants Club. Raggio and Morrison have cordially invited us to attend their dance.</p>
   <p>Best of luck to the West Side Commission Merchants Club.</p>
