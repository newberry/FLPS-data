   <p>P.2--On Sunday, April 18, we had the pleasure of attending a performance of the drama "Suor Teresa," presented by the Citta Di Bari company and directed by Mr. A. Segreto.</p>
   <p>We had an opportunity to admire the well-known actress Maris Armando, who revealed herself as a great dramatic artist, second to none. She gave to her role a realistic vitality which moved and delighted her audience. She has real talent for the stage and gives a realistic impersonation of every character which she assumes.</p>
   <p>It is an honor and a source of honest pride for us Italians to have an artist of this caliber in our colony.</p>
