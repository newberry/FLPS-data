   <p>A lecture was delivered in the Giordano Bruno Hall to an audience of some 200 persons by Attorney Diagora De Bella, who has just arrived from Italy to take the post of director of the Propaganda, organ of the Italian Socialist Federation for the northwest sections.</p>
   <p>Mr. De Bella spoke fluently and eloquently for three quarters of an hour upon the theory of class struggle, according to the syndicalistic viewpoint. The anarchist Libero Tancredi then attacked Mr. De Bella's syndicalism and defended Marxism against his opponent's criticism.</p>
   <p>In his rebuttal Mr. De Bella, using the first person plural, asserted that he was an anti-political, anti-parliamentarian syndicalist, as well as an anarchical socialist.</p>
   <p>The meeting ended in perfect order.</p>
