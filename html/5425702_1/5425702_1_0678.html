   <p>The meeting held the day before yesterday at the La Salle Hotel in favor of Barasa's candidacy met with great success. About two-hundred Italians were present who declared themselves to be in favor of Barasa and to do whatever possible to elect the Italian candidate.</p>
   <p>Judge Barasa, Mr. Gualano, Dr. J. Damiani, Mr. Schiavone, Mr. Bonelli, A. Bassi, F. Rigalo, and P. Biggio talked and were applauded. They then named a propaganda committee whose members consisted of Mr. Gualano, president; Dr. G. Monaco, Dr. J. Domiani, and others. Judge Barasa, each day, gains ground and will in all probability be chosen by his Republican friends as a State's Attorney.</p>
