   <p>Saturday evening, December 29, at 1196 South Cakly Avenue, Biagio Gildo talked eloquently before a large audience.</p>
   <p>He explained the different phases of history, and how successive social periods have always marked alternative conquests of social emancipation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gildo, talking in a sarcastic way, whipped the concupiscence of the church, its corruption and brutishness; he was much applauded. He concluded by saying that it is necessary to shake up the mass of people from their inertia, in order to arouse class consciousness and make them struggle for their rights.</p>
   <p>During this week a general meeting will be held in which the formation of a new associate branch of the Socialist Federation will be discussed. Plans have been made to have speakers in different quarters of the city and neighboring towns, in order to start new branches.</p>
