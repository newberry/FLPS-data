   <p>Between the 20th and 25th of August, a campaign will be carried on throughout the United States for the purpose of raising ten million dollars to erect ten monuments to Roosevelt, in Chicago, and three other cities, and to maintain as a national monument the Oyster Bay home of Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago embodies the sentiment of the Italians in Chicago for Mr. Roosevelt. His work in behalf of the earthquake victims in Messina will never be forgotten. The Chamber has decided to give a luncheon on October 25, at the Betti restaurant, where a famous American speaker will talk. The Italian press is invited to attend. No one should fail to attend this luncheon given in honor of men as great as Mazzini and Garibaldi.</p>
