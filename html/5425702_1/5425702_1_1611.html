   <p>Fifth Anniversary of the Columbus Hospital.</p>
   <p>The Columbus Hospital, today, celebrated its fifth anniversary and also the occupying of the fourth floor. The fourth floor was vacant for several years because of a lack of funds to furnish rooms, but through the help of Dr. Volino and Dr. Damiana, the Italian Womens Benefit Society, Consul Schetta and Milward Adams, every room on the fourth floor has been furnished and is ready for occupancy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Volino on his return from Italy was appointed as chief of the medical staff.</p>
