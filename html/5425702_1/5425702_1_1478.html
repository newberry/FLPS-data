   <p>Phil Cavaretta who at present is with the Cubs at Catalina Island training as first baseman for the coming baseball season, has been added to the swelling list of prominent and promising young men who have become members of our society.</p>
   <p>The honor for proposing the membership of Cavaretta goes to Nunzio Anzalone, president of Lodge P. Mascagni, No. 10, in which he has been enrolled.</p>
   <p>Phil is one of our boys. He was born on the near North Side where he attended the old Lane Technical High School, and comes from one of the best families of hardy and enterprising Southern Italian stock.</p>
   <p>We are happy to have Phil with us and wish him the greatest success on the diamond.</p>
   <p>Many of the thousands of our members, young and old, we are sure will root for him this season at Wrigley Field or wherever he may be playing and winning new laurels.</p>
