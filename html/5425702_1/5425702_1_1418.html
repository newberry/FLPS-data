   <p>A happy and well-thought idea was that of Prof. Silvio Piechianti and his wife, of opening a school for the teaching of Italian to people of both sexes. It is a marvelous opportunity for parents who desire that their children acquire a thorough knowledge of the mother tongue. The fees are within the ability of all to pay. Our best regards to the success of the enterprise.</p>
