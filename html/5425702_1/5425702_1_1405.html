   <p>In the gymnasium of St. John's Church at Harrison Street and Hoyne Avenue courses in Italian, in English, and in citizenship, for children and adults, are in progress attended by more than 150 pupils, all of Italian origin.</p>
   <p>This is a noble innovation for which the Reverend Father de Carlo is responsible. Father de Carlo has always evinced a particular interest in the intellectual and material development of our Italians.</p>
   <p>The classes are free, and the instruction is given by capable teachers who have specialized in their subjects.</p>
   <p>The opening of such a school affords opportunity to hundreds of Italians to learn the language of their forefathers. It is also very convenient for those who cannot attend the public schools.</p>
   <p>In a colony as large as ours every new school represents a step in the progress of civilization, enhancing the dignity and hastening the emancipation of our race.</p>
