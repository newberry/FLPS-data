   <p>Thursday, the 11th, A.M., the Supreme President Philip D'Andrea went to the Banco di Napoli where he deposited in the name of the Colonial Committee the sum of $1,000, as initial fund for the erection of the future Italian House of Chicago; thus keeping a promise made on February 2, during the annual banquet of our organization. The $1,000 was a part of the net profit of the banquet.</p>
   <p>The lack of an Italian House is resented and deplored by the Italian community of Chicago, and we are sure that this noble initiative will fill that gap, adding honor and prestige to the Italian name.</p>
