   <p>As we promised in past issues, we will publish short biographical sketches of any Italian who has made himself prominent in the affairs of this city. In this issue we reveal to you the illustrious personality of our countryman, Albert M. Gualano.</p>
   <p>He obtained his diploma from the Lyceum when twenty-five years old. In 1892 he came to America to visit the White City Exposition, which was organized on the occasion of the World's Columbian Exposition. It was not his intention to remain here but as soon as he had placed his foot on American soil, he soon visioned the possibility of a brilliant future and forgot his plans to return to Italy.</p>
   <p>He decided to remain in the United States. At that period he was an excellent promoter of calligraphic works. Hitting upon a propitious occasion he exhibited some of these works and received much praise, a medal and the highest diploma.</p>
   <p>Music was another of his accomplishments. He played the flute for his own pleasure in Italy. In America it was instrumental in embarking him on a course which acquired for him many friends and admirers. Various activities tell the story of his life at the time. He alternated his writings and his music with the teaching of Italian, Latin, and French.</p>
   <p>But our countryman was aspiring to vaster horizons and so at thirty-three years of age he enrolled at Northwestern University Law School. He completed his studies at the Illinois College of Law, where he received his diploma and the degree of Professor of Law. Since then he has practised law. His profound knowledge is recognized by the cultured element among Americans. A proof of this is his having been nominated in 1902, at the Republican Convention as Judge of the Municipal Court of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Attorney Gualano has likewise demonstrated his ability as an orator.</p>
   <p>He has had the honor of addressing some of the greatest Italian orators who have visited Chicago: Semeria, Deputy Bottai, and Victor Rolando Ricci, former Italian Ambassador to Washington.</p>
   <p>We are not by conviction or temperament addicted to exaggeration. Our statements are the result of judicious reflection born of insight, and a direct knowledge of things.</p>
   <p>Attorney Gualano is also gifted with a spiritual presence that is astounding.</p>
   
   <p>History, philosophy, art, science, fantasy, the entire gamut of human knowledge, one might say, is found amalgamated in the discourses of Attorney Gualano, to form a homogeneous dynamic entity with the force of irresistible conviction and a truly marvelous effect.</p>
   <p>The literary vestments, with which he adorns his classic works, are most brilliant Gualano's oratory at times reaches the sublime.</p>
   <p>As a proof of that which we are trying to affirm, we would like to cite an excerpt of his speech on the occasion of the celebration of the six hundredth anniversary of Dante's death. But we are not fortunate enough to possess a copy, and to write it in our words we fear might profane it. We will give the conclusion of another of his speeches entitled "Great Conquests and Great Conquerors," given at the commemoration of the discovery of America. It is worthy of being reprinted.</p>
   
   <p>"If it is true that from the other world, from time to time, those who have passed beyond return, I belive that the spirit of Columbus will raise itself, this day, from the region of the dead to contemplate with pleasure the immense gift which it gave to the old World; and emerging to the highest point of the firmament, in a splendor of new glory will participate in the celebration of the anniversary of his discovery, apostrophizing all the idols of history. Conquest by the sword is a devastating cyclone that leaves nothing but desolation in its wake. The conquest of the new hemisphere, accomplished without the spilling of blood, was a gift the benefit of which we revalue in new ways with the passing of years. This land, which has been the land of gold, is now the land of Liberty. Today, it is the bulwark of the people's rights. Bold fronts, which maintain themselves by force, are falling every day. The magic of the future civilization lies in one word, "love."</p>
   <p>We have reason, therefore, to conclude that the worthy attorney, Albert N. Gualano, highly honors the colony of Chicago by his high gifts of heart and mind.</p>
