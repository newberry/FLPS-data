   <p>Father Torello's Lecture.</p>
   <p>The "Sunday Chronicle" printed in full the lecture given by Father Torello, before the Chicago Women's Club.</p>
   <p>It is very gratifying that the American Press gives an Italian that much consideration.</p>
   <p>We will gladly print any part of the lecture if Father Torello will give the Italian translation.</p>
