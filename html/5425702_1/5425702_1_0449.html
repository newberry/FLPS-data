   <p>Next week will be a week in the German style - for the Italian Socialists of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A week of propaganda and of recruiting of new members - for our cause, and for the diffusion of Socialist literature.</p>
   <p>The expected arrival of our dear comrade, Arturo Caroti, makes this favorable moment for intensification of our activities.</p>
   <p>The Socialist Deputy from Florence will come to Chicago and will speak to us about Italy and America, two countries that he knows very well. He will bring to us the latest news about the new proletarian soul of Italy, and what is developing and ripening in our mother land.</p>
