   <p>For the first time in the history of Chicago, an Italian name appears as candidate on a Republican ballot.</p>
   <p>The candidate, Carlo A. Raggio, is running for County Commissioner.</p>
   <p>We are hoping for the vote of the entire Italian Colony in support of this, the first Italian candidate on any ballot, in Chicago.</p>
