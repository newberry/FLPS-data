   <p>A Petition.</p>
   <p>A few days ago, Mr. Joy Norton, Street Commissioner, received a letter from sixteen employees complaining that Mr. Fiepi had hired only Sicilians and from each man he exacted a fee of $5.00 for the job.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joy Norton replied that Mr. Fiepi had been recommended to him by a prominent railroad official and that it was his business to charge a fee. He also said, that the rolls were full and that the job of street-cleaning would proceed with workers now employed, this number being adequate for it.</p>
