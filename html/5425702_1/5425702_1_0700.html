   <p>The Aldermanic election of last Tuesday was favorable to both parties, although the Republicans, with the members whose terms are still running, will have a considerable majority in the council. Of the alderman elected Tuesday, seventeen are Democrats and eighteen are Republicans. Of the alderman whose terms are still running, twenty-one are Republicans and twelve are Democrats, so that the new council will have thirty-nine Republicans and twenty-nine Democrats.</p>
   <p>In the nineteenth ward, the Democratic candidate, John Powers, was opposed by the Italian, Luigi Bonnelli. When one realizes that Powers has made a feudal possession of that ward, it is easy to understand the reason for the Italian's defeat. It is satisfying to know, however, that Bonnelli was received in all the precincts. The final vote was: Powers - 3,559, Bonnelli - 845.</p>
