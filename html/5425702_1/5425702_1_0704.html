   <p>The Italian people of the 19th Ward are very fortunate to have an Italian candidate for Alderman. It will be a great pleasure to you if your vote will elect as Alderman, Vincenzo Pacelli. He is young and a good honest worker. He guarantees the people of that Ward that if he will be elected Alderman, he will do everything in his power to help the Italians of the 19th Ward. It will not only be a great help, but it will also be an honor to the Italians to have a co-national in the City Council. With this in mind, do not forget to vote for Vincenzo Pacelli for Alderman of the 19th Ward, Apr. 4, 1899.</p>
   <p>Tonight at 8 P. M. there will be a great mass meeting at Garibaldi Hall, 139 Ewing Street, concerning the election. The people of that Ward are all invited to attend without any distinction because of party. The Central Republican Committee will send able orators to speak on this occasion and will also furnish a good orchestra. Refreshments will be served. We wish Mr. Vincenzo Pacelli a great deal of success in the election.</p>
