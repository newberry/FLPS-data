   <p>At the commencement exercises of the Chicago College of Pharmacy, which were held at Hooley's Theater yesterday, one of the leading graduates was Francisco Gazzolo, a young Italian, and a member of one of the oldest Italian families in the colony.</p>
   <p>Oddly enough the only other Italian pharmacist in the colony is also named Frank Gazzolo. He and the new graduate are first cousins.</p>
