   <p>Having learned of this international meeting, (I) went to Bowen Hall, Hull House, in the belief that it was a socialist gathering.</p>
   <p>Instead I found there only (anarchic) or quasi-(anarchic) speakers, who spoke in various languages. An anarchist wearing a black tie that covered his entire breast spoke in Italian.</p>
   <p>The gist of his speech was that it was entirely useless to support this or that political party or to wait until the bourgeois did something for the unemployed. The proletariat must resort to violence, to rioting on the streets, to sacking stores and markets, and to social revolution.</p>
   <p>When the meeting adjourned to the street, the Italian anarchist had disappeared.</p>
