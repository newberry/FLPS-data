   <p>Sam Sapienza's home was bombed recently. He had disregarded two threatening letters signed by the "Black Hand" demanding the payment of a certain sum of money.</p>
   <p>Sapienza had an idea as to the identity of the writers of the letters whom he believed to be Onofrio Pucci and Michele Rizzo. Meeting them on the street, last Sunday, he wasted no time in drawing his gun and firing. He wounded Pucci but Rizzo fled. Rucci was brought to the German-American Hospital.</p>
   <p>Rizzo was discovered in a house located at 180 Milton Ave.</p>
