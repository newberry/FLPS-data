   <p>We have often requested the Italians to cooperate energetically with Mr. Durante, trustee of the Chicago board of education, to have the Italian language added to the high-school curriculum.</p>
   <p>The examination for teachers will be held on July 1.</p>
   <p>Our musical language will be taught in all the high schools, as it was decided. However, it is necessary that a certain number of students in each high school shall request instruction in Italian.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of parents to encourage their children to learn the Italian language, which is an inestimable cultural acquirement.</p>
