   <p>Thursday night we will have the pleasure of assisting the Florentine Mandoline orchestra. Professor Cesare Valise will be in charge of the concert which will be given for the benefit of the Chicago Press Club. Since we are taking part in this affair, we are asking our colony to be there, because it will be of great interest to us.</p>
