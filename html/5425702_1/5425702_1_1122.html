   <p>At this theatre,located at 96 West Ohio street, on Sunday the 14th, the opera Tosca was presented.</p>
   <p>This was the first performance in Chicago of the Compagnia Oliva, which has just returned from its well-deserved triumphs in Italy and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>This is an organization of real artists, of a kind seldom before welcomed in our colonies. Foremost among them we shall mention the exquisitely intelligent and refined actress, Mrs. Giuliano Oliva.</p>
   <p>As a party newspaper the Parola is glad to note this success of a group of artists of whom nearly all are militant comrades in our ranks.</p>
   <p>On Saturday, the 20th, the second performance will be given, Maria Giovanna; on Sunday the 21st the third, L'Avvelenatore. The seats are popularly priced: .15, .25 and 35 cents.</p>
   <p>We wish for these productions an extraordinary success.</p>
