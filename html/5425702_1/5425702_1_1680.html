   <p>The well-known politician, Joseph Esposito, Committeeman of the 25th Ward, distinguished himself during the Christmas holidays by the charity which he gave to the poor of our community. He made a distribution of money, clothes, food, and coal to the people who were in imperative need. The generosity of Mr. Esposito is worthy of praise.</p>
   <p>The Garibaldi Institute directed by the Rev. P. Decarlo, also made a large distribution of clothes, food, and coal to about 300 poor families. This philanthropic institute maintains a school for Italian children, and is located in the center of the thickly populated district of Taylor street where the largest number of Italians live.</p>
