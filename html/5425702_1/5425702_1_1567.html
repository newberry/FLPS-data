   <p>There can be no question or doubt that there are many opportunities in our order for young men of our race who are willing to first serve their apprenticeship in any one of our lodges.</p>
   <p>Our order welcomes as member any young man, regardless of his political or religious creed, who will willingly and unsparingly lend his moral support in the interests of the advancement of our race in this country.</p>
   <p>Our order is the richest "Fraternal Beneficiary Society" in the United States; engaged exclusively in the insurance of Italian-Americans of both sexes, from one to sixty years age. One of the main objects of our order, however, is teaching the principles of true Americanism to our people through the medium of the lodges. Eventually, the old timers, who are at the helm of our institution, will retire from active duty and younger element must carry on its policies.</p>
   <p>Let the young Italo-Americans belong to the best American clubs or societies, but let them not forget that no shame attaches to them for belonging to an association where they can commingle with people of their own blood, especially <span class="page-break">2</span>if through them and with them, individual and collective progress may be made and success acheived.</p>
   <p>Young Italo-Americans should consider it a sacred duty, honor, and privilege to belong to our organization which, besides the many business opportunities it offers, stands for the perpetuation of the best characteristics of our race and true Americanism.</p>
   <p>V. E. Ferrara, Supreme Treasurer.</p>
