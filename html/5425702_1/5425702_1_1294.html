   <p>The circolo Dante Alighieri has taken a new lease on life through the efforts of lawyer Alberto N. Gualamo, and an ambitious group of Italians. The Circolo will not be as in the past, a plaything of the Chicago Aristocracy, but will concern itself with spreading through the colony a better understanding of the language of Dante. The fees are $3.00 a year. Application for membership and payment of fees should be made to Lawyer Gualamo, 1208 Ashland Block, 59 N. Clark Street.</p>
