   <p>A notice to the Italians of the State of Illinois, by the Board of Education of this city and of other cities, stated that parents are obliged to send their children to a school, whether public or private, to learn the English language. If this obligation is not fulfilled by the parents, they will be subject to a fine of from three to twenty dollars.</p>
   <p>The truant officer, Mr. A. Mastrovalerio, has been visiting the Italian sections, advising the parents to send their children to school because it would be for their own benefit and for the benefit of the children later in life.</p>
