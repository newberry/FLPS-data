   <p>The group under the direction of the clever artist Minciotti, which has been giving performances at the Dante Theatre for the last three months, will terminate its Chicago engagement on next Sunday, the 23rd, with the presentation of "Othello."</p>
   <p>This will be given twice: at 4 and 8 P. M. The reserved seats are for sale at twenty-five and fifty cents.</p>
   <p>This newspaper is hoping for a full house, for it would be a fitting way to express appreciation of the exceptional performance and of the valiant artist Minciotti.</p>
