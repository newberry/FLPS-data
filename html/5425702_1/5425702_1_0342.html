   <p>The co-operative publishing company which is to print La Parola has been incorporated under the name of the Italian Labor Publishing Company.</p>
   <p>Last week we received our certificate of incorporation from the State of Illinois. The certificate has been registered in the recorder's office in Cook County.</p>
   <p>The administrative council, which will function for the term of one year, is composed of Dr. A. Molinari, president, C. Pellegrini, secretary, E. Matteoni, C. Bartalini, A. Ruffino, B. Ronchetta and G. Corti. It met last Thursday and passed a resolution to print five thousand copies of the corporation's charter. These are to be circulated among the readers of La Parola.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to issue five thousand shares of stock to sell to readers. It was further resolved to bond the cashier and the other officials, thus assuring the shareholders of the security of their funds.</p>

   <p>We have arrived at the point at which we operate without a deficit, and thanks to the coming picnic and the favorable financial results expected of it, it may be possible to have an operating fund in the treasury. We can therefore direct all our energies to propaganda instead of using our space for appeals for funds.</p>
   <p>Our paper has improved beyond all expectations in this last year.</p>
   <p>What it most needs at present is a salaried manager who can give all his time to the fight, which at present is carried on by a few part-time workers.</p>
   <p>Therefore, comrades, you are hereby advised that the co-operative is an accomplished fact and needs only capital in order to function. Forward!</p>
   <p>Corti.</p>
