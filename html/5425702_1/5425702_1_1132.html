   <p>Chicago,</p>
   <p>Sept. 9, 1899.</p>
   <p>My dear Editor of L'Italia:</p>
   <p>"I wish to announce in your paper that I am giving another concert for the final funds to set up the monument to the immortal Garibaldi.</p>
   <p>"The Presidents of all the Italian Societies residing here in Chicago are invited, and will deeply honor me if they attend the Committee Mass for this musical event.</p>
   <p>"I also invite M. G. Lifrien to accept the honorable duty as President of the Committee itself.</p>
   <p>"At my studio, Steinway Hall, I await the favor of the desired consorts, which I consider only as a pledge of a flattering success, and the sincerest manipulation of Loyal Patriotism.</p>
   <p>"I want you to accept this proof of my deep consideration, and please believe me, I am ever yours,</p>
   <p>Arturo Marescalchi."</p>
