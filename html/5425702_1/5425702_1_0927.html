   <p>In Popular Mechanics Magazine, we find illustrated a new system of rescue in shipwrecks. We were favorably impressed to learn that this invention is the work of a young Italian living in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The non-sinkable lifesaver, Zardi, as it is named, shows itself to be completely effective. In a marine disaster, the Zardi apparatus can save everything valuable to the passenger such as money, jewelry, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The inventor has already registered his patent at the Washington office. He is Mr. Fausto Zardinoni of Chicago, a very intelligent young man. He is preparing for his final exams as a mechanical engineer, thus completing the study he began in his native city, Venezia, as a student of the Sebastian Nautical Technical Institution.</p>
   <p>He is now preparing models of his lifesaver in the laboratory of the Electro-Maccanica at Gary, Indiana, and will soon attend a great public experiment on Lake Michigan.</p>
