   <p>The Italian Mission located at 567 West Taylor Street, is holding classes on the care and feeding of babies.</p>
   <p>The other day, three month old Salvatore Amidino was being bathed by the trained nurse, Miss Minnie Rettuke. Not being accustomed to baths in nice warm water, Salvatore yelled his disapproval at the top of his lungs. His mother's foreign mind formed the idea that the child was being killed and strenuously objected. If Italian mothers would feel the necessity of giving their babies a daily bath they would soon realize what benefits the child would derive from them.</p>
