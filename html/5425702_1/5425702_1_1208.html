   <p>We announce, with pleasure, that another choral society was added to the others now existing in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Those interviewed said:</p>
   <p>There are 30,000 Italians residing in Chicago. I believe they have not changed in the least for dwelling here; in fact, I am sure to find as many good singers here, as in Italy.</p>
   <p>The Society will be named "Verdi Choral Society", and will be composed of not only Italians, but also Americans who are interested in Italian music.</p>
   <p>At the invitation of Chal. Marescalchi, there are already twenty members.</p>
   <p>The Concert-work will begin immediately after the summer vacation.</p>
   <p>Chal. Marescalchi has our best wishes for a tremendous success.</p>
