   <p>Yesterday, at St. Luke's Hospital, Maestro Cleofonte Campanini died. Maestro Campanini was a celebrated interpreter of the Italian music and he deserves all the credit for the Chicago Opera Company becoming in a few years one of the most famous organizations of its kind.</p>
   <p>The death of Maestro Campanini deprives the world of one of the greatest directors of orchestra and of one of the renowned and genuine interpreters of the lyric operas of the past and present generations.</p>
   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, at the request of F. Bragno, president; J. Cannini and V. Formusa, vice-presidents; Comm. A. Lagoria, A. Ferrari, Dr. S. Monaco, U. Muggia, S. Gillette, L. Caravetta, trustees, held a special meeting and resolved to close the Chamber of Commerce's offices next Saturday, as a token of respect for the beloved Maestro Campanini, who was one of the greatest personalities of modern Italy.</p>
