   <p>Mr. F. Folco, of 2653 W. Madison Street, has written the following letter showing the generosity of the Italians during the collection of funds for the benefit of the American Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday in one of the streets of the 19th Ward, I noticed a group of soldiers, one of whom was shouting persuasive words for the contributions for the American Red Cross.</p>
   <p>This appeal was met with a shower of money and confetti,when the Italian flag passed under someone's window.</p>

   <p>I would also like to make honorable mention of Mr. J. M. Spagnuolo, a member of the Eleventh Infantry, who, with the cooperation of a group of Italian soldiers, collected $186.00 within one hour in the 18th Ward, which was given to the Central office of the Red Cross in the 19th Ward.</p>
   <p>The Italian colony by virtue of its generous contributions to the American Red Cross, is second in demonstration of patriotism to the United States.</p>
