The Italians of Kensington attended in large numbers, thus showing their interest and appreciation for the study of our language.</p>
   <p>The scholastic test in Italian passed by the pupils was very successful, and they demonstrated their skill in the declamation of Italian.</p>
   <p>A selected musical program was rendered by a band directed by Prof. A. J. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>De Grazia. Commendatore Dr. Carosi, Royal Consul General, in distributing medals awarded to the pupils who had distinguished themselves in these Italian classes, praised all the rewarded pupils. The Rev. G.

   <p>Prof. Pomante, Director of Italian Study, in his speech praised the Italo-American National Union, which had given its moral and financial support in order to make possible the teaching of the Italian language to the children of our race, who through knowing the language may appreciate more fully the glorious land of their fathers.</p>
   <p>In supporting financially the Italian schools in Kensington and in Rockford, Illinois, the Italo-American National Union has added another glorious page to its history.</p>
