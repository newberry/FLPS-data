   <p>Upon the invitation of Mr. Eugenio Sassi, inventor of a new type of aeroplane, prominent people of our colony have held a meeting for the purpose of investing in and commercializing this invention.</p>
   <p>In the meeting a great number of our countrymen were present, at which the inventor splendidly demonstrated his machine "Multiplane", illustrating a model of it.</p>
   <p>The demonstration was so convincing that everyone present applauded and promised to give their support in order that this, the first aeroplane of Italian invention may fly over America.</p>
