   <p>In the weekly bulletin published by the Board of Health, we find that during six months of this year, diptheria, scarlet fever, and measles have caused the people of Chicago a loss of another ten-million dollars, or over fifty-thousand dollars per day, to say nothing of the anxiety and despair that these disease-stricken families lived through.</p>
   <p>With regret, the health department issued these figures, making note that diptheria, scarlet fever and measles are sicknesses that are easily avoidable. And yet the public does little to prevent such diseases. The majority of the diptheria, scarlet fever, and measle cases have occurred in the fourth, fifth, eighth, eleventh, nineteenth, twenty-second and twenty-ninth wards, during the past six months.</p>
   <p>We believe it opportune to make the observation that the majority of the Italian Colony lives in one of the above mentioned wards.</p>
