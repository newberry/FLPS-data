   <p>The appeal of the Italian Women's Welfare Society to Italian and Americans for funds to help our needy countrymen has already shown results to the extent of $249.50.</p>
   <p>The Italian Consul Bolognesi, forwarded a twenty dollar check and promised to contribute forty dollars monthly for the fund; in fact, he has already sent ten dollars more.</p>
   <p>Dr. Volini has also offered a contribution of five dollars per month, and has already sent sixteen dollars for the first three months of the year.</p>
