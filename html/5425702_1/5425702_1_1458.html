   <p>The well-known poet and lecturer Gino Calza will be here next week to give a course of lectures on Dante, Carducci, D'Annunzio, and other distinguished Italian poets. May the charming and cultured lecturer attract an audience worthy of him and of his subjects! However, we doubt very much whether the Italian colony will duly honor our countryman by attending. Alas! Guglielino Ferrero had in Chicago an audience of fifty. More enthusiasm was manifested for Dorando Pietri's sturdy calves or for the powerful muscles of the Croatian Raicevich, who was consequently made an Italian citizen.</p>
   <p>When we have the pleasure of meeting Gino Calza we shall say to him: "Sir, after the splendid success which you attained in Latin-American countries, you will learn here that the Anglo-Saxons, the so-called modern Romans, are men superior to us in this respect: namely, that they have been able to Anglo-Saxonize the Italian immigrants.</p>
   <p>"Consequently, in the opinion of these Italo-Americans, lecturers, whether men of letters, poets, or historians, all belong in the museum.</p>

   <p>"In this country, in order to be honored, one must be a wrestler, a track-athlete, a foot-ball-player, or a banker, and in addition one must be an ignoramus.</p>
   <p>"Since you have none of these qualifactions, we fear that your financial reward will be meager."</p>
