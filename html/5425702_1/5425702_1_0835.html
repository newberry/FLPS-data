   <p>Dr. L. Bucaletti, after much research in his laboratory, at 140 N. State St., has brought to light many radical innovations in the scientific field of physic and cosmetic therapy.</p>
   <p>The various electric devices invented by him and constructed by expert electro-mechanical workers are considered by many eminent doctors as wonders for their esthetic as well as professional qualities.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to say that Dr. Bucaletti, to reach his goal, was compelled to undergo many moral struggles, but throughout his lectures and his writings he succeeded in breaking all prejudicial barriers.</p>

   <p>Business and professional men have joined with Dr. Bucaletti in organizing the Electro Therapeutic Apparatus Company, and we are certain that this corporation will have a big success.</p>
   <p>Demands for the new devices are coming, not only from the United States but also from Canada, Australia, China, and India.</p>
