   <p>We would like to report an article published by the New World, official organ of the Chicago Diocese:</p>
   <p>"The hand of the mother-land has reached out over the ocean, to help "Little Italy" of Chicago. Through the Italian Consul, Mr. Giulio Bolognesi, who was commissioned to distribute the money allocated by the Italian Government for the welfare of Chicago Italians, a free lodging house for unemployed Italians was opened this week.</p>
   <p>The lodging house, equipped to feed fifty people and shelter about thirty, is located next to the Columbus Extention Hospital, at Polk and Little Streets. The Sisters of the Sacred Hearts, who also manage the hospital, were placed in charge of it.</p>
   <p>"Since the coming of winter, the good Sisters have fed many poor Italians sent there by the Italian Consul. Such help would have been inadequate if the Sisters had not given their co-operation.</p>
   
   <p>"'This institution,' the Consul said, ' is more efficient than any other method, considering that in the lodging house thirty people can be sheltered every night.'</p>
   <p>"It is the first time, so far as we recollect, that a foreign government has founded a welfare institution for its people in a foreign land. And the benefits derived by such an institution are numerous.</p>
   <p>"The city of Chicago is relieved of the burden, and the Italians are keeping their independence and dignity by not being forced to mix in with the poor of other nationalities, and at the same time, their needs are better understood, because they are aided by their own countrymen."</p>
   <p>The kindly 'good morning' extended by the Sisters of the Columbus Extention Hospital to the poor unfortunates, goes straight to their hearts. And it is not only through pity but also because of a sentimental duty that the Sisters-also Italians-are assisting their countrymen.</p>
   <p>"Thus the poor Italian workers, materially assisted in this period of industrial crisis, are receiving moral, friendly aid and protection from their own countrymen."</p>
   
   <p>That was the article, and now for our comment:</p>
   <p>We do not want to be verbose in commenting on this little Diocesan article. We consider it right and to the point so far as the Diocese is concerned, for they must be grateful to the Italian Consul for the new benefits bestowed upon the clericals.</p>
   <p>But - last Saturday a group of ten of those sheltered inmates came to our office to protest that the treatment received in the "famous Lodging House" is not as reported in the press, the Diocesan press included. They claimed that the soup is bad and scanty. In it are cooked any kinds of entrails (sic). One of the men showed us a broken tooth caused by biting on a nail which he found in the monastic soup. They told us that all the left-overs from the hospital are served to the Shelter inmates, left-overs that leave the stomach emptier (sic) than before, because the "good Sisters" are measuring the bread with a rule. The inmates are compelled to sleep on the floor, because there are not enough beds.</p>
   <p>Besides, the "good Sisters" show partiality. They show preference for those who are frequently in Church to receive the Sacraments, and use certain methods of reprisal against those who do not [frequent the Church]. Last Saturday an inmate was sent away from the lodging house for that very reason. Besides, they are compelled to work without any compensation.</p>
   <p>Any other comment would still more darken the "good" and "beneficent" aureole [surrounding] the "good Sisters."</p>
   <p>We repeat that those [inmates who complained] were only about ten of the total poor people sheltered there. They came to us last Saturday, to protest against such treatment, and to make other complaints which we think best not to mention.</p>
