   <p>Republican Italian voters cannot better keep themselves and their countrymen in the United States than by organizing into political clubs. It is an old and true saying - that in Union there is Strength.</p>
   <p>There should be Republican Italian Clubs in all parts of the City, where an Italian population is to be found. Such Clubs not only bring men together who have common political-interests, but they also awaken a spirit of pleasure as well as practical benefit.</p>
   <p>These Clubs offer a rare opportunity to spread Republican principles. They constitute a sort of recruiting-station. It is the duty of every Republican to leave no stone unturned to increase the Republican vote this Fall.</p>
   <p>The return of the Republican Party to power means the reopening of mills and factories, the revival of business, and ample work and good wages for laboring <span class="page-break">\2</span>people. American-Italians are too deeply interested in this question to allow themselves to be inactive in such a struggle.</p>
   <p>Mr. Victor E. Maggi, who represents Col. DeVecchi, the general delegate of the Congressional Committee of Washington, D. C., is ready at any time to assist any of the Italians of this City or State in organizing Republican Clubs.</p>
   <p>His office is in Room 908, Tacoma Building, Northeast Corner LaSalle and Madison Streets.</p>
