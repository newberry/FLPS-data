   <p>Mr. Frank Caparelli, a school inspector and a friend of Mr. Farfaglia, informs us that on last Monday night at the reopening of the evening sessions of the Dante School, five hundred Italians enrolled in the English classes.</p>
   <p>We should be very thankful to the Reverend Dunne, because he has obtained a permit from the Board of Education which allows the Dante School to be used for this purpose.</p>
   <p>The Irish priests work among the Italians not to save them from sin, but through fear of losing fruitful clients. A dozen new churches have been built in Chicago for Italians under the care of Italian priests who pay the expenses by making collections among the Italians while the churches always remain as the archbishop's property. The Archdiocese has the best real estate office in the country.</p>
   
   <p>The poor Italians priests worry day and night trying to find a way to pay for their church.</p>
