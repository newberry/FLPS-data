   <p>The lists for the big forty mile bicycle race are already opened to the public, and will close at 10 P. M., June 22. As we mentioned in last Sunday's issue; the race will began at 10 A. M., Sunday June 29.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. Borzicchi, the president, notifies all Italian bicycle racers of Chicago, to be present with their bicycles at the North Italian Cycle Club, not later than June 28, or rather the day previous to the race, if they want its backing. There, each bicycle will be thoroughly examined and put into condition for the race.</p>
   <p>These precautions are taken so as to avoid any mishaps that may throw a rider out of the race, as has happened so many times, because of tire or machine defects.</p>
   <p>In the meantime all riders are warned not to loose even one day's rest, in order to assure themselves of the victory.</p>
