   <p>A real social event was the charity Dinner-Dance given by the Italian Woman's Club of Chicago, in the aristocratic Gold Room of the Congress Hotel.</p>
   <p>The best and most refined element of our colony was present, along with the Consul General and his wife.</p>
   <p>For the success of the evening, Mrs. Soravia, president of the Club, and the other officers, are worthy of praise.</p>
