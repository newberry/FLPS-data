   <p>The Republican organization of the First Ward, has celebrated the victory of Mr. Francis Brady, for his election as State Senator, with a banquet that took place at Central Hall at 22nd and Wabash Avenue. More than two hundred guests, among them many well known politicians, were present. Very expensive presents were given to Mr. Brady.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was the Judge Kavanaugh, who praised the political honesty of Mr. Brady. Then a first lieutenant, mutilated in the recent World War, spoke and he had words of great admiration for the Italians of the 19th Ward, that fought with him in the war, like lions. His speech received many cheers.</p>
   <p>Judge Barasa, delivered a great speech also, and he too, was applauded. His popularity is gaining ground every day. During the banquet, we had the opportunity to hear good music and songs through the generosity of Mr. James Colosimo.</p>
