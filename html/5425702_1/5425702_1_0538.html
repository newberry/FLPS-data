   <p>The Italo-American National Union, is a non-political association and it avoids politics, leaving its members free to follow any politicalcreed they choose.</p>
   <p>But today we cannot refrain from reminding all Italians by birth or parentage to stand united.</p>
   <p>April 10th is Election Day and various Italians are candidates for different offices. It is our duty to vote for them regardless of our party affiliations.</p>
   <p>The election of one Italian to any office is an honor and a protection for our people, because, he will have the opportunity to protect the Interests of our race.</p>
   <p>The Italian population of Chicago is large enough but it is not well represented in civic and state affairs.</p>
   <p>The fault lies in our lack of unity,</p>
   <p>We often complain against the newspapers for slandering our race and reputation. We try to protest, but we have not enough representatives, to help our protests.</p>
   <p>It is time to be united and elect all our countrymen who are candidates for office.</p>
   <p>One of those is our supreme president, Ex-Judge Bernard P. Barasa, who is a candidate for the Board of Review on the Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>There are other Italians, candidates on the Republican and Democratic tickets for different offices, and it is our duty to vote for everyone without any party discrimination.</p>
