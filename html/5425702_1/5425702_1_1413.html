   <p>To keep alive in the hearts of the Italian children, the love they should have toward Italy, a school for the teaching of the Italian language was opened on the west side, which is destined to be attended by a great number of students.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felice Bilotta, a teacher, was appointed as director of the school. Mr. Bilotta for several years has been busy keeping the culture of our idiom alive among the compatriots of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The school is located on the first floor of the building at 835 W. Taylor Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bilotta possesses all the necessary requirements to assure the success of this institution, and we are certain that the colony will help him achieve this success. There are also night-classes from 7 to 9 for adults.</p>
