   <p>Two wars have been declared, both in the interest of John D. Rockefeller and American capitalism.</p>
   <p>One is a war for the political and commercial supremacy of the "Oil King" and his friends, in Mexico: the other to crush the rebelling spirit of the slaves of the coal mines of Colorado which are owned by Rockefeller and his gang.</p>
   <p>While we are writing this editorial, the daily press of Chicago has many columns filled with material intended to stimulate the enthusiasm of the American working men for the conquest of Mexico.</p>
   <p>The incident of Tampico and other poor pretexts are mentioned in order to justify the expedition of the Army and Navy for the invasion of the neighbor republic.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At the same time, distorted and incomplete news is being published about the massacre of workers in Colorado.</p>
   <p>The last struggle of Ludlow, Colorado represents one of the vilest attempts against the life and liberty of the working class in the history of America.</p>
   <p>The pen can give only a slight idea of the outrages committed against unhappy women and children, whose only fault lies in belonging to men who do not want to live any longer, in slavery.</p>
   <p>Towns are burned, and miners' camps destroyed, without pity - in order to protect the profits of Mr. Rockefeller.</p>
   <p>Only a few weeks ago, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. arrogantly declared to the inquiring government commission that he and his father would spend every <span class="page-break">\3</span>cent of their great wealth to subdue the miners of Colorado into humble and obedient slaves.</p>
   <p>At the same time, agents paid by the Standard Oil Company have ingeniously manipulated the Mexican crisis to the point of inducing the American Government to agree to armed intervention for the protection of American interests in Mexico.</p>
   <p>The capitalist class was successful in its aim.</p>
   <p>The war has upset the minds of the American people. While their attention is drawn to the military and naval activities in Vera Cruz, Rockefeller's agents are carrying out the criminal plan voiced by young Rockefeller.</p>
   <p>The dreadful side of these current events is that American workers are compelled to fight on foreign land to protect the interests of Rockefeller, <span class="page-break">\4</span>while he in turn kills the workers who are struggling in the Colorado mines for a piece of less bitter bread.</p>
   <p>From all these happenings, we conclude that the working class is going through the greatest crisis in its history.</p>
   <p>We from the Parola will try hard to perform our duty - in urging, enlightening, and informing our readers of the horrible schemes plotted by the capitalists against the working class, which class has the right and the duty to protest vigorously and to organize in order to receive and to protect the right value for its labors.</p>
