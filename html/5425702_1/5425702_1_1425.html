   <p>The meeting of January 25th of the local section of the Dante Alighieri Association gave to our community an evening of intellectual enjoyment and the select people who were present demonstrated their appreciation of the cultural achievements of this association.</p>
   <p>On this occasion the association offered to the Royal Consul-General, Dr. Carosi, a parchment with the signature of all its members.</p>
   <p>Then the dramatic club of the association presented a sketch, "La Partita A Scacchi," by Giacosa, which was skillfully performed.</p>
   <p>But we enjoyed most the lecture delivered by Dr. S. Ingrao, to whom had given the task of commenting on the fourth canto of the Inferno in Dantes' "Divina Commedia."</p>

   <p>It is impossible for us to mention the treasures of erudition which Dr. Ingrao poured out in his lecture.</p>
   <p>He was complimented by the audience and all had words of praise for the doctor, who revealed himself a learned lecturer.</p>
   <p>The profound lecture by Dr. Ingrao, besides showing the broad culture of the eminent speaker, was a good indication of the prestige of the Italo-American National Union, of which Dr. Ingrao is the medical director.</p>
