   <p>This strike has lasted fifteen weeks.</p>
   <p>The workers now have a better chance of winning.</p>
   <p>The number of scabs is small compared to the number of vacant jobs.</p>
   <p>The owners have already lost millions of dollars in consequence of the inactivity in the month of December, which for them is the most lucrative time of the year.</p>
   <p>Today, they anticipate an equal loss if the strike continues through the spring season.</p>
   <p>The workers intend to prolong the strike until the owners adopt the closed-shop system.</p>
   <p>The Italians among the strikers amount to three thousand.</p>
