   <p>The concert given by Prof. Arcongeli, at the Blackstone Theatre for the benefit of the Italian Red Cross, netted a profit of $135.00, which has already been given to the local committee of that organization.</p>
   <p>The great success of this concert is an honor to Prof. Arcongeli and to his singing school.</p>
