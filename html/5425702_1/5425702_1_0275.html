   <p>For the last three days the strike of the workers in the Italian macaroni factories has been in progress. Yesterday the Italian Macaroni Manufacturers Association, of which Mr. L. Carvetta, Viviano Bros., Matalone Bros., A. Moriei, Varco Bros., and others are members, held a meeting to take the necessary steps to meet the present situation.</p>
   <p>The manufacturers will not recognize the present workers' union, until they are regularly organized, and officially recognized by all other American unions. They refuse to give the strikers any concessions.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, a meeting of all the macaroni workers were called August 2, in the Masonic Temple. This meeting was held for the purpose of forming among themselves, an association for the protection of their products, grievously threatened by the American capitalists, Armour &amp; Company, Morris &amp; Company, and so forth, who are dispersing all over American, free of charge, canned macaroni as samples, thus harming the Italian industry which produces a much better quality.</p>
