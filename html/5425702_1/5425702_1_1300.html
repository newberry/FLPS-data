   <p>We beg our friends and comrades to wait patiently for the catalogue of our social library. Many of the books are out of circulation. The Co-operativa Editrice of the newspaper"Avanti!" of Milan, has notified us that a quantity of literary material was sent to us by mail toward the end of last May.</p>
   <p>As soon as this invoice has been received, we shall announce the new list of publications in our columns.</p>
