   <p>L'Italia, the notorious newspaper published by Oscar Durante, which has always betrayed the laboring class and sold itself to the bosses, especially in times of strike, now is trying to abuse the credulity of some retailers by claiming to be unionist.</p>
   <p>Our comrades and sympathizers will do well to warn those newsboys on whose stands L'Italia is being sold that the only Italian unionist paper in Chicago is La Parola dei Socialist.</p>
