   <p>On the evening of July 4th, the Italians of this city and outlying cities gathered at Soldiers' Field to participate in the Military Tournament. This day marked the close of the tournaments and was assigned to the Italians by Gen. Parker as Italian night. The entire evening was a great success and every one was thrilled by the spectacular stunts. Airplanes performed the most perfect formations and daring loops while the cavalry, artillery, and infantry did their charging, battle formations and light skirmishes in perfect and timed order.</p>
   <p>All Italian societies and clubs were present in celebrating the Washington Bicentennial; amongst the foremost the Order Sons of Italy, the Italian Post of the American Legion, under the direction of its Commander Lieut. Butera, Italo-American National Union, Garibaldi League, the Ricigliano Society, and many others.</p>

   <p>The misses of the Italian Women's Club danced in true fashion the Tarantella and it was so gracefully executed that it drew much admiration from the spectators especially Governor Emmerson and Admiral Crosley.</p>
   <p>The most enthusastic moment of the evening came with the rising of the Italian and American flags which brought all the spectators en masse to their feet cheering loudly. At the close of the tournament a great display of fireworks went into play through which could be plainly seen the portraits of Washington, H. M. the King of Italy, and H. E. Benito Mussolini.</p>
   <p>Every part of the show was well performed, and spectators were well pleased with the whole affair. Made possible through the initiative of our esteemed Consul Chev. Uff. Dr. G. Castruccio, the Italians of this city can well be proud of this Italian night.</p>
