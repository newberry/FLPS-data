   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Even more than in years past the condition of our countrymen is now very sad. To the usual seasonal unemployment of the winter are now added many lockouts and distressing financial conditions caused by the World War.</p>
   <p>This consulate is doing its utmost to assist the wretched and the forlorn among Italian immigrants, but its resources are not sufficient to cope with the need.</p>
   <p>I believe that it is only proper that the numerous Italian colony of Chicago should be interested in the relief of its own brothers, particularly in this hour of tribulation.</p>
   
   <p>Therefore, through your esteemed paper, I am urging all my countrymen to contribute to this humanitarian task by sending me their offerings. This will enable me to relieve much poverty and great privation either directly or through existing charitable institutions, Italian or American.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>The Royal Consul,</p>
   <p>Bolognesi.</p>
   <p>Editor's note.- We believe that this philanthropic appeal might arouse much sympathy in our colony if our consul would specify the mediums through which he intends to use these collected funds.</p>
   
   <p>A year ago he simply placed them in the hands of the nuns of the more-or-less Sacred Heart, who, according to the general practice of the Catholic Church, used even those funds for their dismal religious propaganda.</p>
   <p>Let the royal consul declare, whether in the course of a year his attitude has become secular or has remained cloistral.</p>
