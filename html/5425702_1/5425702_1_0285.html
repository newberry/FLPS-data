   <p>On the other hand, the companies are still most contemptibly attempting to break the strike. For instance, they called the working men to the factories for their tools. But when the workers arrived, the managers avoided the subject of tools, and reverted to their usual talk on the generous and important concessions they would grant whenever the workers returned to their jobs.</p>
