   <p>For the first time tomorrow, all ten Italian Societies of the city, eight civil and two military, will unite for a parade, with ten flags representing the ten societies and the American flag next to each of the ten flags. This is real patriotism--one day of unity and peace. Let us all take part in this great event and parade through the city together with the societies.</p>
