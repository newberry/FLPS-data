   <p>The condition of the strike is stationary, and the spirit of loyalty prevails among the printers locked out and the striking retailers, stereotypists, distributors, and drivers.</p>
   <p>Scab retailers and truck-drivers continue to present an odious spectacle, circulating on trucks or standing on street corners, each protected by two policemen.</p>
   <p>Blows of policemen's clubs continue to rain, although more rarely, upon the headsof private citizens who wish to aid the printers and upon harmless union retailers.</p>
   <p>Printed by scabs, newspapers manage to appear rather more regularly. However, a large portion of the public is boycotting them, reading instead the World, the Socialist,and La Parola.</p>
   <p>The opposite stand is taken by Typographical Union No. 16, which is against a sympathetic strike of all printers employed by the dailies affected by the strike and the lockout.</p>

   <p>It should be noted that a complete standstill of the newspaper industry would have forced the press trust to make a better agreement. But the selfish spirit of Lynch and his followers has made the situation still more critical.</p>
   <p>Something more than a labor contract is involved in this struggle, namely, the right to organize.</p>
   <p>If the owners succeed now in disbanding the pressmen's union, other unions of workingmen will also be disbanded.</p>
   <p>However, this struggle between capital and labor may be so terminated, and thus once more the superiority of the industrial organization to craft unionism will be demonstrated.</p>
   <p>The blow aimed at the pressmen would have been easily parried if the entire typographical industry had been united in a single formidable union instead of being divided into so many minor industries: linotypists, stereotypists, compositors, pressmen, packers, set-up men, distributors, criers, etc.</p>
