   <p>The performance of the Grand Opera, "La Boheme," announced by the Italo-American National Union in behalf of the proposed Italian House Center, as was forseen, has an imposing success and has proved once again that the Italian colony of Chicago is always ready to encourage the patriotic and useful initiatives of our organization.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Civic Opera House was crowded to capacity by the best element of our community and by American lovers of good music, who were anxious to hear the young soprano, Vivian Della Chiesa, who for the first time presented herself to the public in the role of "Mimi", in that opera by Puccini.</p>
   <p>Other roles were taken by Armand Tokatyan, Giacomo Rimini, George <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Cehanovsky, Lola Fletcher, Vittorio Trevisan, Giuseppe Cavadore, Teodor Lovich, Maestro Roberto Moranzoni was the director.</p>
   <p>Vivan Della Chiesa, well known to the American public through her radio broadcasts over N.B.C. stations, was well received and applauded by the audience.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to say that the success attained by this notable singer was a just compensation for her strenuous work, and that the performance marked her ascension among the stars of the lyric theater.</p>
   <p>In the intermission between the second and third acts, our Supreme President, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Philip D'Andrea, chairman of the committee, thanked the artists, the director of the Chicago Civic Opera, and all the spectators. He paid a special tribute to the Royal Italian Consul, who was present with the officers of the Consulate, and with officials of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>At the end he gave a beautiful bouquet of flowers to Miss Vivian Della Chiesa.</p>
   <p>The evening artistically and financially was a great success. The net profit will greatly increase the funds for the erection of the Italian House Community Center, which is our goal.</p>
