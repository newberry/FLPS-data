   <p>We have before us a report issued by the Pasteur Anti-Rabies Institute, located at 65 Randolph Street. The director is Dr. A. Lagorio. More than three-hundred patients have taken advantage of this Institute since it was first formed. Only one died and that because he came for treatment a month after he had been bitten. We cannot feel too highly the honor bestowed on the Italian Colony through the efforts of our compatriot, Dr. Lagorio.</p>
