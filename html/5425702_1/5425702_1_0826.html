   <p>E. N. - Prof. Emilo Amelotti of Chicago University, in graciously accepting an invitation to write for the Bulletin, has rendered an invaluable service if the Order has the very important task of contributing to the fostering of the mental education of its members.</p>
   <p>His articles, treating subjects of general interest, should especially appeal to the ever increasing number of college boys and girls who everyday join us.</p>
   <p>Being part and parcel of the new generation of Italo- Americans, upon whom depend the future of our Order and the prestige of our race, Prof. Amelotti's efforts are primarily directed to them and he expects a cordial response.</p>
   <p>The editor, in tendering to Prof. Amelotti sincere thanks, hopes that his articles not only meet with the approval of our readers but that they may prove to be an incentive to others to follow on the trail he has blazed.</p>
