   <p>Miss Victoria Gazzola, a student of the North Division High School, has received the first prize of $50.00 for having the highest average in her studies.</p>
   <p>Miss Gazzolo no doubt deserves this honor, and we wish other Italian boys and girls to be encouraged by Miss Gazzolo's efforts, to do the same.</p>
   <p>Miss Gazzolo, incidentally, has a sister, Editha, who is a student at Hayes School, with a superior average.</p>
