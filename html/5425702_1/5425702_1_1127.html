   <p>A very refined public, Italian and American, crowded the Kimball Hall, in the afternoon to attend the first annual concert, given by the Italian Orchestra, directed by the distinguished maestro, G. Vecchione.</p>
   <p>Many ladies and gentlemen, attracted by the reputation of said orchestra were present and had the opportunity of admiring the musical and artistic qualities of Maestro Vecchione and his orchestra. Everyone can enjoy such concerts offered during the year free of charge, if he is willing to subscribe $3 annually.</p>
   <p>Under the able direction of Maestro Vecchione the orchestra played the "Stabat Mater" by Rossini, the "Mercadante Overture" and the "Marcia a Savoia; the "Reverie," the "Gavotta," and the "Overture" (by Maestro Vechhione), with skill and very fine artistic feeling.</p>
   <p>The Italian Orchestra is an institution organized by Mr. Vecchione in the interest of the Italian arts and our colony should be proud of it and should help and encourage financially and morally such an institution which honors the Italians and Italy.</p>
