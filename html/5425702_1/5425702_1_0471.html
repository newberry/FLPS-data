   <p>The annual picnic of the Socialist party of Chicago will be held in Riverview Park on June 15. It is expected that twelve nationalities will be included in the crowd.</p>
   <p>The committee is working assiduously to insure the success of the affair. Among the speakers will be Eugene Debs, Seymour Stedman, and the Secretary of the United Mine Workers' Union.</p>
   <p>Many games and sports are being planned for the day. Will the Italian group be well represented? We hope so.</p>
   <p>In a few days the Italian committee will send tickets to the readers of La Parola in Chicago, and we hope that all will asist in selling them.</p>

   <p>At the first annual picnic the attendance was nineteen thousand, at the second, thirty four thousand, at the third, fifty five thousand, and we expect it to reach one hundred thousand this year. The existence of our Socialist newspapers depends largely on the proceeds of this picnic.</p>
