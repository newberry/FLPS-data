   <p>The demonstration organized by the Italo-American National Union at the Chicago Civic Opera, last November 15, for an Italian Center in Chicago, could not have had a better success.</p>
   <p>A large audience accepted enthusiastically the special performance of Boheme and the debut of Miss Vivian Dellachiesa in the role of "Mimi."</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Italo-American National Union which exerted itself laudably for the happy accomplishment of the much desired Italian Center in our city.</p>
