   <p>The Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago, resolved to send the following circular, which we give for the benefit of our readers to the Italian press:</p>
   <p>"Countrymen!- The Italian Chamber of Commerce of Chicago on the occasion of the opening in this city of the Banco di Napoli Agency, takes the liberty of turning to our countrymen and recommending to them an institution purely Italian, which has to its credit centuries of existence because of its honesty.</p>
   <p>"The Banco di Napoli, must be considered as an institution, which gives a most valid guarantee to its customers for any amount deposited, and the quickest and surest means between America and Italy for those who send any amount of money to their parents, or to the brothers who are fighting on the bloody Piave.</p>
   
   <p>"The Banco di Napoli was founded in the year 1539, and has at present 52 branches as well as representative in every large city all over the world.</p>
   <p>"The Chamber of Commerce is duty bound to help and recommend Italian institutions which assure confidency in their clients, and therefore urge all Italians to patronize, for their interest, the Banco di Napoli Agency."</p>
