   <p>p. 1 - We have learned that the doctors of our community are discussing the possibilities of uniting. They intend to form a society having as its purpose to serve faithfully and to the best of its ability our countrymen in Chicago. They intend having a board of twelve officers and will hold meetings once a month regularly.</p>
   <p>These are very high sounding words we are being given by the doctors. We only hope the ideals behind these words are equally high. We must admit, though, that such an organization will be of advantage to the doctors because they will be strengthened materially.</p>
