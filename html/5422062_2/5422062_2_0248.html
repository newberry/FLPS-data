   <p>Some time ago an attempt was made to reorganize the regular Greek-American Democratic organization so that all the Wards be represented in the organization with influential individuals who will take care of the members of their Ward cooperating with the regular Democratic Headquarters.</p>
   <p>The following Wards have been organized and are represented by Mr. George Polos, of the Eighth Ward; Mr. Bill Buramas, of the Fifth Ward; Mr. George Prasinos of Forty-Ninth Ward; Mr. Gust Psalidas, of the Thirty-eighth Ward; Mr. John Lapas [Ladas], of Forty-Fifth Ward and Pete Aneson, of the Thirtieth Ward.</p>
   <p>In a few days we will have the names of the organizers of the representatives of the other Wards so all will be represented in the central organization of the regular Greek-American Democratic organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Mr. Gust Psalidas is the organizer of this political center who is trying to perfect this reorganization, to avoid the mistakes of the past when the political discord in the Greek Community held back the organization.</p>
