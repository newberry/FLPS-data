   <p>The general meeting of the Greek Political Club of Chicago was a great success. It was held last Sunday in the Athenian Hall at Blue Island Avenue and Polk Street. Greeks are obviously anxious to acquaint themselves with their political rights.</p>
   <p>Dr. C. Kaliontzis gave a very fine speech, in which he clearly pointed out the program and purposes of this club. He aroused the enthusiasm of his audience to such an extent that many persons applied for membership at the close of the meeting.</p>
   <p>It is planned to have many American lawyers and judges present at the next meeting, which will be held next Sunday afternoon. Mr. Thomas Hutchison, the president, has received many letters from all parts of America asking how similar organizations may be formed in other cities.</p>

   <p>This is a good sign; it indicates that Greek people are awakening to their privileges and duties as American citizens.</p>
