   <p>As President of the American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago, Attorney for the Greek Restaurant Keepers' Association and Executive Secretary of the Pan-Greek-American Political Club of Cook County, I wish to protest against the report which appeared on the front page in today's Tribune, of the so-called "Greek-American Loyalist League", condemning the elections held in Greece yesterday". I wish to state that this group is not representative and it is the same small group which is trying to bring back to Greece, Constantine and his German wife, the sister of the former Kaiser, who attempted to deliver the Greek nation hand and baggage to the Germans, the Turks and the Bulgarians.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago have always publicly declared their sentiment in favor of Venizelos and particularly at a public meeting about two weeks ago held in this city, of representatives of all societies, associations and other Greek organizations; and have wired to the Greek government their confidence in Venizelos and his policies.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos.</p>
