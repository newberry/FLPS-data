   <p>p. 1 - We must once again bring to attention that the professionals of Chicago have decided to organize a political and patriotic society. If the professional men of our city cannot unite and form an organization of some sort for the benefit of the entire community, who will do it? the workers? No! It must be the professional men. Where are the twelve men who are going to be the leaders of Chicago? Have we no leaders or are they merely asleep? Our guess is that they are all lazy, and so, another grand idea will disappear into thin air as a bubble does.</p>
   <p>We were filled with joy when we heard that the professional men were going to become organized. We thought, "Here are men who will see the thing through. They will not bicker and quarrel because they are educated, enlightened men. We can expect the best of them." For once, we were wrong in our judgment. These men are as humanly Greek as the rest of us. It is too bad! We all had high hopes of a much needed society in Chicago, but the thing does not seem possible. Let's not give up hope, though. An opportunity may come again.</p>
