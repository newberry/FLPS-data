   <p>The Greek community of Gary, Indiana, after long deliberation has approved of the design of the Chicago Greek architect, Mr. N. Dokos, who with other architects complied with the request of the Gary community to submit plans for a Greek church. The building of St. Constantines church began last week, and the expenditure will exceed $45,000.</p>
   <p>Agents of the community are in Chicago in search of an interior decorator. Undoubtedly the Gary Greek community will find the proper person, for Chicago has an abundance of talent, native and otherwise.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dokos, the Greek architect of Chicago, is known far and wide for his ability in this class of building. Many churches and schools in many states have been designed by him. His art is based upon purely Greek models.</p>
