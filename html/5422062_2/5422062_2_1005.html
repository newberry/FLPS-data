   <p>The President of the United States has again addressed the American people by radio. He outlined the problems confronting the nation--and himself as its leader--and he explained the measures he has proposed.</p>
   <p>The attitude of this man convinces even his enemies that he is entirely sincere, and that whatever he does is for the common good. This President and his awareness of the needs of the people are something new in the American scene. Despite the attacks and accusations of some newspapers, he shows no signs of weakening. And there is no truth whatever in the charge that he is seeking to become a dictator.</p>
   <p>On the contrary, his policies reveal a socialistic trend. Each new decision or plan has been made with the benefit of the masses of the people in mind. The people have faith in their President, and they are sure that he is aware of all the subversive forces that are seeking to defraud them of their human rights.</p>
   <p>The opponents of the President are like the conservative Social Democrats in Germany. If we are neglected and left to find, unaided, the solution of our problems, we shall create a Hitler. Roosevelt knows this, and so he is earnestly trying to help the people out of the economic morass into which they have been led. If the conservatives do not shout as loudly as they would like to, it is because they sense the strong antipathy of the people.</p>
