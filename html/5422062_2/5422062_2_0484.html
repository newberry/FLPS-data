   <p>The youthful George Thomas and his sister, Danaes, attired in colorful Greek National costumes, approached the guest of honor holding two beautiful bouquets in their hands.</p>
   <p>Owing to the smallness of their stature, they were lifted and set upon the banquet table amidst the cheering of the whole crowd. Mr. Cermak bowing, accepted the flowers of the Greeks, which the youngsters offered.</p>
