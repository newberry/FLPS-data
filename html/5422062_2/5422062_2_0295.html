   <p>Senator Irving L. Lenroot of Wisconsin is the next representative of the Coolidge administration to come to Chicago and speak for Senator William B. McKinley's renomination by the Republicans of Illinois as a friend and supporter of President Coolidge. Senator Lenroot is announced as the principal speaker at a banquet at the Hotel La Salle Sunday night in honor of Senator McKinley. The Greek-American Republican Club of Cook County is giving the banquet. Senator McKinley is expected to reach Chicago from Washington with Senator Lenroot, Sunday morning.</p>
   <p>Attorney Paul Demos, president of the club, is chairman of the committee on arrangements and Peter S. Lambras, editor of the Greek Star, is actively interested. Mr. Lambros said today there were 20,000 Greek stores in Illinois and upward of 50,000 Greek votes. Most of the Greek leaders are behind Senator McKinley, and they predict he will get the votes of practically all the Greeks in Illinois. More than 1,000 plates will be laid at Sunday night's banquet, at which Mr. Demos will be toastmaster and, in addition to Senators Lenroot and McKinley, Miss Harriet Vittum, Mr. Lambros, Felix J. Streyckmans, Edward J. Hess, and John R. Palandech will speak.</p>
