   <p>What promises to become the most comprehensive movement in re-aligning the voting power of the numerically superior Greek element in the 27th and 20th Wards, has been under way for quite a while now by the "Hellenic Center" an organization aiming at all of the above, and more widespread educational program on behalf of the voters of Greek extraction.</p>
   <p>The leaders of this movement are Mr. A. A. Pantelis, and Mr. Peter Agriostathes in the 20th Ward, and Mr. Paul Kare in the 27th; all three of them having been associated with local politics for a number of years, and each one known to be in close contact with the political problems affecting the aforementioned near West Side territories.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Already this movement has won the approval and cooperation of practically all the important factors in the Greek community around Halsted Street, Blue Island avenue, and Harrison Streets; so that it is presumed that in the coming election the "Hellenic Center" adherents will play a most important role in both the 20th and 27th Wards.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paul Kare, who is active mostly in the 27th Ward has assured the writer that through his end of activities in the "Hellenic Center" movement, many Greek-American voters who formerly were lost through ineffective channels or who never cared to vote before, are now gaining a new understanding of their suffrage privileges and duties, and that from now on they will use their ballot to the benefit to the city and their own individual Ward.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pantelis on the other hand has marshalled his forces in the 20th Ward, and he too is confident that the Greek-American voter is getting a "new deal" and that from now on the thousands of Greek voters in Chicago will count in all elections.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pantelis is a Veteran in the game of politics, and his knowledge of the problems affecting city administration affairs make him well qualified to <span class="page-break">3</span>speak in an authoritative manner on this subject.</p>
   <p>The "Hellenic Center" movement is fast spreading to other parts of the city and the county. Its main purpose as we hinted above is educational and as we all know how impressive it is for the people to know and digest the real issues of this and subsequent campaigns, one cannot but feel that the sponsors of this organization are doing a notable service to the city and nation as well.</p>
   <p>Judging from the hundreds of new members who are enrolling under the flag of the "Hellenic Center" there is no question that in the next few weeks the twelve hundred members already in the books will be doubled.</p>
   <p>As part of its program for arousing the interest of the voters, "Hellenic Center" contemplates organizing a series of mass meetings, banquets and rallies on behalf of the Democratic candidates, both national and local, all of whom have been endorsed by this great Organization.</p>
   <p>Readers of this newspaper should watch these columns for further announcements relative to the great work of re-organization under food by the "Hellenic Center" in the center of things Hellenic.</p>
