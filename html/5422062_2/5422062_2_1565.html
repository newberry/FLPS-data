   <p>Last week we visited one of the newest and most modern restaurants in Chicago. It is a new restaurant opened by L. Housakos and S. Manos at 1411 North Clark St. C. E. Rechinger Co. represented by P. Mounoreas, designed and furnished this unusual restaurant. We wish Messrs. Housakos and Manos the best of luck in their new enterprise.</p>
