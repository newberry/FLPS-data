   <p>Fifty thousand registered Republicans, representing voters in every county of the State, have signed the petition of Fred E. Sterling, State chairman, who is candidate for the office of State treasurer.</p>
   <p>This was made known to-day by friends of the State chairman, who are working hard for his candidacy.</p>
   <p>The law requires that not less than 1,000 signatures shall be attached to the petition filed, and not more than 2,000 names may be on it. At the beginning of the Sterling campaign various friends secured primary petition blanks, and 2,000 of them, each containing twenty-five names, have been returned to the candidate.</p>

   <p>Not more than eighty of the filled-in petition forms may be filed with the secretary.</p>
   <p>"Approximately 1,000 of our people have signed pledge cards signifying their willingness to extend to you their enthusiastic and earnest support for the office of United States Senator from Illinois," Mr. Lambros's letter to Mr. Mc Cormick reads in part.</p>
