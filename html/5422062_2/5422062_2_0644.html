   <p>The United States Congress has just passed the new order of general military mobilization introduced by the Secretary of War, Mr. Newton Baker. By this law all males in the United States between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, inclusive, are called to the colors.</p>
   <p>According to the provisions of this new law, those residing in this country must register with the local boards, the ones to which they have easiest access.</p>
   <p>In registering, all potential recruits must be truthful, sincere, and real men. They are under obligation to show that they are law-abiding, loyal, and patriotic Americans, united under the same flag and co-operating in a common cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>America expects every citizen, every man and woman in this country, regardless of nationality, creed, race, or color, to do his or her part in performing the duty and service assigned to them by the Government of the United States. In this way we are keeping faith with our obligations not only to America, but to humanity in general, for whose rights and ideals we must contribute our share.</p>
   <p>There are three reasons why we, the Greek people in Chicago, and in America in general, should respond to America's call to arms:</p>
   <p>1. We are under the sacred obligation to defend and protect the honor and security of our great adopted country, our own country, and, consequently, the safety and happiness of our homes, families, friends, and fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>2. Our own personal sense of responsibility and honor demands that we do our utmost for a common, national cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>3. We must obey the laws of the country, especially in the present circumstances when America is in the midst of a great war.</p>
   <p>We must remember that the newly enacted conscription and mobilization act makes every allowance in regard to justifiable exemptions from service. On the other hand, however, the law is an inexorable one and must be obeyed when it commands the people to conform to it. May we remind the members of our own community in Chicago, particularly those who are affected by the law in question, that it is both unwise and treasonable to try to evade it by any false means.</p>
   <p>We must, if we are real men, disavow any materialistic and selfish interest and thought during this critical period in our national history. We must disabuse our minds and thoughts of any and all depraved and unworthy ideas and plans to advance or support any unpatriotic undertaking that might be harmful to our cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Our minds and thoughts must be occupied with only one thought, namely, the ethical, honorable, and patriotic intention of doing what our country and laws command us to do. In this way, both our honor and our material welfare and interests will be pre-eminently served. We wish to place particular emphasis on this, for it is comparatively easy to recover any material loss, but, on the contrary, when one loses his honor, nothing can be done to repair the loss. Not even wealth could help us, for it is entirely useless without honor. We have many examples verifying this. We have seen a great many rich men despised and dishonored, while on the contrary, we know of many poor ones who are honored and highly esteemed.</p>
   <p>Our great forefathers said: "Many have refused riches and wealth, but none honor, glory, and a good name."</p>
   <p>These are the many reasons why we should do what is expected of us in regard to the above-mentioned obligations and admonitions. After all, our own interest imposes on us the duty to exert all our efforts, together with our <span class="page-break">5</span>fellow Americans, in bringing this disastrous war, in which our nation is engaged, to a victorious conclusion. Is it not well known that the prolongation of this war will be disastrous to our national economic life, and to the world in general?</p>
   <p>The prolongation of the war is both favorable and advantageous to our enemy, the autocratic and absolutist Central Empires, who, undoubtedly, know that they are beaten, but desire to see the day of their final doom and downfall as far removed as possible. This is not the case with us, however, for we are the most powerful and the richest nation on earth; in addition, we are fighting for a just cause and this fact is in itself a great weapon. We are struggling to preserve humanity's rights to justice, liberty, peace, and civilization. We are confident that our victory is assured.</p>
   <p>At this time, we must not expose ourselves to danger and possible defeat because of thoughtlessness, serious errors, blunders, and negligence. If we <span class="page-break">6</span>do so, we will see the tables reversed and, to our surprise, we will see Satan, barbarism, and a new period of darkness reigning throughout the world. The works of the devil and his will, will convince us, belatedly, that the last error was worse than the first one.</p>
   <p>There is an inescapable need, then, for us to faithfully abide by the suggestions and accept the advice which we are offering. Through our actions and through our deeds we shall prove how superficial and stupid some representatives of foreign nationalities in Chicago were, when they sought to defame and bring disrepute to the Greeks of Chicago, and even to the Greeks of the entire United States, as being men without a country and without any desire to serve in the armed forces of the United States.</p>
   <p>So, let us all bear firmly in mind the immortal bequest of our ancestors: "The country is to be honored, revered, and loved even more than our father, mother, ancestors, or anything and anyone else."</p>
   <p>Let this be our sacred symbol and inspiration, and let us prove by our deeds <span class="page-break">7</span>that we abide by it.</p>
