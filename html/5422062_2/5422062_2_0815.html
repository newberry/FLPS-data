   <p>Any American who doubted the patriotism of the Greek people, had his doubts dispelled when the results of the First Liberty Loan were published. It was evident that the Greeks had supported the Loan to the best of their financial ability. Now, in the present Liberty Loan drive, the Greek people are preparing to outdistance all other foreign groups in Chicago. They will subscribe to the fullest extent of their powers, and surely that is as much as any one can do. This is a fine opportunity for the Greeks to show their patriotism.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago are going to purchase these bonds because they are safe investments, and because, they want to show that they are not excelled by any other foreign group in Chicago in their devotion to America.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki recommends that every Greek should purchase at least one or two <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>bonds--more if possible--for which he will receive interest at the rate of four per cent yearly. These bonds can be sold and can be used as collateral on loans. Their possession is a mark of patriotism, and a lack of them is practically unforgivable.</p>
