   <p>The Greeks in Chicago are noted for their many splendid restaurants. One of these is the Union Restaurant in the Loop on Randolph St. It is owned by J. Rodopoulos. In order to further his business, this prominent Greek has rented the first floor for dancing. He has installed a $30,000 organ there. The second floor which is the restaurant has been re-decorated in the popular French style. We know Mr. Rodopoulos will go far in this new enterprise.</p>
