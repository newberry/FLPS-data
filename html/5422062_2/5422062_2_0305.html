   <p>My dear Doctor:</p>
   <p>I feel very proud as Chairman of the Coolidge-Dawes Greek-American Republican Club, to thank and congratulate you for all the precious and great services rendered by you personally, as well as through the Greek newspaper, Saloniki, in the last Presidential Campaign.</p>
   <p>The victory and the election of our candidates is the best reward for our work, and proof that the advice we gave our countrymen to vote for the Republican candidates, was the successful interpretation of the opinion and the confidence of our Country.</p>
   
   <p>Let us try to be, as always, united and interested in the good of our Country.</p>
   <p>Many congratulations for your glorious victory, I remain,</p>
   <p>Yours friendly,</p>
   <p>C. A. Paleologos Mammon,</p>
   <p>Chairman.</p>
