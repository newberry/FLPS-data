   <p>To the Members of the Achaian League:</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of The Achaian League has endorsed and recommends to its members Mr. George F. Mulligan, Democratic Candidate for Judge of the Municipal Court.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mulligan was one of the founders of The Achaian League and has been one of its strongest supporters since its inception in 1910.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Hellenes of Chicago owe to Mr. Mulligan their loyal support as he has at all times been our friend.</p>
   
   <p>The Primary Election will be held on next Tuesday, April 13th, and it is suggested that you ask for a Democratic ballot and vote for George F. Mulligan, whose name will be found under the heading "Associate Judges of the Municipal Court." It is also suggested that you ask your friends to do the same.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Attest:</p>
   <p>George Ligdas,</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
   <p>The Achaian League,</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis,</p>
   <p>President.</p>
