   <p>The failure of Greek merchants as a whole is due mainly to ignorance of the use of figures. Everything else can be used in many different ways to suit the one's desire, but figures have a definite place in which they belong under all circumstances, without change.</p>
   <p>Greek merchants know how to add up profits, but they do not know how to deduct losses.</p>
   <p>All enterprises, small or great, begin with figures. Greek merchants often begin to look for figures many months after the business has been founded, trying to set their accounts in order and to consult them about <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>what is going on in the "inferno of Dante," where the waiter's or the waitress's fingers play "piano," and the chef's cleaver chops up the boss' vitals, where sundry callers come to the back door to deliver merchandise unnecessary and under weight, and sundry persons leave with pockets full in order to lighten the icebox.</p>
   <p>The boss, well dressed in his white jacket, performs with magnificence his boss' duties, smiling to his patrons, sometimes flattering to the point of disgust, showing his teeth (because they told him to smile), behaving himself terribly, strict with his employees, forgetting that his employees can "dish him up" - and the workers of to-day are not as those of old!</p>
   <p>With particular care he counts the cash in the register, and woe if it falls short one quarter! Theft, theft, theft! He lays off employees and substitutes others like them and the shortage is always there. And while so much fuss is being made about a quarter, the chef's benevolent knife invites all with:-"Eat, ye poor, and be satisfied, and ye rich be lavish in gluttony!"</p>

   <p>The witnesses and the loyal guardians of his store he does not ask, he does not consult, for he has got them locked up in some drawer, and their comrades(bills) he has hanging on some hook.</p>
   <p>The loyal guardians and faultless witnesses, figures, are contemptuously thrown away as useless.</p>
   <p>No matter whom of restaurant men you ask, you get the answer: "I have a system; I know what I am doing," and ....</p>
   <p>He never stops to think why the meat bill this week went up to $200, and so on, while the cash register did not show an increase in receipts. There are many questions that could be submitted to every Greek merchant or restaurant man that would make him scratch his head and wonder how a man who does not know the secrets of the business can know more than the restaurant man is supposed to know himself.</p>
   <p>.......All people know figures and write them; few, however, can set them down in order.</p>
