   <p>All Greeks must know that by President Wilson's proclamation registration is set for June 5, 1917. The registration affects those of ages 21 to 30 inclusive. The offices for that purpose will be open from 7 A. M. to 9 P. M.</p>
   <p>Every Greek of the city of Chicago and elsewhere who is between these ages must go to the proper office and register. Registration does not exactly mean mobilization. The law governing registration states that all between these ages must register, irrespective of nationality, or color, whether American citizens or not.</p>
   <p>Those who are ill must procure cards of registration from the offices of their respective counties, fill them out,and either mail them or have them <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>delivered by representatives. Those who are away from home must likewise procure cards from the offices of their residential districts, fill them out, and mail them in advance, so that by June 5th they will be in the registration offices.</p>
   <p>Especial attention is called to the fact that no false statement about age is permissible in any circumstances, under penalty of drastic punishment.</p>
   <p>If for any reason your Greek name has been abbreviated or changed, you must register the full Greek name and the aliases. Because our adopted country's war is also the war of our native Greece, your full Greek name is necessary, for it gives honor, prestige, and distinction when the time comes to fight for Uncle Sam. America fights for liberty, democracy, and justice; therefore your full Greek name must be registered in the annals of Greek-American history.</p>
   <p>Ignorance, pretended or real, is no excuse in the eyes of the law. You must register on June 5, 1917.</p>
