   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>On next Tuesday, Nov. 7th, it will be decided whether waste of public funds and increased taxes continue in this City and County. It will also be decided whether interest earned on public funds shall be retained by the office holder or turned over to the people, where it rightfully belongs. It will also be decided whether the votes of the people shall be counted for the candidates voted for or whether selfish politicians shall steal elections for their friends. It will also be decided whether the people of this State shall demonstrate that a "Grateful people have not forgotten the splendid service rendered the country during the world war."</p>

   <p>We can help stop the waste of public funds; insure the payment of interest on public funds to the treasury of the people; assure honest elections and redeem the pledge to the ex-soldiers which has been so flagrantly disregarded by the Republican Party, by voting the Democratic ticket straight, and by voting "yes" on the small ballot to approve the "Adjusted Compensation Act" of the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Make no mistake, vote the straight Democratic ticket, the large and the small (judicial) ballot - and vote for and work for the approval of the adjusted compensation.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>The Achaian League,</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis,</p>
   <p>President.</p>
