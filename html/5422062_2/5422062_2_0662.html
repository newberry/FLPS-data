   <p>Below we publish a summary of the speech which the Honorable Bernard W. Snow, Chicago judge and staunch friend of the Greek people of Chicago, delivered during a huge meeting of the Greeks of Chicago at the Blackstone Theater on June 27, 1918, on the occasion of the first anniversary of Greece's entrance into the war.</p>
   <p>"About a year ago the inevitable happened. The history of ancient Greece and the love for freedom which also characterizes its descendants was from the beginning an assurance that the Greek nation would be the ally of the world's democracies in the critical and severe contest of this lengthy war for the defense of the rights of mankind.</p>
   <p>"Today we are not celebrating the fact that Greece is fighting by the side of the free nations of the earth, because she, too, is paying tribute to Liberty with her blood. We are really celebrating the occasion of the birth <span class="page-break">\2</span>of a world democracy. During the last three years a foreign monarch, King Constantine of Greece, prevented the people of Greece from expressing its true wishes in regards to the World War, and to the struggle of freedom versus barbarism and tyranny. The ardor and patriotism of the Greek people, however, swept away this despicable dynasty, and gave Greece the privilege of demanding its rights.</p>
   <p>"In this country we realize in what a terrific struggle our sister democracies are engaged in.</p>
   <p>"The history of Greece since the time of Turkish domination is well known to you. It is a glorious page in the world's history. From generation to generation the Greeks are fighting for the liberation of their enslaved brothers.</p>
   <p>"Asia Minor, which is Greek in population and in spirit, is also the home of that same people that gave to the world the arts, philosophy, literature, <span class="page-break">\3</span>and that immortal heritage of devotion to the ideals of freedom.</p>
   <p>"The war has spread to your land, my friends, and your sincere desire for self-government will be recognized at the end of this war for democracy, and a Greek democratic government will live again.</p>
   <p>"We have not come together merely for the purpose of the above-mentioned celebration; but our imaginations are aglow with the thought that the foremost people of the earth are determined to crush a military machine the like of which man has never encountered. Democracy is not established to be dominated by military force; it is founded on the rights of every man to enjoy the fruits of the progress and prosperity of mankind. The fundamental principles of absolutism and democracy are as far apart as the poles. In spite of its military strength, however, absolutism will not conquer the world.</p>
   <p>"In the hearts of most peoples of the earth there lives the spirit of freedom. <span class="page-break">\4</span>Not only is the sacrifice of blood required to preserve it, but the work and productive capacity of each and every one of us is also needed.</p>
   <p>"If the Huns overrun Europe, the United States will wage the war for freedom and democracy alone. In this country we have sufficient resources and wealth to win the war. While others are sacrificing their lives in the trenches for the sake of freedom and democracy, and also for our sake, what are we doing here?</p>
   <p>"Anyone desiring to take advantage of the opportunity to profiteer, by sucking the blood of the unfortunate people, whether he be a business man, a banker or a worker, is guilty of moral treason.</p>
   <p>"This evening, while the defenders of freedom are shedding their blood on all the fronts fighting against the Huns, let us express these thoughts:</p>
   <p>"'Heroic men and women of America; brave men are dying for you that you may <span class="page-break">\5</span>live unafraid; they are dying that you may enjoy the blessings of freedom which your forefathers won for you and which your sons are now defending. In these circumstances, native and foreign-born sons of America, do your duty here or at the front, so that when the prize of war is won and victory is achieved, no one will ask you what you did in this war.</p>
   <p>"The Greeks of Chicago, in particular, are under obligation to do their part in this war; first, because of their glorious and historic past; second, because of the common interests and ideals of Greece and America; third, because they are thus laying the foundations for their security, progress, and prosperity."</p>
