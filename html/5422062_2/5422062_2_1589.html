   <p>At 127 North Dearborn, our old friend and good countryman, M. Lazos, has opened a new and up-to-date restaurant.</p>
   <p>On the evening before his grand opening, Mr. Lazos invited his Greek and American friends to a huge feast followed by music, song and dance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lazos is to be congratulated for adding one more wonderful restaurant to the number owned by other Greeks in Chicago.</p>
