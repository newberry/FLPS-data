   <p>The international situation reveals a world, suffering from a severe case of "nerves". This jittery condition is causing national leaders many sleepless nights. Not only those leaders who are still answerable for their actions to the people, but even the dictators recognize the fact that conditions will get worse unless some agreement is reached among European nations. Even this solution may not avert a crisis as long as an amateur politician such as Hitler is in power.</p>
   <p>Hitler is the opposite of Mussolini, who has been educated in politics, and who is no longer a warmonger--as he was five years ago. The German paper hanger, encouraged by the comparatively easy overthrow of German democracy, thinks that he and Germany are in a position to dictate to the rest of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>world. It is one thing for him to curtail the liberty of a race within a nation, and quite another to impose his wishes upon a group that is interested in the common good.</p>
   <p>Until a short time ago, it was believed that Germany received moral support from Italy in her demand for abrogation of the provisions of the Versailles treaty. Mussolini, however,--even if Hitler does walk in the shadow of his political ideologies--is first an Italian and only second a fascist. He uses fascism simply as a means to strengthen, unify, and enlarge Italy.</p>
   <p>Germany will not help Italy to become powerful because she remembers Italy's treachery during the World War. No matter how much Mussolini may represent himself as anti-French, Germany cannot forget that he desired Italy to enter the War on the side of the Allies. With Germany ready to swallow Austria, the Italians had more to fear from Germany than from France.</p>
   <p>From an anthropological point of view, it has been proved that there is no similarity between the French and German peoples; but that there is a strong <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>relationship between the Italian and French peoples. Surely, the Duce knows that the German goal is far different from the Italian goal, and that the Germans--at least those who believe in the leadership of Hitler--consider themselves to be a most superior race, destined to rule the whole world.</p>
   <p>Of course, it is not the first time that some particular race has suffered from an inflated ego, a superiority complex. Thus far, no one nation or group of peoples has been able to impose its desires upon all the rest of the world. However, such ideas and dreams have been the cause of the majority of wars, and one of the greatest hindrances to the progress of civilization.</p>
   <p>The last speech of Mr. Roosevelt disclosed the true soul of the man--a man with complete understanding of the international situation; a man who realizes that all nations must forget their differences and act to promote the common good. It is a great blessing that the people of the American nation have a <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>man like Roosevelt at the helm. He has identified himself with the cause of the masses, the so-called common people.</p>
   <p>The entire world must take a lesson in meekness, an attribute lost as a result of the last war. It is a crime and an insult to humanity for any political upstart--after the sufferings undergone in the last war--to advocate anything that might cause the blood of man to be poured out anew upon the already bloodstained earth. Mankind must henceforth be taught to oppose war as a means of settling disputes.....</p>
   <p>Leaders of nations must confine their aggressive desires to their own horizons. If common courtesy is practiced by all leaders, the way will be open for peaceful and friendly co-operation. The people refuse to offer their lives to settle the disputes between rival ambitious leaders.</p>
