   <p>p. 1 In my previous article I wrote about the commercial activity and progress of Greek merchants in the City of Chicago. This article is written about Greek professionals of Chicago in particular and Greek professionals all over the United States in general.</p>
   <p>The Greek professionals in Chicago, as well as in other parts of America, are divided into three classes. First, those who came to America as professionals, but owing to some obstacle discontinued practicing their profession and turned to commercial enterprises. They have, with very rare exceptions, succeeded in accumulating wealth and gained the respect of all, as prosperous and good citizens.</p>
   <p>Second, those who came as professionals, but owing to their inability to speak English and according to the laws of the land, not being allowed to practice without examinations and license, turned their endeavors towards getting some kind of employment to make their living, and enrolled in some University or College in order to complete their qualifications.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This task was very hard for those professionals, never had done a day's work in the old country outside their profession. They soon adopted the American way which encouraged them, in the struggle of completing their education. They completed their education and the English language, to a certain extent, was learned and then they also, as those of the first class became prosperous citizens and very useful to their fellow-Greeks. They do their utmost to perpetuate the Greek traditions, Greek culture, and Greek letters. They stand today as the pillar of the new generation of Greek-Americans.</p>
   <p>Third, those professionals, who were born in America. The eyes of Hellenism are focused upon this new generation. The hope and wish of all the Greeks the world over is, that new generation of America, will be the torch bearers of Hellenism and the foundation of the new Greece in America. That these professionals, possessing Greek and American culture and education are equipped, to be distinguished as scientists, inventors, orators eminent statesmen and even Presidents of the United States, time will prove.</p>

   <p>They are of paramount importance to Hellenism, and that is the reason why we must do everything possible to give them a good start. The combined Greek-American inspiration they possessed, makes them feel strong, solid and positive of their great potentialities. The Greek blood within their veins and their American nativity, make them feel proud, dynamic, and apt to excel.</p>
   <p>Colleges and universities all over America are turning out Greek-American graduates with great honors and distinction. Right here in Chicago alone we have a good many Greek-American graduates who excell in their studies. No day passes by, without reading in the Americans and the Greek press encomiums for Greek-American students. It would have been a very beneficial thing as a matter of authentic knowledge, for the Greeks all over the world, if the Greek Legation in Washington had kept a record of the many Greek-Americans who excelled and distinguished themselves in American institutions. Such a record is necessary, and we very urgently suggest to the Greek Ambassador to take pains, to record, in the Embassy's archives, the names and number of students, who were and are top notchers all over this great United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>such a record will gratify and fulfill the hope and wish of Greeks the world over, who have their eyes focused upon the American new generation of the Greeks.</p>
   <p>The American born Greek, with his American idealisms, and the pure Greek blood in his veins which is always progressive combined with his American education, will soon become a torch-bearer of a new civilization that the world has never dreamed.</p>
   <p>without the slightest doubt I aver that American idealism eventually will conquer the world, and humanity will heed the American doctrines, which, slow but sure, are molding the minds of human-kind to a new way of thinking in regard to justice, liberty, education and civilization. And the Greek professional born in America, as a torch bearer of Americans idealism will hold high the light of Hellenism the world over, and illuminate our Earth with American justice and civilization.</p>
