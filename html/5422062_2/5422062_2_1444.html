   <p>Mr. Nick Gianoulis, counsel for Raklios and Company, has been elected chairman of the committee of the Chicago territory for formulating a restaurant code. In a future meeting, the members of this committee, which is composed of the leading restaurateurs of the Chicago territory, and on which are the two Greek restaurateurs, C. Terzakis and George Gianas, will determine the regulations and policies which will govern the Chicago restaurants. This committee is under the leadership of Gianoulis.</p>
   <p>We are sure that he will handle the formulation of this code with his usual ability and foresight. Since so many of the restaurants in and around Chicago are Greek, it is very fitting that a Greek heads the committee formulating regulations.</p>
