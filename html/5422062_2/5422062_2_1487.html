   <p>p. 3.--Perhaps few of our countrymen know that we Greeks can give entertainments in the cool breezes of the Municipal Pier in accordance with our ways and customs. This is a privilege, and it is especially so because our friend Tom Droulias, who hails from Pircaus, is operating the Pier Restaurant, and so he can serve all Greeks who wish to avail themselves of the accommodations on the Pier.</p>
   <p>At any rate, Mr. Droulias is availing himself of them and last Monday the Pier was the scene of his Greek hospitality, for he served a banquet to some fifty friends of his to celebrate the fact that he had picked a winning horse.</p>
   <p>Among those who attended the banquet were Dr. Antoniou, Elias Diakoniviakos, Ang. Drakopoulos, Mr. De Metz, Nick Vasilakos, Demosthenes Kosmopoulos, Tom Maroudas, P. Trougas, Tom Kioupis, Mr. and Mrs. Nick Derveris, Mr. and Mrs. Panos Papaioannou, Miss Helene Filiote, Mr. and Mrs. Paraskeuopoulou, Const. Antonopoulos, Miss Pantaze, P. Paulos, Mr. Salapatas, and Geo. Klouras.</p>
