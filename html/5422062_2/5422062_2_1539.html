   <p>p. 6.- This time I have visited Mr. G. Boukides, florist, opposite the Drake Hotel, who received me with all kindness, and said: "I have noticed various opinions of our fellow-nationals unfolding in the Greek Daily, which seem to stir us to think better, even if we do not try to put our thoughts into effect, immediately. If the Greeks of America succeeds, in time, in bringing up and educating, the new generation with strict Greek customs and habits, I am sure that much good would come.</p>
   <p>"If, however, the Greeks waste their time in aimless partisan and ecclesiastical disputes, neglecting themselves and the youth, a few years from now, it will be too late, and our whole national structure of ideals will vanish beneath the crumbled tower of Babel.</p>
   <p>"As in our enterprises we must unite in order to survive, and not permit the colossal syndicates to devour us, so with our children we must take action for their breeding and education. Higher school education, business cooperation with Communal, and Ecclesiastical harmony must be the motto of the Greek-Americans.</p>
   
   <p>"This is what I had to say," said Mr. Boukides, "and now a few words regarding my occupation:</p>
   <p>"We are working mostly for the wholesalers, as florists, spending our money in doubtful enterprises. Had a few Greeks united they could have established greenhouses here, or still better, could have bought such in California, with Chicago and other cities as the markets. Thus, we would not have had to work always for the Jews...Things are not easy, but 'good is the end of a good beginning,' says a Greek proverb. When there is a good will much can be accomplished. It is not necessary for the Greeks to consume their youth in the dark and damp kitchens of food establishments. Country, flowers, sun, fresh air, health, there you have heaven on earth!</p>
   <p>"In saying this, I do not mean that they should abandon, all at once, their business. No! But to look for something better, and not open so many restaurants every day."</p>
   <p>Mr. Boukides is from Arachova of Lacedaemon, a patriot, and a satirical poet.</p>
   <p>D.I. Rigas.</p>
