   <p>Greeks all over the country have so far contributed, according to the published statistics, $10,000,000 to the Liberty Loans. The latest reports show that contributions of Chicago Greeks exceed $2,000,000.</p>
   <p>And this is only the report that covers contributions as groups or races acting together, and the Greek race, not only in Chicago but all over the country, comes first Per Capita in buying Liberty bonds.</p>
   <p>This is the second great distinction of the Greeks in America. The first was gained by volunteering for enlistment in the American Army and Navy Uncle Sam's official records reveal that the Greeks, per capita hold the honors. More Greeks, per capita have enlisted than men of any other race.</p>

   <p>Again and again I reiterate that the Greek is distinguished for his patritotism. What a wonderful thing it would have been had we been lucky enough to have a couple of millions of Greeks here in America! Now we have between and four hundred thousand and their patriotic influence is known and felt everywhere. Imagine then what two million Greeks would do in emergencies like the present. They would do wonders. It is in the race and in American idealism.</p>
