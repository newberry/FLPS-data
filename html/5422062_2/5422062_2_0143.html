   <p>April the eighth is drawing near and our countrymen are getting more and more excited over the coming election.</p>
   <p>Among those taking an important part are John Kaliopoulos, who is supporting Deneen and Paul Demos, who backs Miss McCormick with the aid of N. Kanellis.</p>
   <p>With Mr. Demos' help, the secretary of the Republican Club, George Spannon, is giving a series of dinners for the Greek voters of Chicago. One such dinner took place last Monday in honor of Miss McCormick at the La Salle Hotel.</p>
   <p>Helpers of Mr. Kaliopoulos are Messrs. J. Michalopoulos, G. Kolletin, A. Flambouras, G. Porrikos, and P. Sikokis.</p>
   <p>Mr. Deneen will speak to the Greek voters next Sunday at Collias Hall, 748 South Halsted Street. All Republicans should be present.</p>
