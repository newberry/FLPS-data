   <p>We are proud of the many Greeks who have graduated from colleges and universities and are now engaged in professional activities. One of these is Dr. Baxebanis, who is a chiropodist.</p>
   <p>Dr. Baxebanis offices are at 3411 Lawrence Ave. Patients of the North, Northwest and West Sides should go to Dr. Baxebanis when they have foot troubles.</p>
