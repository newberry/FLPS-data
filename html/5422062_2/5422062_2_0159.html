   <p>p. 1 - General L. D. Tyson of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee, is a candidate for the office of United States senator. The election will be held in August of this year.</p>
   <p>I have known General Tyson for about twenty years. During the Spanish-American War he served as colonel in Cuba. In the last war he served in France as major general, taking part in several battles. He studied at the famous West Point Academy, and his election will be an honor to the State of Tennessee.</p>
   <p>Those of you who served in the World War will best appreciate this man who has always fought for liberty. He is in favor of the soldiers' bonus.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Thomas S. Hutchison,</p>
   <p>Major General and an officer</p>
   <p>in the Balkan Wars, 1912-1913.</p>
