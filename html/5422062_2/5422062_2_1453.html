   <p>In this great City of Chicago, where more than 2,000 Greek businesses were flourishing sometime ago, regardless of how many are left now, there the greatest need for an organization such as the American Restaurant organization.</p>
   <p>But as happens with all Greek organizations, and especially the commercial ones, the interest of the members is in conflict with that of the ambitious and unscrupulous officials who run the organizations.</p>
   <p>And this is natural, because the able and honest are not interested and do not care to be elected by improper methods, so the self-seekers get together and at the proper time vote for each other. They can in this manner control the election of the officers and manipulate the affairs of the organization.</p>
   
   <p>By these methods the frivolous and unscrupulous are elected to the various offices and eventually destroy the organization, though for some time they pose as persons of importance.</p>
   <p>It is certain that something similar happened to the Greek Restaurant Association of Chicago, the plights and troubles of which are many and of such great variety that we can not report them all, but we note a few. Outstanding is that of Mr. De Stefano, the lawyer, who collected a judgment of $500 against the organization. The newly retained, organizer-secretary, by breaking the agreements of his predecessors, about the service and the office, was responsible for that judgement.</p>
   <p>On this occasion we recall the clever deed of some grafters who ransacked the treasury of the Greek Restaurant organization of Detroit, by promising to stop the famous speakeasies from serving meals, because it was against the interests of the restaurants. They got away with about $2,000 by duping the officials.</p>
   <p>The Chicago notorious secretary, for the past few years has been organizing Greek Restaurant organizations, and while directing them as executive secretary, has with the very well known method of confederates and the prearranged programs, drawn many victims into his net. To form a vague idea of the plight and conditions prevailing at the affairs of the organization, not to term them otherwise, we report an incident which came under our personal observation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andrew Anastassakes, who runs the Palace Restaurant, at 614 So. Wells St., sent his check for dues to the organization, and after a few days a committee visited him to remind him of unpaid dues.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Anastassakes presented them the check duly paid by the bank. On examination it was found that it was indorsed by the G. T. Restaurant of Mr. Terzakes, the president of the organization.</p>
   <p>We do not want to insinuate embezzlement or fraudulent withdrawals of money, but this organization cannot be considered a serious and important association when the president cashes the checks of the organization and no mention of it appears in the records.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Terzakes, or his restaurant took possession of that check properly, or if it was cashed by them for the benefit of the organization, a record ought to have been kept of such transactions so no collectors would be sent out for another payment.</p>
   <p>This is one incident known to us; we do not know if there are more but if so we will be glad to report them, but organizations of this kind with such systems of accounting gives cause and justifies all kinds of rumors about its officials and those who are interested in it.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, men like Mr. Terzakes, as businessmen ought to have a better sense of honor and dignity than to allow themselves to be criticized for matters like that, even if it was a mistake that a check of the organization was mixed up in his own account; or that he cashed the check and did not turn in the money!</p>
   <p>These, and the like, are the incidents which blacken the reputation and the esteem of the associations and the officials who run them, so the public looks upon them with contempt.</p>
   <p>We want to believe and be sure, that the recently elected new personnel of the organization will be more careful, and will not give cause for criticisms like that at the expense of the association. Concerning its secretary much is said and rumored to the effect that he is always working to turn the organization members to become Bolsheviks instead of working for their own interest.</p>
