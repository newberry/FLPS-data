   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I have yours of the 13th inst., with reference to the approaching primary election for mayor.</p>
   <p>I am not a candidate at the primary, but I am an independent candidate for mayor at the election April 1st.</p>
   
   <p>It is almost needless to state that the Greeks, as well as every other group of citizens of this country, are entitled to equal rights and the protection of our laws.</p>
   <p>I have been States Attorney of Cook County for six years and First Assistant Corporation Counsel of Chicago under two administrations. My record in this position is a matter of public knowledge. I am a candidate upon that record. Later on I shall announce my position on some of what I believe to be the leading issues.</p>
   <p>My headquarters are at 404 Ashland Block, and you can obtain anyinformation you desire at those headquarters.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Maclay Hoyne,</p>
   <p>States Attorney.</p>
