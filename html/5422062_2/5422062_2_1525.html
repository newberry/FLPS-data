   <p>p. 2.- Greek business men have been having an economic depression for over a year. This phenomenon could not be explained at first. The small business men whose profits were "just enough," thought they could make these small resources work for them in other ways. Being new to the country and reading about huge fortunes shrewd business men were making, they hastened to invest all they could in Wall Street.</p>
   <p>As a rule, Greeks are careful of the speculations they make, but for once this rule was tragically broken and at a great cost to them. This sad experience has done us some good. It has shown us the evil of trying to get something for nothing. Work is our only hope.</p>
