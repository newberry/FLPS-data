   <p>Communistic Russia claims that it has succeeded in drawing to the church which it has established the larger part of the Russian people. We cite these figures from Russian data, which speak for themselves. According to these the "Living Church" has attracted only twenty-five percent of the followers of the old church, while the latter holds seventy-five per cent of the faithful, still as stupid and fanatical as under Czarism, if not more so. This means that talk does not change conditions, and that miracles may be written about, but they do not happen.</p>
