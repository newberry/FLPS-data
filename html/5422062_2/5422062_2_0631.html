   <p>The proverb says, "After the rain, there comes the rainbow." This adage can also be applied to the present financial situation. Although there are still many clouds darkening the horizon, it is evident that they are gradually disappearing. America made many sacrifices during the War, yet she did not lose money. In fact, she gained. Cooperation is all that is necessary to restore normal conditions in this country.</p>
   <p>The expressions "American" and "un-American" are not to be applied to those who did or did not fight or cheer for their country. The "un-American" cheered for his country, but he would not buy fifty dollars' worth of Liberty Bonds.</p>
   <p>It is a known fact, that many foreign-born were induced to invest their money in enterprises that did not even exist. Thousands of dollars were swindled in such ways. If this money had been safely invested, this could not have happened.</p>

   <p>It is the duty of every foreign-born to support everything that is American, having in mind the motto, "All Americans, and America first."</p>
