   <p>On December 12 the voters of the State of Illinois are asked to come to the polls and declare by their votes whether they approve of the new constitution which was written and prepared by the delegates elected for this task about two years ago.</p>
   <p>It is needless to suggest to Greek voters that they should not fail to come to the polls and vote on that day for the new constitution. We must bear in mind that the constitution, written and formulated under the present circumstances and conditions by the best political minds of the State, cannot but be, in its entirety, much superior to the one that was written fifty years ago.</p>
   <p>And it is the duty of us Greeks to demonstrate that we are interested in the country in which we have received such hospitality, in which we progress, prosper, and enrich ourselves.</p>
   <p>So, all to the polls, on December 12.</p>
