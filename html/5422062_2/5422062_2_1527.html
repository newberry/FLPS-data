   <p>Known for twenty years to the Greeks of Chicago and other western cities, the Bouris Liner Supply Co. has once again opened its doors at 642 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>Greek restauroteurs, who had used Bouris' tablecloths, napkins, towels, etc. were glad to hear of the firms revival.</p>
   <p>The Company also carries a good line of Baptismal and Greek wedding supplies. We Greeks should continue to support this enterprise as we have in the past.</p>
