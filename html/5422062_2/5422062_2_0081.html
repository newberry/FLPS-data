   <p>Greeks of Chicago and America, do not entirely devote your daily efforts towards gaining the almighty dollar; devote an hour or so daily to acquaint yourselves with the destructive propaganda of the Bolshivikis, who attempt to destroy and entirely eradicate National and International principles of religion, science, philosophy, sacred ties of family life, honor, truth, education, and everything that is good and holy for the maintenance of established society. The slaughter and death from hunger of 15,000,000 Christians in Russia, should be enough to wake you up and take notice of the menace to civilization. Hundreds of thousands of children of both sexes are left to roam the streets of Russia, living a life of misery, sleeping in the streets, halls, and caves; a life much inferior than the life that the animals lead. Is not this enough to convince you that the aim of the Reds is to destroy the Ideals of the Human Race, to disintegrate the foundation of Christianity the world over and to throw the Human Race in the pits of darkness, ignorance, immorality and disintegration of Nationalism?</p>
   <p>Oh Greeks of today! do not treat this Bolshiviki Monster with indifference but fight it with all of your power, before it is too late.</p>
