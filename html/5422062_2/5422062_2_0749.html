   <p>Dear Publisher of Saloniki: We request you to publish in your newspaper the fact that the Greek Committee for the Third Liberty Loan campaign is sponsoring a contest among the Greek sellers of Liberty Bonds in Chicago and Cook County.</p>
   <p>The committee will award to the one who sells the greatest number of bonds a first prize of a one-hundred-dollar Liberty Bond. In addition, the committee will publicly compliment the winner for his patriotic service and his valuable contribution to a great national cause. To the winner of second place will be awarded a Liberty Bond of fifty dollars; to the winner of third place five Savings Stamps will be given.</p>
   <p>Those who desire to take part in the contest are requested to notify the publisher of the paper to which they subscribe; he will gladly publish their names. They must also apply to Mr. Paul Demos, Secretary of the Greek Committee, who will supply them with the necessary information as to registration procedure.</p>
