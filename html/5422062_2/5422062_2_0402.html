   <p>In an Ohio court two men and a woman have been sentenced to the pentitentiary for from five to ten years on the charge of criminal syndicalism. The press reports, as to the nature of their offense, are not full, but it appears that they indulged in Communistic addresses last August. It seems they were attempting to deliver an address in keeping with the platform of the Communist Party when apprehended. The woman was charged with distributing Communistic pamphlets to the crowd. The severity of the comments of the Court in passing sentence was inspired, in part at least, by the contemptuous attitude of the accused toward the bench.</p>
   <p>Somehow it is hard to believe that the country has been saved from a serious menace. The people of Ohio are a hard-headed, sensible sort of people who probably look upon Communism with more curiosity than concern. Theoretically, we permit people to advocate any political system they choose. A Communist ticket can go upon the ballot. If the speeches were made to an orderly crowd and there was no danger of rioting, it would probably have been just as well to have ignored the meeting.</p>
   <p>They do it better in England. There they have a theory that free speech is a safety valve. In Hyde Park one may hear a Communist speech almost any time. No one gets excited about it. Nothing happens. The effect is nil.</p>
   <p>No doubt the men and the woman in Ohio could have asked nothing better than an arrest, a trial and conviction, with a heavy sentence. Publicity is what they seek. Their general attitude during the trial was such as to deprive them of any sympathy. As a matter of policy it would have been just as well to have allowed them to talk.</p>
   <p>Our theories of government are sound enough to stand the arbitrament of debate. It serves no useful purpose to give the dignity of martyrdom to people of no consequence who are unable to do harm.</p>
