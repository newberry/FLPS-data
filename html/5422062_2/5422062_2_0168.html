   <p>The Greeks of Chicago should be happy over the nomination of a Greek and a philhellene [friend of Greek people] for the position of Judges of the Municipal Court. They are A. Pantelis and Mr. Kent Greene. It is not necessary for us to recommend Mr. Pantelis to the Greeks. His accomplishments and character are known to every Chicagoan, and we are sure that he will win every Greek vote.</p>
   <p>We known Mr. Greene to be a real friend of the Greek people. He respects our forefathers and their contributions to civilization so much that he learned to read and write our language. He speaks the language to such an extent that he can give an oration in Greek.</p>
   <p>All the Greeks should vote for these men.... This will be the first opportunity at which the Greeks of Chicago will be able to show their political strength.</p>
