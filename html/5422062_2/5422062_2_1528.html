   <p>One of the most progressive Greeks in Chicago is Anastasios Pierrakos from Gythio, Lakonia. He came to America when only ten years old and since that time has been employed by the Wabash Railroad Co., where he now holds an important position.</p>
   <p>His progress was so rapid that when it was necessary to build a bridge at 75th and Western Avenues, the only person thought of for the position of supervision was Mr. Pierrakos.</p>
   <p>The work cost $2,000,000 and was finished in one year. He received honors and congratulations from all the superior officers for this marvelous work.</p>

   <p>He is so well thought of that E. Haney, president of the Wabash Co. personally asked him to supervise the building of a reserve station at Polk and Dearborn St. This project will cost $1,000,000.</p>
   <p>Bravo, Mr. Pierrakos!</p>
