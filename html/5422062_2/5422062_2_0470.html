   <p>We have had the pleasure and happiness to receive the following letter from Governor Roosevelt, the Democratic Candidate:</p>
   <p>Executive Mansion</p>
   <p>Albany, New York</p>
   <p>October 28, 1932</p>
   <p>Mr. Dimitrios Callimachos,</p>
   <p>Editor, National Herald,</p>
   <p>140 West 26th Street,</p>
   <p>New York City.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>My dear Mr. Callimachos:</p>
   <p>For some weeks ago I have been hoping that I might have the privilege and the pleasure of meeting you personally as my guest here in Albany or at my home at Hyde Park. I have wanted to talk over with you the entire national situation and particularly the outlook among the citizens who read and are influenced by your publication.</p>
   <p>I have also ventured to hope through its columns you might give me your support in our present campaign - one which we feel reaches deeper than mere party lines and should command the active approval of thoughtful and forward-looking Americans, whatever their previous national heritage.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>However, the duties of my office and the plans of the Campaign Committee have made it impossible to appoint a time when I might extend such an invitation. I want you to know that anything you feel able to do, personally or through the columns of your paper, will be very deeply appreciated. May I also say that I welcome any advice, suggestions or criticism you may have? Your letters will always be welcome as well as any clippings or other material you may care to send for my personal attention.</p>
   <p>Yours very sincerely,</p>
   <p>(Signed) Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>

   <p>The following letter was addressed to Governor Roosevelt in response to the deep interest he has shown towards American citizens of Greek parentage:</p>
   <p>November 3, 1932</p>
   <p>To His Excellency</p>
   <p>The Governor of the State of New York</p>
   <p>Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
   <p>Executive Mansion,</p>
   <p>Albany, New York</p>
   <p>My dear Governor:</p>
   <p>Your letter of October 28th has gladdened my heart and mind. Born and brought up in a historic background and schooled in the spirit of democracy <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>and the liberalism of their ancestors, near and remote, in the past, the Greeks have learned how to discover, understand and appreciate the qualities of a true leader of the people.</p>
   <p>Our newspaper, the National Herald, knowing well for the last seventeen years, your ideas and moral principles about government and human relationship, has consistently and intensively supported your nomination on the Democratic ticket as the standard bearer of the Periclean and Jeffersonian ideals: and from the day of your nomination we are doing all we can in order to divulge widely among the Greeks those ideals formulated by you and adapted to our time and our needs.</p>
   <p>As our paper has a National circulation the great part of the Americans <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of Greek descent have read in its columns an analytical resume of all your speeches and statements and also our editorial support of all of them. This applies not only to our daily issue but to our Sunday and monthly issues as well.</p>
   <p>It is an unqualified support not merely to the standard bearer of a party but to a man destined to guide the American nation and, through it, the world to prosperity and happiness, - destined to take up the Wilsonian pledge "to make the world safe for democracy."</p>
   <p>The Greeks, as a race, have also their own particular reason to love you, Governor, knowing that your family, a hundred years ago, have been instrumental in promoting the success of Greek independence.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>I am not over-estimating the omens when I assure you, my dear Governor, that my first opportunity to meet you personally will come after the 4th of March; and the meeting place will be: The White House.</p>
   <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>D. Callimachos,</p>
   <p>Editor.</p>
   <p>In our letter to the Democratic candidate we merely have outlined our attitude in the present campaign. We know that this stand is in line with the wishes and the choice of the American citizens of Greek parentage.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Governor Roosevelt is liked by the Greeks - and it does not necessarily mean any degree of animosity towards the President of the United States - because he has taken a clear-cut attitude towards all the great problems and issues of the day. His declaration for the repeal of the 18th Amendment and the modification of the Volstead Act so as to permit light wines and beer, his tariff policy facilitating the flow of the International commerce and the liquidation of debts, his interest in the forgotten man - the Greeks as workers and small business men are all among the "forgotten men" - his famous "concert of interests" abolishing the "half boom and half broke" system, his pledge to humanize the immigration laws, his relief proposals, his labor policies, and his policies on all other issues find the Greeks of America in complete agreement.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Last but not least, the Americans of Greek parentage support Governor Roosevelt because they know by his record as Governor of the State of New York that he has the ability to lead men by cooperation and teamwork.</p>
