   <p>Buy bonds of the Third Liberty Loan. It is a duty and obligation to our adopted country, as well as to our motherland. Do not keep your money locked up in safes, for it does not bring gain either to you or to the government which has need of the money to realize its high purposes, that is, to secure the prevalence of liberty and democracy throughout the world, and especially among the oppressed peoples.</p>
   <p>Also, do not keep your money with you or hide it in any part of your home. To do so is very foolish, for not only does it not produce any interest for you, but you are running the risk of losing it.</p>
   <p>Buy bonds of the Liberty Loan and in this way you are insuring your money and benefiting yourselves and your country. Be assured that you, too, are doing all in your power to rid the world of the Kaiser, to restore a lasting, world peace, which is sought by America and her Allies. Onward to your duty!</p>
