   <p>March 31, 1931.</p>
   <p>Friends and Fellow Chicagoans:</p>
   <p>April 7th is the day whereby every citizen of this great city of ours shall cast their ballot in electing a mayor for the next four years to come. Our organization certainly will not remain disinterested, but shall do its duty to see that all of its members and their friends shall cast their ballots to elect as mayor, a man with a clean record and ability, sincerity, and leadership, to guide the destinies of this great city.</p>
   <p>The constructive record of A. J. Cermak, during the many years of his public service, is convincing that he is a man best fitted by experience and training to help solve the many serious problems now confronting our city.</p>

   <p>Our organization has always in the past shown strength and work, supporting our party, but we must confess that the leadership of our ward committee man, James Sullivan, shall be praised not only in supporting the Democratic party but in giving assistance and cooperation to our club.</p>
   <p>Thursday evening, April 2, 1931, at 8 o'clock our club extends an invitation to its members and their friends to attend a great mass meeting in honor of our next mayor, A. J. Cermak, at its clubrooms, 7445 Cottage Grove Avenue.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>George Polos, President.</p>
