   <p>Rumors are multiplying that Italy intends to enter the war on the side of the triple entente; first by declaring war on Turkey, and then, by extending hostilities to the countries of the two kaisers. If these stories prove true, it may be taken for granted that Italy has been persuaded to forget about her foolish dispute with Greece on the Albanian question.</p>
   <p>Both the Greek and the Italian people sympathize with the Allies, but the ambitions of the two countries clash in Albania. Italy claims to have interests in Albania, and views Greek expansion in that region with alarm. Greece has the very definite interests of two or three hundred thousand fellow Hellenes living in the southern part of this make-shift kingdom. These people want annexation with Greece as ardently as Texas desired union with the United States.</p>

   <p>Manifestly, in a dispute of this sort, Greece has the better argument. She represents the growing idea of nationality, instead of the decaying dynastic notions which Italy has inherited from her old enemy, Austria.</p>
   <p>The Albania quarrel was one of the many disturbances made in Vienna [sic]. If it is thrown aside, and Italy and Greece join hands in this war, Austria and Turkey will be put in difficult positions.</p>
