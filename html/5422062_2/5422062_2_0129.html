   <p>Mr. Anthony A. Pantelis, secretary of the Greek Democratic Political Club of Illinois, representing various political organizations, which will support the candidacy of A. J. Cermak, as Mayor, submitted a resolution to Mr. Cermak with the slogan: "Clean up the City Hall from graft and instill Americanism in the voter's hearts."</p>
   <p>This resolution has been endorsed also by four Greek newspaper publishers, thus making the Greek Press unanimous for Cermak. The publishers are S. Kotakis of the Chicago Greek Daily, P.S. Lampros of the Greek Star, G.A. Kyriakopoulos of the Democrat, and Nick Salopoulos of Saloniki.</p>
   <p>As a result of this resolution there were about 12,500 signatures of Greek voters in the Greek Democratic Leagues' office.</p>
   <p>The American citizens of Greek descent will render a service to our community if they disdain the sinister, lying, and insulting propaganda that has been circulated in the last moments of the campaign.</p>

   <p>Twenty eight years of public service by Anton Cermak are there as a rock of Gibralter to recommend him.</p>
