   <p>Subscriptions to the Liberty Loan will be closed on the fifteenth of this month. It is an honor for every Greek that can possibly do so to buy some of these Bonds, even though he can only buy a fifty dollar Bond. These Bonds are not only as good as money, but they also pay interest at the rate of three and one-half per cent, besides being a sound investment. Many of our nationality have acquired the bad habit of putting their savings into safety-deposit boxes of the banks. Buying Liberty Bonds will enable them to continue this habit; since they can be put into the bank vaults just as money.</p>
   <p>Aside from the benefits of safety and interest derived from these Bonds, there is another good reason for buying them. Every dollar invested in these Bonds is a step towards the freedom of the entire world; it is a step towards the liberation and the saving of thousands of Greeks who are being enslaved or slaughtered. And finally, it is a weapon against the tyrannical Prussian government.</p>
