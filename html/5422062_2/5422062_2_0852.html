   <p>We, the undersigned Greeks of Chicago, having heard Mr. Kafantaris and Mr. Aravantinos, speaking at a general meeting as representatives of the National Government of Thessaloniki, have come to this decision:</p>
   <p>First: We heartily agree with the government in Saloniki that Mr. Venizelos is the best choice for leader of Greece; and the best man to uphold the interests of our people.</p>
   <p>Second: We denounce the government in Athens as traitorous because it gave Greek territory and forts to the Bulgars--the historic enemies of Greece.</p>
   <p>Third: We announce that our sympathies are with the Allies, and hope that their efforts will be crowned with success.</p>
   <p>Fourth: We pledge allegiance to America and to the President, and say that if the Stars and Stripes are in danger, we, the Greeks, will be in the front <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>line of defense.</p>
   <p>Fifth: We ask the President of the United States to recognize the freedom-seeking government in Thessaloniki, and refuse to acknowledge the traitorous King in Athens who is seeking to enslave the Greeks. We ask that the representatives of the government of Thessaloniki be recognized by the United States; just as they are by the powers of the Entente.</p>
   <p>Signed by</p>
   <p>The hundred members of the Liberal Society.....</p>
