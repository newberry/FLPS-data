   <p>The economic situation, it seems, does not stop the Greeks from opening up more restaurants. The newest one, in the center of our city, on Randolph and Wells, is known as Potters' Luncheonette.</p>
   <p>It is operated by C. Tsoukalas (Potter) and J. Theodore of Thrace. The fixtures and equipment have been supplied by Peppas &amp; Alex Co. We wish them much success.</p>
