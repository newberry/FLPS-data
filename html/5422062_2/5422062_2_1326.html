   <p>p. 4- On the day before yesterday a good friend of mine joined the group of Greek professional men, a Greek-American who is a real patriot, - my beloved crony George Demetriou Tsioulos. He graduated recently from the University of Chicago with a medical degree.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tsioulos came to America at a tender age and has studied long and diligently.</p>
   <p>To his venerable parents who aspired to reveal their son's ability I extend my heartiest congratulations; and for my beloved young friend, George Tsioulos, who has now achieved professional rank, I wish success and clear sailing throughout his career.</p>
   <p>George I. Ntarkas.</p>
