   <p>To the Editor of the Post:</p>
   <p>Sir: The future of democratic government depends on the active participation of the majority of the people in elections, but history shows that the greater part of American citizens do not care to go to the polls, and time and time again public officials have been elected by a minority. Thus our government is a democratic government of minorities.</p>
   <p>The results of European elections, as compared with those in this country, indicate that public officials over there are elected by the majority, as has been clearly demonstrated by the last election in Germany, in which nearly 90 per cent of the citizens cast their votes.</p>

   <p>Ever since the days of Abraham Lincoln statistics show that election after election, with the exception of presidential elections, has been decided by the minority of the voters; in fact, in all the judicial elections in Cook County, as well as in other parts of the country, not more than 33 per cent of the total registered vote was cast, and we are in doubt whether the judges elected represent the people as a whole, inasmuch as they receive majorities of minorities, though legally and properly elected.</p>
   <p>In all elections every effort is made by the campaigners of both parties to induce the people to vote. In spite of this they have failed to arouse public sentiment, and in case of bad weather the small vote is blamed on the weather forecaster, notwithstanding the fact that Tuesday is not the proper day on which to hold an election.</p>
   <p>In a republic like the United States the will of the people must always prevail. However, time and time again it has been manifested by the results of elections that government of the people, for the people, and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>by the people is government by the minority of the people. Such being the case, the question arises: What is wrong? Is the something wrong with the government, the Constitution, the laws, or the people?</p>
   <p>These questions can be discussed at other times, but in my opinion, Tuesday is not the proper day of the week for elections, for it has always been inconvenient for those who have work to do.</p>
   <p>The man who takes no special interest in the campaign, although his employer allows him two hours in which to vote, does not care to do so; he goes home or to the theater, thinking that his vote would not make any difference in the result of the election.</p>
   <p>The businessman who arises in the morning to go to his office refuses to stand in line to vote. Therefore he goes to his office with the thought in mind that he will vote in the afternoon, but since he is busy, he does not go to the polls and believes that his vote will not make any difference.</p>

   <p>The laborer, the bricklayer, the plumber, and other workmen are not presentable for exhibition in a public place and let it go, while the farmer is busy with his crops and does not care to go to the polls with his boots on, feeling like the workman, that he is not presentable.</p>
   <p>The same argument applies to the housewife, who goes down-town or is busy with her work at home, and who, unless she is taken by her precinct captain, does not care to go to the polls, and likewise does not care to go unless she is well dressed for the occasion.</p>
   <p>Taking everything into consideration, I feel that elections must be held on Sunday instead of on Tuesday. Election Tuesday is a holiday for bankers and for courts, while department stores and all other business-houses remain open. Therefore I believe that a general holiday, like Sunday, should be consecrated to the performance of religious and political duties, and the spirit of the day will have a great influence upon the voters, who will cast their votes in accordance with the dictates of their consciences.</p>

   <p>On the second Sunday of November and the second Sunday of April no golf-links are open, and people are not motoring. They stay at home, go to church, and have plenty of time to discuss elections among themselves and plenty of time to dress and go to the polls to vote.</p>
   <p>Sunday is a day of rest and inspiration. Sunday is a day that makes a citizen think of his duties and forget his business affairs. And Sunday is a proper day for a citizen to exercise his rights of citizenship by electing the proper public officials.</p>
   <p>We have the experience of nearly a hundred years to show us that a great portion of the people do not vote on Tuesday because it is inconvenient. Changing election day to Sunday will incline us to the performance of our duty as citizens and the election of suitable candidates to public office.. Let us adopt modern methods in harmony with our rapid development and our progress in political science.</p>
   <p>We have tried Tuesday and found it unsuccessful. Let us try Sunday and consider attendance at the polls a religious and patriotic duty to be performed on the Sabbath day.</p>
