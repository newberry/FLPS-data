   <p>In the last publication of the Greek Star, the eminent doctor of our city Dr. K. Kalliontzis wrote an article titled, "The Enemies of Our Country, Greece."</p>
   <p>We respect and appreciate the profound thoughts of our honorable doctor, regarding the political struggle which is going on in Greece. His writings to that effect are wonderful and very beneficial. But we do not agree nor approve of his theme against Free Mansory and Socialism.</p>
   <p>The distinguished member of our community is either misinformed, prejudiced, or lacking historical knowledge some medical men and other professionals, might be a power and authority in their profession but when it comes to world affairs, their knowledge and opinions are not worth much.</p>
   
   <p>Our doctor would do good to his profession and to our race, if he would write something on how mothers should take care of their babies, or on general hygiene. Dr. Kalliontzis is not a Free Mason, consequently he knows little or nothing of Masonic principles. However he may be excused for his disrespectful article against Masonry, and it will do him honor if he retracts his statement.</p>
   <p>Below is what Dr. Kalliontzis said in his article on "Free Masonry."</p>
   <p>"Another plague to our Country is Masonry. The Masons of Free Tectons are elevated in degrees of Masonry, the more they become irreligious and anti-nationalists, adopting Xenolatry and Cosmopolitanism. Masonry was first founded by Cosmopolitan Jews, who were against Christianity. Anti-christianity and Cosmopolitanism are two opposits of Greek Nationalism."</p>
   <p>The above paragraph should be corrected by our doctor in the next publication we hope.</p>
