   <p>Churches, societies, veterans of all wars, even "Liberals" will gather today in Chicago to remember the 113th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birth.</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, will compare Lincoln with Pericles before the First Methodist Sunday school at 10 A. M.</p>
   <p>The great American and the great Greek had many points of similarity as statesmen, patriots, and orators, Mr. Lambros declares.</p>
