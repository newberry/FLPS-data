   <p>We appeal to you to support the foregoing candidates for judicial honors at the election to be held on June 7. Their past public records are such that they are worthy of the support of all voters and especially of your support.</p>
   <p>They have demonstrated that they are fair-minded men and are possessed of a disposition which leads us to believe that they will do "justice" to all if elected judges of the Circuit Court. They need your support; so do not fail them in the coming election.</p>
   <p>They have been your friends in the past and will remain your friends when elected judges. The election will be held next Monday. It is very important that you come out and vote.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
