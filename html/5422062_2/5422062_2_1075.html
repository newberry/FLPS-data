   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros,</p>
   <p>Accept my appreciation for your thoughtfulness in sending me the excellent article on the analogy between Pericles and Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Every student of democracy must be acquainted with Greek history if he is to comprehend the age in which we live.</p>
   <p>Your article is an excellent exposition of an important theme.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>William D. Saltiel.</p>
