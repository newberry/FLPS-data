   <p>The Greek Press along with its many other missions, will deem it its duty, as representing the sound sentiments of the Greek-Americans of Chicago, to partake in the active political affairs, be they local, state, or national. There was a time when the naturalized citizens of the Greek population of Chicago were very limited. But during the last few years and due directly to the magnificent response shown by the Greeks during the participation of America in the World War, nearly the entire adult population of the Greeks of Chicago have become naturalized citizens.</p>
   <p>The larger portion of our people are followers of the policies of the Republican party and in all the recent campaigns they have taken a very active interest and represented themselves in a capacity of able leaders. During the last presidential elections the numerous Republican organizations of Chicago rendered their support to the leading candidate, guided in their actions by native sons of the Republic who have taken an interest in the Greek element.</p>

   <p>One of those who for years has taken an interest in the foreign language groups in general and in the Greeks in particular is the honorable Mr. A. B. Messer, an American with a broad heart and a gentle soul, a gentleman whose Americanism does not deter him from recognizing the rights of the foreign groups.</p>
   <p>Mr. Messer served the Republican party in many capacities and in the year 1919 became the manager of the campaign among foreign language groups. In that capacity, under Will Hays, among other services rendered he was instrumental in preventing hostile legislation aimed at the foreign language press. In the campaign of 1928 Mr. Messer served in the capacity of manager of the estern Division of the Foreign Language Groups, under Wm. E. Hall.</p>
   <p>In the heated campaign of last year Mr. Messer had shown his interest in the Greek-American element by appointing as campaign speakers of the party in the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, etc. Messers Geo. Spannon and Geo. Spannon and Geo. Porikos, two of our most prominent young Greek lawyers in Chicago.</p>

   <p>In the person of Mr. Messer the Greeks have a true friend and a strong supporter of their rights. And Mr. Messer also may rest assured that the Greek voters of Chicago, appreciating his interest, will always lend him their support.</p>
