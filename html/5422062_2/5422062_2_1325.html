   <p>p. 2- Dr. Tassos Koliopoulos, nephew of John Koliopoulos, prosperous business man and president of Mortal Sleep of the Virgin Mary parish, has come to our city to complete his study of surgery.</p>
   <p>This young physician, desiring to become a surgeon, prefers to pursue his studies in America because American hospitals have the most complete equipment of the latest surgical instruments, and their methods are likewise most modern.</p>
