   <p>p. 5.- The well-known Atlas Exchange National Bank, under Nick Kyriakopoulos, has merged with the West Side National Bank and has moved its offices to the bank building on the corner of Ashland and Roosevelt Road.</p>
   <p>The new bank will be known as the West Side Atlas National Bank of Chicago and will keep the same stockholders and customers of the two banks.</p>
   <p>The Greek people, former patrons, who for many years have used this bank, will find that the same courtesy and convenience will prevail. There are two new Greek directors on the staff of the bank. Peter Malakates has been with the bank since its establishment and is now vice-president. His co-worker is Michael Hatsos, who also has much knowledge of the banking business.</p>
