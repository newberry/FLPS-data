   <p>The Greeks of Chicago today are wearing the blue and white of the Hellenic kingdom, along with the red, white and blue of their adopted land, following a patriotic demonstration Thursday of Greece's entry in the War on the side of the allies.</p>
   <p>It was the anniversary of the day on which King Constantine was hurled from his throne after trying to deliver his people to the Kaiser and Premier Venizelos led the nation in declaring against the Hohenzollerns.</p>
   <p>A celebration was held in the Blackstone theater to mark the anniversary, and while 3,000 inside the theater cheered the speakers, a great crowd in the street clamored for admission to the already crowded meeting.</p>
