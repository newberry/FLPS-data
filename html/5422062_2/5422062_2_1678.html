   <p>p. 3. Next Thursday, the Aragon, a new luxurious temple for Terpsichorians, a scintillating gem of Greek progressiveness, opens its doors to the public. The owner of the Aragon is, the great enterprising Greek, Mr. Andrew Karzas. The cost, of this ornament to our city, is $2,000,000.</p>
   <p>The ever progressing Mr. Karzas, in order to present to the City of Chicago, a monument of beauty, luxury and art, visited many European capitols and individually selected the proper designs for the architecture of the Aragon.</p>
   <p>The edifice is of Spanish style, with European and American architectural art combined, and its interior and exterior lavishly decorated. It is the last word in architectual masterpieces.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki, which never fails to render honors and praise to the ones that are really worthy, congratulates Mr. Karzas and extends to him sincere wishes for the success of his new enterprise.</p>
