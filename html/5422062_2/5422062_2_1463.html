   <p>An addition to the many Greek business houses on Halsted Street was made last Saturday. It is a restaurant at 528 South Halsted. It is called the Tri-Motto. This restaurant supplies a long-felt need because people employed in that neighborhood have been unable to find a clean, yet economical place in which to eat.</p>
   <p>The Tri-Motto is up-to-date and attractive. It features both Greek and American cuisine. It is managed by a capable restaurateur, W. G. Bakon. This restaurant is a credit to the Greek people, and we hope it will be a great success.</p>
