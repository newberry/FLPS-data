   <p>The Honorable Richard Yates, whose picture we are publishing above, is well known in the Greek Community of Chicago. On July 4, Mr. Yates was asked to speak before the Greek people of Chicago in Grant Park. His speech caused great enthusiasm because it was full of patriotism and genuine feeling toward the Greeks and Greece.</p>
   <p>While Mr. Yates was Governor of Illinois, he served in that high office with energy and distinction. He is a man of liberal thought; his upbringing and family traditions being purely American. His father was Governor of Illinois also. He was one of the most intimate friends and supporters of President Lincoln. During the Civil War he recruited sixteen regiments for the Union Army in two weeks' time.</p>

   <p>Mr. Richard Yates is a candidate for the Congress of the United States. He is well loved by both the Republicans and the Democrats.</p>
   <p>We urge all eligible Greek voters of Chicago and Illinois to cast their vote for an able executive, an experienced statesman, and a staunch friend of the Greek people.</p>
