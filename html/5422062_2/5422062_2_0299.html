   <p>p. 1.--In the last presidential election campaign the Greeks displayed great interest in politics. From the Atlantic to the Pacific voters of Grecian descent formed political organizations in both the major parties.</p>
   <p>This shows that the Greek immigrant is beginning to understand the importance of naturalization and of taking part in the politics of the country with the object of electing honest officials for the country's welfare and the public safety.</p>
   <p>In Chicago the center of Greek activity in the Republican party was the Coolidge-Dawes Greek-American Club which organized to direct all the other Greek Republican organizations in this country. The offices of this club were in the Wrigley Building with the other central offices of the Republican party.</p>

Lambros, and Paul Demos, vice-chairmen, John Askounis, secretary, A. G. Stavrou, assistant secretary, G. Chiagouris, treasurer, Xenophon Alafouzos, John Alex, C. Avgerinos, Alex Balaskas, E. M.
