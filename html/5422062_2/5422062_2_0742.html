   <p>Bonds of the Third Liberty Loan have been on sale since the latter part of last week in Chicago and throughout the United States. A telegram coming from the office of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. McAdoo, at midnight, Friday, announced throughout the length and breadth of the United States that the Third Liberty Loan is at the disposal of the general public, and that the coverage of this loan is left to and depends upon the patriotism of the people.</p>
   <p>The news of this telegraphic wire was followed by the firing of guns, the ringing of church bells in every village, by the screaming sirens of factories and ships. For half an hour the deafening noise was announcing to the Kaiser and his allies that the inexhaustible wealth and riches of America are ready to be mobilized and used in the defense of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the freedom of all peoples and for the rescue of humanity.</p>
   <p>Such was the psychological condition of the people, and its patriotism rose to such heights that on the next day, with the opening of the banks, literally millions of bonds of this patriotic loan were offered and sold in behalf of the sacred struggle for freedom.</p>
   <p>What moved and moves all deeply, however, is the offer of a widow, who lost her only son in the war, to buy the first bond sold in this great Liberty Loan drive.</p>
   <p>Rejoice all you tender, noble, and patriotic hearts; you whose heart is pulsating hopefully and bravely every day, always remembering those who are fighting in the field of honor, those who left behind all and marched to distant foreign soil, far from home and hearth, far from the bosom of family and beloved ones, to fight for civilization and the freedom of all peace-loving peoples.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Rejoice, ye proud and honored parents, who have borne such lions, such knights, and angels. You, too, honored sisters, who have been deprived of the pillars and pride of your homes.</p>
   <p>Rejoice and again rejoice, ye honored wives that are bereft of husband and protector; you, too, beloved and dearest children, that with tears in your eyes have seen the father depart, the father, who upon leaving home, left such an unfilled void, but on returning, brought such happiness and joy. This person has now left for the slaughtering grounds. Rejoice, you feeble creatures, who do not know whether you will again see him who gave you life and an honorable name.</p>
   <p>Rejoice and again rejoice, ever-glorious and honored United States of America, you that have borne, reared, and raised these heroic men, who, on being separated from us, are going to fight under the Stars and Stripes, far away from your sacred soil, for the great principles of liberty, equality, and independence, which are indispensable and <span class="page-break">\4</span>vital elements in the life and well-being of your noble sons.</p>
   <p>Rejoice and again rejoice, American men and women, children of a classic, honored, and sacred land, fight for lofty ideals, and sacrifice your life and wealth for the sake of civilization and for the sacred and inalienable rights of all men and nations.</p>
   <p>If you will not find rest in the land in which you first saw the bright sunlight; if you Greeks are not laid to rest in the sweet bosom of Greece's soil; Americans, if your graves are not decorated by the fragrant flowers of California and Florida, they will be adorned with the pure white marble of Pentelieus [Translator's note: Mountain in Greece--marble quarry], and the gleaming marble of Italy, with which glorious mausoleums will be erected in your honor, in which your ivory bones will be placed. On your eternal monuments the history of the world will inscribe your glorious names in golden letters.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>If generations since the times of the Greeks and Romans commemorate the names of the heroes of Marathon and the fallen at Leuctra, the generations of all time will commemorate and bless your names; your glory and renown will live forever, even unto the end of time.</p>
