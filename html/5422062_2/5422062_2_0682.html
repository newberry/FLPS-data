   <p>Here is an opportunity for every American--man or woman, young or old, regardless of nationality--to come forward and do his duty for Uncle Sam.</p>
   <p>We need volunteers who will help us sell War-Savings Stamps. We must also have a list of men and women who can speak in public. Only a few moments of your spare time will help greatly--an evening a week. Sunday afternoon or evening. Only a small part of your available time will be of great help to us.</p>
   <p>So, sign the following blank in the space provided, mark the day or evening which you desire to devote to this noble cause, and mail it to Mrs. M. Pflaum, War-Savings Committee, 403 Conway Building.</p>
