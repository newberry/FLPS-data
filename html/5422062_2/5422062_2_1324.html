   <p>The Greek Professional Men's Club of Chicago has completed the third year of its existence and has entered the fourth. The club has elected the following officers for the coming period: S. Kotakis, president, C. Thomas, first vice-president, J. Atsalinos, second vice-president, G. Porikos, secretary, G. Arahovitis, treasurer, G. Kyriakopoulos, historian, and S. Zaph, A. Pantelis, C. Paptheodorov, D. Parry, and Mr. Apalainis, counselors.</p>
   <p>The Greek Professional Men's Club, within the limits of its powers, has contributed to the social activities of our community by a series of lectures, by the celebration of the Fifty Year Jubilee of Palama, and by the splendid dinner served for the benefit of the Athenian College, attended by the Greek Ambassador, Mr. H. Simopoulos, the former American Ambassador to Greece, Mr. Kops, Mrs. E. Sikelianos, lecturer, and others. We have no doubt that the new executive council will continue the Club's activities for the term ensuing. The Greek community has much to expect of the Greek Professional Men's Club of Chicago.</p>
