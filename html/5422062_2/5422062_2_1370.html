   <p>The ancient Greeks used to say that one must be afraid of liars because they are devils. The Greeks of today have these devils in their midst impersonating doctors and other professional men.</p>
   <p>Instead of helping the poor, ignorant Greeks, who are lost in a strange land, the professionals do their best to exploit them in every possible manner. We are issuing a warning to these smart professional men.</p>

   <p>At present there are 20,000 Greeks in Chicago. They are rapidly becoming Americanized and it will be a sad day for the professionals when these "foreigners" wake up.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the doctors, lawyers, teachers, and so forth, of Greek descent to help and advise their countrymen. Show them what is right and what is wrong. It is your duty to be proud of them and happy that they are here!</p>
