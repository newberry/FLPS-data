   <p>The condition of the world today demonstrates the hopelessness of expecting a limitation of armaments by international agreement and the futility of endeavouring to induce countries to depend for their security on paper guarantees. Since the Great War, successive British governments have advocated universal disarmament and the conclusion of pacts which would make war impossible. They sacrificed the country's defense on the altar of collective security, and assured the people that if they showed a little faith and exercised patience, all would turn out for the best, for then the nations of the world would be working together in peace and concord.</p>
   <p>Today, the world resounds to the tramp of armed men, and instead of hope of consolidating peace, there is fear of another world war. Italy, preparing to wage a more ruthless campaign in Abyssinia, warns members of the League of Nations that if they dare to curb her activities they may be responsible for plunging Europe into war. Germany's ambitious military plans have caused alarm among neighbors. Relations between Japan and the Soviet are reported to be strained, and a race in naval armaments in the Pacific Ocean is threatening. In some quarters, doubtless Germany's decision to rearm will be attributed to the failure of international statesmen to concede her equality in armaments. Such equality was promised, but without waiting for fulfillment Germany, whose security was not menaced, took what she demanded and made an end of the grievance of which she complained. For years her rulers, while declaring their enthusiasm for peace, have been stealthily evading the limitations of the Versailles Treaty. They have found a moral and responsible justification for their action in a recital of their country's wrongs.</p>
   <p>Two years ago the British Government proposed that Germany's demand for security might be satisfied by the raising of an army of between 200,000 and 300,000 men. In the French army there were then about 400,000 men. It appears now that by the end of this year Germany will have approximately 550,000 regular soldiers and, with those that have been trained or partly trained, at least 1,600,000 men. Her air force, too, has reached parity with that of Britain, and it is hoped that the country's output of aeroplanes will reach 4,000 a year. In short, the world is back to prewar conditions. There is little difference between a Germany ruled by Herr Hitler in a brown uniform and a Germany under an Emperor in shining armor. Each embodies the principle of German might, and imposes on neighboring countries the duty of maintaining such armaments as are deemed necessary for defense of their frontiers. Nevertheless, there are some compensations to be found in a menacing situation. Germany, for example, has no longer the grievance of being an inferior state. She is now as strong as any of her powerful neighbors, and if she should adopt an unreasonable attitude she will make herself the victim of that policy of encirclement which she dreads. Her people, too, cannot have forgotten their experiences in the Great War already. They must agree with one of their military leaders who said, "Europe is too small to hold another battlefield".</p>
   
   <p>Above all, it may be a great gain for the nations of Europe, including Germany herself, to take due account of a highly explosive atmosphere. If they do they may work together for the avoidance of a general catastrophe.</p>
