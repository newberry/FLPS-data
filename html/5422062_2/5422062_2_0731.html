   <p>Prominent Chicago Greek is Here for the Drive - Many Native-Born Citizens May Well Take Lessons in Patriotism from Them</p>
   <p>p. 1</p>
   <p>Mason City's Liberty Loan quota will be doubled or more than doubled in subscriptions if the bond purchasers of native-born Americans approach the ratio of those who were born in Greece, and who in many cases are not yet naturalized!</p>
   <p>In spite of any reasons which they may have to think that their patriotism was not appreciated in the past, that they were misjudged, and that their motives were misinterpreted, the Greeks are going far beyond everybody's <span class="page-break">2</span>expectations in their subscriptions.</p>
   <p>Special Meetings</p>
   <p>Special meetings for Greek citizens, held under the direction of the Foreign Language Division of the Seventh Federal Reserve District organization, were held at the industrial plants of the city yesterday with good results.</p>
   <p>The speaker assigned to Mason City was a fine one - a really prominent Greek-American, whose services have been recognized recently by his native land.</p>
   <p>This man is Constantine P. Triandafil, of Chicago, head of a great importing and exporting house, a man who stands high in Chicago, with Americans of other descent as well as with Greeks.</p>
   <p>Mr. Triandafil understands the Liberty Loan proposition thoroughly and is heart and soul in the campaign. To emphasize this, he told a Mason City Greek <span class="page-break">3</span>to-day that he "would fight shoulder to shoulder with the Devil if necessary in order to win the war."</p>
   <p>"If you are willing to do that," said the Mason City Greek, "I'll stake all I've got," and he proceeded to write a check for most of his bank balance for Liberty bonds.</p>
   <p>Many Meetings</p>
   <p>The first meeting for Greeks was held at the Lehigh plant at 11:30 A. M. yesterday. All the men gathered in the machine shop. Oscar E. Davis, superintendent, said last night that the statements of Mr. Triandafil had brought results, for several Greeks had already, of their own accord, made their second subscriptions when they realized how much depended, both for the country of their adoption and for their native land, on the success of the loan.</p>
   <p>At 1:15 P. M. another fine meeting was held at the Northwestern States Portland <span class="page-break">4</span>Cement plant, in the engine-room, where equally good results were obtained.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon meetings were held at two central points in the brickyard district. Last evening another meeting took place in the big cafe on Jackson Avenue, which was thronged with foreign-born workers, and tremendous results were obtained.</p>
   <p>The Chicago man has just one complaint to make of Mason City - that is the manner in which the really good things which the Greeks have done here seem to have been overlooked. As a result of his visit a permanent Chamber of Commerce committee, headed by James J. Manusos, is to be named, which will handle all matters relating to Greek-American residents.</p>

   <p>My dear Mr. McNider: I am pleased to report that Mr. Constantine P.

The fact that we shall report 100 per cent of sales among the people of Greek birth here is evidence of the effectiveness of his work. He has wonderful force and influence among his people and should be sent to them wherever they may be in need of enlightenment as to the help they may and should be to our government.</p>
