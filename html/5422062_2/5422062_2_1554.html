   <p>The firm of Demos Motor Sales Company has opened an extention sales room to serve its many customers in the vicinity of 5342-46 Belmont Avenue.</p>
   <p>For a number of years Mr. Demos was engaged in operating this line of business at 4325 W. Grand Avenue. He is special agent for De Soto and Plymouth automobiles, and the only agent whose orders are filled directly from the factory. That means a great saving for the buyers.</p>
