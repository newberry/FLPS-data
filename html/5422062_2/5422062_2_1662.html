   <p>The well known enterprising young Greek, Panos Anagnostopoulos, after a $40,000 expenditure, last Saturday opened the doors of the luxurious "Hopper", with the tantalizing echoes of a brilliant orchestra.</p>
   <p>The entire spacious restaurant and Confectionery hall of the "Hopper" was transformed in to a garden of flowers sent so lavishly by friends, relatives and patrons that the hall resembled hanging gardens of the past.</p>
   <p>The famous "Hopper" is an ornament to the upper part of the city. Congratulations to the young Greek.</p>
