   <p>Since the closing of the Chicago World's Fair, a large number of Greek businessmen in the city, whose business had increased during the Fair, have complained of a sizable drop in their profits. They blame this slump on the general economic condition of the nation, and they sit idly by, watching their stores drift against the rocks of failure.</p>
   <p>It has never occurred to them to improve conditions by improving themselves. Modernization, synchronization, new ideas, and new systems are unknown, quanities to a great many Greek entrepreneurs. That is why the Greek Chamber of Commerce and various other Greek organizations and clubs in the city should do some worth-while things--such as giving lectures and conducting classes on business management and methods--instead of expending their energy in arranging dances.</p>
   <p>If these classes were provided, there would be no excuse for the backwardness <span class="page-break">\2</span>and stagnation of the Greeks in business. There are thousands of things they could be taught in relation to their occupations that would be of great benefit. And we have a few persons who are capable of providing the necessary instruction.</p>
