   <p>The Greek Star editorially joins in the pledge already expressed by a majority of foreign language newspapers in Chicago support the United States in any event growing out of the present international crisis. Its editorial says, in part:</p>
   <p>"Now it is not anymore a question of being pro-ally or pro-German, but it is a question of pure Americanism. And we, as Greek-Americans-loyal Americans-are here to stand by the flag-the flag that flies over 'land of the free and the home of the brave'.</p>
   <p>CROATIANS RENEW PLEDGE TO U.S.</p>
   <p>Austria Hungary's indorsement of the new German submarine policy is the inspiration today of a new pledge of loyalty to the United States by the Chicago Croatian daily Hrvatska Zastava. It says in part:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"Now, since we are advised that the Austro-Hungarian government has officially declared its approval of Germany's policy of ruthless submarine warfare, we do not doubt that President Wilson will break off diplomatic relations with the dual empire, too, although this may be considered a mere formality. Nevertheless, we American citizens of Croatian descent and Croatian inhabitants of the United States deem it necessary to express on this occasion our fullest confidence in the wisdom of President Wilson and of his government and our readiness to put at the disposal of the government ourselves, our services, our lives, and our fortunes.</p>
   <p>"We shall readily follow the presidents call at any time and against any foe of this land of the free, but declare that in this special case, where his move is directed against our arch foes, the Teutons, especially Austria-Hungary, we shall flock under the stars and stripes with twofold zeal."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"To help preserve the ideals and sacred traditions of this, our adopted country, the United States of America; to revere its laws and inspire others to respect and obey them; to strive unceasingly to quicken the public's sense of civic duty; in all ways to aid in making this country greater and better than we found it".</p>
   <p>This is the expressed aim of the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers, which includes practically every foreign language newspaper in the country with the exception of the German.</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambras, publisher of the Greek Star, and John F. Smulski of the Polish World will go to Springfield today to extend a formal invitation to Governor Lowden to address a special meeting of the Chicago branch of the association at the Advertising building this week.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Governor Lowden has already informally signified that he will speak at the meeting on "What America Expects of the Foreigner". Mr. Smulski is to talk on "What the Foreigner Can Do for America."</p>
   <p>Mr. Lambras will preside at the meeting. He says there are 780 newspapers in the association, of which seventy-five are located in Chicago. These seventy-five newspapers printed in thirty different languages, represent over seventy per cent of the foreign population of Chicago, the most cosmopolitan city in the world.</p>
