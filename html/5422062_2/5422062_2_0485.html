   <p>The Greek colony, of Chicago, welcomes with unalloyed joy the appointment of one of its foremost citizens and a lawyer of distinction, Mr. Andrew J. Vlachos, as an assistant state's attorney by the honorable John A. Swanson.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andrew J. Vlachos has made Chicago his home for the last thirty years and has, in that period, fortified himself with the knowledge of law and has mastered the principles underlying our form of government in all its intricacies. His career as a lawyer for the past twenty years or so has been most commendable. Our Greek-American citizens have had more than one occasion to be proud of one of its most representative citizens.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos' appointment proves once more the need of our compatriots banding themselves together with the object of promoting good government and securing the necessary recognition from the political leaders of the city, the county and the state. This recognition should be commensurate to their strength in numbers and influence.</p>

   <p>Greeks run thousands of stores in Chicago and the surrounding territory, and influence many thousands of voters.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago, being engaged mostly in business, vote largely the Republican ticket. Like other Republicans, they ally themselves with one faction or another. The larger faction at present is without doubt the Deneen following. In recognition of heavy Greek-American support given the Deneen group in Cook County, comes the appointment of Mr. Andrew J. Vlachos as an assistant state's attorney, a position, which, we are confident, Mr. Andrew Vlachos will fill with honor to himself, to the land of his birth, and to the land whose laws and systems of government he is called upon to uphold, in the courts of the country.</p>
