   <p>Part 1st. Historical Background.</p>
   <p>P. 1</p>
   <p>We are requested to outline the progress of the Greeks of Chicago up to 1926. To do this with justice it is necessary to sketch the historical background of the Greeks in the United States. It is very little known that Greece had a Lafayette, who also came here when the American revolution broke out in 1776, leading a small body of other Greeks and fought in the American army.</p>
   <p>His name was Demetrios Ypsilantis, who was of the family of Cominos, an emperor of Constantinople. Love of liberty and admiration of the American cause and ideals were the motives which brought his band here. They fought throughout the war and did not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>leave the American soil until peace with England was signed. In honor of the Greek fighters the residents of a town in Michigan named it Ypsilanti, and the picture of the leader, Demetrios Ypsilantis, hangs in one of its public places.</p>
   <p>From then on to 1897, there was intermittent immigration into the United States from Greece, particularly from Sparta, Arcadia and the Greek Islands. In 1821, at the time of the Greek war of independence, many Americans, friends of Greece, fought on Greek soil against Turkey; and the American people in general helped the starving Greek population of those dark days by donations of abundant food, clothing and other necessaries, which were sent to Greece. Some of the Americans have adopted Greek children, brought them to America, educated them, and many of them have become prominent in the educational and political life in various parts of that country. Mr. Anagnostou of Boston, Mass. for years the head of the institution for the deaf and dumb, and two others, who became congressmen, were among those who excelled in prominence.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Some of them entered the American Navy and rose to the highest offices therein.</p>
   <p>But the flood of Greek immigration began in 1897, after the disaster of Greece in the Turko-Greek war, mainly because of economic conditions in Greece, and the desire of Greeks to find new avenues for their betterment, which is a national characteristic of the Greek race.</p>
   <p>Since then about a half million Greeks have come to America and are scattered all over the country. Naturally the largest cities have the most populous Greek communities.</p>
   <p>When the writer came to Chicago in 1903, the Greek population of the city did not exceed five thousand mostly single fellows of youthful age. A great number came from villages, from farms, etc. None of these Greeks spoke English. Never had they gone out of the confines of their village, nor had they come in contact with Americans or other races alien <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to them. It may seem strange to be told that scarcely any of them had ever seen a confectionery store or an ice-cream parlor. Nor had they been in the restaurant, theater or other lines of business where they now predominate. Their capital, when they arrived here was not more than twenty-five dollars per person, but they brought with them the progressive spirit of the Greek race.</p>
   <p>They found themselves in a strange land, and were confronted by a new standard of life. Everything was "Greek to them". It was necessary for them to learn the language which they thought very difficult, to learn the constitution of the land and acquaint themselves with the laws of the State and the regulations of the city. This condition applied not only to the Greeks of Chicago, but to all of them in the United States.</p>
   <p>Part II. Domestic Condition.</p>
   <p>In approximately a quarter of a century there has developed a Greek community in Chicago of about seventy-five thousand.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Although these are not the exact figures, it may be safely estimated that the number of Greek families exceed ten thousand. The males have not only married the thousands of Greek women who have come over since, or who have been born here, but also American women of many stocks. The Greek parents are keen for education of their children and send them to schools, colleges, academies and universities. Although the tradition of Greek parents has been against the participation of daughters in industry, yet in harmony with the American custom, they have for some time past prepared their daughter to enter useful and paying vocations. Many of the Greek families of Chicago own their homes. Anyone entering a Greek home will find the highest standards of cleanliness and sanitation, and an atmosphere of refinement and culture, which would do credit to any other nationality of our cosmopolitan population.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Part III. Religious, Professional and Social Life.</p>
   <p>From their first establishment, the Greeks of Chicago built houses of worship and there are today five churches of the Greek orthodox faith, one on the south side, two in the north section and two on the west and further west sections of the city. Chicago is the diocese of one of the Greek Bishops in America. In connection with their churches the Greeks are operating schools where the language of the land and other American courses are taught, together with the Greek language and Greek history. The Greek churches have done much to promote the welfare of the population to which they minister.</p>
   <p>A few professional Greeks came to Chicago as immigrants, most of them being physicians. Up to the present, the Greek communities of Chicago have given more than thirty physicians and surgeons, a number of dentists, architects and about twelve lawyers, graduates of American institutions. Some of the physicians and surgeons are on the staffs of our <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>leading hospitals. The Universities of Chicago, Northwestern and others contain a very respectable number of students of Greek extraction, and they have become sufficiently Americanized so that one of them named Devatenos, played upon the University of Chicago football team during the season of 1924. The University students have for some years had a club, Plato, to aid students in their scholarship and to nourish and develop the love of literature and philosophy among them.</p>
   <p>Beside Plato, there is the Greek Professional Men's Club, containing the practicing professional men of Greek extraction in the city, with the object of promoting friendship, understanding and mutual helpfulness among the members and to promote Americanization among the Greeks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Considering journalism as still a profession and not a business, it is appropriate at this point to state that there have been published in Greek, for some years back in Chicago, The Greek Daily and the following weekly papers, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>The Greek Star which lately contains matter in both Greek and English; Saloniki and Arcadia; also the monthly magazines, Religious Echo, containing religious matter, and the Educational Echo, published by the young students of the Greek school, Socrates, and containing educational matter, both of them in the Greek language. Besides, for the past three years, a weekly paper, and The Greek Review a monthly periodical, have been published in Chicago both in the English language.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago have developed their social life. They are no longer confined to certain sections of the west side, but are settled all over the city. They have formed for their convenience, five communities, the purpose of which is to build churches in connection with schools, help the needy, promote the general welfare of their members and work toward a better understanding with the American people in general. They have numerous benevolent societies for the assistance of their members in particular, and the assistance <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>of all in general, in case of sickness and for their individual and social development.</p>
   <p>A recently formed and even now notable organization among the Greeks of America, as well as Chicago, with branches everywhere, is the Greek-American Order, Ahepa, the purpose of which is the promotion of the Americanization of the Greeks in America and the development of true understanding among them and the American people.</p>
   <p>The Greek women have long had an organization which has been very active in charitable work. The Greek daughters of the new generation have also founded three clubs to promote the social life of the young Greek women, to help indigent families and to do general charitable work. One can get a great impression of the social development and individual refinement of the Greeks in Chicago by attending any of the many balls and banquets given by them during the course of a year for philanthropic purposes, political causes, or mere social entertainment.</p>

   <p>Part I V. Commercial Progress.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago have become prominent in business. Much of the confectionery business of Chicago is controlled by them. The Greek confectionery stores exceed five thousand. In the restaurant business they have also proved themselves very successful and there are no less than five thousand Greek-American restaurants in the city. The name Raklios and Company, which has more than thirty restaurants in the loop alone, is a remarkable monument to John Raklios, a poor immigrant (as all of us were) who went through many struggles and poverty to reach that business achievement.</p>
   <p>The firm of Peppas and Alex, in the business of hotel and restaurant supplies, is one of the largest concerns of its kind in this country, and is known all over the United States and Canada. The Greeks are big manufacturers of ice-cream and candies and are among the leaders of these <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>articles in the city. The Greeks have also been very successful in the grocery business, the fruit and vegetable trade, the florist business and in other branches of trade. More lately they have successfully gone into the motion picture theater and ballroom enterprises.</p>
   <p>Andrew Karzas has been translating his keen perception of artistic fineness and beauty of design to his theaters and to the Trianon and Aragon ballrooms.</p>
   <p>For many years the Greeks have been engaged in the importing of European and Oriental products to America and the exporting of American products to other countries.</p>
   <p>A number of Greeks are occupying positions in banks and other big institutions and offices, and there is a great number of workmen in factories and other industries. It is appropriate to mention here that the Atlas Exchange National Bank, Halsted and Taylor Streets, whose <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>President is the attorney and banker, Daniel M. Healy, is a sound establishment and its progress in that section of the city has been remarkable.</p>
   <p>The activities of the Greeks in long term leaseholds and in the purchase and ownership of real estate, and particularly city corners and acreage, within the past ten years, are a remarkable achievement. There are now a number of building contractors, and these are developing their holdings by building thereon. The real estate activities are indicative of the decision of the Greek population to remain a permanent part of the people of this land. Space does not permit the writer to mention the many others of the Greek community who have acquired prominent and even notable achievements in their various lines. Many of the above lines of business have their flourishing trade associations, such as the American Restaurant Association and the Greek Confectionery Association.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>Part V. Political and National Life.</p>
   <p>The writer believes that the Greek voters in Chicago number at least twenty-five thousand. They are almost entirely divided between the two major political parties. The Greeks were slow to become naturalized. They loved their native land did not want to alienate themselves from it readily, nor to adopt American citizenship without thorough consideration. This slow process due to careful thought, before taking the serious step of becoming citizens, makes for a higher quality of citizenship in those who have finally taken it. During the past fifteen years, however, and especially since the great war, they have become citizens in large numbers and are developing a strong interest in political campaigns. They have their share of political clubs, which are so characteristic of our democracy, among all sections of our people.</p>
   <p>There are a number of Greeks who are holding political positions. There is no doubt that they would manifest still greater interest in politics if some of them were elected to offices by the suffrage of the people.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>It would be an unpardonable omission on the part of the writer not to mention with pride the remarkable record of the Greeks of Chicago, and all over the United States, not only as law-abiding citizens, but also as contributors, in abundance and with cheerfulness, to all campaigns for Liberty Loans and the Red Cross during the great war and especially in the participation of more than 75,000 of Greeks in the great war under the flag of our Republic, the United States of America.</p>
   <p>The contributions of the Greeks to the Red Cross were not made during the years of the European War only. They have been made since, in all the campaigns of the Red Cross; but it is necessary to mention especially in this connection that they gave "until it hurt" to the Near East Relief, the greatest philanthropic movement of the century, engaged inby the United States under the inspiration of that eminent American, Henry Morgenthau, former Ambassador to Turkey. It was the means of saving millions of suffering Armenians, Syrians and Jews, as well as Greeks, and aided in the settlement <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>in Greece of about a million and one-half refugees from Asia and Thrace.</p>
   <p>In view of the tremendous progress of the Greeks in Chicago and elsewhere in the United States during their short life here, may we not hope that the future will bring forth still greater achievements from them, making not only for the betterment of the life of the Greek-American stock of our Republic, but also furthering the common interest, welfare, honor and glory of our beloved and wonderful city of Chicago, and of all the people of the greatest land in the world, the United States of America.</p>
