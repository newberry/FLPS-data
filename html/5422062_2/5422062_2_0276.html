   <p>p.2... We have learned with pleasure that another organization of Greek-American citizens has recently been launched under the title of Sons of Hellas Club. Its aim is to promote political action among Greeks for the coming election, an activity which has been very much neglected. It is about time for drastic measures to be taken to raise the prestige of Greeks to the same level as that of other nationalities which enjoy the esteem of the local authorities. These other nationalities are even taken into account by authorities outside the local boundary limits and are recognized as important factors in the political life of their adopted country.</p>
