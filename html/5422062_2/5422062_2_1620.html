   <p>Our visit to the Villa-Volka Grill assured us that the Greek people were not behind in new ideas and architecture. This new restaurant which has been opened by D. Valos and J. Katsoulis on Ohio and Cass Streets is one of the most modern to be found in Chicago. Its individuality is expressed in the Spanish influence which prevails in furnishings and decorations. C. E. Hichinger and Co. designed and furnished this modern and unique eating place. They and the owners should be congratulated on the success of their undertaking. This is now one of the most beautiful restaurants in our city.</p>
