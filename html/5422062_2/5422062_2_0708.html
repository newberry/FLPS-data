   <p>"Our heart is ever carried to the plains of Picardy, where the freedom of the world is being hazarded. We follow with anxiety the soldiers of liberty who struggle heroically to stop the barbarous tide. We must not be afraid of the fury of the enemy. They will be smashed.</p>
   <p>"Those who assail the democracies, in order to force upon the world absolutism, are fanatics. A teaching of fifty years has instilled in their minds the idea of subjection to the will of a divine majesty, the Kaiser. They thus become the apostles of the idea of absolutism, which they are trying to force upon the world.</p>
   <p>"Let us be equally fanatic in our conception of freedom. Let us defend our ideal with the same tenacity, and we shall win. In spite of the strength of our enemies, we shall defeat them. The ancient Greeks were a mere handful <span class="page-break">\2</span>of men; they defeated the Persian colossus because their love of freedom was a religious love, and because they preferred death to a life of subjection and slavery.</p>
   <p>"We will win, if we strengthen not only our material strength, but also, and particularly, our moral strength. It is our moral strength that will increase the resistance and will secure victory. In our efforts to gain this end, we must abandon abstract discussions.....We must take the individual as he is, with his particular psychology. Peoples, as well as individuals, are subject to general laws. The collective or group interest impels peoples, as well as individuals. Abstract ideas appeal only to the aristocracy--not to the masses.</p>
   <p>"Our armies are composed of men of superior mentality; our actions must inspire them. These armies are made up of various nationalities. Everyone of them has had different aspirations. We must be aware of these aspirations, so that we can inspire the nation concerned, and, as a consequence, the <span class="page-break">\3</span>army which it furnishes. The English soldier, for instance, fights in order to maintain the world-wide power of Great Britain. The French soldier fights to liberate his beloved provinces, Alsace and Lorraine, which were taken from France against her will. The Italian and the Greek soldiers fight to free their brothers from an odious and horrible subjection. These sentiments are profound, and act powerfully upon the soldiers. The American soldier fights to save democracy, the destruction of which will threaten his freedom as well. Everyone who is fighting for the general ideal, is fighting also for his particular and cherished ideal. Have we strengthened the moral forces of these people? No.</p>
   <p>"I read scholarly articles discussing the right of France to her provinces. The rights of Italy are discussed with legal terminology. Greeks, Serbians, and Roumanians have the prospect of being forced to give parts of their national territory to the Bulgarians, our common enemies. All that is said and written is gathered by the German system of propaganda, and is used by it in order to influence the fighting people. The work of discouragement <span class="page-break">\4</span>is fed by ourselves.</p>
   <p>"The work of destruction must cease; only the work of creation must remain. All our attention, all our anxiety must be directed towards only one purpose--how shall we win the war. We shall win it, if the patriotic feeling of the peoples is raised to the highest level so as to augment their power of resistance. The victor will be the people who are able to resist a quarter of an hour longer. We must also work to destroy the morale of the enemy.</p>
   <p>"Even today our best efforts only strengthen it; until today we have made a distinction between peoples and governments. Peoples are ruled according to their mentality; the German mentality completely accepts the concept which its government embodies. German Social Democracy has been the most obedient servant of Prussian militarism. When the more enlightened classes set such an example, what can the [political] conception of the majority of people be? The German people are as responsible for this war as their government, because <span class="page-break">\5</span>they accept the principle of domination. All the allies of Germany have the same responsibility--Germany is their master and they are her servants. The co-operation of these people with Germany force the Allies to maintain more than a million men in Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Saloniki. If these men were fighting in France, the war would be over by now.</p>
   <p>"Our enemies, knowing that they have friends and protectors among us, hope that even if they are defeated, they will have nothing to lose. This belief strengthens them and induces them to continue the struggle, in order, by such a victory, to obtain world domination, without any risk.</p>
   <p>"All these discussions diminish our moral force. Let us win the war first. We shall have time to discuss other matters afterwards. Our claims can be discussed freely and settled easily because between honest peoples such as the champions of freedom, every question will be settled in good faith. All our efforts must be co-ordinated in such a way as to augment our forces, material as well as moral. We must save ourselves, save the freedom of the <span class="page-break">\6</span>world, and our principles will be imposed without any resistance.</p>
   <p>"Acting thus, we shall win. Whatever may be the strength of our enemies--whatever may be the difficulties involved in securing, by our sacrifice, the freedom of the world--we shall render to humanity the greatest service. The role of America in the final result will be the most prominent. May I shout: Long live America! Long live Greece! Long live the Greeks of Chicago!</p>
   <p>"May God bless our arms in this war for liberty, justice, peace, and humanity."</p>
