   <p>With the approach of the November election one's thoughts turn to politics and to possible future civic leaders.</p>
   <p>At this point the question arises of what Greek-Americans, as a race, can do to contribute to the better government of their adopted country.</p>
   <p>Along with the benefits of naturalization the new citizen assumes certain duties and responsibilities.</p>
   <p>Among the many benefits acquired are governmental protection of one's rights, life, and property and the right to vote.</p>
   <p>Now the right to vote is no trifling privilege. It is a right which was obtained only after a fierce struggle, prolonged through centuries, between nobles and <span class="page-break">\2</span>plebeians. It is a right acquired by much bloodshed and heavy sacrifice.</p>
   <p>The fair sex likewise had to wage a constant and persistent struggle to gain the right to vote, a right so highly treasured and yet so widely abused in the present day.</p>
   <p>The vote is the power which controls, directly or indirectly almost all human endeavors, institutions, activities, and even emotions. Granting this premise, one readily concludes that the right to vote is the avenue through which one can rise to loftier heights, through which one who is lost in the woods can emerge into the light and achieve power.</p>
   <p>If, therefore, the right to vote is the avenue to success and power, Greek-American citizens should follow that avenue and succeed.</p>
   <p>But such success, as you all know is not achieved by one vote or two votes <span class="page-break">\3</span>alone, or by many scattered votes. It is achieved only through full cooperation of forces, through unity of effort, through a solid front.</p>
   <p>During the last two years there has been a tendency among Greek-American citizens to organize. First they organized socially, trying to rise to a higher level in this bewildering society into which they have been thrust. They have succeeded to a certain extent, but not perfectly. Then, just before it was too late, they began to organize in their commercial undertakings, a commendable step indeed, which should have been taken years ago.</p>
   <p>Finally they began to organize politically.</p>
   <p>In taking these steps Greek-Americans did not accomplish anything new under the sun. They only followed the natural course of affairs, emulating the other foreign groups which had preceded them in their migration to the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>These other foreign groups are a step ahead of the Greek-Americans, but what of it? The Greeks can catch up with them if they so desire.</p>
   <p>This problem of political organization faces the small Greek community as well as the large one. It is all a matter of degree.</p>
   <p>From my brief study of the situation I have concluded that most of the Greek communities in the smaller towns are not organized politically. However, when they do organize (for there are some small communities which have organized themselves for political purposes), they co-operate better and get fuller results from their efforts than similar organizations in larger cities. For whoever surveys the Greek-American political organizations existing in large cities will readily see the lack of full co-operation among the various clubs. The difference is this: while the smaller communities have non-partisan clubs and exert the influence of a controlling minority, at least in the local elections, the dissensions of the larger communities make them appear smaller than they <span class="page-break">\5</span>really are, and their influence is proportionately diminished.</p>
   <p>Why cannot each neighborhood where more than a hundred Greek-Americans reside organize a political club? Such a club can exert more influence than one at first realizes. There are plenty of such neighborhoods in Chicago and its environs, with thousands of votes still unorganized, unharnessed. An unharnessed, uncontrolled force produces no results.</p>
   <p>Only by organizing our voting strength can we push to the front in American political life. Others have done it; the Greeks can do it as well.</p>
   <p>This is a challenge to every man and woman, young or old who is capable of organizing a political club, to every one who is qualified to be a leader in the political field.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Let us inaugurate a new era in our political life and make the way smoother for the younger generation.</p>
   <p>Do your share! Co-operate! Become politically minded! By so doing you will not only render service to the government under which you live; you will also elevate the political status of the Greek race and benefit yourselves.</p>
   <p>The power of the vote is ours; let us use it wisely and make it produce the best results.</p>
   <p>It is high time for us to learn a lesson from our previous disastrous political ventures.</p>
   <p>Let us heed the sound advice of Benjamin Franklin, who in the days of the American Revolution said in a convention:</p>
   <p>"We must hang together, or we shall hang separately."</p>
