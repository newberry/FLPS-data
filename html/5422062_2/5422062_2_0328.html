   <p>The American Association of the Greek Community of Chicago was founded a year ago by the well-known Greek lawyer, Paul Demos. This is a fine example of a noteworthy organization, because without doubt it surpasses all other Greek clubs in achievement and development. Unlike most clubs, this one has a program and this program is followed. Some of its progress should be credited to the fine work of its president and council members, who are well chosen.</p>
   <p>Although this organization is primarily a political one, it worked very hard through the American press to aid the Greek cause.....To belong to this organization is worthy of praise because it is one that honors the Greek name. And so we advise everyone to join this fine association, and thus help both himself and our Fatherland.</p>
