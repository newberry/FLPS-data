   <p>The Greek women headed by Mrs. K. Salopoulos wholeheartedly endorsed Mrs. Ruth H. McCormick for Congressman at large.Circulars and petitions are sent to men folks to support Ruth.</p>
   <p>As women, we are happy that Mrs. McCormick chose to become a candidate, because she represents the highest type of womanhood, with all women's virtues, sweet, noble, fine, honest, and faithful. Surely the women of Illinois regardless of party must feel honored to realize what it means to them, when a woman of this type goes to Washington. We know that our men recognize the superb quality of statemanship in Ruth, and will vote for her, not only in tribute to their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters, and to all womanhood but because she will be a credit to Illinois.</p>
   <p>The women of Greek birth and descent readily recognize the splendid qualities of Mrs. McCormick, and we know that they will do all in their power within their circles of friends, relatives and acquaintances to get all the Greek men and women to vote for Ruth Hanna McCormick.</p>
