   <p>p. 3-.....Last week one of our worthy compatriots, Constantine Triantafillou passed away in the prime of his life and was buried with impressive rites.</p>
   <p>The funeral services were held in Evangelismos Church. The Reverend Father Hatzedemetrion officiated. Many wreaths were placed on the coffin, since the late Mr. Triantafillou was very active among Americans and a small group of Greeks, who highly esteemed him for his good character, honesty, and patriotic sentiments.</p>
   <p>He came here when he was very young and made good progress. At the funeral his brother George dispensed with the usual speeches.</p>
   <p>Saloniki extends its sympathy to the stricken family.</p>
