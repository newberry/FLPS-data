   <p>Three well-known Greek men, P. Kontominas, C. Pappas, and P. Malakates, have opened a new concern called "The Old Dutch Flour Company." Its offices and warehouses are at 831 West Polk Street in the building owned by P. Galanopoulos.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Kontominas has been in the flour business for many years, and has a large clientele of fine restaurants which buy all their flour from him. The addition of the other two gentlemen will triple the business because they are both well known and respected by Greek and American businessmen.</p>
