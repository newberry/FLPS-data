   <p>Near the Greek colony--at 107-109 South Halsted Street--there is a Greek store fixture concern, The Modern Store Fixture Company. It is owned and managed by two partners, Mr. Louis Douban and A. Koliakopoulos.</p>
   <p>These two men are well known in our community and they have successfully decorated and outfitted many beautiful restaurants and other types of stores. Any one who is considering opening a restaurant, bar, candy or fruit store, should visit this concern before making any decisions.</p>
