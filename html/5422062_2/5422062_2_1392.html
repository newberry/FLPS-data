   <p>Very few businessmen have the courage or the financial resources to enlarge or remodel their establishments during these insecure times. Those that do so are blessed with much faith in themselves, and are confident of being able to surmount any obstacles that may present themselves.</p>
   <p>One of these persons is Mr. Constantine Panasopoulos, known among the American people as Palmer, who has just opened one of the most aristocratic Greek restaurants in Chicago. During the past three years Mr. Palmer has had a restaurant at 19 East Ohio Street. He knew his business so well that his customers became very numerous and could not be accomodated in the old establishment. Therefore he moved to much larger premises at 15 East Ohio Street.....He has spent the last two months preparing the new restaurant so that it will be one of the finest in Chicago. It will seat eighty people and is the last word in fixtures, lighting, and decorating. Pies and cakes will be baked in a special kitchen by a Viennese pastry cook.....The fixtures and decorating have been done by the Albert Pick Company and the American Store Fixture Company.</p>
   <p>The place opened two weeks ago and is doing a tremendous business.</p>
