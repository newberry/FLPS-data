   <p>p. 8- This letter is addressed to our people directly by the Greek-American Democratic Voters' League of Cook County.</p>
   <p>On Tuesday, Nov. 3rd, an election will be held for the offices of President of the United States, Governor of Illinois, and United States senator and also for other offices, national, state and local, as well as for judicial positions.</p>
   <p>Our organization since its inception three years ago has been very active in city, county, and state, and it endorses all the Democratic candidates. We are particularly interested in the re-election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Senator James Hamilton Lewis, Governor Henry Horner, Thomas J. Courtney, state's attorney, Horace G. Lindheimer, county treasurer, Albert J. Horan, bailiff of the Municipal Court of Chicago, Joseph L. Gill, clerk of the Municipal <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Court, John J. Sonsteby, chief justice of the Municipal Court, and all the Democratic judges of the Municipal Court.</p>
   <p>Not only have they proved themselves friends of our people during their term of public service, but they have also made a splendid record as public officials in their respective offices.</p>
   <p>Among other things they have made it possible for us to carry on the activities of this organization by encouraging its officers and members and by co-operating with them to the fullest extent.</p>
   <p>The candidates of the Democratic ticket deserve the support of every right-thinking Greek citizen of Chicago.</p>
