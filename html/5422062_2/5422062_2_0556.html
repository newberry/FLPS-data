   <p>The Greek community of Chicago with great delight hears the appointment of George Kyriakopoulos as City Prosecutor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kyriakopoulos, native of historic Arcadia, came to Chicago thirty years ago. His ardent desire for education, and his natural inclination towards oratory, soon distinguished him when he became a member of the bar. The studious and ambitious scion of Arcadia, working days and studying nights, succeeded in entering his Hellenic name in the annals of law.</p>
   <p>In all national and social activities, he was one of the first to fight for the perpetuation of Greek traditions and ideals.</p>
   <p>As an American citizen, Mr. Kyriakopoulos, took an active part in the political arena, following the doctrines of the Democratic Party, and in 1918 was appointed Assistant States Attorney by Mackley Hoyne successfully serving for three years. During Mayor William E. Dever's administration, Mr. Kyriakopoulos was appointed City Prosecutor for a term of four years.</p>

   <p>His many friends wish him success to a higher office, for the benefit of the Greek community of Chicago, and for bringing honor to the Greeks through his appointment.</p>
