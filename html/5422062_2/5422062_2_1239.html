   <p>Due to the provision of the prevalent law that a newly arrived alien doctor unable to speak English, cannot obtain a medical license to practice his profession. Mr. Lambros, Editor of the Greek Star, appeared before the medical examiners of the State with Mr. Sarantos Loumous, a distinguished doctor from Greece, and after half an hour proved to that learned assembly, that a Greek doctor is a Doctor even if he does not speak English. The result was that Mr. Loumos took the examinations and obtained his medical license five days after his arrival here from Greece.</p>
   <p>We must bear in mind also that another Greek doctor, Constantine Theodorou was appointed as doctor of Cook County Jail, through the efforts of Mr. Lambros, still holding the position due to his skill and efficiency as a doctor.</p>
