   <p>Says It Is His Duty to City and</p>
   <p>Party to Rid Chicago of Thompsonism</p>
   <p>Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star and recognized leader of Greek Republicans in past political skirmishes, yesterday declared for the Democratic nominee, Robert M. Sweitzer, asserting that it was "his duty to the city and the party to help rid the city of Thompsonism."</p>
   <p>With the Lambros announcement came a statement from Captain George Hull Porter, Republican affiliated with the Sweitzer Non-partisan League, denouncing Mayor Thompson for attempting to inject national issues into the local campaign.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lambros's Letter</p>
   <p>Mr. Lambros wrote to Mr. Sweitzer as follows:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"You are the logical candidate to beat Thompson. Though I am the publisher of a Republican newspaper and an officer of a Republican ward organization, I consider my indorsement of your candidacy as no breach of faith with the party, since everybody is doing the same thing.</p>
   <p>"There is but one issue in this campaign, and that is to get rid of Thompsonism by supporting you' as the strongest and most available candidate to beat him.</p>
   <p>"I am calling upon all my personal and political friends to cooperate in this movement of public-spirited citizens that will give to Chicago a new administration of its municipal government."</p>
