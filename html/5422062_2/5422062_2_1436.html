   <p>A part of the business activity of the Greek community of Chicago is a furniture factory. This establishment is owned and operated by Mr. E. Soter and Mr. A. Treslidin. It is located at 3114 West Madison Street.</p>
   <p>The manufacturing takes place in the rear of the building, the front being used for display purposes. The two Greek owners are expert cabinetmakers. They are aided by various skilled artificers, and the finished pieces reflect care and good workmanship. We were amazed to discover, upon visiting this Greek concern, the intricacies and skill required to make comparatively plain pieces of furniture. Both owners started as apprentices to cabinetmakers in their early youth. They are thus well qualified for the business in which they are engaged.</p>
   <p>We believe that this Greek firm should be supported by the Greek community, if only because it is the only one of its kind in Chicago.</p>
