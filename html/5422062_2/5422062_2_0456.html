   <p>Dear Sir,</p>
   <p>Your letter of October 26th received.</p>
   <p>I am appreciative of your sincere efforts in my behalf and of your organization's endorsement of my candidacy for the office of judge of the municipal court.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>I shall endeavor to continue to do in the future the things which probably prompted the indorsement of your newspaper.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Matthew D. Hartigan.</p>
