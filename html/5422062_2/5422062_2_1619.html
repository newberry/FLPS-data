   <p>p. 2.- It is time for the Greeks of Chicago to become serious about our future existence. Shall we explain? At the present time, Hellenism in Chicago, commercially, is not in the high position it should be.</p>
   <p>At first the Greeks had a monopoly on the restaurant and the confectionery trades. These now have gone into other hands. The grocery stores and fruit stores have been slowly disappearing under the onslaught of the chain stores. Those that have remained, merely eke out an existance.</p>
   <p>The fault is that of the Greeks and no one else. When we told the Greeks to form unions and prevent this danger, they were too busy fighting their petty battles to respond. Now that the crisis has come, there is only one thing left to do. The slogan should be, "A Greek for a Greek." We must support each other and fight to regain our rights. We cannot delay for it may be too late already.</p>
