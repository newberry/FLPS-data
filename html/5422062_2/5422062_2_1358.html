   <p>One more member has been added to the circle of Greek professional men in Chicago- Andrew J. Vlachos, the new attorney.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos, a graduate of the National University of Athens, enrolled at Northwestern University and was about ready for graduation when the first Balkan war broke out. He discontinued his studies and went to Greece to fight against the Turks. As soon as he returned to Chicago, the second war broke out, and he again responded to the call of Greece to fight against the Bulgars. When he returned,he finished his studies and graduated with honors.</p>
   <p>All his friends and the Greek community in general wish Mr. Vlachos a brilliant career.</p>
