   <p>p. 3. We are doing our duty in presenting Dr. Alexandros G. Economou, to the Greek community of Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the World War the prominent Doctor was appointed a Sanitary Supervisor by the United States, and his services were very valuable to the government. He also greatly aided the Greek military delegation which came to America during the war. In later years he devoted his time to various hospitals, following their ever increasing scientific progress.</p>
   <p>Now he has decided to establish his offices, for the practice of his profession, at 2373 Lincoln Ave.</p>
