   <p>p. 3.- The Chicago Pie Co. is well known to the Greeks of Chicago. The company is 100 per cent Greek. It was founded by the very active Photios Karalis and its business radius is expanding every day. Besides its expanding business and activity, the company is taking in consideration the life and security of its employees.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Chicago Pie Co. have adopted the modern method of insuring for any eventuality their 75 employes, all Greeks. This group insurance, without doctor's examination, was procured through N. Gavaris, insurance broker.</p>
   <p>The company's example, in securing the services of a Greek house, is praiseworthy and should be followed by other Greek companies. Well done.</p>
