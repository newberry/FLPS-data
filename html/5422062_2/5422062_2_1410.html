   <p>The Greek Press has devoted its editorial space to various problems of the Greek community of Chicago in a sincere effort to solve, or at least partially to solve, them. The creation and maintenance of schools and other institutions has been one of the major issues urged by the Press. We have repeatedly counseled the parents of our community to send their children, whenever possible, to universities and colleges because we know that the more weapons one has to fight with the easier life's struggle will be. An educated Greek is more of a Greek than one who does not even know the magnitude of his heritage.</p>
   <p>The progress our children are making in the arts and sciences justifies <span class="page-break">2</span>our great pride and joy in them. The success of the poor immigrant boys who came to America and acquired wealth and fame by the sweat of their brow is a laurel wreath for the entire Greek people. Nor do we forget the dignity given to our community by our successful businessmen, who have earned the world's admiration.....</p>
   <p>However, there are two other groups of Greek people who have been neglected, and in whose fate we are tremendously interested. They are the manufacturers or producers dealing with Greek merchants and the entirely Greek enterprises having an exclusively Greek patronage. The first group will be discussed in another issue because we wish to discuss the latter group today.</p>
   <p>This group is composed of our grocers, butchers, confectioners, and bakers.....The majority of these people serve a completely Greek clientele and are, in most cases, located in the vicinity of Halsted and Harrison Streets. It is <span class="page-break">3</span>impossible to make a thorough study of their problems in a column, such as this, whose space is limited. We shall merely indicate certain unfortunate conditions which exist, and let the one's involved take whatever action they see fit.</p>
   <p>It must be clearly understood from the beginning that we have no intention of accusing these merchants of shirking their social or economic duties. On the contrary, if there is any group of our people worthy of praise it is this one. They conscientiously serve the Greek Community in every possible way each and every time they are called upon. The only foolish thing they do is to neglect themselves. This neglect is their failure to advertise their wares. Naturally, anything that curtails the business of one or two stores has a similar effect upon the business of an entire community. It is rather paradoxical to find this group losing prestige from lack of publicity when it has been the mainstay of Hellenism in Chicago since the time of the first Greek immigrant.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>This group, directly and indirectly, gave the Greek community the framework upon which to develop; not because they were the only patriotic Greeks in the city, but because their type of work made them the bulwarks of our structure. Therefore, we may justifiably title them our pioneer "captains of industry".</p>
   <p>This title, which so rightfully belongs to them, is held high because of their participation in the active community and commercial life of our people. However, their lack of understanding as regards the value of advertising has caused them to remain stationary, and has withheld from them the returns enjoyed by American merchants. Greek purchasers should be notified of their duty to support Greek stores because these stores contribute daily to the needs and benefit activities of the entire community.....The community is not to be blamed for its unawareness; it is the merchants themselves who are at fault. A campaign must be carried on continuously to remind the Greek people that all of their household needs can be purchased at Greek stores. Such a campaign, if systematically conducted, would be of great benefit to all our <span class="page-break">5</span>merchants.</p>
   <p>It is practically impossible for the Greek merchants of Halsted Street to cease making contributions to the endless philanthropic undertakings which continually beset them, since they benefit the Greek Community and must be supported by all true Greeks. However, it is also very foolish for them not to expect tangible returns for such contributions from the community. They have every right to seek and get publicity from each organization and group which they help. This can be accomplished in various ways.</p>
   <p>Such a publicity campaign is easy to start if it is managed systematically, and if egotistic interests are eliminated. Money will be needed, but not as much as is required to obligate or make friendly some small politician who masquerades as a friend of our people.</p>
