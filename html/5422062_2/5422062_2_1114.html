   <p>"I Want Every One of My Countrymen in This City to Know the Life of George Washington So That They May All Be Better Citizens," He Writes--Foreign Language Press Helps Americanization.</p>
   <p>George Washington is "the father of his country."</p>
   <p>The present tense is used because Washington still lives in the hearts of his countrymen. No living personality to-day exercises so great an influence over the patriotic impulses of all true Americans as that of the memory and the life-story of George Washington.</p>

   <p>Adopted Father of Immigrant</p>
   <p>Not only is George Washington the father of native-born America. He is the adopted "little father" of newly-made citizens from foreign shores. Long before they take out their first naturalization papers, the great majority of our immigrants learn to know and to revere the name of George Washington. He is perhaps more real to them than to native Americans, for the immigrant can better appreciate all that the name of Washington stands for. To them he becomes a sort of Patron saint, the symbol of free, happy, liberty-loving, prosperous, wonderful America.</p>
   <p>Noble service in acquainting new arrivals with American ideals is being done by the foreign-language press. Most of these papers have proved valuable aids in the Americanization campaign.</p>

   <p>Immigrant Reveres Washington's Name</p>
   <p>Typical of the reverence in which the name of George Washington is held by his adopted children is a letter received by the Courier from a native of Greece, now a resident of Waterloo. The letter follows:"I am sending you a copy of a newspaper, the Greek Star, in which you will find an article about the father of our country, George Washington. I shall be very much obliged if you will be kind enough to publish it in your paper.</p>
   <p>"The reason why I want you to publish it is that I want every one of my countrymen who live in this city to know the life of the greatest American, George Washington, so that they will all be better citizens of this great country."</p>

   <p>Tribute by Greek Paper</p>
   <p>We print below the article referred to, which native-born Americans may read with profit.</p>
   <p>George Washington</p>
   <p>First in war, first in peace, first in the hearts of his countrymen!</p>
   <p>George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Virginia. Next Wednesday is the anniversary of his birth, and the day has been set aside as a day on which the American people, from coast to coast, shall show their admiration and respect for a hero whose name will live forever.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>As this great country grows older and greater, the anniversary of the birth of the first President of the United States becomes more significant. We are called upon to pay our tribute next week to the memory of George Washington.</p>
   <p>No statesman, no clergyman, no editor, nor any other living American will neglect to pay homage to the patriotism and the heroism of the great liberator of America.</p>
   <p>There is one Fourth of July, and there are two birthdays of immortal Americans, Lincoln's and Washington's. The names of these two great men will always remain the supreme inspiration for everything concerning America and Americanism.</p>

   <p>Washington was made commander-in-chief in the Revolutionary War, and he was unanimously elected President of the United States.</p>
   <p>Whether he was President, general, or a private citizen, his only ambition was to serve his country to the utmost of his capacity, regardless of rank or title. In fact, he once said that he would just as soon serve as a private as serve as an officer, as long as he could fight for the noble cause of freedom.</p>
   <p>After Washington's second term as President he was requested to become a candidate again, but he preferred to retire to private life. By this refusal of his the unwritten law was established that no President should accept a third term; and in honor of Washington's memory no President has ever accepted this honor three times.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>His farewell address, carefully composed and solemnly worded, was an appeal to the American people to be true to the Government, to avoid party strife, to beware of foreign influence, and to cultivate patriotic devotion to American institutions and to the American flag.</p>
   <p>Washington is known as the father of our country. He was a true American who went through many struggles and disappointments, fought his battles heroically, and succeeded in establishing a free country which will endure as his brilliant monument in history. He was the founder of a noble tradition.</p>
   <p>Washington came from Virginia, and Lincoln came from Illinois. Both won spotless honor by the same labor, the same love of liberty, and the same love for humanity. Both worshipped the same God; both loved the same country; and both lived and died for their country.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Their ideals and their sacred traditions are the master principles of American democracy.</p>
   <p>Washington and Lincoln stand before us as the symbols of independence, righteousness, and freedom,---principles dear to the heart of every American.</p>
   <p>By believing in Washington and Lincoln you will remain loyal to the American flag, a true American, and you may feel proud to be a citizen of the country that represents the highest and noblest form of democracy.</p>
