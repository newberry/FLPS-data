   <p>Fellow-Greeks:</p>
   <p>Never before have the chronicles of mankind recorded such slaughter, bloodshed, privation, and misery as the records of the present war reveal. Never before has humanity gone through so much agony of spirit, bereavement, mental anguish, and destruction of property as it is going through today.</p>
   <p>Never before was humanity as a whole, regardless of nationality or creed, called upon to offer material aid to millions of sick, famished, and afflicted people. And consequently never before have Greeks,scions of a glorious and immortal race, had such an opportunity to reveal their philanthropy and the grandeur of the Greek character to all humanity as they have now through the institution of the American Red Cross.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Responding, therefore, to the appeal of our President, Woodrow Wilson, who calls on all races of this great Republic to contribute to the funds of the American Red Cross, the present Greek committee was organized with the approval of the Red Cross and is known as the "Greek Campaign Committee for the American Red Cross of Chicago."</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly Greeks all over the country have contributed to the funds of the American Red Cross, but in this case it is a contribution by a racial group. The present opportunity is the most appropriate for expressing to the American people our gratitude for what this people did for us in our holy war for independence in 1821.</p>
   <p>Fellow Greeks, it is not only that we Greeks will express our appreciation to the United States by contributing to the Red Cross as a group, but <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it is also the greatest humanitarian act that any race could perform. Our contribution to the American Red Cross is not only an imperative duty; it is also an obligation to the country in which we live, prosper, and have our being.</p>
   <p>Do not delay; act at once, and act first. Let the Greek name shine in the eyes of our adopted country and in the eyes of the whole world. Form committees to go from house to house and from store to store and ask every fellow-Greek to print his name in the book of the American Red Cross, which will be published once a month, showing the racial and individual contributions. Every Greek in the land must carry his American Red Cross book with him to show to his fellow-American his appreciation of the patriotic duty which he owes to the greatest republic of the world, the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Chicago, July 25, 1917.</p>
   <p>The Grand Committee.</p>
