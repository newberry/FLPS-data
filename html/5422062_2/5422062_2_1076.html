   <p>Chicago.</p>
   <p>My dear Peter,</p>
   <p>I thank you for your letter of February 8.</p>
   <p>I am glad to be able to play a small part in helping Mr. Andrew Vlachos to be appointed assistant State's attorney. I am sure that you Greek people ought to feel proud of his elevation.</p>
   <p>I have read as much as I could of your speech on Lincoln and Pericles, and of course you never fail in an emergency.</p>
   <p>With Kindest regards, I am</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Edward R. Litsinger.</p>
