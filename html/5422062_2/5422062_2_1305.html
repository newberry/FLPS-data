   <p>One of our most brilliant college graduates has recently opened dentist offices at 8 S. Michigan Avenue. The lucky youth, Christ K. Antonopoulos, feels great joy, not only at his success, but at the warm reception given him by his friends. On that day flowers completely filled his spacious offices. Phone calls, telegrams, and visitors kept coming all day with congratulations and good wishes. Dr. Antonopoulos invited most of his friends to a huge banquet at the restaurant of Mr. Spiropovlos. We wish Dr. Antonopoulos the greatest of success in the future.</p>
