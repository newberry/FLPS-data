   <p>A very important event took place night before last in our Community, which undoubtedly will effect greatly the career of the Greeks in Chicago and generally in America.</p>
   <p>About forty Professional Men of our Community gathered at the LaSalle Hotel responding to a call by Mr. Pol. Koryllos, President of the Association of Professional Men, and exchanged opinions about launching a Society in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Starting with a very enthusiastic introduction by Mr. Koryllos, followed by many speeches in succession, about the need of such an organization in America, they finished by deciding on the establishment of such an Association in Chicago that it might be a part of the Confederation in America. All present joined the organization and elected a committee whose job would be to work out the constitution and call a general conference of all Greek professional men of Chicago to ratify it............</p>
   
   <p>Comments of the publisher.</p>
   <p>We consider the launching of the Association of the Profession Men as a happy event, expecting many advantages from it, not only for our professional men but for Hellenism generally, because people are so need to expect a signal for every action from those who, thanks to their education and knowledge, are in a position to know what should be done.</p>
   <p>It was, therefore, imperative for the professional men to organize in order for them to be able to respond to the demands of society. And, what is important, to give an example of a general organization, composed of Greeks in America. On which is more growing imperative than ever in this country, where everything and everybody, is organized in close cooperation, we, as Greeks, are unable any longer to compete as individuals.</p>
   <p>Expecting much advantage from such an organization, we greet the Association from Chicago and wish it success in its great duties.</p>
