   <p>A major problem confronting the Greeks of today is in the field of business. Since the recent decline in business, they are frightened at the outlook.</p>
   <p>Everything runs in cycles. It is natural, then, that this decline in business should be taking place. The same thing happened ten years ago and twenty years ago. The trouble is that we think we ought to operate as we did ten and twenty years ago.</p>
   <p>During the earlier years, when a Greek had a little capital he would open a store. As business grew, he made improvements and enlargements in his store, or open another store. As a result, the management of these stores changed hands many times in the course of years.</p>

   <p>With this system, some were successful, others failed. It is an economic law most Greeks fail to heed. Today, those with a loosely knit chain of stores are going to suffer first while those with one good business will survive.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press has tried to make the people realize the need or organization, in its preceding articles, "Greek Commerce in Peril."</p>
   <p>We must change our system of managing restaurants and candy stores. Our businesses must progress as everything else does. We must go forward!</p>
