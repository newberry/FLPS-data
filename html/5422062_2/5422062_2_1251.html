   <p>We are happy to announce that Dr. Charles Spirrison of Chicago has been appointed a county physician of Cook County. He is the first Greek doctor who has achieved this high honor. In fact, he is the first Chicagoan of Greek descent to become a practicing physician.</p>
   <p>Dr. Spirrison was born in Chicago and studied medicine at Loyola Medical School. He received his degree in 1928 and began practicing his profession immediately. He has now achieved an enviable position as a county physician, and we should all be very proud of him. Such posts are not easy to get. They require much ability. Congratulations, Doctor!</p>
