   <p>p. 5.- Dr. and Mrs. Spiros Sotirakos (S. Soter) left at midnight last Saturday for a trip to Greece. Just before they left, hundreds of friends came to wish them "bon voyage" and a speedy return. Many accompanied them to the station. The doctor and his wife are first going to visit relatives in Canton, Ohio. From there they are going to proceed to New York where they will join the Ahepan Exposition. Mr. Sotirakos' prime reason for going is to study advanced medical improvements for several months in Vienna. We hope they have a pleasant journey and a speedy return.</p>
