   <p>p. 3. With great pleasure we are informed that the National Bank of Greece established an agency here in our great city. Owing to the tremendous bank business of the Greeks of Chicago, the above named Institution decided to send Mr. J. E. Protecdicos, who is one of its famous Banking heads, to Chicago to establish the agency.</p>
   <p>The administration of this banking branch is entrusted to the hands of Mr. Anthony C. Bennett, (Antonios Benettas), a well known banker of Chicago. For twelve years Mr. Bennett was connected with the Continental and Commercial National Bank, and also the First National Bank of Chicago. No better person could have been appointed to head the new branch.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, the whole Greek Community of Chicago will be pleased with the establishment of the banking branch and its appointed governor.</p>
