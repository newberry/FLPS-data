   <p>The Greek concern known as the M &amp; L Utilities Corporation, 29 South Halsted Street, was founded about four months ago. Its organizers are two Greeks held in high esteem in the business world. Both Nicholas Mihalopoulos and Charles Levathitos have been in business for many years and are progressive and up-to-date in their methods. Mr. Levathitos was associated for many years with a large manufacturing concern that sold restaurant and store equipment.....</p>
   <p>We are sure that this newly organized concern will be able to serve Greek businessmen in an efficient and profitable manner. A buyer can profit from the experienced advice of this concern and be sure he is getting the finest type of equipment for a restaurant, lunchroom, meatmarket, or barroom.</p>
   <p>This Greek concern has been given the exclusive right to sell and install the Commercial oil ranges.....In order better to serve their clients, this firm has engaged the services of L. W. Newbre, who is one of the finest store designers in Chicago. He was formerly employed for many years by the firm of Peppas &amp; Alex. The M &amp; L Corporation has a complete line of samples in its display room. It is open at all times. Both partners will be happy to serve the public in every possible manner.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press is very proud of this new concern and its organizers.</p>
