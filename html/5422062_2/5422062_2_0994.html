   <p>Until a few days ago, the major problem that worried every citizen of America, including our own people, was how to extricate ourselves from the clutches of the depression. Since the President has prevailed upon Congress to pass certain measures he deems necessary for the improvement of the financial situation of the nation, we are all watchfully awaiting results.</p>
   <p>Now that the Government has assumed the direction of business and agriculture, and has imposed restrictions upon certain aspects of both, some people are beginning to become doubtful and impatient. Individuals who have been accustomed to manage their industrial affairs and investments without outside direction cannot adjust themselves to the President's ideas.</p>
   <p>The President and his policies face a hard fight because they represent a manner of thinking that is new to the world. The new policies will have to overcome influences that have been an integral part of economic life for hundreds of years. Despite the fact that the President's intentions are of the best, it is obvious that it will be tremendously difficult to convince all of the people of the value of his suggestions and his measures. The President's proposals for getting the nation out of its present critical situation are experimental in character; and these experiments are being watched very intently by the rest of the world.</p>
