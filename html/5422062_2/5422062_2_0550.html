   <p>p. 8.- For the first time the Greek-American citizens of Chicago, those affiliated with the Democratic Party, have become conscious of their power and organized a regular and permanent organization,which is to be known hereafter as: The Greek-American Democratic Voters League of Cook County.</p>
   <p>The new organization has opened its permanent headquarters in suite 340, Morrison Hotel, and elected its officers and board of directors, thus establishing the first exemplary precedent of Greek political organizations in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Any organization, particularly political, in order to function properly, must be governed and directed by a body of capable men. In this respect the Greek-American Democratic Voters League of Cook County has been fortunate.</p>

   <p>A number of our best citizens, are serving the organization in one form or another. At the head of them all, in the capacity of the President of the League is Mr. Michael S. Krokidas, of the well known Athenian family, whose father was one of the most distinguished physicians in Athens.</p>
   <p>The Krokidas' family has always been in the forefront in the life of Greece, during the past fifty years or more.</p>
