   <p>3) How a sick person can be made comfortable.</p>

   <p>Sickness is a great expense to a family and everyone wishes to have a nurse, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>but unfortunately the majority can't afford to hire one. Therefore it is the duty of every woman and girl to know what to do in case of sickness.</p>
