   <p>All Greeks who are American citizens should join this organization [political club]. Those who are not yet citizens are urged to apply for their citizenship papers immediately.</p>
   <p>This organization is the result of the zealous and untiring efforts of one Greek-American citizen, Mr. Nick Katsavos. Over three hundred men attended the first meeting. A charter for the club was obtained and a definite program showing the aims and purposes of the club was laid out. The headquarters will be located at 161 West Madison Street.</p>
   <p>The Club will encourage and aid people who seek to become American citizens.</p>

   <p>Officers of the Club were chosen, and various committees were established. The officers elected were Mr. James N. Manousopoulos, president, and Mr. John Gerasimos, vice-president....</p>
