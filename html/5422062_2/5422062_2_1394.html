   <p>We have just been informed that Mr. James Demetriades, well-known Chicago businessman, has opened a Greek food shop at 6043 South Halsted Street. The shop will carry all kinds of Greek products and will also have a fresh daily supply of meats. The store is very near the St. Nicholas Church, and will therefore be convenient for the residents of the South Side.</p>
