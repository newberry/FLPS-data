   <p>Among the 280 graduates of various law schools who were taking the Illinois bar examination, was the well-known Paul Demos. He was one of the few who passed the bar with a high rating, and was given the right to practice law in the state of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Demos comes from a fine family. He studied in Greece and then came to America. Here he entered the business world, not to make profit but to enable himself to pursue a higher education. Mr. Demos is well known in Chicago because, while still a student, he won many cases....</p>
   <p>This is the type of young man the Greeks of America have need of. The Saloniki hails his success with joy, and wishes him good luck for the future.</p>
