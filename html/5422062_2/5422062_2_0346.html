   <p>The Greeks of Chicago should be proud of the Greek-American Political Club of Chicago. It is presided over by the philhellene, Thomas Hutchison, who has contributed many English articles to the Saloniki. The well-known Dr. Constantine Kalliontzis is vice-president.....</p>
   <p>Many political candidates on the Democratic ticket were present at the meeting held last Sunday. They praised the Greek people and promised to help them in every possible way.</p>
   <p>The Athenian Hall was packed with eager listeners who were thrilled at hearing the American men tell of the glories of Marathon and Salamis. All who attended will never forget the pleasure they received from hearing their fatherland praised so highly.</p>
   <p>Another meeting will be held next Sunday.....It is unnecessary for us to urge every true Greek to attend. We must all join this fine, outstanding organization.</p>
