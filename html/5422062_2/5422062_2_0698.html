   <p>The statement, published in the local American newspaper, the Chicago Herald, to the effect that during the patriotic gathering in Orchestra Hall, at which His Excellency the Greek Ambassador, Mr. George Roufos, was present, registrations for Liberty Loan bonds netted the sum of one million dollars, is false. Because this statement is not true, and because he who circulated it has handicapped the good work of the Greek Committee, by giving the public a reason for distrusting future announcements of the Committee, we wish publicly to deny and refute this statement. No efforts to secure registrations were made at the gathering by members of the Committee, who have been authorized to obtain registrations only by going from store to store and from house to house.</p>
