   <p>With great pleasure and pride we announce through Saloniki, the appointment of Andrew Vlachos as Assistant States Attorney of Cook County. On the occasion of his appointment we proudly offer his biography including his professional activities in the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos was born in Samarades, a small town near Tripolis, Greece. His father was a priest and teacher. In 1886 he moved to the city of Tripolis for the purpose of educating his five children in the schools of that city. Andrew, the third son, was educated in the public schools of Tripolis, and at seventeen years of age graduated from the Gymnasium of Tripolis. In 1898 he entered the law school of the National University of Greece, Athens, and was graduated in 1901. In September, 1902, he came to the United States, to study law and serve the increasing population of Greeks in Chicago. Not speaking the English language and being unable to begin at once to study in the law school, he, with others, established an importing business in the vicinity of Hull House, then the center of the Greek community of Chicago. During this period he studied the English <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>language under the tutorship of Frank Beezley, a Greek and latin scholar. He graduated from the Law School of Northwestern University and from Hamilton College of Law, and was admitted to the bar in 1916.</p>
   <p>In 1909 he visited Greece, returning in 1910. In 1912, he went to Greece heading 1,500 Greek volunteers who wished to participate in the war of Greece against Turkey for the freedom of Epirus and Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, which were still under Turkey. In a demonstration, following the capture of Janina, the capital of Epirus, he addressed King Constantine, then Crown Prince, on behalf of the victorious army. Following that he was requested to address the people who had assembled for the occasion. He also participated in the second Balkan War, against Bulgaria, having fought in the battle of Salonika and the battle of Kilkis, in the first decisive victory of the Greek Army, and in subsequent battles until July 1913, when the Greek Army reached the old Turco-Bulgarian boundaries, forcing there the Armistice. He was decorated with two service medals, and in 1914 returned to Chicago and completed his studies. In 1918 he visited Japan as representative of a big firm.</p>

   <p>Mr. Vlachos enjoys the confidence of all those who have known him, and is looked upon by the Greeks of Chicago and of the United States as an advocate of Greek-American ideals, and a pioneer of the educational, social and political advancement of the Greek people in America. He is well known throughout the nation, since he came to this country, for his social, political and educational work through publications, Greek-American newspapers, and by his lectures and addresses.</p>
   <p>In 1906, he translated the Constitution of the United States of America into the Greek language, and it was published in the Greek Star of Chicago together with a long historical introduction.</p>
   <p>When in Athens, in 1909 his former law professor, Neokles Kazazes, invited him to deliver a lecture in Athens about the Greeks of America from a social, commercial, moral and educational standpoint. This lecture, heard by the most prominent Athenians, was the first lecture delivered in Athens about the Greeks in America by a Greek from America, and it was published <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>in the Acropolis, a daily newspaper of Athens, and also by Hellenism, a national periodical.</p>
   <p>He was sent as a delegate to various conventions of philanthropic, religious, political and patriotic character.</p>
   <p>In 1921, on the occasion of the Greek Centennial (1821-1921) he published "To Asmaton Asmaton Tis Files" (The Song of the Songs of the Race), a book containing the national drama of Greece, and representing an historical period of the Greek nation of five hundred years, from 1453 on.</p>
   <p>Besides the work of Mr. Vlachos in prose, there are also several patriotic poems written by him during the time he was on the battlefield in 1912 and 1913, as well as when in America. While writing a poem on the tomb of Ali Pasha in Janina, entitled the "Lamentation of Ali Pasha" (Ali Pasha was the cruel tyrant of Epirus who lived during the early part of the 19th century), the oldest son of the Crown Prince of Greece, an officer of the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>army, asked to read the poem. The Prince was very much impressed with its forceful language, congratulated Mr. Vlachos and requested him to continue writing patriotic songs, as an inspiration to the soldiers. One of his songs, a military poem entitled "Ta Nikitiria" and dedicated to the Third Regiment Infantry, was set to music by the leader of the Greek Royal Band, and was performed during the Second Balkan War as the official March of the Regiment. The music was published and phonograph records made. Others of his poems have also been published in the United States and Greece. Mr. Vlachos has also written the official hymn of the Order of Ahepa, a fraternal organization to which he belongs.</p>
   <p>While in the war Mr. Vlachos had special permission from the Greek government to take photographs of the actual fighting, and has now in his possession about 500 pictures and plates taken during the War of 1912 - 1913.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos, besides being a soldier, is also a scholar and finds enjoyment in the study of classic works of the great old masters of Greece. He <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>always points to the stars of the ancient "Golden Age" and advises youth of all nationalities to become students of Greek philosophy, poetry, history, literature and art. He believes that no one can reach the highest point of human intellectual achievement without knowledge of the Greek language, Greek philosophy and literature. He strongly advocates, and sincerely believes, that the combination of Greek and American education secures the best knowledge and inspiration toward progress and virtue.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vlachos has delivered lectures in Illinois in support of the New Athens College in Athens, Greece, the wonderful American educational institution chartered by the New York Board of Regents.</p>
   <p>Of special interest in his "War Diary," consisting of about seventeen books not published, in which one can read and feel the actual life of the soldiers fighting for freedom, independence, liberty and civilization.</p>

   <p>The appointment of Mr. Vlachos as Assistant State's Attorney of Cook County has a great significance to the Greek political life of Chicago. Until now, very few Greeks have been appointed to political offices due to the fact that the Greek voters are so much divided among themselves. They are unable to present a united political front of enough strength to bring about a necessary political recognition.</p>
   <p>Perhaps this new appointment may inspire the coveted union of Greek voters, and in a united front, undoubtedly they will acquire higher positions and elective power. It is about time for Greek political strength to make its voice heard and impose its influence upon the political horizon.</p>
   <p>In the person of Mr. Vlachos the community of Greeks of Chicago sees the beginning of a new political era, and feels much honored by his appointment.</p>
