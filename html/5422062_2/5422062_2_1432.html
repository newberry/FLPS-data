   <p>In order that the North Side Greek families may find it easier to buy Greek products, a new grocery store and meat market has just been opened on the corner of Halsted Street and Wrightwood Avenue (2600 North Halsted Street). This store, which is near the St. George Church, will carry a complete line of Greek products.</p>
