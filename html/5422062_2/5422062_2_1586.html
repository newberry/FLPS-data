   <p>George Annes, well-known restaurateur of our city, together with the equally well-known Alexander brothers, opened last Monday, the largest and most brilliant Greek restaurant in our city.</p>
   <p>The La Tour d'Argent (Silver Tower) as it is named, is located in the new Palmolive building, on the near North Side. This building is one of the greatest architectural achievements of our city.</p>
   <p>With such splendid surroundings, good food, and perfect service, the La Tour d 'Argent will become the most popular restaurant in Chicago. We congratulate the owners on their progress!</p>
