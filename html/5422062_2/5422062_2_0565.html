   <p>As is customary, the 24th. Ward Republican Organization is preparing its annual picnic. The outing will be held Sunday, August 24th, at White House Park, Irving Park Boulevard and River Road.</p>
   <p>Those who attend, and they usually number many hundreds, will be entertained with a fine program. There will be dancing, baseball, and other outdoor sports. An all around good time is promised.</p>
   <p>Mr. Charles E. Peace, the Republican Ward Committeeman, and his organization are well-known on the North side for promoting civic and social enterprises. His very close friendship with Mr. Nick C. Canellis, the well-known Greek-American of Chicago, who takes a leading part in local politics, and the large acquaintances he has with the north side Greeks, means that there will be quite a number of our people enjoying this outing.</p>
