   <p>(2) That all Greeks should volunteer proudly to serve under the star-spangled American flag, following the example of thousands of their countrymen who have already enlisted, for service in the army or in the navy of the United States.</p>
   <p>(3) That all Greeks should buy Liberty Bonds and support the cause of the American Red Cross wholeheartedly.</p>
   <p>(4) That thanks should be extended and appreciation shown for the sincere and human attitude of America towards Greece, lasting from 1821 up to the present day.</p>
