   <p>Some businesses suffer during the summer months. Others reap their harvests then. The Greek businesses are not so satisfactorily arranged. In the olden days the candy stores waited for the summer time. Their entire future depended on the summer weather. If it was a rainy season, the partners would blame each other for lack of business and break up. Nowadays the automobiles bother them. The automobiles go far and wide and bring back ideas from other places. The candy stores find that their own display is old-fashioned, their systems and customs are dated twenty years back, and they resent being criticized about it.</p>
   <p>As soon as business falls a bit "off par" they put on a glum face and resign themselves to fate. The proprietor does not realize that a smile will make a customer spend an extra nickel.</p>
   <p>Why are our Greek candy-stores losing business? Because they are organized on a tiresome stereotyped pattern, and are afraid to make the slightest change after so many years of the same thing. The successful stores are those that have an individuality about them. People want something different! They are tired of "just another Greek restaurant." People say, "When you've gone to one, you've seen them all."</p>
