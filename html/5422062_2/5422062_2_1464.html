   <p>The well-known Constantine Gousias, who owns the shoe-making school at 7 West Division Street, has succeeded in renting the building at 27 South Wells Street. He was forced to move because of lack of space for new machines.</p>
   <p>The new quarters occupy four floors. The first will be used for the actual manufacture of shoes. The second and third floors will house the school, which has been in existence since 1927. Mr. Gousias has purchased much machinery of the latest type to be installed in his new location.</p>
