   <p>Hon. A. J. Cermak, Mayor</p>
   <p>City Hall, Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Mr. Mayor:</p>
   <p>May we not add our congratulations to those already conveyed to you by the various Democratic organizations in Chicago and pledge anew to you and to the Democratic party our loyalty and support.</p>
   <p>Two of our officers, Mr. A. A. Pantelis and Mr. G. A. Kyriakopoulos, are sufficiently well known to you and to the leaders of democracy to require no introduction. They have devoted an unusually large amount of energy, time and money in the interest of the Democratic party, not only in this but in all elections during the last decade or more. They are entitled to recognition for that work.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, urge the appointment of Mr. A. A. Pantelis as City Prosecutor and the appointment of Mr. G. A. Kyriakopoulos as one of his assistants.</p>
   <p>We know that they will render the high grade service that you expect of your appointees and that they will reflect in their work great credit upon your administration.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Dr. N. Salopoulos, Chairman</p>
   <p>Paul Kare, Vice Chairman</p>
   <p>George Becharas, Treasurer</p>
   <p>George Poulos, Ass't. Treasurer.</p>
