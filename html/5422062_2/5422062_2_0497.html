   <p>Dear Mr. Mammon:</p>
   <p>As you are no doubt aware, the Official Notification of General Charles G. Dawes for Vice-President will take place at his home at the corner of Greenwood Ave., and Sheridan Road, Evanston, on the evening of August 19th. The grounds will be open at 7:30 P.M. and the ceremonies will begin at 8:30 P.M. with Chairman William <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Butler presiding. Hon. A. W. Jefferis, former Member of Congress from Omaha, Nebraska, who placed the General's name in nomination at the Cleveland Convention, will deliver the Notification Address, to be followed by the Speech of Acceptance.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that there may be a good representation of the Greek editors and your various friends and associates present. It is suggested that <span class="page-break">2</span>each group select a meeting place, accessible to the General's home and notify us of the same, as soon as possible, so that everything may run smoothly, as a very large crowd is expected.</p>
   <p>Assuring you of our appreciation of your hearty cooperation in this matter, I am,</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Wm. G. Edens.</p>
