   <p>Dear Mr. Mammon:</p>
   <p>We have just received the Foreign Language Speaker's allotment of souvenir Liberty Loan medals made of captured German cannon, and will be glad to issue one to you if you will call at this office.</p>
   <p>These medals will be valued souvenirs of the Liberty Loan Campaign and we presume you will wear yours while the present Victory Campaign is in progress.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Felix J. Streyckmans,</p>
   <p>Federal Reserve Director,</p>
   <p>Foreign Language Division.</p>
   <p>Nels M. Hokanson,</p>
   <p>Director, Foreign Language Speaker's Bureau.</p>
