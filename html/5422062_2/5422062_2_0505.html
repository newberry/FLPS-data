   <p>Mr. A. A. Pantelis</p>
   <p>155 N. Clark St.,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>We are about to embark upon a campaign of very great consequence, not alone to the business men, but all of the people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Realizing the urgency of the public's demand for a complete overturn of the present conditions, this organization has chosen as its candidate for mayor, Judge William E. Dever, whose long career in public life is a guarantee of his future performance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It hardly is necessary for us to assure you that the reception, which Judge Dever's candidacy has been accorded by all classes of citizens, has been so enthusiastic and flattering as to leave little doubt as to the outcome of the battle of ballots in April.</p>
   <p>It is the earnest wish of the committee, having in charge the details of Judge Dever's campaign, that this will be a victory for the people.</p>
   <p>We feel that the time has arrived when we should invite subscriptions from everyone who is interested in restoring the city government to a condition of financial and business soundness. Therefore, we would appreciate your check for whatever sum you feel you can offer in the name of better government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The expense of the campaign has begun and subscriptions are acceptable now.</p>
   <p>We particularly desire to inform all business men that the committee has authorized no individual or individuals to act as collectors.</p>
   <p>If you have any suggestions which may add to the efficiency of the campaign, bring them in. We will be glad to receive them.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Martin O'Brien,</p>
   <p>Chairman.</p>
