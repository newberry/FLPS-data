   <p>If one is to be considered an efficient and honorable trustee of private, public, or corporate money or property, he must keep books which are in complete order and which enable him to give an accurate account to himself, to other parties concerned, and to the public.</p>
   <p>This obligation is imposed and is respected for many different reasons. First, the trustee can thus maintain good relations with his own conscience; second, he is saved from many accounting errors; third, he is able to enjoy the confidence and respect of other parties and to avoid misunderstandings. In addition, his personal integrity thus receives the best possible publicity. The public comes to realize that any sum of money may be safely entrusted to him. If he is to preserve his reputation as a reliable individual, the trustee must make public financial statements at regular intervals and in great detail, in order that his management of funds may be understood and <span class="page-break">\2</span>checked by everyone.</p>
   <p>On the basis of these requirements, a law has been passed affecting those who are responsible for the management and expenditure of any considerable sums of corporate or public money. This law imposes strict regulations upon the trustees. There is also another law, dealing with direct and indirect taxes, which demands that everyone who manages any private property must keep orderly books and must submit the necessary reports to the proper authorities. But, if the law, propriety, and society make such strict demands even on him who manages his own property, how much more, in the way of honesty and efficiency, do they expect of the individual who handles money or goods belonging to public institutions or corporations!</p>
   <p>It must be remembered that such public funds or property have no connection whatsoever with the manager's or treasurer's private fortune. This is an observation which is made daily. Every conscientious and honest citizen in society must realize how great and sacred is the responsibility of a treasurer or of a man who is entrusted to keep, invest, or manage public funds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Supported and actuated by these principles, we advise and urge all those who are entrusted with the management and use of money which has come from the pockets of Chicago Greeks, in the course of our church, community, or business life, with the object of promoting a common purpose, to give clear and detailed public accounts of all financial affairs. In this way, accountants, treasurers, and trustees of public funds will do their duty and, in addition, will dispel any possible suspicion as to the existence of mis-namagement, embezzelment, waste, or other abuses. Then, those of us in Chicago who have given money and great moral and material support to the common welfare will receive encouragement in the thought that the money which we have contributed and entrusted to our officials and leaders has been well spent. This will encourage us to contribute more money in the future for churches, schools, and other institutions, since we will have implicit faith in the competence and honesty of those who handle treasury funds.</p>
   <p>We will take no excuse for any failure of treasurers to give full accounts. The press, and particularly Saloniki, being the ever-watchful sentinel of the public's interests, will see to it that accounts are made public regularly.</p>

   <p>As long as the man who is responsible for the disposal of public funds gives an accounting voluntarily and without any prompting, we have nothing but praise for him. There are times, however, when reluctance on his part must be overcome by the forceful demand of the public. Just as the head of a family budgets his wages and expenses with great care, accounting even for the smallest item, so should the individual who is entrusted with public money use care and wisdom in spending it.</p>
   <p>Saloniki offers the use of its columns for the publication of all accounts, statements, and information which will satisfy the public and inform it as to where its money has gone.</p>
   <p>If any church or other institution in which the public is vitally interested and to which the public has contributed fails to keep the public informed as to its financial status, then we shall use every legal means to discover what is happening to our money. As a public organ, guarding the public's interests, Saloniki feels that this attitude is one of her greatest obligations. We repeat that the people must know where their money is going.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>If some foolish and guilty individuals should characterize us as meddlesome, severe, and unjust merely because we seek justice and righteousness, how should dishonesty and failure to honor obligations be characterized? We leave it to the public to criticize us and to confer on us any title they choose.</p>
   <p>The time for lying, injustice, and dishonesty has passed. Today everything must face judgment; we, too, must be judged. Justice, honesty, and righteousness must take their proper place.</p>
