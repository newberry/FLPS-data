   <p>One of the few localities of Chicago where a great number of our Nationals, now American citizens reside, is that where St. Demetrios church is located, it is known as Ward 47.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Ward 47 keep up one of the best political organizations, recognized by local political paragons, and quietly obtain many favors and concessions from political paragons and municipal authorities.</p>
   <p>The majority of them being Democrats their political organization is known as the Greek-American Political Club of the 47th Ward. President of the Club is the beloved lawyer and prosecuting attorney, Mr. Demetrios Chelos, of our community.</p>
   <p>Now, on the approaching of the election, the Club has decided to arrange a great political gathering, in which all voters of the locality are to be present and impress with their members the Americans who will be there. This great political rally will take place, Thursday, Oct. 29th, in the Club's regular headquarters, 2415 Lawrence avenue. Refreshments will be served following the program. It seems needless to recommend that all of our Nationals be there.</p>
