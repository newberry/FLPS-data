   <p>The Greek Confectioners of Chicago and vicinity are invited to participate in the meetings of the Confectioners' Association that take place once a month. You are not required to be or to become a member to be eligible to attend these meetings.</p>
   <p>The object of the Association is to elucidate the methods and ways of the Confectionary man and thoroughly Americanize the confectionary business. We must progress. That which we knew and practiced about the confectionary business in the past is not perfect; everything needs to be modernized. Look all around, you will find that nothing stands stationary, but a perpetual evolution from good to better takes place, and so on.</p>
   <p>Come and witness our demonstration.</p>
