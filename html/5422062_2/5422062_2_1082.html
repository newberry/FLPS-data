   <p>As a reminder to the Greeks of America, of the privileges and liberties we enjoy under the American form of government, I reprint something that occurred in Greece.</p>
   <p>By decree of the First division of the Army, the publisher of a weekly newspaper was arrested for criticizing the President of the Republic of Greece in an article published in that paper and headed "Reformation." The publisher E. Kapetanakis and his two typists K. Kotzis and E. Ioanidis were arrested and thrown into jail.</p>
   <p>This recollection does not approve or disapprove the measure of the Greek Government, it is the Government's business, but simply it reminds the Greek-Americans of the liberties extended to us by our beloved adopted country. A word to the wise!</p>
