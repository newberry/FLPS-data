   <p>The Demosthenes Political Organization was founded, four years ago, by a few thoughtful and conscientious voters, with the express purpose of bringing together citizens who were willing to exercise their privilege of voting for the welfare of society irrespective of political party affiliations. The Demosthenes Political Organization during its first year of its existence has expanded until it now covers the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 17th, and 18th wards of Chicago. Its membership consists, to a large extent, of business men and women who are vitally interested in the political and economic conditions of their respective communities.</p>
   <p>Thus, the fundamental purpose of this Organization is to acquaint its members with the different candidates seeking public offices, to analyze their qualifications, and promote the election of those candidates who are capable of performing the duties of their respective offices, economically, efficiently, and for the best interests of the public at large.</p>
   <p>Once again the Demosthenes Political Club has supported the policies of President <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Franklin D. Roosevelt, hoping that he will give a strong hand at this time to bring to an end the so-called depression, without, of course, misusing the powers entrusted to him and to his administration.</p>
   <p>The D.P.C. has been organized since 1931 and it consists of business men and women of the South Side of Chicago. Headquarters: 120 N. La Salle St. Room 6, 6700 Stoney Island Ave. Room 206.</p>
