   <p>The United States has issued a Victory Liberty Loan for the purpose of facilitating the return and discharge of our soldiers and sailors.</p>
   <p>Onward, then, to duty again. Let us hurry and buy the Fifth Victory Loan in order to secure our money in the best way, and to accomplish our duty; and to thank and encourage our heroes who, seeing and feeling our gratitude to them, will show the same interest and willingness if--God forbid!--the same situation arises again.</p>
