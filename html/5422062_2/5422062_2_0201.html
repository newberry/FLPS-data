   <p>True to our tradition of guiding, instructing, and enlightening the Greeks of Chicago and elsewhere, we come forward again in regard to the mayoralty election and urge our fellow-Greeks to vote the straight Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>The Republican candidates, who adhere to the program of that great American, our President Theodore Roosevelt, are as follows: Mr. J. M. Harlan is the candidate for the office of mayor. Mr. Harlan among other things is distinguished for being a true American who loves his country, for his reverence for what is right and just, for his belief in the equality of all citizens, and for his irreconcilable opposition to the enemies of the country. Others on the ticket are M. E. Greenebaum, candidate for the office of city treasurer, J. F. Smulski, candidate for the office of city attorney, and Francis P. Brady, candidate for the office of city clerk. The integrity and honesty of these four Republican personages and their capacity to fill the offices for which they have been named are vouched for by hundreds of thousands of people, regardless of party, who know them well.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago, for the interest of the city and for our own welfare, are requested to heed our advice and vote the straight Republican ticket.</p>
