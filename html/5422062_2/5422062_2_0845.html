   <p>The United States of America, our country, our family, and our life, is at war, fighting Prussian militarism. Our country's victory means for us life, happiness, liberty, and security.</p>
   <p>The country asks the American people for a loan of two billion dollars. The money must be raised at once. All societies, all organizations, and every individual Greek must buy Liberty bonds. Distinguish yourself; buy much more than your neighbor; buy more than you can. But the best way is to buy as a group. Let us have Greek meetings and make our object known. Let us lead, so that other nationalities will follow our example. United States Government bonds are our safety and our security. Let us be loaded with them.</p>
