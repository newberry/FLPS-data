   <p>p. 1.- The Greeks of Chicago, as well as all the Greeks of America, should be thankful that we live and prosper in this great Republic where revolutions are practically unknown.</p>
   <p>We are informed, that in Greece the seventh revolution has taken taken place. General Kondilis, at the head of the new revolution, in the twinkle of an eye and without a bloodshed, overthrew the government, and the Dictatorship of General Pangalos. Greece is making Mexico look like an amateur as far as revolutions are concerned. Shame on you, Greece. Shame on you, Greek Politicians.</p>
   <p>Is Greece owned by politicians or are the politicians owned by Greece? We, the Greeks of America, remind those politicians of Greece, whom, for the sake of courtesy, we call statesmen, that the duty of a statesman is not to serve the interest and welfare of himself and his clique, but, on the contrary, his duty is to serve the country as a whole.</p>
   
   <p>The apathy of the Greek people towards the administration of state affairs, and the personal gain and egotism of those pseudo-statesmen, are potent factors of instability and of revolution. As brother-Greeks from this side of the ocean, we appeal to you, Gen. Kondilis, with the following invocation:</p>
   <p>Dear General: In the name of our Great and Holy Country, we implore you to act wisely, rightly, and justly. We beseech you, in the name of your Military honor not to permit your authority to be swayed hither and thither by emotional folly and vengeance. We remind you, General, of the victories and glories, you have achieved, (while in exile) at the gates of Constantinople, fighting for our country. That glory and fame must be maintained by you if you can abstain from the political mud now prevalent in Greece.</p>
   <p>If you intend to save the country, as you said in your declaration, do not mix in politics, but establish a national guard of supervision for those who govern. Call to power the excellence of statesmanship to govern wisely and justly. Assure these statesmen that the national guard of supervision stands by their side. The voice of impartial Greeks of America, in wise counsels, must be heeded by you, General, if you really intend to serve Greece, rather than your personal ambitions.</p>
   
   <p>Your further glory depends upon you and only you. And, General, do not forget that your condemnation also depends on you.</p>
   <p>General Kondilis, bear in mind the utterance that another leader voiced, "Oh Solon! Where are you?" The counsel of the Greeks of America is very sincere.</p>
