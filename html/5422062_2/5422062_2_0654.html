   <p>According to its announcement, the Greek Liberty Loan Committee awarded honorary prizes to the following workers: Mr. John Raklios, first prize; Mr. George Kotsones, second prize; Mr. Gust Pappas, third prize.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen refused any monetary remuneration, but accepted the honorary prizes. Just praise and honor is due to these patriotic and energetic men. They neglected their private work and jobs for one whole month in order that they might work for a great national cause, the campaign for the Third Liberty Loan. They have done honor to the Greek name.</p>
   <p>Work for the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign starts soon. Those wishing to offer their services as members of the Liberty Loan Committee are requested to apply to the committee secretary, Mr. Paul Demos, 105 West Monroe St., Twelfth Floor.</p>
