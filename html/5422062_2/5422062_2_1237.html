   <p>The much-discussed plan of the Greek Men's Professional Club of Chicago is beginning to take form. It is planned to form new chapters or branches of the main organization according to the various classifications of its members.</p>
   <p>The first branch to be organized will be composed of architects, chemists, mechanics, and engineers. This branch is, of course, a part of the central organization and will follow the same procedure and activity. This new body is already composed of twenty-five members who elected G. Arahovitis president, and N. Skoularinan secretary.</p>
   <p>Last week this group held its first social meeting.</p>
