   <p>Mr. Chairman and Gentleman:</p>
   <p>I have come here today not to talk politics, but to talk to you about yourselves.</p>
   <p>There was a time when the Greek people were the wonder and the admiration of the world, when science, art, literature and government yielded mastery to you. Today you have drifted away from the high ideals of your forefathers and hold no place of high repute among the people of this great country.</p>
   <p>Today when the name of one of you appears in the public press of this country it is followed by the words: "A Greek," as though you were some strange and unknown factor in modern civilization. You have only yourselves <span class="page-break">2</span>to blame for the conditions that now exist, because your own disunion, your own lack of organization lies at the bottom of the public's lack of respect for you.</p>
   <p>Why does the public press say "George Dontopoulos, a Greek" was injured or arrested, as the case may be? You never see them say "Mike O'Brien, an Irishman," or "Herman Meyersberger, a German!" I will tell you why; it is because the Irish are organized and influential, and because the Germans are organized and influential, while you are without organization and therefore without influence.</p>
   <p>I can remember some twenty, or twenty-five years ago when advertisements for clerks, laborers and other help would appear in the newspapers and on sign-boards with the expression "No Irish need apply" at the end of the advertisement. You don't see such advertisements now. And why? Because the Irish began to organize. In the East they organized "The Sons <span class="page-break">3</span>of St. Patrick;" in the West "The Ancient Order of the Hibernians." They got their people into these organizations, got them naturalized so that they could vote and they voted! They became a power in the affairs of government and in the elections. Soon their members were on the Police Force, Fire Department, then in the Town and City Councils, then in the City Offices, the County Offices, the State Legislature, the State Offices, in Congress, in the Senate - everywhere the Irishman began to force his way in public affairs and always through organization. It was the same with the Germans. They formed their Turnvereins, their Saengerbunds, and their various other organizations, and today the German is found everywhere in our American public life, from the Police Force up to the Halls of Congress.</p>
   <p>You Greeks can do the same. You have behind you the sentiment and traditions of Ages; all you lack for success is organization and united effort. You all know how easy it is to take one slender stick in the hands and <span class="page-break">4</span>break it with little effort; but take a hundred sticks bound together tightly and no man can break them.</p>
   <p>It is the same with yourselves; singly and alone, it is easy to ignore you and defeat you; but if you were all united into one organization your power and influence would be so great, no man nor set of men, would dare to ignore you or your rights.</p>
   <p>There has been formed in Chicago an organization called The Achaian League. Its purpose is to promote American citizenship among people of Hellenic descent and to enforce and protect the rights of such citizens. Join this League, and get your friends to join! Its officers will see that you become naturalized, that your Citizenship papers are issued to you, that you are registered as voters, and that you are kept informed on matters of public interest and of interest to you.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Achaian League is non-partisan; its purpose is not to favor any one particular party, but to enable the people of Hellenic descent to demand and secure representation in American Government and in Public affairs by means of organized and united effort on the part of the Greek people themselves.</p>
   <p>By your being organized and being interested in public affairs, you will soon become familiar with the customs and the language of the Country, and as the Irish and the Germans and the Poles, the Greeks will soon be found in the Police Department, the Fire Department, the City Council, in City and County offices, in the State Legislature and in Congress. Then will you aid in making Chicago the Athens of America, and, in the upbuilding of yourselves, will secure for the Greek people in America a return of the glory they once had in Greece.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>You can gain recognition in no other way. Your voting strength alone will gauge the position that will be accorded you in the affairs and the life of America. You can win advancement just as the Irish and the others have done. There is much in common between the Irish and the Greeks. I don't know whether the Greeks came originally from Ireland or the Irish came from Greece, but somehwere, sometime, someplace in the fog and gloom of forgotten Ages, they seem to have had a common origin. The pictures and statues of the ancient Greeks look like pictures or statues of Irish statesmen.</p>
   <p>If you do not avail yourselves of the opportunities this country gives you, and of the traits of character you have inherited from the past, you will be false to your own History and a shame to your posterity. Organize, then join the Achaian League, see that all your people are naturalized and, with your united and organized voting strength, demand and secure your rightful place in public affairs and in the future history of American Government.</p>
   <p>George F. Mulligan, 816 Ashland Block, Chicago, Ill.</p>
