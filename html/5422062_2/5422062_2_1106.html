   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>Your able article, "Torch of Democracy Kindled by Pericles, Borne to Triumph by America's Lincoln," which was published in the Herald and Examiner on Sunday, Feb. 11, 1923, merits high commendation.</p>
   <p>I find myself in perfect accord with the thought expressed in your neatly-turned phrases.</p>
   <p>It has long been apparent to me that there is a striking likeness in tone and even in expression between the funeral oration of Pericles and the address delivered by President Lincoln at the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Many of the sentiments of the great Athenian orator would be, with little adoption, appropriate for use on an American Decoration Day.</p>
   <p>So man's heart answers to man's heart, race answers to race, and generation to generation! And how clearly you have brought out these several similarities!</p>
   <p>Therefore, let me express my deep appreciation of this latest gem of your noted and versatile pen, and I shall always be glad of new opportunities to enjoy your work.</p>
   <p>Appreciatively yours,</p>
   <p>Geo. Chrissikos.</p>
