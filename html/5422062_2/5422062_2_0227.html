   <p>Whereas, The Greek-American Regular Democratic Organization is one composed of citizens of Greek descent who are ardent followers of the principles and ideals of democracy, as such democracy is personified at the present time nationally by the great administration of our president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and locally by our esteemed mayor, Edward J. Kelly; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Greek-American Regular Democratic Organization has long been actively engaged--particularly during the administrations of our ex-mayor, Anton J. Cermak, and our present mayor--in spreading the doctrine of democracy, inculcating in our Greek citizenry the principles adopted by the founders of this country, and in upholding the traditions of the Democratic party; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Our honorable mayor, Edward J. Kelly, in pursuing the policies <span class="page-break">2</span>and principles of the Democratic party, and thus effecting great and beneficial economies in the administration of our local government, has become the target of unfair and unjust publicity on the part of a minority element; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The Greek-American Regular Democratic Organization, guided by a sense of duty to the local administration and to the element which it represents, feels that a great injustice and injury has been done to our honorable mayor and to the administration of democracy in this community in general; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the Greek-American Regular Democratic Organization, as the representative of the Greek Democratic element of this community and in the interest of its prosperity and wishes, go on record as faithfully upholding our esteemed mayor, E. J. Kelly of Chicago, in his conduct and his administration of our local government, and approving wholeheartedly <span class="page-break">3</span>his program and his policies. Be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the Greek Regular Democratic Organization will be at his command any time it may be called upon to render its support.</p>
   <p>George Becharas, chairman;</p>
   <p>William Bouramas, secretary;</p>
   <p>James A. Geroulis, recording secretary;</p>
   <p>L. Choromokos, treasurer.</p>
