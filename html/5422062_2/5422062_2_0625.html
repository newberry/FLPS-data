   <p>Recent historical events in the Far East have had a tendency to dim the banner of glory that has constituted the pride and boast of Hellenic people from the immemorial. The heroic deeds of the famous Hellenic warriors of ancient Greece are utilized by the modern critics of this nation to prove their contention of the decadence of those sterling virtues of heart and mind that virtually made Hellenic forces invincible on the battlefield.</p>
   <p>"Passing the buck", in the parlance of the streets, is a vice that constitutes one of the obnoxious products, of a civilization which claims to have achieved its goal in this commercial age, and had dethroned "Principle" (spelled with an E) and enthroned "Principal" (spelled with an A).</p>
   <p>The European nations, governing their actions by this policy, simply utilized Hellenic credulity to advance allied interests in the Far East, urging Greece to defend the cause of Christian sovereignity with its traditional unselfishness, and then deliberately evaded the moral obligation of implied support, when the fortunes of war demanded fulfillment as a necessary measure to transform certain defeat into practical victory.</p>
   <p>Having used Greece as a cat's-paw to pull the Allied chestnuts out of the fire for Eastern mismanagement, instead of offering even a hypocritical sympathy to its badly burnt tool, the Allied Christian nations of Europe add insult to injury by charging the Hellenic hosts with cowardice; salving their conscience by "Passing the buck" and charging the victims of their perfidy with the sole responsibility for the debacle Hellenic courage recorded in song and story.</p>
   
   <p>This attitude of Greece's professed friends clearly demonstrates their own profound ignorance of the true definition of Courage; which is divisible, comprising exceptional moral valor and physical bravery, in great nations as well as great men.</p>
   <p>According to that standard of measurement, the traditions of Hellenic courage are evidently not deficient of that selfsame trait. Moral courage is of higher origin than the physical, since it springs from a consciousness of virtue. It logically follows that no form or moral sophistry can justify the European Christian's desertion of those Hellenic guards placed on the boundary lines of Christian advancement from the invasion of its foes. Nor can it purge them from the infamy of their own devising.</p>
   <p>Perhaps no single example of that spirit which made ancient Greece so glorious can be cited than the one outlined in the following self-explanatory press despatch dated Oct. 25th, 1922, at Pittsburgh,Pa.</p>
   
   <p>Christ A. Melitis of Pittsburgh,who served in France with the 28th Division and was wounded six times, today returned to President Miller-and the Croix de Guerre and citation conferred upon him by France.</p>
   <p>"A good bit of me is left in France; but the wounds I received there were nothing in comparison to the wound I received when I learned that France was helping the Turk," said Melitis' letter which accompanied the decorations.</p>
   <p>Melitis is Vice-President of the Greek-American World War Veterans.</p>
   <p>Consistency is so rare a jewel that one may hunt like Diogenes of old, both night and day, in fruitless endeavor to find one fit to wear that decoration.</p>
   <p>How many of the medal-bedecked alleged heroes of the World War can rise to the same height of true courage attained by Meletis of Hellenic origin who, with a frankness bordering on brutality, candidly announces that any material symbol of virtue loses its spiritual significance and depreciates in moral value in the same degree that the bestowing agency through its own actions demonstrates its total lack of any and all attributes that testify to man's kinship with God.</p>
   <p>Hellenic Post of the American Legion needs offer no apologies for the defeat of the Hellenic forces that forced the fanatical Turks; rather than to stultify themselves by so doing, let them emulate the example set by Meletis of Pittsburgh and by fearlessly voicing the truth make the defamers of Hellenic courage aware of their own lack of true courage, which is calm without insolence or bravado and never indulges in intrigue or character assassination back in the shadow of comparative analysis.</p>
   <p>Let Hellenic Post of the American Legion, not only by virtue of war record of its members, but also by the unity and harmony that makes its present and future activities constitute itself a living refutation of such malicious calumny and thus prove that the Hellenic contribution to America's civilization aids rather than retards its advancement along any and all lines that call for the display of real courage.</p>
