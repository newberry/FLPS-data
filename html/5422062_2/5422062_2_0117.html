   <p>By this time no doubt every one in Chicago, Greek and non-Greek, know that George Becharas is campaigning for the office of county commissioner.</p>
   <p>As we all know, before one can enter a primary election he must get a certain number of signatures on a petition. This was very easy for Mr. Becharas to accomplish because he is well known by all the Greek people and a great number of influential Americans as well. He has already secured ten thousand signatures, a matter which has caused the Central Democratic Committee to give serious consideration to his candidacy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Becharas' entrance into the campaign came as a result of a meeting of the Greek Democratic leaders, who feel that the Greek group is powerful enough to have some influence and at least one man in office.</p>
