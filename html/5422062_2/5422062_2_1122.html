   <p>Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, spoke on "Lincoln as Pericles and Percles as Lincoln" before the Sunday school of the First Methodist Church yesterday morning.</p>
   <p>"We find a striking similarity in the problems solved by the wisdom and statesmanship of Pericles and Lincoln," the editor said.

   <p>"Pericles sowed the seeds of democratic principles," Mr. Lambros said, "with <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the words, we enjoy a form of government that is not for the benefit of the few but for all concerned," but it was Lincoln who gave the meaning of democracy when he said, "that government of the people, for the people, and by the people shall not perish from the earth."</p>
