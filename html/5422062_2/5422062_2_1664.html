   <p>p. 1. The Northwest Business Men's Club has been organized by a body of business men of Greek extraction who are a credit to themselves and their fellow members.</p>
   <p>This city of ours, the City of Chicago, is a mecca where people from all over the world gather and start life anew--the German, Pole, Jew, Swede, and all others. They all have their meeting place, where they can assemble and talk over old times, a place where the language of their mother country may be spoken, friendship resumed and developed, and where they may seek respite from the turmoil of the drudgeries of everyday life. But the Greek, the father of our modern civilization, he who made the Damon and Pythias history, is an orphan. That is why every Greek should join this club, that we may be able to exemplify the friendship of Damon and Pythias.</p>
   <p>It is our hope to be able to erect a club house in the near future along Athenian architectual lines, that will be a show place in Chicago and where we can gather to pass a pleasant evening. We all very well know that in order to accomplish anything along this line it takes more than one man, and it takes <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>more than a few men. So therefore, we ask the cooperation of every Greek in Chicago by becoming a member of our club, that we may be able to gain big political power, and some day be in a position to elect a few of our own nationality as Magistrates. We have a number of intelligent Greek attorneys, who are quite capable of acting as Judges, provided they have the cooperation of the Greeks of Chicago. Every nationality has a certain amount of control of offices and political positions and the Greeks have none. The question is: "Why not?" "No cooperation." The answer is simple.</p>
   <p>We wish to say a few words for the benefit of the restaurant men. It is only recently that the restaurant men, were oppressed by the milk moguls, and the reason was because of a monopolistic tendancy. The Association of Milkmen got together and decided not to take business away from each other. And the consequences were that the restaurant men had to take what ever the milk man handed them, and be satisfied, until the restaurant men got together and formed the Restaurant Association. This combine put up a united front, and compelled the milk moguls to abandon their monopolistic policy, that the Greek restaurant <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>keeper might purchase milk at will.</p>
   <p>It is only recently that the Wholesale Grocers Association had a meeting and decided to stop the credit of every Greek. Why did they do that? They had absolutely no reason. But they felt that we were growing too fast to suit them. Thanks to a few of the Wholesale grocers, who took the Greeks' part in the matter, and the reason for this, was because ninety percent of the grocery business depends upon Greeks. They figured if the credit to the Greeks was wholly shut off, the Greeks would stop buying from them, and they could not stand the pressure. That is the reason why the Greeks should organize clubs, or Associations, they need to defend themselves.</p>
   <p>The vegetable business is practically controlled by Greeks, but, unfortunately, the Greeks have no Association. If they do not get together very soon and organize themselves either the National Tea Company or the A &amp; P Company will inevitably control the market of this business. Look at the bootblacks, they are organized and they fare well.</p>

   <p>If the Greek Confectionary men do not organize to defend their rights in time to cover every corner in Chicago where a Greek confection shop now stands, there will be a drug store controlled by a big corporation, no more Greek confectioners. The Greeks should organize every line of business separately. There are plenty of men in every line to form a strong association. They will be able to help one another financially, as well as socially, and be a credit to all.</p>
   <p>The Northwest Business Mens Club cordially invites every Greek business man to join the club and if this is done we certainly will have so much prestige and power, that our voices will be effective in politics, business, and social affairs.</p>
