   <p>Dear fellow countrymen:</p>
   <p>On Tuesday, November 7, a judicial election will take place for the election of judges and other officials for county positions.</p>
   <p>Therefore, I take the initiative, because of my professional experience, to recommend that you vote for the following candidates to fill the two most important judicial seats:</p>
   <p>For Probate Court Judge, the Honorable Henry Horner; for County Court Judge, vote for the Honorable Edmund Jarecki. Vote for these men not only because they respect the Greek people, but because they are also honest and impartial judges.</p>
   <p>With affection and esteem,</p>
   <p>G.A. Kyriacopoulos,</p>
   <p>Attorney and Chairman of the Greek Democratic Club.</p>
