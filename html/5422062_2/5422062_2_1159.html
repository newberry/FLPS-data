   <p>p. 3.- What characteristic do the Greek women in America have that makes them inferior to European and American women? The answer is: Idleness!</p>
   <p>Anyone who makes a study of the women in America will see that the Greek women make up for what the American ones lack in idleness.</p>
   <p>They hate to work and do nothing but take life easy all day and every day. They have the excuse that as girls they were not allowed to work as the American girls must do. The Greek women prefer the life of Turkish women, sheltered in a harem, that is, they want to live the "life of Reilly", taking everything and giving nothing. They want good clothes, a beautiful home, a full community life and plenty of money. A Greek woman once said, "If I haven't fifty dollars in my pocketbook, I don't leave the house." What would she do if she didn't have fifty dollars, we would like to know?</p>
   <p>This Greek woman would rather own one dress, live very plainly, and let life and love go by rather than budge a little and try to better her economic condition. She has an idea in her little head that if her neighbors think <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>she washes her own clothes, they will drop her from their calling list. This woman has yet to learn that work makes one feel glad to be alive and useful.</p>
   <p>Another woman I know refused to do even housework during the entire depression. Her excuse was that she always had a maid at her mother's home. It would tire her to wash. She didn't like to iron. The cleaning of the house was too much for her. Her two sons made her nervous and irritable, she needed a nurse for them. She insisted that a woman isn't strong enough for all that. Of what use was she then? She wasn't even an ornament in her home--just because she let idleness get the best of her. This idleness makes them become slow in their movements. It takes them an hour to wash the supper dishes and more than that to comb their hair and fix themselves up in general.</p>
   <p>Women, unless they are ill, should work continually. There is an old proverb that says, "The good housekeeper is both slave and queen in her home" She works without complaint and enjoys the fruits of her labor. She budgets her expenses, keeps a clean home, raises her children, and, when necessary, goes out into the world to help.</p>
