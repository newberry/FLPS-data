   <p>The Pekin Cleaners and Hatters, Inc., whose central offices are located at 372 East 61st Street, is one of the most rapidly growing Greek concerns. This company has grown very rapidly during the last few years and now includes seven branch stores, mainly located on the South Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The company is owned and managed by Mr. Anton Papageorge, who deserves the credit for most of its success. The Pekin Cleaners are well known among the people of the South Side who are fastidious about the appearance of their garments.</p>
   <p>We are very proud of this Greek enterprise and wish it continued success.</p>
