   <p>Few delve to the bottom of a cause, but noted historians unearth the cause, and consequently both cause and effect are presented for the enlightenment of the general masses. From what came the glorified bravery of our progenitors? What caused the superhuman victories of the Greeks who forced legions of barbarians to run in defeat? The chief cause of such achievements was attributed to gymnastics and athletics which created steel-like bodies and intrepid souls.</p>
   <p>Something similar to that courage and its warlike proclivity, is found today in the Colleges and Universities of the United States. The American people, today, are, in general, the best athletes and most courageous of people. This is verified by the World War. The bravest and most intelligent soldiers of all were the boys from America. Not once, but many times, they came out of their trenches and like lions fell upon the enemy, whose rain of fire failed to halt the courageous Americans. The Americans today, are following step by step, the glory and grandeur of the ancient Greeks.</p>
   <p>The ancient axiom: "A healthy mind, in a healthy body", could rightly and justly be attributed to the American people.</p>

   <p>and other cities of Greece, had refused to be subdued by Darius. For this reason, the 1,200 ships and the 110,000 Persians had come to subdue Athens.</p>
   <p>The ten Athenian generals, representing the ten communities of Athens, formed a council, and chose Miltiades, as general Commander. Miltiades, was recognized by all as the most gifted general.</p>
   <p>The fate of the world was at stake,, depending upon the outcome of this historical event, Athens, was representing civilization--Persia, barbarism. A Persian victory would have brought cultural darkness to the world for centuries to come.</p>
   <p>The Athenians, owing to their sagacity and great preponderance of physical strength, decided to maintain and perpetuate their civilization. At the break of that eventful September day, 490 B.C., the Greeks like lions, fell upon the Persians, and proved to the world that Grecian glory was justly and immortalized. They did not tackle the enemy by surprise, but like roaring lions informed the Persians that the immortal army of 11,000 was coming to gain the victory!</p>

   <p>The ancient Greeks, through gymnastics and intellectual culture, became the basis of our present day civilization. A historical event is recited here for coroboration of my thesis and for emulation by others.</p>
   <p>One September morning, 490 B.C. 11,000 heavily armed Greeks were massed at the foot of the mountain, Pantelicos. From there to the sea, stretches the six mile plain of Marathon. This six by two mile plain was thronged by 110,000 Persians, and the quay was overcrowded with the naval fleet of Persia. The Persian forces had come to punish that arrogant and proud city of Athens. The salvation of the Greeks was entrusted to the hands of 11,000 immortals and a few naval ships.</p>
   <p>Greece was divided in many kingdoms, or principalities, and Athens was not only a city, but a kingdom also, representing the most perfect democracy of all the nations in the world. Athens was divided into ten communities, or parts, and each community chose one general, who, for one day was the highest military authority in Athens.</p>
   <p>Persia, at that time, was a most powerful and despotic nation, the richest in money and mines, and its Emperor was Darius the First. Athens, Sparta, <span class="page-break">\4</span>They attacked the enemy from three sides. The center body of the Greeks met tremendous resistance, but the steel-bodied Greeks, forged on, reinforced by the flanks, and after a tremendous slaughter, forced the persians to flee to their ships. Then the Greek ships played their part also in destroying a large part of the enemy's fleet, and the remainder fled. The same thing was repeated in later years when Darius' sun, Ixerxes, was defeated by Leonidas. The Greeks maintained their civilization.</p>
   <p>This verifies the belief that in order for anyone to be perfect, as a man and citizen of the government, he must possess, in his daily life, a sound mind and sound body. An intelligent general must possess a sound body in order to have an analogy in bravery.</p>
   <p>Everything is habit and custom, which becomes gradually a second nature. And if we trained youth from childhood the results would be astonishing. Many times we emphasized the fact that a sound mind must be supported by sound body in order to have the most desirable results.</p>
