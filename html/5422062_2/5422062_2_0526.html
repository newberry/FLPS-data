   <p>p. 1- No other race in Chicago has so many business establishments as the Greek race. Greek stores in Chicago number a little more than 4,100, and the Chicago Greek population is 25,000. That is, every fifth Greek in Chicago is a businessman. The money involved in the business transactions of these Greeks amounts to more than a hundred and thirty-seven millions of dollars in a year. Tremendous power indeed! Nevertheless, from the political point of view, this power of the Greek is dead.</p>
   <p>There are in Chicago many and various Greek associations and societies, with a total membership of 8,783, and the object of their existence is to promote better business, to effect mutual cooperation and assistance, and to serve philanthropic purposes. The political part, the most important part of all, is absolutely neglected or left in the hands of others. Many of us are citizens, and we could have strong political organizations, through which we could make ourselves heard in matters concerning the welfare of our adopted country when elections come.</p>
   
   <p>But from what I have heard and observed, the whole matter of the Greek vote stands like this: "I am a law-abiding citizen; I mind my own business; I work from morning to night; if I don't vote, it does not matter; others will vote. I do not personally know anything about the qualifications of the candidates. In my neighborhood many Americans do not vote; why do you pick on the Greeks so much? If any small incident takes place, the American press magnifies the thing and heralds it in big headlines against the Greeks; I would rather stay aloof until I know more of the political game. I have heard a very good and respectable American gentleman expressing his views about politics, and I have no reason to contradict them."</p>
   <p>The above allegations and many others may be true to a certain extent, but every man who lives in this country and enjoys the benefits which it extends to him should be a citizen of the commonwealth which nurtures him, educates him, and protects him without the slightest partiality.</p>
   
   <p>This is an obligation which devolves on every man.</p>
   <p>And after meeting this important obligation, he has a still greater duty to perform, that is, to vote. And when I say vote, it does not mean to vote just to get through with it and show your neighbor that you do as he does, as we go to church to be seen and to see others and to be known as church-goers. That is not meeting our obligation sincerely and faithfully, for it is a display, a pretense of being in harmony with the majority.</p>
   <p>Our voting must be done with reverence and devotion, with thought and diliberation. The interest and the welfare of the country and our own interest and welfare depend upon our voting. Therefore it is an absolute prerequisite to know the character of the person whom we vote for and to vote impartially and honestly. You see, it is a holy duty. The prosperity, the progress, the liberty, and the very existence of the country depend upon our administrators, who are chosen by your vote and mine.</p>
   
   <p>Political unity among Greeks will change the attitude of the press, which sometimes makes a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
   <p>Let us all become American citizens; if there is any difficulty with your papers, Uncle Sam has free information offices to assist you in getting the necessary instructions in regard to the date of your arrival, the boat, and other similar things which we easily forget.</p>
   <p>Let us who are American citizens heed the above suggestions, organize ourselves politically, and become a unit of the political machinery of our adopted country.</p>
