   <p>To the Hellenes:</p>
   <p>In 1910 soon after the Achaian League was organized, among the candidates endorsed by the League was Robert M. Sweitzer, who was then the Democratic candidate for the office of County Clerk. That endorsement was given to Mr. Sweitzer because he was a genuine friend of the people, and that it was merited is shown by the fact that Mr. Sweitzer was re-elected to the office in 1914 by the largest vote given any candidate in that election.</p>
   <p>Carter M. Harrison was endorsed for Mayor of Chicago by this League in 1911 because he was deemed to be the best among the candidates seeking the office at that time. Subsequent to his election, and throughout his term of office, the attitude of his administration toward the Hellenes and his management of the city's affairs have been such that this league cannot endorse him for re-election, but, on the contrary, must recommend his defeat.</p>

   <p>Robert M. Sweitzer, in this campaign for the mayoralty nomination deserves and should receive the votes of all Chicago Democrats who desire an administration of the city's affairs that will be free from inclination to injustice on grounds of race or creed.</p>
   <p>Hellenes will receive justice at Mr. Sweitzer's hands.</p>
   <p>Vote for Mr. Robert M. Sweitzer for Mayor.</p>
   <p>The Achaian League,</p>
   <p>by John C. Theodorou, President</p>
   <p>A. C. Coorlin, Vice-President</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis, Secretary.</p>
