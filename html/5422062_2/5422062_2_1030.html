   <p>Dear Editor of the Saloniki: I write this poor letter to you, and hope that you will publish it so that the people may know of the conditions under which we Greek boys live. All shoe-shine boys are appreciative of the sincere efforts made by the Saloniki, and by a few humane and kind bosses, to better our living and working conditions.</p>
   <p>Fellow workers! We must realize that we are living in the twentieth century, as free citizens, not in the dark ignorance of the Middle Ages, as slaves or serfs.</p>
   <p>Fellow sufferers! We work at least seventeen hours a day. We do not know what it is to celebrate or rest on Sunday, Easter, or Christmas. On holidays we know we are to get up at six o'clock in the morning and are to work until ten o'clock at night. It will take us at least half an hour to walk wearily to the room where we sleep, and another hour for us to eat our supper, wash the dishes, and make arrangements for the night. If we are lucky, we are able to go to sleep at midnight. That means we get five hours of rest!</p>
   <p>In what other civilized nation of the world are such conditions allowed to exist? Therefore, my friends, we must aid the efforts of the Saloniki.</p>
   <p>We await, with great anxiety, the results of the meeting called by the editor of the Saloniki. People who are anxious to help us, will attend the meeting. We owe special thanks to Mr. Prassinos, who was the first person to raise a voice of protest against our semislavery.</p>
   <p>At this meeting they are going to seek a solution to this grave problem. They are going to fight for our rights, since we are unable to do so.</p>
   <p>We only ask that which has been guaranteed by the American Constitution to each and every person--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
   
   <p>Thank you,.</p>
   <p>James Polizois</p>
