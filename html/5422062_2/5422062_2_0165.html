   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>About a year and a half ago, while the country was enjoying prosperity, the Republicans were shouting "turn out the Democrats".</p>
   <p>True to form, the people turned out the party that brought prosperity and plenty.</p>
   <p>It did not take very long after the Republicans went into office for the people to realize the mistake they made. Now the cry from one end of the country to the other is, "put back the Democrats and restore prosperity to the people."</p>
   <p>On April 11th the Democratic party will nominate candidates for various city, county, and State offices and for Representatives in Congress. It is important that representative men be nominated to assure success at the <span class="page-break">\2</span>polls in November. The regular Democratic organization has selected and is supporting men who are eminently fitted for the various offices, and it is the duty of every Democrat to support the ticket so selected.</p>
   <p>We have opened up headquarters in Room 249 Hotel Sherman, and chairman A. A. Pantelis will be at headquarters every day from 12:30 to 1:30 P. M. During the day, Sam Andeppas, John Lambros and Frank Dionesopoulos will be in charge of headquarters. The vice-chairman,George Kyriakopoulos, will be in headquarters every day from 2 to 3 P. M., and the secretary, Nicholas C. Ganas, will be there from 3 to 4 P. M. each day.</p>
   <p>Please call as soon as convenient and be supplied with literature,and help restore prosperity by putting the Democrats back in office.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>N. C. Ganas, Secretary,</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis, chairman.</p>
