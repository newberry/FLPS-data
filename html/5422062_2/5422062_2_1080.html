   <p>If Venus was alive to-day, Ziegfeld would undoubtedly pay her $5000 a day to appear in his "Follies."</p>
   <p>So opined Peter S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star, yesterday in an address before the Central Y.M.C.A. in which he compared modern America to the golden age of Pericles.</p>
   <p>"American ideals are similar to those of ancient Greece," said he. "Soldier Field is a copy of the Stadium at Athens. Classical Greek culture is paralleled by America's great accomplishments in science, art, and material wealth.</p>
   <p>"But Bacchus, god of wine, has been ruled out by Mr. Volstead."</p>
   
   <p>Speaking in behalf of 500,000 American citizens of Greek lineage, 65,000 of them in Chicago, Mr. Lambros declared Americanism "the greatest factor in the world to-day.</p>
   <p>"Our aim in coming to America was to become a living part of it," said he.</p>
