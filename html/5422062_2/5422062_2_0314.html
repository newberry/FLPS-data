   <p>The annual dance of the Greek Democratic Organization of Chicago is being given tomorrow in the Cameo Room of the well known Morrison Hotel, which is located on the north east corner of Madison and Clark Streets.</p>
   <p>The progressive and very active Executive Committee of the above mentioned Organization has wholeheartedly given its best efforts so that the dance may take place with the proper order and success.</p>
   <p>We hope, that the whole Greek Colony will honor with their presence this Organization, which is composed of the most eminent people of our Greek Colony and it has offered many services of a nationalistic character.</p>
