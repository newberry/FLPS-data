   <p>Archbishop Meletios, Metropolitan of Athens and President of the Holy Synod of Greece, arrived in Chicago today with a message of patriotism for his countrymen of the Middle West. Accompanying him were members of the Greek Commission to the United States. They are guests of the Hellenic Central Executive Committee, which is cooperating with the State Council of Defense in the entertainment program.</p>
   <p>Archbishop Meletios retired to his room at the Blackstone Hotel immediately upon his arrival.</p>
   <p>"I have come to Chicago to stir the Greek citizens to further deeds of patriotism", he said. "My message to them is, do not wait to be drafted, but enlist."</p>
   <p>As with the other allies, the United States government has signed a treaty with Greece providing that Greeks not naturalized shall either enlist or be returned to Greece to be drafted. Thursday night the Archbishop is to deliver his message at the Auditorium theater. He will also recount the activities of his country in the war and relate the manner in which the Greek people are supporting the allies in Europe as well as in America.</p>
