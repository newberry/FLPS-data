   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Salopoulos has suggested that you act as Director of Publicity for the Greek Division during the present campaign, and if this is agreeable to you we shall be glad to have you furnish us with a list of the Greek papers which, in your opinion, are absolutely loyal and entitled to any paid advertising which may be given out.</p>
   <p>In furnishing this list, please give us as near as possible the circulation of each paper and what the charges would be for full-page advertisements. We hope to have at least two such advertisements during the present campaign, and would like also to have you,together with the editors and other qualified men, prepare copy for such full-page advertisements which, in your opinion, would have the best effect on the Greek reading public. This copy should be sent to us as soon as possible, together with the other information.</p>
   <p>Trusting that you will be able to act in this capacity, we are,</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>Nels M. Hokanson,</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
