   <p>The economic crisis persists, despite the N. R. A. According to my way of thinking, it cannot help but do so. It was a general equalizer for great and small enterprise. It is a sort of "bed of Prokroustis" which, according to Greek mythology, was made to fit all sleepers. Of course, it was a rather uncomfortable bed to sleep in, for if one were too short his body was stretched until it was the same length as the bed; and if he were too tall the condition was remedied by having his legs cut short. So you see how the bed managed to fit everyone and to equalize all who slept upon it.</p>
   <p>We all know that what benefits a small business does not necessarily benefit a large one, and vice versa. One pair of shoes cannot be comfortable on all feet. Some will find them short, others wide, and still others painful. By the same line of reasoning we conclude that no one medicine will cure the various ills of all the people. We have discovered that stuff supposed to <span class="page-break">2</span>cure all ailments never cures anything at all.</p>
   <p>Even, if all classes were affected by this economic crisis, some would be affected more than others. Nevertheless, it is believed by many that one group does exist which has not felt any economic discomfort. Judging from what we saw at the clerical convention which took place last month in Chicago, we would say that group is the priests. This opinion was held by all the laymen who attended any of the meetings of the convention.</p>
   <p>All of us have seen the Byzantine paintings of the saints, the Biblical characters, and the holy men of the past. We are familiar with their ascetic appearance and their bodies which have become transparent from fasting. Now, turn and look at the assembled group of Greek priests. What a difference! Well-fed, well-rounded, red-cheeked, and heavy-jowled. And we ask: "Can those men be the future saints? And if they do become saints do you not think it will be difficult to find painters to paint their portraits? And <span class="page-break">3</span>if the painters can be found, what will be the reaction of the worshiping flock when it gages upon them?"</p>
   <p>Aside from the Archbishop and one or two of the priests, the others will make very poor models for saints. H....[sic] One cannot have a red-cheeked, full face, resembling a full moon, and pose as an ascetic. Nor can he have the shoulders and biceps of a wrestler, and be a model for the picture of a penitent faster.</p>
   <p>Of course, I, personally, cannot really be sure that the priests have not felt the crisis; but I am sure of their possibilities as saints. None of them could ever achieve the appearance of Saint John the Baptist, or Saint John of Kaluvitis. So our future artists can solve this problem by painting all of them as Saint George or Saint James--both of whom were well fed. A new angle on the well-being of the priests was pointed out by my friend John Psihalinos, a local undertaker.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Well John, I see you have another customer (meaning a corpse), and are making a lot of money," I said to him the other day.</p>
   <p>"Yes, I have had a pretty regular run of funerals, but I can't manage to make any money. The crisis...." [sic]</p>
   <p>"Oh, stop for goodness' sake! If you have funerals you can't help but make money; so what are you saying about the crisis?" I answered angrily.</p>
   <p>"I still insist I don't make money," he said. "My work is just like all other types. I am affected by the low incomes of the people just as all other businessmen are. But I know a group that isn't. You see, some people, like you, derive their living from the living; while others, such as I, derive it from the dead. But there are some who live at the expense of both the living and the dead, as do the priests."</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Therefore, in accordance with the philosophy of my friend John, the priests have experienced no crisis. They are like the lambs which nurse from two ewes.</p>
