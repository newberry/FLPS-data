   <p>p.1--Among the many Greek immigrants who have come to Chicago and settled are the Koutoumanos brothers, who were the first Greeks to establish a tobacco factory here. All four brothers are experts in the art of making cigarettes and curing tobacco.</p>
   <p>In 1910 they founded a small business at 727 South Halsted street and they now operate a good-sized factory at 742 South Halsted street, where they manufacture cigars and cut tobacco fine for cigarettes. They sell the E1 Rodeo and the Capita cigars even now, when the depression has hurt all business.</p>
   <p>Of the brothers George came to America first in 1905; Anastasios followed in 1906, and Panagiotes in 1907. The youngest brother, Polyzoes, arrived in 1910, and in that year they founded their tobacco business.</p>
   
   <p>Another admirable characteristic of the Koutomanos family is that all four brothers and their families live together and work together, a unique example of the unity and independence of the Greek family and of the Greek spirit of loyalty and family love.</p>
