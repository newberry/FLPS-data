   <p>With great joy Loxias announces that the eminent Lambros Diamesis has been granted a doctor's license from the State of Illinois. The Greeks of Chicago should be very proud and very thankful to have this great man among us.</p>
   <p>After his studies in Athens, he gave his services for five years to the Pathological laboratory in that city. The following five years spent in Germany, assisting Professor Muller in the Pathological laboratory there.</p>

   <p>From there he went to Vienna and was closely associated with Prof. Joseph Bauer and Prof. Noorden.</p>
   <p>Dr. Diamesis has been in Chicago once a year publishing several periodicals he has brought with him from Germany.</p>
   <p>We are very fortunate to have such a learned doctor in our midst because we are sure he will be of great benefit to our city. His offices are at 16 W. Chicago Ave, Chicago.</p>
