   <p>The American Restaurant Ass'n. of Chicago, a Greek club, has been established for over a year. The purpose of the organization is to look after the interests of its members and to do what it can to improve the restaurant business.</p>
   <p>The Greek restaurateurs, united, are a colossal power. They are in a position to organize the restaurant business and make huge profits for all.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of knowing one another they have decided to give an annual banquet to which members and their families are invited.</p>
   <p>On May 13, at 8 P.M., the Greek restaurateurs and their families will gather in the Grand Ballroom of the La Salle Hotel, for the annual dinner-dance. We don't need to remind the restaurateurs of the event. They will all be there to help make the evening a success.</p>
