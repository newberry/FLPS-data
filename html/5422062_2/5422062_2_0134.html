   <p>p. 6.- We, the Greek-American Republican Club members of Cook County, at a meeting assembled on the 10th day of March, 1931, having the welfare of our adopted city of Chicago at heart and realizing the vicissitudes that confront it in the forthcoming election, do, hereby, highly resolve:</p>
   <p>1. THAT the City of Chicago shall, and of right, ought to regain its former position of prestige and power in the eyes of the world;</p>
   <p>2. THAT the City of Chicago and its people will be best served by one whose past record is replete with hard, unrelenting work and sterling achievement;</p>
   <p>3. THAT the present crisis demands that we discard party politics in the interest of our beloved city, and to that end we hereby further resolve:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>THAT we unqualifiedly endorse the candidacy of the Honorable Anton J. Cermak, Democratic candidate for Mayor, the man best fitted to fill the Mayor's chair of the City of Chicago with the honor, loyalty, ability and integrity that traditionally belongs to it.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos, President</p>
   <p>George W. Prassas, Secretary.</p>
