   <p>The Chicago Greek Daily is always watching, with interest, our new intellectuals, and, with a pleasure, will present in its columns the ones that, with much studious effort and labor, win a place among our other intellectuals. Such a one we have to present today in the person of Mr. George Drosos.</p>
   <p>Mr. George J. Drosos from Melion, Ganohoron, Thrace, graduate of the Grand Institution of learning in Constantinople, Adminstrator of Grammar schools in Turkey and Greece, having received great honors in the Educational Convention of Salonika by the supervisor, Mr. Dem. Andreades, for his zeal and correct conception of tutoring, gained the ardent praise of the Board of Education of Salonika. Mr. Drosos came to America and attended the University of Chicago University for four years, receiving the Degree of Bachelor of Philosophy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Drosos, in brief, is our new intellectual. The Greek Community of Chicago, and especially the West Side school of which he has assured the management, wish him success.</p>
