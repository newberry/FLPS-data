   <p>The United States celebrates, during the month of February, the birthdays of two famous patriots. President Washington and President Lincoln, are two of the most loved and best-remembered men in American history. And very justly so. It is customary for nations to celebrate the birthdays or dates of death of their great children--not because they feel a spirit of obligation or thank-fulness, but for the purpose of inspiring the younger generations to similar acts of patriotism and sacrifice.</p>
   <p>In this same month, however, occurs the birthday of Thomas Paine--a men unfortunately overlooked by historians and by the immigrant groups of America. This has happened because Paine was a misunderstood man in his lifetime and is still so in ours.</p>

   <p>Yet Thomas Paine was one of the greatest patriots of his period. Historians ignored him and even refused to acknowledge him as worth while.....As a result of this indifference we do not hear much about Paine or his patriotic activity. In fact, our entire attitude can be summed up in the words of a former President of the United States when he called Paine, "a filthy little atheist".</p>
   <p>Paine was not little nor can we call a man who in his will says, "I die in perfect composure and resignation to the will of my creator, God," an atheist.</p>
   <p>If we do not know much about him it is due to the failure of his fellow patriots to understand him. We must not forget that Paine lived in an era when men were ultraconservative and reactionary in thought and tolerated no questioning or examination of existing concepts.....Because he dared to do this he was criticized and abhored. This attitude persisted not only during his life but even until now, years after his death.</p>
   <p>How many of us know that the idea of American liberation did not originate with <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Washington but was the dream of Paine? How many of us know that Thomas Paine was one of the first to write and talk about woman suffrage and the equality of women? How many know he was the first one to formulate the idea of the United States of America, which can justly be credited with starting the American Revolution, at a time when, as Franklin said, "No American, drunk or sober, thought of independence".</p>
   <p>Thomas Paine was not of the caliber of patriots who say much while they sit comfortably drinking tea in front of a fire. While all the other patriots were signing the Declaration of Independence, Paine was serving as a common soldier in the army under Nathaniel Greene. During a critical period in the war Paine wrote:</p>
   <p>"These are the times which try men's souls. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph."</p>
   <p>Paine had followed the path of such men as Christ, Socrates, Pithagoras, and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Galileo. This path may not lead to glory, but it does raise the standard of mankind throughout the world. He did only what he considered his duty. He died poor, forsaken, and unmourned. He continues to be the "forgotten man" of the democracy he dreamt of and hoped for. He hewed a new road of thought through the hopeless brambles--let us have courage to follow.</p>
