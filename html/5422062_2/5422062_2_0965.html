   <p>P. S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star, one of the leading Greek papers in the country, today made a prophecy regarding the division of the spoils of the Balkan war. This is how the territory will be divided after the war, in Mr. Lambros' opinion.</p>
   <p>Montenegro will take Scutari and a small zone of North Albania. Servia will take old Servia. Bulgaria will take all the surrounding territory outside of Constantinople. Greece will take practically all of Macedonia, with Monastir and Saloniki, besides Epirus and the islands of the Aegean sea.</p>

   <p>"How are they going to divide the spoils?" asked Mr. Lambros. "This is the question that occupies the mind of the diplomatic world. This is a matter of which nobody knows, excepting the heads of the four Balkans. Nothing to that effect has, as yet, been given for official publication, and whatever has been published so far is only a surmise. The only thing that is an absolute truth is the fact that the alliance covers every detail in every respect, and there would be no room for quarrel over the spoils, for the Balkans will not want to become the laughing stock of the world.</p>
   <p>"If I am to answer that question, I do not think it will be out of the way if I make the following prophecy:</p>
   <p>"In the first place the rules of the Berlin treaty, in my opinion, that give Greece Epirus and a zone of the Southern Macedonia, is not included in the agreement of the Balkans. Outside of that the territories will be divided as follows:</p>

   <p>"Montenegro will take Scutari and a small zone of North Albania. Servia will take Old Servia, a zone of territory toward her borders from Macedonia so that it will give her a sea port in the Adriatic Sea. Bulgaria will take all the surrounding territory outside of Constantinople, such as Adrianople, Kir Killis, Tsoulou, etc., and will have a seaport from Kavala bay down to the gulf of Saros, besides a small zone of Macedonia toward her frontier. Greece will take practically the entire Macedonia with Monastir and Saloniki besides Epirus and the islands of the Aegean Sea, not mentioning Crete, which has been annexed right after the war was declared. The result of the war shows that the Balkans have fought and won because they fought for a cause concerning civilization, Christianity and humanity against barbarism, crescent and the atrocities of the 'Great Assassin.'</p>
   <p>"History will speak highly of the National spirit and the enthusiasm of the Balkans, while on the other hand it will be shown that the Turks became cowards, demoralized and unable to fight."</p>
