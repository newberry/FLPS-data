   <p>In answer to the plea made by Mr. N. Salopoulos, in behalf of the mother country, thousands of Greek men have thronged into Chicago.</p>
   <p>So many answered the call to enlist in behalf of Greece, that the Consulate's office could not properly take care of the applicants; so it became necessary to hire a large hall at 748 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
   <p>Men are arriving from all over the Middle West to file applications, in order that they might return and fight for Greece. The first man to enlist from Chicago was the president of the Veterans Club, Mr. John Agriostathis.</p>
