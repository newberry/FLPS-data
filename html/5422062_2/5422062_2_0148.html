   <p>p. 4.- As the deadline of April 8th draws near, Miss Ruth Hanna McCormick, Republican, who is running for United States Senator, is redoubling her energies. Her political offices take up four floors at 14 E. Monroe St.</p>
   <p>The Greek branch is entirely organized and all Greeks interested in seeing Miss McCormick elected should visit the offices of this Greek organization. On the first floor, a large reception room furnishes space for many chats and conversations with Miss McCormick and her helpers.</p>
