   <p>p. 1- For a number of days now the political activities and fervor in the County, and the whole State as well, for the coming primaries on April 8th, began to manifest themselves in earnest.</p>
   <p>That which the Greek Daily announces, with particular joy to its reading public, however, is the interest manifested by and the political activities of, a considerable portion of the Greeks in our city. They have unequivocally declared themselves wholly for that group of the Republican party whose leading figure is the Hon. Charles E. Deneen. An article dealing with this event will appear in the next issue of the Greek Daily.</p>
   <p>The Greek Daily does not think that it can add much to the situation as the Press Committee has clearly and distinctly demonstrated events as they are. The only thing to be added is our unreserved support towards this group which has shown good results in the past.</p>
   <p>Greeks of Chicago, we are lacking in neither spirit, nor in economic means, nor votes. What we fall behind in is politics. Show, therefore, the political interest that is due. Let us merge into a political group, which <span class="page-break">\2</span>regardless of the results of the coming election, will remain an organized group and will put us on the map.</p>
   <p>As individuals you can be sure that you accomplish nothing. As an organized group, however, much could be attained.</p>
