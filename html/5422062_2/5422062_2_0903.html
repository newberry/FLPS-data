   <p>Saloniki is of the opinion that it is the bounden duty of a state-wide and nation-wide newspaper to keep its readers abreast of all the important national and international developments. Especially do the Greek people of Chicago, and of America generally, need to be informed about the significance and inevitable world-wide repercussions of the titanic World War raging between the Entente Powers and the Central Austro-German Alliance. There is no doubt whatever that the United States of America, our mother country, as well as the entire world, will be affected to a greater or lesser degree by the terrible and horrible war that Britain, France, Russia, and their small allies are waging against brutal force, international anarchy, and against ambitious militaristic nations which are obsessed with the idea that they are predestined to conquer the world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Being Americans and Greeks, we know where our sympathies and moral support lie. The very names of Greece and America, their glorious history and achievements, are synonymous with the ideals of justice, freedom, international peace, and order.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago are very much concerned with and deeply interested in the position that the Greek government is taking toward England, France, and Russia in the present war. Until now, because of the delicate international position of Greece, especially in so far as its geographical and strategic position is concerned, the only sane course that the Greek government under His Majesty King Constantine and Premier Venizelos could follow was the policy of strict neutrality. Lately, however, through the Greek press and through official pronouncements of the Greek government, it has been revealed that the overwhelming sentiment of the Greek people is unmistakably pro-Ally. This attitude, this partiality, this friendship of the Greek people for Great Britain and France, is neither surprising nor unexpected. Common interests and ideals have made Great Britain, France, <span class="page-break">\3</span>and Greece the closest of friends. These two great powers fought for our independence both in the field of diplomacy and on the field of battle eighty-eight years ago. They were the ones that gave us our independence after they had destroyed the Turkish and Egyptain fleets in the Bay of Navarino in October, 1827. France and Britain gave us loans and every possible moral and material assistance as soon as the small, infant kingdom of Greece was established in 1832. In the desperate effort of our fathers to build and organize a new nation politically, economically, socially and intellectually, the Allies offered the Greek people invaluable support, for which Greece shall be eternally grateful. To a very great extent, our life has been patterned after the British and French systems of government, industry, commerce, and defense. Many features of our social and civic life are British or French in origin.</p>
   <p>Is there any wonder, then, why the Greeks of America, why our people in the fatherland, are favoring the Allied cause, and are inclined to offer Britain and France every possible moral support?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Leaving aside all considerations of sentiment and examining the facts of the present international upheaval in their positive aspect, we find that Greece is pre-eminently a small naval and maritime power; therefore, her interests compel her to co-operate with the masters of the seas. It is indeed very fortunate that the British and French fleets rule the waves.</p>
   <p>Today, the pro-Ally foreign policy of our great statesman, Eleutherios Venizelos, has been adopted by the new Greek government, according to the statement of Christakis Zographos, the Foreign Minister of Greece.</p>
   <p>We, here in America, and the entire Greek nation receive the pronouncement of the new government with great joy. We are all waiting impatiently for the moment when the armed forces of Greece will be fighting by the side of the Allies. By foregoing our silly neutrality policy, we will have the opportunity of fighting for the liberation of millions of our brothers who are still bowing a submissive head to the Turkish tyrant.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>No Greek can have a different desire, because as long as our traditional mortal enemy, Turkey, is allied to and fighting on the side of Austria-Hungary and Germany, nations which have injured Greece in so many ways in the past, we, as loyal Greeks, would naturally never even think of entering the war on the side of our avowed enemies.</p>
   <p>The foreign policy formulated by Venizelos is fully endorsed by the Greek people. There can be no alternative. It is very pleasing to know that the new Greek government under Gounaris has stated that it will continue the methods and policies of Venizelos' government. The Greek people can sleep quietly, because it has a strong government. We all have full confidence in our nation's present leaders.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of Chicago, in particular, and the Greeks of the United States, in general, are expected to follow the evolution of the political and war situation in Europe with undiminished interest. It is their duty, however, <span class="page-break">\6</span>to be very cautious in making extravagant or provocative statements. We must realize that many thousands of miles separate us from the scene of conflict; consequently, no one can possibly know at any given time what is happening in Europe or in our mother country. Furthermore, the Greek people of Chicago and America must be prepared to offer any immediate service to Mother Hellas, if called upon to do so. It seems inevitable that Greece will be obliged to enter the war. The hour is so critical that amid the conflicting opinions and ideas of our people in this city in regard to our entrance into the war, Saloniki can merely offer this advice to all: Be ready to answer the call of your country. It is imperative that everyone perform his patriotic duty at this time.</p>
   <p>The foreign policy of Greece has been decided upon. It cannot be changed now. There are absolutely no grounds for giving the slightest credence to rumors of serious quarrels and differences of opinion within the Greek government. The political life of Greece is very stable. All are of one <span class="page-break">\7</span>counsel, from King Constantine down to the common soldier. All are working for the glory and grandeur of the fatherland. No Greek should think differently.</p>
