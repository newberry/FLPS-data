   <p>Dear Mr. Mammon:</p>
   <p>This is to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, commenting upon the great victory of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>It is gratifying indeed to state that it has been my privilege and pleasure to participate in this campaign as vice-chairman, under your able leadership as the chairman of the Coolidge-Dawes Greek-American Republican Club.</p>
   <p>Though the victory is ours, yet, I feel there is much work before us, even after the election, and I feel that the good work already done must not stop at any time, but we must continue our efforts in behalf of the administration, under our excellent president, Coolidge, with hopes in view of electing General Dawes the next President of the United States.</p>
   <p>With kindest personal regards and best wishes, I am</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>P. S. Lambros.</p>
