   <p>p. 2.- The Democrat feels that it has the right to inform the Greek people of Chicago, and especially those who have the privilege of voting, at the coming election, to cast their votes for the Mayor of our city, W. E. Dever. During his four year term as Mayor of our city, he has cleaned up the various places where crime might breed. Included in his "clean-up" campaign were the soft-drink parlors, police politics, bootleggers, and the South Water Market. One of the biggest improvements of our city during his term is the beautiful "Wacker Drive." He has improved the parks of our city and added more to an already large list. He has made new streets, demanded more light at night, and made Chicago a safe place for a large population. Everybody benefits from what he has done so we must vote for him again to help him carry on his good work.</p>
