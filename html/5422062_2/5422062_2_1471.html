   <p>The much-discussed formation of an organization of Greeks in business on Halsted Street from Randolph Street to Roosevelt Road has become a reality. First, all Greek proprietors were contacted to determine whether or not such an organization was desired. This was followed by a series of meetings held at the Greek Club of Mr. Mimis Economides. Problems were discussed, future plans were laid, and a board of directors was elected.</p>
   <p>These gentlemen met in the offices of Mallars and Sias last Tuesday and elected their officers. P. Bougas was elected president; D. Panagakis, vice-president; James Passialis, treasurer; and Th. Haliotis, secretary. The directors are Messrs. Mouzakeotis, Orologas, Tsouloufis, and Kaisaris.</p>
   <p>These men will make plans for the promotion of good will toward Greek <span class="page-break">2</span>merchants and for the increase of their patronage.</p>
