   <p>The progressive Mr. T. J. Paganis recently opened his new restaurant at 1011 North State Street. This place is unique among Greek dining establishments.</p>
   <p>Its atmosphere is old Russian, and it has been named the "Volga". The employees all wear the traditional and beautiful Russian peasant dress. The furnishings are in the authentic Russian style; they make one forget he is in America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paganis deserves hearty congratulations for this new achievement. The entire Greek community benefits from such a progressive venture.</p>
