   <p>Another new restaurant opened its doors yesterday. It is owned by B. Karagiannis and N. Selimus at 810 S. Wabash.</p>
   <p>The restaurant owned by Mr. Karagiannis which had been situated there for eight years is no more. The new enlarged, modern restaurant has taken its place.</p>
   <p>The beautiful furnishings are the work of Pappas and Alex Co., under direct supervision of Mr. Mazarakis.</p>
   <p>Their grand opening day was a great success yesterday. We wish them the same success in the future.</p>
