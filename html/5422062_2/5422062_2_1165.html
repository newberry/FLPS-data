   <p>Fifty years ago, when city women, pressed by the requirements of life, began, in the western countries of Europe, to attend universities and higher institutions of learning, men considered it unnatural. Even scientists were stirred. How was it possible for woman to enter the sacred temple of science, which man himself approached with awe! They wanted to prove that woman was mentally inferior to man; they began to investigate the form and the weight of the brains of man and of woman, and it was found that woman's brain was 184 grammes lighter than man's. That seemed to them sufficient proof. (The authoress of this article continues with a long diatribe, quoting different authorities on the question, and her comments on them - Translator) Just why? Why was woman as a scientist usually inferior to man? The woman who in everyday life was equal to him and often even superior to him? Men admit with impartiality that the average woman of the people, of the farm, is more intelligent than the man who is equally uneducated. She is the real head of the family, takes care of everything, and sees to the future of the children as well. They remember that during the last war women, though <span class="page-break">\2</span>unprepared, held the interior line well. They successfully replaced their men in stores and offices and on farms. Why then this difference?</p>
   <p>.....Woman is interested in the concrete, in things themselves, not in the natural laws which underlie superficial appearances.</p>
   <p>"Naturally, I would have stayed in my own country," one of our most eminent Greek woman scientists humorously remarked to me some time ago, "I would not have entered the life-struggle if it had not been for the lack of husbands."</p>
   <p>This difference in the orientation of men's and women's interests accounts for the difference in quality of woman's wit and man's.</p>
   <p>.... "Woman has wit, aye, plenty of it, but her wit is in accordance with her specific nature and serves her feminine mission," says Lady Czina Lambroso. "It differs qualitatively from that of man and is interested differently."</p>

   <p>However, the results themselves do not justify the exclusion of women from higher education. Nor must those women who have no inclination for education imagine that their mission in this world is inferior.</p>
   <p>Not all life is spent in the laboratories and the offices of the wise. Let them truly fulfill their feminine mission beside their children and their husbands, thus working for the progress of humanity as much if not more than scientists. They must prepare the workers of the future and encourage those of the present. They spread all around them kindness, cheerfulness, and love, the things that lend value to life.</p>
   <p>.... And by this psychical cooperation of the sexes, supplementing their physical cooperation, both will be perfected, and we shall have the superior man and the superior woman of the future, as we see them in Drosini's book Ersi.</p>
