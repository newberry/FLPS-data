   <p>Very artistic stickers have been printed by the Saloniki press which make the following announcement:</p>
   <p>"No one is employed in this place of business who does not believe that the patriotic interest is higher and greater than the personal one and who does not prove that he is a loyal and a good citizen by investing in Liberty Bonds or War Saving Stamps, or who is not sacrificing himself for the honor and interest of this great Republic as a token of devotion to her. The existence of this business depends upon her to whom it belongs."</p>
   <p>Any businessman who desires to post this notice in his store and thus demonstrate his patriotism may write or call at the office of the Saloniki which offers these printed notices free of charge to its subscribers.</p>
