   <p>A new Greek restaurant has just opened which is entirely different from any we have ever seen. We are proud to witness such progressiveness on the part of the Greeks. They have begun to modernize their systems and their equipment. They are always experimenting with new ideas and inventions.</p>
   <p>This new restaurant is opened by John,Andrew, and Ambrose Batsis, brothers at 1033-37 Berwyn Avenue, in the aristocratic vicinity of the Edgewater Beach Hotel. It is known as the Seville Grill and is decorated in Spanish style. It was equipped by Peppas &amp; Alex Company. We congratulate the owners on this new enterprise, which is sure to be a success.</p>
