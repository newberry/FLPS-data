   <p>Mr. Nicholas D. Cheronis, whose picture is printed above, and whose advertisements in the Saloniki are familiar to all of you, happens to be the first Greek chemist to become well known in this country. His opening a chemical laboratory indicates that the Greek spirit is progressing, not only in the commercial world, but in the arts and sciences as well.</p>
   <p>Not only is Mr. Cheronis the first Greek chemist, but he is also numbered among the few chemists in this country to succeed in finding the synthesis and production of many rare substances which hitherto had been known only to German chemists.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cheronis pursued his studies in the Athenian Gymnasium, and came to America in 1912 with a burning love for letters, and a very strong inclination for the study of chemistry. He enrolled at the University of Chicago, and graduated with honors within three years. During those three years he suffered, and was forced to struggle very hard because he was earning his living and studying at the same time.</p>
   <p>At that time America had entered the war, and Cheronis, with the other young men, volunteered his services. He was assigned to the chemical research division, and was given the task of discovering a chemical protection against the poisonous gases used by the Germans. His services were very valuable to the United States Army, and his labor saved many soldiers from gas poisoning. He opened a laboratory on Jackson Boulevard immediately after his discharge. His business was so good that he had been forced to open two more laboratories.</p>
   <p>Anyone would imagine that Mr. Cheronis would confine himself to those activities, but he had no intention of doing so. Besides teaching at the School of Pharmacy, he is also studying at the Chicago University in order to receive the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.</p>
   <p>The Saloniki feels a great satisfaction and joy at the great progress of Cheronis, and wishes him much success and happiness. This young man is worthy of the highest regard of the entire community. He is not only a benefactor to humanity, but he is an honor to his family, his country, and his fatherland. It is to be hoped that his example will be followed by the other young Greek men and women.</p>
