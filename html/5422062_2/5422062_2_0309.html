   <p>Our Dear Mr. Dawes:</p>
   <p>We, the Greek-American Republicans of the United States, your admirers and political friends, are indeed very happy because you have been elected as Vice-President of our glorious Country, and by our Committee respectfully express to you our cordial congratulations, with the wish that we may one day see you as the President of the United States for the prosperity of our Country and the good of humanity.</p>
   <p>Permit us to present to you a little pipe of your style, made by a Greek of the former capitol of the Grecian Empire, Constantinople, and to wish the Almighty God to keep you in perfect health so that you may smoke it in the White House.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Republican-Greek American Party and Committee, C. A. Paleologos Mammon, Chairman.</p>
