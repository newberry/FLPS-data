   <p>The well-known firm or Mr. B. Kuratzis, which is managed by Mrs. A. Kondulis, has moved to larger quarters and a better location. The W. and K. Fur Company, as it is called,has acquired a fine clientele in a brief period of time. The store is very popular with most of the chic and well-dressed Greek women of Chicago; and this fact made possible the transfer to a more aristocratic salon. The firm is now located in the Capital Building in the heart of the shopping district of the Loop, on the corner of State and Randolph Streets.</p>
   <p>This Greek fur establishment has every facility necessary to give service to its customers. Ample storage vaults are available for summer fur protection. Prices are reasonable, and there are hundreds of styles to choose from.</p>
