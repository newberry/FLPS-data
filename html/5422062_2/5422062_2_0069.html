   <p>In the last publication of the Greek Star, the eminent doctor of our city Dr. K. Kalliontzis wrote an article titled, "The Enemies of Our Country, Greece."</p>
   <p>We respect and appreciate the profound thoughts of our honorable doctor, regarding the political struggle which is going on in Greece. His writings to that effect are wonderful and very beneficial. But we do not agree nor approve of his theme against Free Mansory and Socialism.</p>
   <p>The distinguished member of our community is either misinformed, prejudiced, or lacking historical knowledge some medical men and other professionals, might be a power and authority in their profession but when it comes to world affairs, their knowledge and opinions are not worth much.</p>
