   <p>p. 5. On November 4, 1924, you are bound to perform your duty as a citizen by easting your vote for President and Vice-president of the United States and the other elective officers.</p>
   <p>We ask you to vote for the Republican candidates Coolidge and Dawes, and for the other Republican candidates so that they will be able to carry out their economic program in support of the Constitution.</p>
   <p>All business, big and small, and the laboring classes as well will benefit equally by the election of Republicans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Messrs. Coolidge and Dawes will apply the program of the party, which is to support national industry and the products of this country by cutting taxes and imposing a heavy tariff on imported products.</p>
   <p>The application of this principle will keep industry in operation, will give workers continuous employment, and will maintain the demand for American products with the result that wages will go up in all fields.</p>
   <p>Commerce and industry are the arteries of the peoples life, and they are protected by the Republican party the creator of our prosperity. Besides this these candidates are friends of our native country which is now badly need of such protectors.</p>
   <p>Therefore we must not only vote for the Republican candidates, but we must work to persuade others to vote for them. If they lose, and we trust that they will not, "chaos will ensue," as Mr. Dawes has said.</p>
   <p>For the Committee, K. Palecluges.</p>
