   <p>"To the Cretans of Chicago,</p>
   <p>"Fellow patriots: The Cretan Brotherhood of Chicago has called a general meeting in the regular meeting hall at Polk Street and Blue Island Avenue, and requests not only its members, but all Cretans of Chicago to be present. The reason for holding this meeting is of interest to all people of Cretan descent who love their mother country.</p>
   <p>The presence of all Cretans of Chicago is important and even obligatory, as the meeting is not called for the purpose of increasing the membership of the organization, but to discuss matters vital to Greece. The critical conditions existing today have made thousands of Greeks living in this free country pray to the Almighty that their brothers in Greece may soon enjoy the same freedom they possess here. We wish to ask the people of the United States to help us in our fight for the liberation of the thousands of our brothers who are suffering untold agonies at the hands of the merciless Turks and Bulgarians.</p>
   <p>We are sure that anyone with a heart and a sympathetic soul will make sure that he attends this meeting of the Chicago Cretans. The meeting is being held for the purposes of showing our patriotic instincts and pity for human suffering.</p>
   <p>With respect and thanks,</p>
   <p>The Committee of Cretan Brotherhood of Chicago."</p>
