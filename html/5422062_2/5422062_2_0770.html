   <p>Thrift, as a characteristic of a nation and people, is one of the most vital elements for the prosperity and power of any nation. It is one of the greatest factors for the continuation of the war and for steady progress in time of peace.</p>
   <p>Thrift is a self-imposed rule against any extravagance and waste. It is a principle, which, by application, becomes a habit, a compulsion to progress. It is a cause of stimulation for industry and activity, discouraging or correcting indolence. Thrift is reasonable control. It is the means by which we are trained to supply ourselves with necessities and which exercises such an influence on our judgment for the preservation of profits. It guides us in not purchasing more than is necessary, and we thus refrain <span class="page-break">\2</span>from buying something that we will not use. Thrift is something that makes us distinguish between different brands and to weigh values. It makes for a more proper use of the dollar. It is the bridle of any inclination to waste. If we intend to purchase something and are about to choose between two similar articles, one of which is worth one dollar and the other, one and one-half dollars, without any appreciable difference in quality between the two, we will choose the first, and in this we are actuated by thrift. This is the reason for issuing Thrift Stamps. Economy is the motive for thrift, that is, the avoidance of waste and the desire for profit. A man may practice economy without being economical, but no one can be economical without being thrifty. The object of thrift is to increase savings. Extravagance is the opposite of economy. Thrift is the power which uses profit for useful purposes, it transforms the useless into the useful and substitutes idleness with profitable occupation.</p>
   <p>Every man, woman, and child in our country must consider themselves <span class="page-break">\3</span>self-sufficing individuals by satisfying their absolute needs, not by means of waste, but by reasonable spending. We must not confuse thrift with misery and stinginess. It is not expected of us that we stop buying anything but food for our maintenance. Such a policy would injure our industry and decrease our consuming power. Industrial activity produces wages and creates profits, which are taxed by the government. If there was no profit in industry and consumption, who would buy Thrift Stamps?</p>
   <p>What the government and thrift demand of us is to restrict foolish spending, mainly because we have money in our pocketbooks for spending.</p>
   <p>We must not raise obstacles to impede the security and progress of our industries. We are not asked to deprive ourselves of reasonable pleasures, but to enjoy them in moderation. As a matter of principle, thrift is care, management, prudence, frugality, and calculation to a point where a saving of money is effected. This is reasonable thrift, the result of which will <span class="page-break">\4</span>be the purchasing of Economy Certificates, thanks to your patriotism. By this thrift, we are receiving a great lesson in economizing; at the same time, we are assuring ourselves of profitable returns. Let us lend our savings, accumulated by thrift, to the Government, obtaining the supreme satisfaction of assisting it at a critical period in the history of our country to win a just war, to save our sons at the front and on the seas by securing better and abundant food, warmer clothing, necessary supplies, better medical care, better and more abundant guns and munitions. Let us make ourselves happy in the knowledge that, in addition, we are supporting our men in our armies, heart and soul, and that we are spending our last cent for a great cause.</p>
   <p>Is not this great cause worth the saving of twenty-five cents? Our enemy has branded us a nation of prodigals and spendthrifts. Let us prove to them that we are not only the richest country in the world, but also the most thrifty. Extraordinary expenditures are allowed only for the purchase of instruments for their defeat. "Men win the battles, but money wins the wars."</p>

   <p>[Saloniki Editor's note: We hope that our Greek people in Chicago will heed this official appeal for self-sacrifice, thrift, and economy. In the recent past we have given practical evidence of our willingness and determination to assist in winning the war. Let us give added proof of our loyalty and self-sacrifice by saving and purchasing United States Government Thrift Stamps.]</p>
