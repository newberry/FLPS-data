   <p>The Greek Minister to Washington, Mr. George Roufos, received an appeal from the brave and heroic Greek veterans of our homeland's recent glorious wars.</p>
   <p>Our sincere admiration for these heroes and an entire nations undying gratitude to them impose upon us the duty to help them regain not only their physical strength and health, but also their moral and spiritual courage; and to assure them of our appreciation for the great services which they gave to their country.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of America, and of Chicago in particular, must give proof of their patriotic and philanthropic sentiments by contributing their material aid and support to this cause.</p>
   <p>The cause of the Greek War Veterans' Association is a noble one. It demands considerable sums of money. What Greek will refuse to contribute toward helping these heroic defenders of our liberty, who left parts of their bodies on <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the fields of battle, and who shed their blood on the sacred soil of Macedonia?</p>
   <p>The letter to the Greek Minister follows:</p>
   <p>"Your Excellency: With the wholehearted approval of our Premier, Mr. Eleutherios Venizelos, the Associatiation of the Greek War Veterans has been set up for the purpose of providing the technical means and the proper equipment to alleviate the suffering of our veterans.</p>
   <p>"The nation and the Government must hospitalize and relieve the suffering of those who have sacrificed their bodies and their health for our country. Considerations of humanity and respect demand that all the Greeks, everywhere, offer their moral and material assistance, if for no other reason than to encourage those who are now fighting in the various fronts of the war, and those who are about to be called for service. In this respect, the support of Greeks in America will be highly beneficial, and will have a great moral effect.</p>
   <p>"We are confident that the loyal Greeks of America will exceed the expectations <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the Association and the Prime Minister.</p>
   <p>"We request you to undertake the appointment of committees for a nation-wide campaign for funds.</p>
   <p>"We enclose printed appeals for your own use. We rely on your warm patriotism and devotion to the great causes and efforts of our common country, Greece, in the present war.</p>
   <p>"Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>"Helen Griva, President.</p>
   <p>"Alexander Paspatis, Secretary."</p>
