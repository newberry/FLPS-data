   <p>Dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>On behalf of the Greek Division of the Regular Democratic Party I want to extend my appreciation for the article which appeared in your paper on Saturday, March 10.</p>
   <p>The members of this organization realize that the time has come for the Greek people to take an active part in the selection of those who are to govern this community, state and nation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Heretofore our people did not give any attention to political matters and a few self-styled leaders held themselves out as "kings of the Greeks" and did a great deal of harm to the interests of our people.</p>
   <p>We are very sorry that the editorials of your paper will not be in favor of our candidate, but since there are two parties we do not expect to make all of the Greeks Democrats. However, I am going to ask you to give our organization as much publicity as you consistently can and I assure you that we will not abuse the privilege which you have so generously given us.</p>
   <p>Of course we feel that the news columns of any newspaper should be devoted to news, but unfortunately many editors do not permit their columns to be used by the opposition.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We are very glad to see that you were able to drive out the extortionists and the false leaders from the Republican Party and we want to assure you that the same thing will be accomplished in the Democratic Party. We are going to demonstrate that truth and honesty of purpose will conquer in the end and all mushroom organizations springing up just before each election will forever be put out of the political map in this community and we feel sure that with your help and with the help of the other Greek papers we will be able to accomplish that very easily.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>A. A. Pantelis,</p>
   <p>Chairman,</p>
   <p>Greek Division of the Regular Democratic Party.</p>
