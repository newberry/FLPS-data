   <p>The Greek community of Chicago, of which Paul Demos is president, last night entertained Judge Harry Olson and former Governor Deneen with a dinner at the Hotel Morrison.</p>
   <p>The society, which is composed of American citizens of Greek origin, has endorsed Judge Olson for mayor. Speeches were made by Messrs. Deneen, Olson, Sheriff Charles W. Peters, and J. Kent Green.</p>
   <p>Mr. Green delivered his address in Greek, thereby making a great hit with the descendants of Demosthenes.</p>
   <p>The officers of the community are Paul Demos, T. K. Valos, E.M. Chirigos, John Christacos, John K. Alex, John Mangel, and George Sellas.</p>
