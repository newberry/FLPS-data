   <p>Among the wholesale fruit merchants at South Water Market who have made systematic progress, we find Mr. John Panousis, the banana King as he is nick-named. His house is considered one of the very best. He practically controls the banana trade in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Before Mr. Panousis moved to his new place, 169 South Water Market he was located at the Randolph St. Market, where he had been engaged in the same line of business for five years.</p>
