   <p>The astonishing expansion of the chain of the Chicago Greek restaurants operated by Raklios and Company, the corporation of which John Raklios is president, Vasilios Kotsones is vice-president, and Andreas Chrones is secretary, is commendable. The three officers of the corporation are compatriots of ours who began their careers as laborers and by honesty, industry, and an enterprising business spirit ascended to a higher commercial level.</p>
   <p>John Raklios and his co-workers have acquired the confidence and the respect of American businessmen to such an extent that the Raklios Company's business has expanded until it competes successfully with the large American companies in its field.</p>
   <p>The sixteen large magnificent, and sanitary restaurants of Raklios and Company, located in the busiest centers of Chicago, are an indication of the success of Greek enterprise and of the commercial system, unity, and co-operation of Greeks.</p>

   <p>This corporation is progressing very rapidly. It is equipping its seventeenth restaurant, although less than three months ago it opened one of the best establishments of its kind at the corner of Madison and Dearborn Streets, for a restaurant of which the equipment cost $70,000.</p>
   <p>For its seventeenth restaurant Raklios and Company have succeded in obtaining a long-term lease for the price of $127,000.</p>
   <p>The new restaurant is located at the northwest corner of Jackson and Canal Streets, near the entrance of the newly-erected Union Station, a building of admirable architectural design.</p>
   <p>For the equipment of this new restaurant the Raklios Company will spend $50,000.</p>
   <p>But who is behind the scenes? Whose magic succeeds in discovering these money-making localities?</p>
   <p>It is none other than our prominent compatriot George Chiagouris.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Both Mr. Chiagouris and Mr. Raklios have been very successful in their respective fields and our community is proud of their achievements.</p>
