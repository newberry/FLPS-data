   <p>I have the honor to announce that after thirty years of practical and scientific experience in Greece and seven consecutive years in America, I have achieved perfection of quality in manufacturing all kinds of cheese and promise to satisfy the most capricious individual. We have always unsalted cheese for epicures and expectant mothers, edible with sugar. Its flavor is exquisite with fruits and in cheese-cake. We also keep fresh unsalted hot and cold Myzethra, white cheese, and Yiaourti in small pails rivaling that of Levadia. For poor families also we carry Yiaourti, similar to that of Parnasos, and Manolas in one-half pound and one-quarter pound cartons.</p>
   <p>We sell at wholesale and at retail. Our Yiaourti is nourishing, refreshing, light on the stomach, digestible, and the best nourishment for persons in ill health. 715 S. Halsted Street.</p>
