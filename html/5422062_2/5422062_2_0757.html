   <p>Registration for the Third Liberty Loan begins on April 6, the first anniversary of this nation's entrance into the war for freedom and justice. On this occasion, W.G. McAdoo, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, addressed the following circular letter to the various associations, clubs, and churches:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"In order that the present war in which we are engaged may come to a happy and victorious conclusion for the satisfaction of the honor and rights of America and the freedom of the world, your government is forced to ask for more funds. For this reason it has been already announced that the Third Liberty Loan issue is out.</p>

   <p>"Registration for this Liberty Loan will begin on April 6, 1918, that is, on the first anniversary of our entrance into the war on the side of the hard-pressed Allies.</p>
   <p>"Americans of foreign birth and descent, both individually as well as through their organizations, clubs, and churches, have responded to the two previous appeals for Liberty Loans in such a way that I was deeply pleased. I am confident that the Third Liberty Loan will receive your wholehearted and spontaneous support, regardless of sect, sex, age, or place of birth.</p>
   <p>"To insure the success of our purpose, the success of the drive for the Loan, organized and systematic efforts must be made. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that all organized bodies co-operate and assist in the forthcoming Liberty Loan campaign. I hope that the government will be offered this co-operation without reservation.</p>
   <p>(Signed)"William G. McAdoo</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Treasury."</p>
