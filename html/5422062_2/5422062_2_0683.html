   <p>Dear Publisher of the Saloniki: You are requested to publish the following in your esteemed paper in connection with the Liberty Loan drive. The Greek element of Chicago needed an opportunity to prove it was not asleep, and that it kept the flame of enthusiasm for, and loyalty to, its adopted country and to its fatherland burning brightly. Such an opportunity was afforded in the Third Liberty Loan drive.</p>
   <p>The Greek people of Chicago, because of their patriotism and exemplary attitude, were highly praised in the American press, which announced that the Greeks have not failed to retain and to receive inspiration from the principles and ideals of their glorious ancestors.</p>
   <p>The Greeks have given full support to the Greek Committee by registering enmasse for the Liberty Loan drive. They have inspired and encouraged the Committee to work with greater energy and thoroughness.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>They proved that the Greek does not miss an opportunity to give actual evidence of his co-operation and patriotism in any great national cause. This is one of his inborn traits.</p>
   <p>Therefore, just praise and honor are due the Greek people. The Greek Loan Committee takes this opportunity publicly to thank all those registered for the Loan, especially those who registered through the Greek Committee, which succeeded in collecting $1,675,000.</p>
   <p>The Committee desired to publish the entire honor roll, made up of the names of one thousand registrants, but since newspaper space is so valuable, it must content itself with expressing hearty thanks and congratulations. The Committee anounces that it is proud of the patriotic and brilliant task accomplished with the support of its loyal fellow-countrymen.</p>
   <p>Because the Committee believes that those who contributed according to their ability, even though the amount was only fifty dollars, were no less patriotic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>than those who contributed five thousand dollars, the Committee has decided not to publish the names of the heaviest contributors. It would be an injustice, however, if the Committee did not include on the honor roll the names of those who worked with self-sacrifice, enthusiasm, and energy to make the Greek participation in the drive a success. Therefore, it lists those individuals who raised the Greek name so high and who brought us such great honor.</p>
   <p>Enthusiastic and unselfish workers and patriots such as John Raklios, who sacrificed a month's time in spite of the great responsibility his extensive restaurant enterprises demand in order to work for the Loan drive, should be mentioned. In spite of his church duties during the Easter holidays, the Reverend Constantine Hatzidimitriou worked superhumanly to present a respectable number of registrations.</p>
   <p>Other indefatigable workers were: Andrew Chronopoulos, florist; John Stefanou; James Mangas, who registered all those who came from his homeland province and among whom he is highly respected; C. Papas, president of the Pericles Society of Pullman, who worked so methodically and energetically. Among our enthusiastic <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and progressive young men we should mention: James Tasiopoulos, director of the Foreign Accounts Division of the Illinois State Bank; A. Porikos, representative of the Life Insurance Company, who worked day and night for the Loan drive; George Katsonis, grocery salesman, one of those who obtained the greatest number of registrations; P. Chiotes, cigar salesman, who allowed no customer of his to escape; Mr. Askounis; Messrs. Valos, Chronis, Spiridakis, Petrakos, Stamos, Koliopoulos, all restauranteurs, who do honor to the Greek name at every given opportunity.</p>
   <p>Messr. Damaskos, Dimitrakopoulos, Gianacopoulos, Aruamites, and George Bitcharas, who has two brothers serving in the American Army; Haralambopoulos, president of the Shine Parlor Owners' Association; Karahalios, president of the Tanios Society; C. Katsiaris, Johnson, Stameson, Karabelas, Moutzouros, confectioners; and Nicholas Matalos, all worked tirelessly for the great cause. Mr. George Bambakaris, prominent salesman in the Rothschild Company, signed the head of the company for $5,000.</p>
   <p>Finally, we mention a true Spartan woman, Miss Mary Kitsos, who worked so well that <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>we are now convinced that when occasion arises even our women can actively prove their patriotic sentiments.</p>
   <p>With such collaborators we anticipated the achievements which raised the Greek name to its proper station.</p>
   <p>Mr. Felix J. Streycknious, a Belgian by descent, who is director of the Foreign Language Division of the Liberty Loan Campaign Committee, contributed greatly towards the success of the Greek Loan Committee by his admirable and systematic work and assistance. His secretary, Mr. Nels M. Hokanson, also gave us valuable assistance. To them we express our sincere thanks.</p>
   <p>Special mention of the noble and valuable services of Chicago's Greek press should be made here, becuase it never failed constantly to urge the Greek people to register with the Loan Committee by inspiring all with patriotism, unselfish co-operation, and true loyalty. We can now boast that, with no exception, all of us have more than performed our duty and obligation both to our fatherland and to our adopted country.</p>
