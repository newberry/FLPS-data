   <p>A new kafenion [cafe] has been opened in the heart of the Greek business district at 621 South Halsted Street. This cafe has been named "Eleftheria" [Liberty]. It is owned by N. Zoumis and N. Poulos.....Both men are old-timers on Halsted Street, and we are sure their new enterprise will be very successful.</p>
