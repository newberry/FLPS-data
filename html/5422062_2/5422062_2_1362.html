   <p>At last what we have trumpeted for many years in the ears of our professional men may soon materialize.</p>
   <p>Twenty-five Greek physicians held a meeting last week in the Sherman Hotel and discussed the possibility of forming a Greek professional men's club with the object of serving the interests of the Greek community in Chicago. The doctors also discussed the establishment of a Greek hospital and of a dental clinic.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that this step taken by the doctors will soon be realized in actual accomplishment.</p>
   <p>The Greek community here is so large that it is able to support a hospital, a dental clinic, and many other things which are necessary to our increasing colony.</p>
