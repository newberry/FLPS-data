   <p>A telegram to the American press informs us that President E. Venizelos, of the National Government of Greece, has sent some words of advice to the Greeks in America. He urges that as American citizens they should support the efforts of President Wilson and should throw themselves wholeheartedly into the defense of the star-laden American flag. The flag which symbolizes the nation's ideals of freedom and justice, and which protects the sacred and undeniable rights of men.</p>
   <p>This message, which has crossed an ocean and a continent to come to us, contains nothing that we have not heard before. It has been said many times by those who have felt the sacredness and true devotion to country which is present in the word "Patris" (Fatherland); meaning the land which through its just laws and democratic standards has become a place of refuge for all those who have become worthy of being called good citizens. Their appreciation of this privilege has obligated them and has made them endeavor to repay this obligation by supporting and defending--even as far as to give their lives--that adopted fatherland.</p>
   <p>A man who has pride in being a citizen and feels a duty towards the fatherland, is the ideal for all of us to follow.</p>
   <p>It is a duty to be patriotic and the telegram of Venizelos was based on this fact. Venizelos is a man who believes that every individual has certain duties towards himself and his country, and that these duties must be performed willingly by these individuals.</p>
   
   <p>This is an insight into the character of Venizelos whose horizon is bound only by a realization of his duty to himself and to his country. Unlike most of us, he places his country above all else.</p>
   <p>Let this sense of duty become strong in all of us, and happy are they that possess it.</p>
