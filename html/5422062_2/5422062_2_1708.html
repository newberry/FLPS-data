   <p>p. 2.--Last Monday was the opening day of a new and magnificent candy-store by the rapidly progressing Greek concern of De Met's. This new candy-store is the sixth established by this company and is located at 330 South Michigan avenue. It is the most luxurious and magnificent of all the stores and is remarkable for the excellence of its artistic decoration.</p>
   <p>The Greek company operates all its stores, which are located in the Loop, in a very efficient way and this accounts for their success.</p>
   <p>We extend to De Met's our congratulations and best wishes.</p>
