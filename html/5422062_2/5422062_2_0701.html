If it is philanthropy, education, generosity, enlightenment, church patriotism, or any other good thing, Louis Choromokos is on the front line in full panoply to bring results. That is Louis. Everybody knows and esteems the old boy. Why? Because he is real and true. What he does (he does) methodically, sincerely, and well. Here is what the Liberty Loan Shrapnel, a government publication for Cook County, says of Mr. Choromokos:</p>
   <p>We have heard of all kinds of psychological method applied to Liberty Loan sales, but Mr. L. Choromokos, who sells Liberty bonds by mail, has something new and unique. His letters, signed"I Sell Liberty Bonds," with his picture printed on one of the four corners of the letterhead have brought incredible results. Thousands of such letters were mailed, and the psychological response was tremendous.</p>
   
   <p>Loxias note: Those who for one reason or another resent Mr. Choromokos's popularity must take a lesson or two of his ingenuity. He is a wonder; he brings home the bacon. He is not a piker; he outwits everybody. He is a credit to us all. Bravo, Louis, old boy! The country needs more of your type.</p>
