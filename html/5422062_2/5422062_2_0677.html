   <p>p. 1. -- Greece's declaration of war against the Central Powers will be magnificently celebrated on June 27th at 7 P. M. at the Blackstone Theatre, 60 East Seventh Street.</p>
   <p>All the Greeks of Chicago and the suburbs are requested to participate in this celebration. A special request is made to the veterans of the two Balkan wars and the various Greek organizations and societies, to be present in group with their respective flags and banners in order to lead the grand march. The place of gathering before the grand march begins is Hull House.</p>
   <p>The specific object of the celebration and demonstration is to make the fact known that Greece is fighting against the Central Powers. Many, through lack of knowledge, believe that Greece is in a state of armed neutrality, while in reality Greece is in an actual state of war against Germany and its allies.</p>
   
   <p>In this celebration, at which Samuel Insull will preside, many orators will deliver patriotic addresses. Noted among them are Clarence S. Darrow, Bernard W. Snow, Felix J. Streyckmans, and the Greek Consul General of Chicago.</p>
