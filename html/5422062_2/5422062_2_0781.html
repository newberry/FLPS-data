   <p>The purchase of savings stamps is the best and surest means of investing money. By doing this you accomplish two things: first, you are supporting the United States Government in the quick and successful prosecution of the struggle for freedom and democracy; secondly, you acquire the habit of saving some money which you would have spent aimlessly, and which will be of use to you in the future.</p>
   <p>You can begin with twenty-five cents. Do not neglect this, start today. Savings stamps are sold by K. Salopoulos, who has been authorized to do so by the Treasury Department.</p>
