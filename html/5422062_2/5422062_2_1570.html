   <p>During my sojourn in Chicago, I have visited practically all the Greek merchants of this city, and the knowledge gained from various interviews is given in this article.</p>
   <p>Greek merchants should have risen to a higher scale than they are now. Greeks are extremely industrious and very honest, nevertheless there are few Greek merchants who realize that in union there is strength. With few exceptions business is in the hnds of individual merchants who have steadily refused to be united with big corporations and big companies.</p>
   <p>During the early years of the establishment of the Greek community in Chicago, the individual Greek merchant predominated in the fruit business, confectioneries, restaurants, groceries, flowers, shoe-repairing, and importing. The Greek merchant due to his industry and progressiveness was able to compete with individuals of other nationalities and reach the top in his particular line. He continued to prosper and continued in the lead until the combined capital of other nationalities, resulting in big corporations and chain-stores, caused him to lose footing. Through his shrewdness and sagacity he recognized the danger, yet has stubbornly refused to utilize his ability to unite with other Greek merchants on a big scale to frustrate the approaching danger of being put out of business by the big moguls. While formerly no other nationality could compete with the Greek in his line of business, the chain-stores with tremendous resources behind them have made the individual Greek merchant a mere straw in the wind.</p>
   <p>He is not entirely destroyed, but he is barely in business. His individual ego does not permit him to function through large corporations. A few years ago four-fifths of the restaurants in Chicago were in the hands of Greeks, a similar proportion of confectionaries, three-fourths of the fruit business and practically all of the flower business. The Greek was then a dominant figure, but not so today. There are a few exceptions.</p>
   
   <p>Notably among these exceptions are the chain-stores of Raklios and Co., restaurateurs; De Mets Candy Stores, Andies Candy Stores, and out of the six big fruit commission houses in the city, one is in the hands of Greeks, that of Christ Nicolson and Co. This is directed of the two Nicolson brothers and James Karas. The Nicolson Co. laid out plans for two more commission houses, which according to authentic information, should be the biggest in the market.</p>
   <p>In spite of the fall of the market that prevails now, there is enough Greek capital, intelligence, and capacity for organization to avert the danger of being "devoured" by the big fellows. If the Greeks in Chicago and the rest of the country will emulate the American method of uniting, they will soon shine again on the horizon of predominating business. Let us hope their egotism will be brushed aside and that some American methods will be adopted by which big business will come into the hands of Greeks,and will come to stay.</p>
