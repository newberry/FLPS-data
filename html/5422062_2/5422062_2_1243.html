   <p>The Greek Press takes great pleasure in announcing the good fortune of a Greek girl of Chicago. Miss C. Gavaris, who is a graduate of the University of Chicago, having majored in the classical languages, recently won a scholarship which enabled her to go to Athens and continue her studies.</p>
   <p>During her stay in Greece the American College offered her a professorship. She returned to America after visiting Italy, Germany, and France.</p>
   <p>Upon her return to Chicago, the University of Chicago also offered her a professorship. Miss Gavaris finally decided to spend the rest of her life under the blue skies of Greece. And so she accepted the position in the American College in Athens.</p>
   <p>Miss Gavaris will shortly leave America and go to Greece. With her go our hopes for her success and fame. She has made the Greek community of Chicago very proud and happy.</p>
