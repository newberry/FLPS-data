   <p>On the corner of Halsted and Taylor Streets stands the Atlas National Bank. We would like to make known the many conveniences this bank provides for the Greek people of Chicago. This bank, aside from the fact that it has much Greek stock, has as representative, Peter Malakaten, who has had much experience with Greek, American and Italian banks.</p>
   <p>Consult Mr. Malakaten upon any financial problem and take advantage of the conveniences this 15 year old bank offers.</p>
