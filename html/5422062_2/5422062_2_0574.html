   <p>My dear Mr. Lambros:</p>
   <p>I have no words to express, as a friend and Chairman of our Club, my thanks to you for all your great services and help which you have rendered in the last Presidential Campaign by your Newspaper and personal influence. I feel proud in having colleagues in national and patriotic campaigns such persons as you.</p>
   <p>The last glorious victory of our Party proved that we successfully interpreted the opinion and the confidence of our Country by advising, as Officers of the "Coolidge-Dawes Greek-American Republican Club," our fellow-countrymen to vote and work for the Republican candidates.</p>
   <p>It will be a great thing to continue being united politically for the good of our Country and the interest and progress of our own countrymen.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>I again congratulate you for our victory and thanking you for all your precious efforts, I remain,</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>C. A. Palaeologos Mammon,</p>
   <p>Chairman of the Coolidge-Dawes Greek-American Republican Club.</p>
