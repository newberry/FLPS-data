   <p>Though I met with so many hardships at the beginning of my career in this country twenty-five years ago, and notwithstanding the fact that I have been penniless and friendless among strangers in a strange land, I have had faith in the land of promise and opportunities, and my dream has come true. I have nothing but praise for Columbia. I feel grateful to Uncle Sam, and in fact I cannot do enough to serve this great country of ours as a loyal American citizen.</p>
   <p>The foreign-born American can demonstrate his loyalty not only by becoming a citizen but also by performing the duties of a real American citizen who respects the Constitution, obeys the laws, stands by our government, is devoted to his adopted country, and adores the glorious American flag, the symbol of the principles of Washington and Lincoln, those principles which have been carried as far as the new battlefield of honor in France and Belgium in order to preserve the principles of American democracy.</p>

   <p>An American born in this country has a duty to perform as a matter of duty, but an American of foreign birth and extraction has a duty to perform as a matter of gratitude to his adopted country for his welcome here and for the privileges, the opportunities, and the equality accorded to him in the land where millions of men, women, and children have found home, work and protection.</p>
   <p>It is true that the war is over, and the American army is demobilized, but Americanism and patriotism will never be demobilized. Now in the midst of unrest we are called upon to display our inflexible determination to carry on and to stand by Old Glory against anarchy, that we may continue to dwell in peace and happiness, bearing in mind that no infamy whatsoever will be permitted to undermine the foundation of the Republic, and that no "Reds" will be permitted to interfere with the principles of American democracy.</p>
