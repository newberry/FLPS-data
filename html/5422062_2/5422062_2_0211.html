   <p>p. 8.- Most of the people in reading this newspaper are wondering, no doubt, why I am devoting this and the former issue of "Proodos", (Progress) to the cause of the Democratic Party.</p>
   <p>For the last eighteen years, since this paper has been in existence, I have, to a certain extent, devoted my time more or less to the Democratic Party during the national and local campaigns.</p>
   <p>In this particular campaign, I am devoting all space available to the Democratic Party with the greatest of pleasure in cognizance of the work done by the present administration for the reconstruction of this country and the general welfare of the masses of the people and particularly to our people of Grecian descent.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>I also take the opportunity to express my sincere cooperation and confidence in the cause of the Democratic Voters League of Cook County, that so ably uplifted the political situation of our race in this great city.</p>
   <p>This real Greek political organization, which so sincerely and unselfishly serves the Greek voters of Cook County, is under the leadership and guidance of Commissioner Michael S. Krokidas, its President and his Secretary, William Bouramas.</p>
