   <p>From the sacred bones</p>
   <p>Of gallant Grecians come;</p>
   <p>And as of old all-conquering,</p>
   <p>Hail, liberty, hail!</p>
   <p>This is the sacred symbol which our fathers bequeathed to us with religious piety and reverence. In the name of this symbol they conjured us to guard and keep freedom as our most precious possession.</p>
   <p>Under the banner of Christian faith, under the protection of our holy church, and under the folds of our blue and white flag, which symbolizes our free skies, our fathers gathered, took counsel, and decided to throw off the chains of slavery. Drawing their scimitars, they went forth like fearless lions against the barbarian Turk, singing with their wives and children: "Better an hour of freedom than forty years of prison and slavery." As pious beneficiaries and guardians of this sacred will and bequest, we are under obligation to preserve and protect it at whatever cost against any unholy hand that would, even for one moment, violate the sanctity of the sacred temple of our liberty, which our honored and glorious ancestors bequeathed to us with many superhuman sacrifices.</p>
   <p>Yes, it is this same freedom, our invaluable possession and adored goddess, which the conqueror's and tyrant's greed, like a violent and relentless torrent, threatens to destroy. These barbarous peoples, driven by a savage spirit of destruction and conquest, have united for the purpose of destroying the world and putting the peoples of the earth under their yoke.</p>
   
   <p>Greece, America, and the Allied nations are now waging a titanic and fearful war against the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary), whose victory means our enslavement and destruction</p>
   <p>We are under obligation to defend our freedom and that alone, for that is the power that allows us to think, act, and choose freely. If we are to preserve these privileges and natural rights we need our freedom, and to win this, the greatest of blessings, we must fight. This fight, however, imposes upon us many heavy sacrifices, especially material ones.</p>
   <p>Our greatest need is money, without which we can do nothing. It is through our liberty that we create and preserve our wealth, while without liberty, with the yoke of subjection and bondage weighing heavily on our necks, our wealth and possessions belong to our "lord and master." Here is where the advantage lies in offering not only our moral support and patriotic fervor, but also our material assistance to our government, by subscribing to the Liberty Loan--liberty and the National Loan are one and the same; they are inextricably interwoven. Whoever wants liberty must also want the Loan.</p>
   <p>Therefore, onward Greek-Americans, patriotic and brave sons of freedom! Let us all purchase Liberty Loan bonds, which will be issued soon.</p>
   <p>In the measure of our ability, let us endeavor to contribute toward the success and triumph of this war of liberation, through which the destiny of subject and oppressed peoples will be determined, as well as the victory of justice and liberty through democracy. After we have performed our duty let us shout: Hail, liberty, hail!</p>
