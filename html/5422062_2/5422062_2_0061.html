   <p>Congratulations to the revolutionists of Greece for "throwing off the yoke of despotism" were cabled today by the Hellenic Liberal Democratic League of Chicago following a meeting of 300 members in its hall at 515 S. Halsted St., last night. The cable was sent to the "Chief of the Revolutionary Government," at Athens.</p>
   <p>The league represents 30,000 people of Greek descent in Chicago," said Paul Demos, the President, with offices at 127 S. Dearborn St. "They are overwhelmingly in favor of a republican form of government for their native land. We believe Venizelos will return to take charge of the government. It is the only solution."</p>
