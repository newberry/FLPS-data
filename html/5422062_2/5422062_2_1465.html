   <p>The Greek Restaurant Men's Club of Chicago is to be commended for its active campaign to enroll new members. Every Greek restaurateur ought to belong to this organization. It can be of great benefit to its members in their economic and social existence. This union can protect their individual interests, and it will prove a good weapon against the depression and its ill effects.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press is very much in favor of the Club and will support it wholeheartedly.</p>
