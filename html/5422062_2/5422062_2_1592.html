   <p>Last week we had the pleasure of visiting the factory of a Greek concern whose work was a little different from the usual restaurants and other Greek establishments.</p>
   <p>In several Greek stores we had noticed fans shaped like airplanes and had remarked upon such a clever invention. We were told that a Greek had designed this plane and we were glad to hear that a Greek could have a share in such a large American concern.</p>
   <p>When we were assured that the company originally was, and still is, Greek, our joy was unbounded. The leader of this establishment is none other than the well-known owner of the Rich Laundry Co., N. Kanellis, who employs Louis Nigoe (Hlian Nikan) as manager of the Chicago Aero Fan Co.</p>
   <p>The entire personnel of machinists, office-workers, salesmen, etc., is Greek. This fan is the last word--it is entirely noiseless and takes the place of four ordinary fans. The factory works ceaselessly in order to satisfy the demand for these superior fans. Mr. Kanellis, Mr. Nikas, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>every Greek person employed at the factory deserve great praise for this thriving and unusual business.</p>
