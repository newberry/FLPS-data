   <p>A few days ago we visited the famous Trianon Ballroom, owned by Andrew Karzas. The visit was prompted by a desire to see the effect of the recently completed interior decoration. Despite the fact that many visits to the Trianon have impressed me to the beauty of the foyer and the curving staircase, nevertheless, I could not help but recall the first time I visited this world-famous ballroom. That was in 1922. I could not believe my eyes, for never had I or any-one else seen anything to compare with it. As time passed we began to take it for granted because it always looked the same. Many changes were made.</p>
   <p>However, when I saw it this last time, it was as if it were a new creation made by a magic wand. Everything is new--from the ceilings to the floors. Tapestries, paintings, and draperies, chair and divan covers, color combinations and effects--all have been changed. The effect is marvelous. The ballroom floor is the finest in the world. It is made of slender pieces of wood, and the entire floor is suspended upon springs. Naturally, this floor makes dancing less fatiguing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>because it "gives" imperceptibly. Modernistic furnishings also enliven the second floor halls.....</p>
   <p>All this is due to the progressiveness of its owner, Mr. Karzas, who has done much to raise the Greeks in the respect of the American people.</p>
