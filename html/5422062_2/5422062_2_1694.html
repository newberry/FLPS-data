   <p>The La Salle Hotel, last Sunday, was overcrowded with Greek restaurant keepers. The banquet and dance, given by the aforesaid Association, was attended by 1,700 members of the Association, besides their families and and friends.</p>
   <p>The success of the banquet was attributed to the retiring president, Mr. Askounis, who for weeks ahead was preparing for such a multitude.</p>
   <p>Mr. Askounis, after a brief and fiery speech, introduced the new president and master of ceremonies, Mr. K. Soteracopoulos, who as a promising and enterprising young man outlined the aim of the Greek Restaurant Association. Dancing and merriment followed until the late hours of the night.</p>
