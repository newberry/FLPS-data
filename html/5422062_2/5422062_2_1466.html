   <p>The Greeks of Chicago will be happy to learn that the Majestic Theater, on Monroe Street, has been taken over by....the well-known businessmen, Mr. T. Vallos and Mr. [E. A.] Gregory. After having been closed for a time for refurnishing and redecoration, the theater was reopened to the public last Saturday afternoon.</p>
   <p>Our pride is justified because it is no small accomplishment to acquire one of the largest theaters in the Loop. The two owners have been in the theater business a long time and have been very successful.</p>
   <p>The Majestic will feature first-run pictures and the best vaudeville shows.</p>
