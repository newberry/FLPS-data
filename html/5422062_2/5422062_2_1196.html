   <p>p. 6-Dr. Benjamin Goldberg, secretary of the directing council of the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, has said that the Greeks, especially those suffering from tuberculosis, are very fortunate because they have had as "health ambassador in America and in Chicago a very energetic and enthusiastic leader in the person of Mrs.Papadopoulou,"--our own "Mother of Greek soldiers."</p>
   <p>"The great interest and intelligence shown by 'Mother'," continued the distinguished physician, "in all matters pertaining to tuberculosis both here in America and in Greece have made a great impression on me. The zeal with which Mrs. Papadopoulou carries out her undertaking of collecting funds for tubercular invalids will not only benefit her own country but will also greatly assist us in coping with tuberculosis right here in Chicago; for education on the subject of tuberculosis is the chief means to success in combating it, and 'Mother' with her dissemination of facts relative to this malady has helped us very much in the war which we are waging against this disease in this city.</p>

   <p>"Just as the Greeks in Greece have their tubercular problems to solve, so have the Greeks in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"In the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium at this very moment we have twelve Greek patients suffering with tuberculosis, and I do not doubt that there are many more Greeks in Chicago afflicted with this disease who are not getting medical attention.</p>
   <p>"In the last four months seven Greeks have died of tuberculosis in this city.</p>
   <p>"I have been informed that among Greeks a groundless but nevertheless genuine fear of this disease prevails; that is, they are afflicted with tuberculophobia. Greeks consider the disease a disgrace, a mark of shame. Consequently, when they contract it, they neglect to see a doctor immediately or to apply to one of the various city dispensaries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"They must realize that tuberculosis can be cured, and that it is a disease from which all persons can be protected. They ought to know that the seven Greeks who have died within the last few months might have been cured if they had been treated when their illness was in its initial stages.</p>
   <p>"When a person observes that he does not weigh as much as he formerly weighed, that he coughs constantly, that he feels very tired in the afternoon, that he sweats profusely at night in his sleep, and that he spits blood occasionally, he should go to the doctor immediately to see whether these are symptoms of tuberculosis. The family physician is a good advisor and friend of the sick. He should be consulted without fail. A visit to any doctor's office will do much to safeguard the patient from the loss of months and even years of gainful occupation, not to mention the attendant pain, which the illness causes when it is allowed to continue into its more advanced stages.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"If the afflicted lacks funds to pay for the services of a physician, he may go to any of the dispensaries in the city for examination. Such dispensaries are located at the following addresses:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>1367 Sedgwick street,</td>
     <td>2049 Washington boulevard,</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>1535 North Robey street,</td>
     <td>1215 South Racine avenue,</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>2950 Calumet avenue,</td>
     <td>1000-1002 East Seventy-fifth street,</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>5625 South State street</td>
     <td>734 West Forty-seventh street.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>"The doctors in the places just mentioned are specialists in tuberculosis. Their many years' of experience in combating this malady is always at the public's disposal.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Their salaries and the cost of the medicine which they dispense are taken out of the taxes collected by the city. Thus the patient gets their excellent medical attention without charge.</p>
   <p>"Now I should like to take this opportunity," continued the eminent physician, "to thank Mrs. Papadopoulou, 'Mother of Greek soldiers; for the excellent work which she is doing in combating this illness not only for the Greeks of Greece but for sufferers all over the world. As I have said before, the education which 'Mother' has begun to disseminate is the finest means for safeguarding the public health. Ignorance of tuberculosis among the people has always been our greatest obstacle; ignorance of its symptoms, of its highly infectious nature, and of the fact that it may be cured has made tuberculosis a greater scourge than it need be. I thank Mrs. Papadopoulou for her great interest in the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, and I wish for her sanitarium in Greece the greatest success."</p>
