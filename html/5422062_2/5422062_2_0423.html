   <p>The Democrat takes this opportunity to endorse all of the candidates submitted to the people of the City of Chicago and County of Cook by the regular Democratic organization. All of the candidates submitted by the regular Democratic organization have the necessary qualifications to make them eminently fitted for the offices to which they have been nominated by distinguished leaders of the Democratic party. If elected, they will make useful public servants of which we may all feel justly proud. The Democrat and its editorial organization recommends to all of its friends that they vote for the Democratic candidates submitted by the regular Democratic organization at the Primaries to be held April 8, 1930.</p>
