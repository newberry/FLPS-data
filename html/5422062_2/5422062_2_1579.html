   <p>The organization of Greek restaurateurs, known as the American Restaurant Association is giving a dance on the 2nd of November, at the Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>These dances given by the restaurateurs always attract big crowds. We do not expect to be disappointed this time.</p>
