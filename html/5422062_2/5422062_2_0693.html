   <p>Even though the results of the Third Liberty Loan did not measure up to the expectations of the Greek people, especially when compared to the proceeds of the Second Liberty Loan which exceeded the two-million-dollar mark in Chicago alone, nevertheless the totals, compared with those of other nationalities, were sufficiently satisfactory and reflect honor and prestige on our nationality.</p>
   <p>By our enthusiasm and promptness in purchasing the newly issued bonds, we oversubscribed our share of the loan in Chicago, surpassing every other nationality. The Greeks of Chicago contributed $167 per capita, thus ranking the highest in average individual contributions in proportion to the numbers of other foreign-language minorities of Chicago. The second highest contribution was $128 per capita. The Italian subscription averaged $28 dollars; the Germans came next with $11 per capita. It is thus conclusively proven and reaffirmed that the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Greek people have a superior and higher conception of patriotism, that material things are considered of far lesser significance than sentiment and moral duty. They have maintained that material wealth is merely the servant for necessary duties. The Greeks have been endowed by nature with so many great virtues and superior qualities that through full development of them they will be enabled to occupy an enviable position, socially, economically, and politically, among the foremost nationalities of this great city. It is generally admitted that we, as a great nation in culture and intellectual attainment, should have long been in the vanguard of the earth's civilized nations, for Greece has weaned Christianity, she has given forth the blessings of civilization, and has profoundly influenced the cultural, intellectual, political, and economic life of all the great European nations. Our rich and inexhaustible historic and intellectual background is the foundation of modern languages, science, and art.</p>
   <p>It is commonly admitted that in spite of our great historic heritage, we are sadly lacking in personal traits of intellectual distinction, education, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>refinement. The obvious reason for this is that we have never appreciated the innate capacities and potentialities with which we are endowed. On the contrary, we have never sought to devote ourselves to the cultivation of our minds and souls. By doing so, we could doubtless become marvelous citizens and admirable members of a great society of men. Our incurable egoism and selfishness is responsible for our failure to develop our inborn powers. We think that we know it all, that no one is better than we are, and that what ever we know or think is perfect, while whatever the others think or say is worthless.</p>
   <p>It is about time we study and appreciate the fine qualities and exceptional virtues of other nationalities as well as the obligations which we are assuming because of our present-day needs. Prudence dictates that we should select whatever is useful and advantageous to us for self-development and self-improvement. Therefore, we should not adopt or recognize any method or system superficially without ascertaining in advance whether it is conducive to good, for too often the opposite is the case, and instead of good <span class="page-break">\4</span>we receive evil. The thing that most contributes to our insufficiency and backwardness is the fact that our people have never tried hard enough to distinguish what are those good and useful elements which can enhance our progress and happiness, nor can they distinguish what those evil and injurious elements are which impede our progress and frustrate our efforts to attain happiness.</p>
   <p>We notice that, on the one hand, as individuals, we progress and succeed regardless of the trade or profession we choose, but, on the other hand, collectively, we are hopelessly backward and deficient. Why? Because there is no coherent force among the members of our community; there is no uniformity, but complete social laxity and disorganization. Because the good and select ideas are not prevalent for they alone are able to organize, to produce an acceptable system.</p>
   <p>Without some sort of a system nothing in the world can be successfully attained.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>So, we are in need of systematic work; we must produce and support able and virtuous men who will be our leaders. Only thus will we be assured of progress in the social, economic, political, and national sphere.</p>
   <p>But nothing can be accomplished at present, because brainless, incompetents, without any real ability or virtue, who are merely beautifully painted, hollow tin-cans, have the audacity to pose as self-appointed leaders amongst us. Although we know what they really are, we tolerate them. They are well known to both ourselves and to our American friends. Are we sure that they will not harm us in the future? They are false leaders, fakes, frauds.</p>
   <p>Only the truth and it, alone, can and must prevail.</p>
