   <p>With great pride we announce to the Greek people of Chicago the new and astonishing success of John Raklios and Co., which is headed by our popular countryman, John Raklios.</p>
   <p>The negotiating and securing of three long leases for the company was transacted by George Chiagouris, a specialist when it comes to long leases, who, for twenty years, has acted as middleman with much success.</p>
   <p>The Greek Press takes great joy in printing this new Greek victory. We also extend our personal congratulations to John Raklios and George Chiagouris for their success in this new progressive Greek action.</p>
