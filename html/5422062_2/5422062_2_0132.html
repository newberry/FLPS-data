   <p>p. 1- In our last issue we dealt with the action of the Greek division of the Democratic party, which has its offices in the headquarters of the Democratic party in the Ashland Block, 134 North Clark Street, and is working feverishly for the election of the Democratic candidate, A. J. Cermak. This Greek division of which Mr. N. Salopoulos is president, and Mr. A. Pantelis, lawyer, is secretary-general, has issued a circular to Greek voters from which we quote the following:-</p>
   <p>"Greek voters, Democrats and Republicans! Take your broom in hand and clean up your City Hall, now gripped in the tentacles of exploitation and greed. In the coming election there is only one issue, and that is the dethronement of exploitation and greed.</p>
   <p>"If you desire your own good, if you seek your own happiness, if you are awaiting the return of prosperity, if you want the 1933 Fair to become a real World's Fair and to ballyhoe it properly, vote Democratic, elect the Hon. Mr. Cermak and the rest of the Democratic candidates.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Greeks - if you are descendants of the ancient Greeks and of Pericles, the original author of the democratic form of government, you must go to the polls on April 7, raise your voices, and clean up the City Hall of Chicago."</p>
   <p>We endorse this appeal to Greek voters and believe that the election of April 7 will justify the expectations of the Greek division of the Democratic party.</p>
