   <p>p. 1. The Greek royalists of Chicago and the remainder of the country are asked to heed the results of the elections in Greece. It is about time to become sane and eliminate the absurd and foolish idea of restoring royalty to govern Greece. This preposterous conception, that we must restore royalty to rule the free people of Greece, has divided the Greeks of America in two irreconcilable classes, the royalists, (who are in the minority) and the republicans. Such a division should not have taken place here in America. As America citizens we should not entertain dynastic thoughts, and those who are not American citizens, as yet, should be ashamed of abusing the friendliness, patience, and freedom of this country extended to them. It is about time to shake our-selves free from such an illusion and misception. America does not stand for royalty. Why do the Greeks, (at least some of us), continue to go contrary to the fundamental principles of our adopted country?</p>
   <p>The elections in Greece were held, yesterday, and the result is a final blow to the hopes, aspirations, and ambitions, of the element which has so earnestly desired royalty to govern. Evidently, Greece still maintains a few <span class="page-break">2</span>voters who cling to the useless obsession of wanting Kings to run the country. But happily the intelligence of Greece has spoken decisively, indeed, by more than a two to one majority, and it is now desired that this should be the last endeavor to foist the silly idea of a worthless system of government upon the backs of a free people. Surely this misguided and mistaken crowd will now bow gracefully, to the undoubted will of the great majority, and forever stop this ridiculous nonsense and accept cheerfully, in good faith, the only sane, safe, and permanent method, which is; to bring the great Greek race back to the position it looks on as its right and has enjoyed.</p>
   <p>The great war, just ended by the results of the elections, has shown to the statesmen and people of Greece that the parasites, termed royalty, are unfit to rule Greece. It is time for the small, annoying and troublesome minority, to bow before the inevitable, and become useful and patriotic supporters of the republican system of government, the wiser Greeks have adopted.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America living under a republican form of government should fondly hope that this sane republican system will teach every one (including the royalists), that freedom can only be acquired and held by the whole people, <span class="page-break">3</span>and not by a king, queen, prince, or pontentate. This should be decided only by the actual voice of all the people, in their own sovereign capacity, expressed in elections periodically, where the will of the majority prevails.</p>
   <p>The people of the land showed intelligence and did their duty in banishing royalty, and now it is up to these distinguished patriotic statesmen of Greece to do their duty, if they wish to be honored by the people, and continue to be in power.</p>
