   <p>One of the first Greek tailors in our city is Mr. Nicholas Mouzakiotis. Always ready to serve in the best manner, he has recently installed a new modern system to better serve his customers. They do not need to bring their clothes to him for cleaning, remodeling, etc., because he has put in a delivery service. All a customer needs to do is call up Mr. Mouzakiotis and he will immediately send someone to pick up the articles. Mr. Mouzakiotis is an experienced tailor, cleaner, and dyer and very well qualified for the work. Those living on the North and West Sides should call VanBuren 2248, while those on the South Hyde Park 9278 and they will be taken care of immediately.</p>
