   <p>The Greek-American importing firm, Deligiannis Brothers and Company, have begun a campaign to enlarge their territory for the sale of Greek imported products. They have been appointed the exclusive distributors of Metaxa Cognac throughout the middle west.</p>
   <p>The newest idea is to send a representative to the southern states which have a large but half-forgotten Greek population. A. Deligiannis, second son of a member of the firm, has been chosen, since he recently graduated from a school of commerce. Assisting him is one of the personnel, an experienced salesman who knows the territory. The trip is being made in a new automobile which has special facilities for the display of merchandise.</p>
