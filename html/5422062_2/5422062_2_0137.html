   <p>The Greek Voters of our community have been considerably active lately. Many mass meetings have been arranged in which the Greek organizations of both parties gave voice to their political viewpoints.</p>
   <p>If we judge from these gatherings, the political opinion of the Greek voters is decidedly, by a majority, democratic, and especially in regards to the candidate for Senator of the Democratic Party, Mr. James Hamilton Lewis.</p>
   <p>Mr. James Hamilton Lewis has served as senator, from the State of Illinois, before and is considered to be one of the most capable orators of America, an aristocrat in appearance and manners, but very democratic in sentiment. He is a real gentleman and, furthermore, is distinguished as a Phil-Hellene.</p>
