   <p>Among other exploiters of innocent people, quack doctors occupy a prominent position. They take advantage of the patriotic and trusting nature of Greeks in America; furthermore, they are the direct cause of much unnecessary suffering and many deaths.</p>
   <p>These frauds have never attended a university and are in complete ignorance of the professional duties which they attempt to assume. After having been ostracized, and in many cases forcibly expelled from their native Greek village, they came to this country and proceeded to dupe trusting Greeks. By means of misleading advertisements and false testimonials they have succeeded in fooling many sick people. If these people were not actually sick before visiting these quacks, they soon became so afterwards; hence, there was never a shortage of patients.</p>
   <p>A few years ago the Greek community of Lowell, Massachusetts was cursed <span class="page-break">\2</span>with the presence of such a quack. He prescribed a certain kind of medicine for his unfortunate patient, who died as a result. The good doctor left town in the middle of the night. Another so-called doctor built a huge iron oven in which he baked the skin off his patients--for the small sum of two dollars.</p>
   <p>Chicago is overrun with these quacks; in fact, they are plentiful in every large metropolis. However, this is not the worst of it: we have female as well as male quacks! Many Greek women act as midwives without having had the slightest training. Because of carelessness of these midwives many mothers die of infections or complications. In the majority of cases, if the mother survives, her child succumbs.</p>
   <p>These criminal acts must not be allowed to continue! They are a dark blot on our name!</p>
