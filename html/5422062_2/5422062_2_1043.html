   <p>Dear Editor of the Saloniki: First of all, I want to heartily congratulate you for having enough courage to take up the cudgels in behalf of these poor unfortunates who are at the mercy of their heartless employers.</p>
   <p>You have proved to the Greeks in America that a Greek paper with a social conscience and social awareness does exist. Since you have demonstrated that you are anxious to defend the working classes--especially children that are exploited by the bosses--I take this opportunity to give you more information on the plight of the poor shoe-shine boys.</p>
   <p>These boys work at least sixteen hours a day. Why shouldn't they at least be free to rest or attend church on Sunday? Why shouldn't they get a chance to breathe a little fresh air in instead of the dust and dirt they <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>inhale the rest of the week? This is exactly why all the boys are unhealthy, shrunken, and sallow. I will wager that not one is in completely good health.</p>
   <p>The employers justify themselves by saying that their busiest day is Sunday; and that if they close on that day, they will lose a lot of money. But the American does not say that. He tells you to do your shopping or to have your shoes shined on Saturday night. Why can't the Greeks do the same thing? Let the shoes be shined on Saturday evening, in order that the little shoeblacks may be free to attend church on Sundays and all holidays, as is the case in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
   <p>I also desire to answer the letter of Mr. C. G., who declares that I have slandered the members of my profession, since I, too, am the owner of a shoe-shine establishment.</p>
   <p>No! I am not raising my voice to cast aspersions on my fellow craftsmen.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>I am seeking a day of rest for young boys. This is not asking very much, for it is the inalienable right of all men to rest one day in the week. Mr. C. G. is not performing a charitable act when he feeds his employees a bit of dry bread, for they have labored and earned it many times over. When an individual works sixteen hours a day, seven days a week, he has earned any amount you could give him.</p>
   <p>The people who believe they are doing these boys a favor by treating them as slaves are the same ones that were thrown out of Greece by Venizelos. Now they are here in America, and continue certain inhumane practices that caused them to be persecuted in their own land.</p>
   <p>Mr. Editor, I appeal to you. Invite all the Greek boys working as shoeblacks to come to the offices of the Saloniki and report their working conditions. If they do not have enough free time to come in person, ask them to write a letter stating that they want to rest on Sundays.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>In this way we can reveal the true conditions to the City Council of Chicago; and we can also ask the State Legislature to pass laws regulating the number of working days of these children.</p>
   <p>Tell the boys that their names will not be revealed, so that they need not fear the wrath of their bosses.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>George Prasinos</p>
