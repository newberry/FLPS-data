   <p>p. 5.- In a previous issue of the Greek Press we wrote about Dr. Petrakogiannis' new office at 104 S. Michigan Ave. This office will enable him to serve those living on both the South and North Sides of the city. As is known, Dr. Petrakogiannis has cured hundreds of people of their mouth ailments, specializing in pyorrhea. He thoroughly prepared himself for this profession and has made a name among American specialists. The Greeks of Chicago are very fortunate to have such a dependable dentist conveniently situated in the Loop.</p>
