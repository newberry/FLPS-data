   <p>p. 1.- We all know that the city of Chicago intends to raise the licenses for peddling from $25 to $200 a year. This, of course, directly affects the Greek people because practically all peddlers are Greek. There is only one way to stop this added taxation. We must organize. We Greeks must forget our personal grievances and come together to fight this huge menance to our business. Unions have been formed before and will be formed for years to come to help the common people protect their rights.</p>
   <p>The Greeks are jealous of each other and rivalry exists among them often ending in bloodshed. This is not a very good trait of the Greek people. It must be stopped.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday we are organizing a meeting for all Greeks at Hull House. Please be there and fight for your rights and your neighbor's rights. Forget silly quarrels and pull together to win your cause at Hull House on Sunday.</p>
