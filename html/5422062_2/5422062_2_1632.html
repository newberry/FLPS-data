   <p>Last Saturday the American Association of Greek Restaurant Keepers gave a dance banquet at the LaSalle Hotel. Over two thousand Greek restauranteurs attended this dance.</p>
   <p>The aim of the society of the restaurant keepers, is to ameliorate conditions and prove that a Greek could fraternize with a Greek competitor and derive the benefits of such contact.</p>
   <p>A noted event of the dance was a letter sent to the association, by Mayor Wm. Hale Thompson, which was published by all the newspapers of Chicago. The letter read as follows:</p>
   <p>"I extend the official greetings of our City, upon the occasion of the Greek Restaurant Owners' annual dance, and recommend to all citizens at large to patronize this splendid dance of such good people, who are so successfully making their way in business endeavors, and who stand always loyally by our City, State and Nation."</p>
