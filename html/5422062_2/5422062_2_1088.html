   <p>Anniversary of Great American Recalls Famous Eulogies over Dead Which when Compared Reveal Same Lofty Ideals by Each, though More than 2,000 Years Intervened between Addresses.</p>
   <p>(By Peter S. Lambros, editor of the Greek Star)</p>
   <p>As the world moves on, the anniversary of Lincoln's birth returns in triumph every year, with the usual tribute paid to his memory by more than 100,000,000 Americans, who are called upon to do homage to the ideals and the achievements of the beloved Emancipator.</p>
   <p>This anniversary has everlasting significance, renewing within us the loving remembrance of a great martyr, a memory which shines in our hearts as a guiding star and a supreme inspiration.</p>

   <p>As the birthday of the Nazarene brings joy to all Christians for the preservation of God's commandments, so the commemoration of Lincoln's birthday symbolizes Americanism and patriotism because Lincoln, as the new Star of Bethlehem, lighted the way to the preservation of the Union and to the firm establishment of the fundamental principles of American Democracy.</p>
   <p>As the doctrine of Christianity, "Peace on earth and good will to men," has been crystallized by centuries of use, so the doctrine of Lincoln, "with malice toward none, with charity for all," stands firm and is equally clear evidence that Lincoln now speaks in spirit, as he spoke in person in 1863.</p>
   <p>Lincoln an Inspiration</p>
   <p>Lincoln's life and work are brilliant pages in the history of the world. Lincoln's name is idolized by all Americans, who stand with Lincoln because he stood right, and by his faith in righteousness and justice Lincoln always shines as the guiding star of patriotism, of obedience to the Constitution, and of cordial feelings toward all nations.</p>

   <p>As an American, I am participating with pride in the celebration of that great event, the birth of Abraham Lincoln. I happen not to be an American by birth, but I am proud that I am an American by choice, particularly since I came from the land where the light of democracy was kindled.</p>
   <p>As a native of Sparta and now as an American among Americans, I fully realize my duty to my adopted country, and I show that I realize it by obedience,-by being just as faithful to America as the Spartans were to Sparta.</p>
   <p>I think of the historic times of the Athenians and the Spartans,-of democracy and law and order. And I think of the marvelous age of Lincoln with the greatest admiration because he left an everlasting inspiration by standing steadfast before the nations of the world for the rights of this great country of ours.</p>
   <p>Not having had the opportunity to attend public school in America, I did not learn Americanism as one learns grammar, but it came to me as an inspiration,-from the sight of the Statue of Liberty and from the spirit of Abraham Lincoln. Consequently my heart swells with pride when I see the Star Spangled Banner, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and when I think of the honor which is mine in being a citizen of the foremost country of the world,-first in liberty and justice, first in progress and in civilization, and first in acts of peace and kindness to humanity.</p>
   <p>Oh what pride is mine to be an American and to share in the honor of observing Lincoln's birthday anniversary! Oh what a privilege it is for me to be able to say that as the follower of Pericles and Lincoln, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to make a comparison of the world's most notable addresses, Pericles' funeral oration and Lincoln's Gettysburg address!</p>
   <p>Lincoln a New Pericles</p>
   <p>Although more than two thousand years have passed since Pericles delivered his famous oration, and although the opportunity was presented to other statesmen of the world to distinguish themselves as brilliant orators under similar conditions, nevertheless none came forward in that long period, and the world had to wait for the great American, Lincoln,to behold a new Pericles, whose famous Gettysburg address was equally as brilliant as Pericles' funeral oration.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>I can speak with due propriety of the significance of both orations because the democratic policies of the famous statesman of Athens were so splendidly conveyed to the world through the idealistic thoughts of the illustrious statesman of America and so perfectly illustrated in his Gettysburg address.</p>
   <p>Both these men were great believers in the doctrine of equal rights for all; both were governors of great republics and witnessed the horrors of civil war, triumphantly emerging from bloody struggles between brothers; both preserved the fundamental principles of democracy and paved the way to the golden ages of their countries; both were champions of democracy, and they delivered the two most notable orations ever pronounced over the graves of heroes of civil wars. Time makes the only difference between them; Pericles became famous in 431 B. C., and Lincoln became immortal in 1863 A. D.</p>
   <p>Two Ages Compared</p>
   <p>Athens under the regime of Pericles was what America is to-day. A careful perusal of the democratic ideas cherished by these two standard-bearers of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>democracy who lived two thousand years apart would enlarge our imagination and our thought by impressing upon them a sense of the lapse of time and making us realize how history for the first time distinctly repeated itself in the personalities of these two statesmen and in the events which took place in the ages of Pericles and Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Though history immortalizes both eulogies, yet it does not mention that either Pericles or Lincoln was applauded. This was not because the addresses were not successful, but because the significance of the mournful events repressed any applause or cheering during the course of the solemn ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The first sincere appreciation of Lincoln's speech came from across the sea, when the Edinburg Review stated editorially that "No other address except that of Pericles made in eulogy of the heroes of the Peloponnesian War can compare with Lincoln's Gettysburg address."</p>
   <p>It would take the pen of Thucydides, which recorded the history of Pericles, to <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>write the history of Lincoln; it would require the poetic talent of Homer to sing the hymns of this illustrious god of democracy. Only the eloquence of Demosthenes could do justice to the supreme genius of these two leaders.</p>
   <p>The record of the events which have occurred since the time of the golden era of Athens shows that the world has gone through catastrophes, earthquakes, wars, fires, and bloodshed.</p>
   <p>Other nations, contemporaries of ancient Greece have been wiped off the face of the earth. We still marvel to see how the Periclean doctrine of democracy has been preserved through the centuries, how it has developed in America, and how it is developing now in the very same city of Athens where Pericles said, "You are either republicans or imperialists, or neither, or both," and where Venizelos is even now debating with the Athenians in the same manner for the same object, that of establishing a republic in Greece.</p>
   <p>Conditions Are Parallel</p>
   <p>The name of Pericles is inseparably connected with the golden era in which he lived.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The name of Lincoln is likewise connected with the epoch in which he was "testing whether that nation could long endure," a test which led him through a period of stormy circumstances equally as grave and exciting as those of the age of Pericles.</p>
   <p>In comparing the idealistic thoughts and sentiments of the two great statesmen I wish to dispel any mistaken idea that I am trying to reveal evidence of plagiarism. No! I merely desire to point out how history repeats itself, and how two master minds have come together, though two thousand years apart.</p>
   <p>Lincoln Second Pericles</p>
   <p>Pericles believed that demou kratos, the reign of the people, was the noblest idea ever conceived by human thought. This noble idea was never again so well expressed until Lincoln said,</p>
   <p>"Government by the people shall not perish from the earth."</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Pericles was the president of Athens, the first republic which the world had ever known. Since then there has been but one president in the world who has met Pericles in spirit, under conditions of striking similarity. The speeches of Pericles as well as those of Lincoln, such as his Cooper Institute speech and those delivered by him in his debate with Douglas, were really Philippies against the foes of democracy.</p>
   <p>The oligarchy of Athens and the helotism of Sparta were just as inimical to democracy as the slavery of the South; therefore Pericles struck against the concentration of power in oligarchies and fought the confederate states led by the Lacedaemonians in order to abolish oppression in Sparta just as Lincoln fought the Confederates of the South in order to save the Union and to establish equality under the blessing of the American government.</p>
   <p>Both Lincoln and Pericles possessed superior statesmanship and intellectual power; both struggled to prevent a nation's being divided against itself. If the principles of Pericles had prevailed, Greece would not have been divided between the kingdom of Sparta and the republic of Athens. And if the efforts of Lincoln had been in vain, the United States would have been divided to-day <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>as are the Balkan States.</p>
   <p>The aim of both wars was victory or death, and under Lincoln victory was won. The war against Sparta was not for the purpose of conquest or of interfering with the rights of other states; its aim was to unite Greece under one government. The purpose of the Civil War was to unite America under the Stars and Stripes.</p>
   <p>Triumph of Democracy</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Civil War was not to conquer the South but to abolish slavery and to eliminate the conflict between slave States and free States. There was no alternative; the Washington Government had either to recognize the Southern Confederacy as an independent power within its own limits or to vindicate itself by force of arms.</p>
   <p>The result was that democracy triumphed, slavery was abolished, and the Union was preserved.</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>Pericles' opening remarks had reference to the glory of his ancestors, as Lincoln began by saying, "Our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty."</p>
   <p>Furthermore, we read that Pericles spoke of democracy as a "form of government to be administered not for the benefit of the few but for the benefit of all," and this means, as the famous American expressed it, "government by the people."</p>
   <p>Touching upon the cause of the war, Pericles explained that "the country was brought to a test by the Peloponnesian War and had to prove superior to its fame."</p>
   <p>Lincoln's words are: "Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure."</p>
   <p>As we proceed through these addresses, we find that Pericles, speaking of equality, said, <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>"The struggle is not for the same purpose in our case as it is in that of men who have none of these advantages in an equal degree."</p>
   <p>Lincoln's statement was "that all men are created equal,"</p>
   <p>Sentiments Compared</p>
   <p>Pericles further on dwells on the fact that "it was for such a country that these dead heroes resolved to fight and fell fighting for freedom."</p>
   <p>In Lincoln's address appears the passage, "We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as the final resting-place of those who gave their lives that that nation might live."</p>
   <p>Pericles says, "These dead heroes endured the brunt of battle with their bodies," and he adds, "It is for you who remain to pray that you may with better fortune fulfill your vows."</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>Lincoln's statement is: "It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work."</p>
   <p>"Depriving their country of their valor, but devoting to her the most glorious of sacrifices," continues Pericles.</p>
   <p>"The brave men who struggled here have consecrated it far above our power to add or to detract," said Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Pericles' tribute was: "You must console yourselves with the far renown of those who have perished."</p>
   <p>Lincoln's words are: "That we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion."</p>
   <p>Taking the orations in their entirety, we note that Pericles's eloquence and Lincoln's are unlike in their phraseology, but that both orators nobly expressed their nations' sorrow for the dead who had perished in battle.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>Both statesmen paid the highest tribute to the heroes of civil wars; both possessed the same love of freedom, the same devotion to their countries, the same respect for the principle of equality, for their ancestors, and for democracy.</p>
   <p>In setting forth as closely as possible all the parallels in the lives and the thoughts of these two great immortals we come to the conclusion that Pericles sowed the seed of the republican form of government, that his ideals played a very important part in the evolution of civilization, and that the very same spirit of democracy has contributed, through the tireless efforts of America's greatest son, Abraham Lincoln, to the American form of government.</p>
   <p>Soldiers Not Unknown</p>
   <p>Pericles' and Lincoln's eulogies were expressions of the deep emotion inspired in them by the memory of the dead who had died in battle. This tradition of eulogizing the dead is still maintained, and public speakers are still called upon to deliver addresses over the graves of unknown soldiers.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>There is no such thing as an unknown soldier, for they all knew, as we all know, the noble causes for which they sacrificed their lives. Those who have fought for the sacred cause of freedom since Pericles' time, Washington and Lincoln among them, have contributed to the development of democracy and civilization and to the establishment of liberty and justice.</p>
   <p>They were not conscious of the dreadful nature of their death, but they were conscious of the glory of their sacrifice upon the altar of patriotism.</p>
   <p>They died a just death in obedience to their country's command. There is no greater devotion than theirs who proved by their death that they were loyal to the land of liberty which had taught them to die for the noble cause of freedom.</p>
   <p>They died without complaint and with faith in their hearts and words of hope on their lips, confident that democracy would triumph, and that civilization would survive.</p>
   <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>
   <p>Now as we do homage to the memory of this immortal American, it behooves us to pay tribute to all great heroes, living and dead, and to derive inspiration from their bravery, that we may "dedicate ourselves to the unfinished work," as Lincoln said, renewing our faith in the land of liberty and resolving to make our contributions to Greater America.</p>
   <p>The brave men who fought for the noble cause of liberty and justice "should be honored by deeds," as Pericles said; and as Lincoln taught us, "we should take increased devotion."</p>
   <p>Our increased devotion should be manifested in absolute respect for the Constitution and in our united loyalty to America and to the flag that waves "o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."</p>
