   <p>Among the young Greek students of our city we find A. A. Pantelis of Kastri, Kynouria. He is enrolled in the School of Law at our city University and will receive his degree this coming June. Although a young man he does not lack courage and initiative. Some time ago he organized the only Greek-American Political Club, The Achaian League, and is president of it. The club will hold its first general meeting on Sunday, 2 o'clock at Hull House Bowen Hall. There will be Greek and American speakers.</p>
   <p>Among the American speakers we have such men as Carter H. Harrison, Robert M. Sweitzer, Michael Gimmer, John Owens, Peter Bartzen, and George F. Mulligan. All Greeks should attend this special meeting which is a rare opportunity for them.</p>
