   <p>Greeks! Lend a helping hand to your native land, America, and the Allies!</p>
   <p>Pay attention to and obey the suggestions and appeals of the President of the United States and Mr. Hoover, director of the Federal Food Administration. Conserve, save, and do not waste any food; do not underestimate the danger that America and the Allies are risking by an insufficiency and shortage of food resources. Ample and plentiful food supplies are one of the most important means by which a final victory for the Allied and American Armies can be won.</p>
