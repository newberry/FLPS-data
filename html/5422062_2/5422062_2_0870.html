   <p>The time for slow deliberation has passed, and we are now in a period where hasty and unfair actions are the rule.</p>
   <p>The British-French navy surrounds our islands and has blockaded our seaports. The country is being faced by the terrible specter of hunger; yet the people of Greece are a free people living in a free country.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time such a thing has happened; because last June the English navy also caused the Greeks to starve when they would not permit Greek trade to continue. The Greeks suffered then, and they are suffering now, because of a blockade formed by countries that always had the love and respect of the Greek people.</p>
   <p>It is shameful that the French and English should take such unfair action against their small friend Greece. It is an unjust and inhuman action to starve five million Greek people who have constantly said prayers for the victory of the Allied forces.</p>
