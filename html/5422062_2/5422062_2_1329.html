   <p>The Greek architect came to America 18 years ago, and owing to his inclination towards that profession, he attended night schools to learn English. The young immigrant, as is usually the case, had to work in the day time to earn his living. After a short time he entered College, and came out on top of the list of the excellent architects of the College. The firm of "Hall, Lawrence, Rippel and Ratcliffe", recognized the talent of the young architect and asked him to become a member. He now holds the office of vice-president. According to connoisseurs of architecture and according to Mr. Hall, the young man is the best architect in Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the world war he fought in France under the Stars and Stripes, and after the war he continued his studies in the Academy of Fine Arts, Paris.</p>
