   <p>First: Because he is thus contributing to the altar of liberty and so gaining every advantage.</p>
   <p>Second: By subscribing to the Liberty Loan, he is helping to bring this bloody war to a conclusion.</p>
   <p>Third: Because he is showing his loyalty and patriotism to this, his adopted country in which he is enjoying the blessings of freedom.</p>
   <p>Fourth: He will be highly esteemed by the American people and will thus improve his business and economic status.</p>
   <p>Fifth: He will have the courage and liberty to ask for the help and protection of the Americans if need be.</p>
   <p>Sixth: Because this money will be spent not only for the needs of this country, but for the needs of the allies as well; consequently our homeland, Greece, will be benefited indirectly.</p>
   <p>Seventh: Because almost all of this money will be spent on food supplies and war materials; consequently there will be a greater circulation of currency, a fact which shall greatly improve employment.</p>
   <p>Eighth: Because Liberty Loan bonds are the safest investment, for the bonds are protected by the national wealth of the United States, which is estimated to be about two hundred and fifty billion dollars. The banks are guaranteeing this loan.</p>
   <p>Ninth: Because they (the bonds) yield an interest of four and one-half percent, which is more than any bank pays. This loan is free of any tax. The bank interest is six and one-half per cent, but is liable to taxation.</p>
   
   <p>Tenth: Because the holder of even one such bond can boast and be proud that he, too, has done his part in this sacred struggle for freedom.</p>
   <p>Eleventh: Because these bonds represent cash, and one may sell them at any time he feels the need to do so. They can be transferred to anyone and can be used as security for a loan.</p>
   <p>Twelfth: Because he may save and buy a few bonds at a time by paying small amounts at a time, if he has not very much money to pay in cash. In this way, by saving two dollars weekly, one can buy a fifty-dollar bond in twenty-five weeks. By saving four dollars a week, one can buy a one hundred-dollar bond in the same length of time, and so forth and so on.</p>
   <p>While there is so much gain in buying Liberty Loan bonds, the buyer will sustain no loss, or run no risk whatsoever. We urge all the Greek people of Chicago to buy Liberty Loan bonds, and they will profit greatly in so many ways.</p>
