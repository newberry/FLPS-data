   <p>Charles S. Deneen, former governor, charged the progressives last night with plagiarism. He said the party got its "social justice" planks in its platform two years ago from laws already placed in the statute books of Illinois by the Republicans.</p>
   <p>"The Republican party," said Mr. Deneen at the West Side Coliseum, 1213 Blue Island avenue, "has been the true progressive party of the nation and of the state. Its record is a sufficient evidence of this fact. Take, for illustration, the so called laws for social justice that are being agitated as part of the progressive program.</p>
   <p>"The record of the Republican party is full, clear and satisfactory on all phases of this class of legislation. It is only necessary to cite the laws of this character enacted in our own state.</p>

   <p>"In every department of state work Illinois has taken an advanced position and already has enacted into law or had in process of enactment twenty-six of the twenty-eight planks of the Progressive platforms of 1912.</p>
   <p>"The platform of the Progressives might well have been taken from the statute books of this state."</p>

   <p>Officers of the state committee conferred with some of the candidates yesterday over financial plans. Funds are running low, due largely to the expense of the special train that took the state nominees on a nine days' tour of Illinois, and to furnish the sinews of war for the final week of the campaign the candidates will be invited to "dig-down."</p>
