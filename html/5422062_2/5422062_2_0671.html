   <p>The first anniversary of Greece's entrance into the World War on the side of the United States and the Allied Powers of Europe was celebrated with pomp and magnificence.</p>
   <p>The first meeting took place at Hull House from which the people paraded as far as the Blackstone Theater, where the celebration took place.</p>
   <p>At the head of the procession marched stalwart youths wearing the Greek national costumes, Foustanela, and bearing the American and Greek flags and banners of the various organizations.</p>
   <p>The dignitaries and officials as well as the students of the Greek schools, occupied the stage of the theater. In the middle stood a table draped with the American flag.</p>

   <p>More than three thousand people filled the theater to capacity. Many others on the outside clamored to be allowed to enter.</p>
   <p>The Honorable Samuel Insull was chairman of the evening. Our three Chicago Greek priests were present, led by Reverend Leon Pygeas. A fine church choir sang appropriate hymns and the "Te Deum". Then, the Reverend Constantine Hatzidimitriou gave the invocation. Afterwards, the chairman, Mr. Insull, opened the ceremony with a fine introductory speech and read the Governor's telegram congratulating the Greek people and expressing regret for his inability to attend.</p>
   <p>The children sang the Greek national anthem and then the Honorable Felix J. Streyckmans spoke beautifully and inspiringly, comparing Washington and Lincoln with Solon and Cleisthenes, and President Wilson to Pericles.</p>

   <p>Then, the Honorable Clarence S. Darrow and the Honorable Bernard W. Snow spoke. Lastly, the Consul General, Mr. Stamatios Pezas, spoke. Then Mr. P. Demos was introduced. He read a salutation to President Wilson from the Greek people.</p>
   <p>Amidst great enthusiasm and cheering, the vast audience dispersed, shouting hurrahs for America, Greece, and the Allies.</p>
   <p>[Saloniki's Editor's note: The committee in charge of the celebration regrets that a larger hall was not rented for the accommodation of the great crowds. However, it is to be congratulated for its splendid work in organizing this magnificent affair.]</p>
