   <p>Greek-Americans Organize for Republican Candidate and Will Give Banquet Greek-Americans Organize</p>
   <p>Greek-Americans of Chicago have organized the Greek-American Republican League for the purpose of supporting Lueder for mayor. They will tender a banquet to Mr. Lueder on Friday evening, March 23, at the Hotel LaSalle. The speakers will be sheriff Peter M. Hoffman, Congressman Henry R. Rathbone, Judge Barasa, and Judge John Haas.</p>
   <p>In giving his endorsement to-day to Mr. Lueder, Mr. Lambros said: "Do we want a judge or a businessman as mayor of Chicago? If we want a judge, then Judge Dever is qualified as a gentleman of excellent legal talent, which he has <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>exercised in the high tribunal of Cook County. If we want a businessman for a business city, then Mr. Lueder is fully qualified to give Chicago a business-like administration.</p>
   <p>"I advocate Mr. Lueder's election because I believe that for the good of Chicago we need a businessman as mayor. Mr. Lueder is a man of high standing, who measures up not only to the requirements of the hour but also to the demands of the future. Mr. Lueder is a successful businessman of remarkable physical strength and clear thought and vision whose executive ability has been demonstrated by his conduct as postmaster. Undoubtedly he will display the same administrative ability as mayor of Chicago.</p>
