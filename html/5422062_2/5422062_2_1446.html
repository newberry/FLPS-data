   <p>The Greek Press, in its sincere interest in the progress and advancement of Greek enterprise, is very happy to announce the opening of a new restaurant.</p>
   <p>This restaurant was opened last week on the corner of Oak Street and Michigan Boulevard, and is called the "Ranch Cafe". Its owner, Mr. C. Terzakis, has furnished and decorated the cafe in a manner in keeping with its name. The Cafe resembles an early American ranch with modern conveniences. It represents the best of its kind, and Mr. Terzakis deserves much praise for the elaboration of his unusual idea. The decoration of the cafe cost him ten thousand dollars--a sum well spent.</p>
   <p>Since, it is situated on Chicago's Gold Coast Mr. Terzakis will, no doubt, be very successful.</p>
