   <p>We, the Greek-American Republican Club of Cook County, at a meeting assembled on March 10th, 1931, having the welfare of our adopted city, Chicago, at heart, and realizing the vicissitudes that confront it in the forthcoming election, do hereby highly resolve:</p>
   <p>That the city of Chicago shall, and rightly, regain its former prestige and power in the eyes of the world;</p>
   <p>That the city of Chicago and its people will be best served by one whose past record is replete with hard work and sterling achievement;</p>
   <p>That the present crisis demands that we discard party politics in the interest of our beloved city. To that end we hereby further resolve;</p>
   <p>That we unqualifiedly endorse the candidacy of the Hon. Anton J. Cermak, Democratic candidate for Mayor, the man best fitted to fill the Mayor's chair of the city of Chicago with the honor, loyalty, ability and integrity that traditionally belongs to it.</p>
   <p>Paul Demos, President; Geo W. Prassas, Sec'y.</p>
