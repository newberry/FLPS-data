   <p>Registration for subscribers to the Third Liberty Loan begins on April 6. It is a loan which will be used by the government to preserve and protect the freedom of the peoples of the world, as well as our own. Your loan yields four per cent interest guaranteed by the United States Government. This is another opportunity which is afforded us to prove our loyalty and patriotism to America. Besides being given the advantage of material and moral gain, we are privileged to come and contribute to the altar of liberty.</p>
   <p>Get ready and register as subscribers to the Third Liberty Loan. A committee composed of Greek people is about to be formed. You must all call on this committee, if you want to register. Let us make a fine showing in the number of Greeks registering, even though many of us cannot make an equally impressive showing in regard to actual financial subscriptions. We will demonstrate to our great and glorious adopted country, the United States of America, that we are by nature a freedom-loving people.</p>
   <p>Onward all, to our duty!</p>
