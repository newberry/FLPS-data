   <p>I have never been unmindful of the tribute America and the entire world owe glorious Greece. My love for Greece has been warm ever since my school days, when I learned about the marvelous victories of Salamis and Marathon and the Golden Era of Pericles, in the days of "the glory that was Greece."</p>
   <p>My personal contact with numerous Greeks has instilled into me greater admiration for their motherland, as well as greater respect for the seventy-five thousand Greeks of this city who have contributed their share toward Greater Chicago and Greater America.</p>
   <p>I deeply appreciate the support given me politically by the Greek-Americans during the past, and now, I am extremely pleased that the Greek-American Litsinger Club has been organized to further my campaign as Republican candidate for mayor of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Moreover, I am happy to learn of the banquet and rally to be given in my honor by the splendid organization, Sunday evening, Feb. 6th, at the Hotel La Salle.</p>
   <p>Such an enthusiastic demonstration in my behalf of thousands of my Greek friends and fellow Americans is indeed great encouragement to me in this campaign and leads me to believe that, with your assistance and cooperation, we will attain victory at the polls, February 22nd.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Edward R. Litsinger.</p>
