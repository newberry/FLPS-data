   <p>The well-known enterprising Greek, Geo. M. Harris, after many negotiations has purchased the Sunkist Pie Company.</p>
   <p>This progressive Greek, with his brother, founded the Harris Brothers Pie Company in 1921. This enterprise in a few years enlarged its shops, absorbed another company (The Pie Bakeries of America) and eventually became one of the biggest concerns of its kind in the whole country.</p>
   <p>Many good wishes to these enterprising Greeks.</p>
