   <p>An excellent club by the name of Club des Amis de la France has existed in Chicago for the past five months. The honorary president is the French consul to Chicago, and the Belgian consul is honorary vice-president.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this club is evidently to make as many friends for France as possible for furthering their propaganda, and to offset the propaganda being spread by the Germans.</p>
   <p>We are greatly pleased to hear that there are many outstanding French-speaking Greeks from our Chicago Greek community who are prominent and active members of this club. These countrymen of ours have managed, through their own efforts, to occupy second place in the number of members. The total membership of this club is two hundred and twenty.</p>
   <p>Thirty-four nationalities are represented in the club, and the number of Greek <span class="page-break">2</span>members is thirty.</p>
   <p>Our prominent and progressive merchant, Mr. Mathew Scordilis, is a member of the board of officers.</p>
   <p>Anyone desiring to become a member of the Club des Amis de la France may apply to Mr. Scordilis.</p>
