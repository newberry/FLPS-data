   <p>The second meeting of the Central Committee in charge of Polish Day arrangements was held yesterday evening at Pulaski Hall. Mr. J. Sakwinski and Mr. J. Kolaczyk, representatives of St. Hedwig's parish, attended.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by S. Slominski. The minutes of the last meeting were read, and a letter from S. Slupski, repeating his proposal that a painting be purchased from the Polish exhibit and presented to the Art Institute, instead of celebrating in another way, was tabled for future discussion.</p>
   <p>The committee appointed to consult with the World's Fair officials on setting a definite date for Polish Day reported that due to circumstances beyond its own control, it had thus far been unable to set the date. The chairman promised that this would be done today(Saturday), when the day agreed upon will be communicated to the Central Committee's headquarters. The financial committee next presented its report. In behalf of this committee, Mr. [Julius] Smietanka announced that he and A. Stefanowicz had laid a petition for support <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>before the Polish Roman Catholic Union's Convention. (Editor's note: As we already know, the Convention allotted fifty dollars and offered to furnish one float). Further, in behalf of the same committee, J. Rosinski presented a plan for raising funds, which, after a long discussion and with a few amendments, was accepted.</p>
   <p>The plan, covering also the main points in the parade program, is as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Every parish or society will be required to furnish music and a float at its own expense, in this way leaving each parish or society (with the exception of military societies)as an individual group, each to be assigned to its proper place in the parade by the Central Committee. The Central Committee will be in full charge of the parade and the floats.</p>
   <p>2. Each parish or society will be required to deposit a certain sum of money, depending upon its means, with the Central Committee. This fund will be used to pay for the main orchestra, the celebration at Festival Hall, entertainment of guests, correspondence, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>announcements, etcetere. The collection will amount to not less than fifteen cents for each person marching in the parade.</p>
   <p>3. Each parish or society will take up the above-mentioned collection within its own group and deposit the entire sum with the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>The above plan for financing the celebration was accepted as most feasible by the representatives of parishes and societies present. It provides the necessary funds for the Central Committee to operate, and at the same time, it will not proved great burden to those participating in the Polish Day activities. Finally, it gives each parish and society freedom to act upon its own initiative in making the best possible appearance, even encouraging competition.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the decision made at the last meeting, the president named the various special committees. The committees are as follows: Parade committee--<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>P. Kiolbassa, A. Lisztewnik, J. Napieralski, M. Wleklinski, L. Machnikowski, J. Koziczynski, and Z. Schmidt. Float committee-- H. Nagiel, F. Jablonski, B. Markiewicz, G. Kozlowski, M.J. Szameit, F. Wikaryasz, E. Wiedeman, W. Smulski, and J. Roszak. Committee to take charge of celebration at Festival Hall--S. Slominski, [M. A.] La Buy, P. Kiolbassa, Andrew Schultz, K. Bielinski, N. L. Piotrowski, J. Szostakowski, and S. Solski. Music committee--J. Gniot, I. Czaja, and J. Manna. It was decided also to invite A. Mallek, A. Kwasigroch, and Henzl into this committee. Decorations committee--W. Bardonski, D. Ekowski, and M. Marcinkowski. Publicity committee-- W. Smulski, H. Nagiel, F. Jablonski, and Casimir Zychlinski.</p>
   <p>The duties of each committee were explained, and it was agreed that each committee could requisition the services of as many additional members as it needed to do its work.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee's recommendations were then presented. The first proposed that Central Committee members from different neighborhoods or parishes should <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>consider themselves each as a special committee from their respective localities, where they are to get busy as soon as possible in: (1) Making a list of societies and persons willing to participate in Polish Day activities; (2) Collecting the fifteen-cent assessment, and (3) coming to a definite understanding in regard to the furnishing of floats, with businessmen in their districts. In order to accomplish this task, it was suggested that the committee members organize properly, each in his own community, and enlist the services of such people as they deem necessary. They are to make a report of their activities to the Central Committee within a week. This proposal was unanimously accepted after a short discussion.</p>
   <p>The second recommendation proposed the publication of the following announcements: (1) From the Central Committee, making public the date and all of the details of the Polish Day celebration. (2) From the financial committee, describing the plan for financing the affair, with an appeal to the generosity of the public. (3) From the publicity committee to representative Poles in other cities, inviting them to attend or to send delegates to the Polish Day in Chicago. (4) From the float committee, listing the proposed floats and outlining methods of communication with persons or corporations furnishing <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>floats. This proposal was also accepted unanimously.</p>
   <p>The matter of badges and the participation of the Czechs in the parade were referred to the proper committees.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee decided to hold its next meeting at 7:30 in the evening on August 30, at Pulaski Hall. It is hoped that by this time reports of activities in various communities will be ready.</p>
   <p>As can be readily seen, much has already been done, and a sound foundation for future work has been laid. That work is even now under way. The duties of each committee were decided upon yesterday, and today each committee is already in action.</p>
