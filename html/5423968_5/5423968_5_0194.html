   <p>The Chicago Wholesale Grocery Company, a well-known Polish firm at 175 West Randolph Street, announced last Saturday that it was forced to go out of business. The cause of failure was given as poor business and lack of funds to pay creditors. Great doubt is expressed as to whether all bills will be met. The assets are placed at $13,000 and the liabilities at $21,500. Last Friday, the sheriff closed the doors of this firm at the request of a number of creditors. Its president was A. X. Centela, and its treasurer Albert Wachowski.</p>
