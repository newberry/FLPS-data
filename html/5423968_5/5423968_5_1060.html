   <p>"Perla Cyllejska [The Cyllejski Pearl], the play which was enjoyed so much by a large audience yesterday, will be repeated on Sunday, January 15 in the hall on Bradley Street. This will be its second performance in the interests of charity. The entire proceeds of the play will be used for the benefit of the many Polish widows in our community. This information was first disclosed to the audience by the Very Reverend V. Barzynski during one of the intermissions. The enthusiasm with which this news was received seems to augur that the performance of "Perla Cyllejska" next Sunday will be highly successful, and that it will really bring relief and material aid to our poverty-stricken widows and orphans.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the performance is noble. Everyone who desires to help dry the tears of the unfortunate should see "Perla Cyllejska". We will at once perform a good deed and see a beautiful and worthwhile drama.</p>
