   <p>Under such a title there appeared in the weekly supplement devoted to art, "The Chicago Evening Post Magazine Of The Art World" on June 22nd, an article by Samuel Putnam, about the creative power of Mr. Michael Rekucki, known already for some time to the Polonia of Chicago as an artist.</p>
   <p>The author, remarking that the works of Mr. Rekucki, which he himself has viewed in the artist's modest studio at 2100 W. Chicago Avenue, are also already known to the general public in Chicago from an exhibit in conjunction with the Chicago No-Jury Society of Artists, reflects to a great extent on the creative power of Mr. Rekucki, and claims that this creative power is the expression of great talent. The artist, in spite of the outstanding mark of impressionism of Weiss and Mehofer, likewise the comparatively young development of Polish painting, and the unfortunately unfavorable influence of the modernistic German school of Max Lieberman and the French impressionist, Edward Manet, is making with great effort his own path and is overcoming these influences with success.</p>
   
   <p>Specifying a few works of Mr. Rekucki, such as "The Head of a Young Girl", "The Polish Peasant Woman", and "A Winter Scene at Podhal", Mr. Putnam praises these works and at the same time claims that the portraits of Kosciuszko and Pulaski by Mr. Rekucki can be counted among the best marks, which, in regard to style and tone, he does not hesitate to compare in value with the works of such masters of the English school as Gainsborough and others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Putnam, one of the most prominent judges and critics of art, is not for the first time devoting the columns of the newspaper edited by him to Polish art, about which he always expresses himself with high recognition. Mr. Rekucki can be congratulated, because with his works he has interested prominent American critics and received from them a word of praise. This attests to his outstanding talent, and the Poles in Chicago can be rightfully proud of him.</p>
   <p>It is proper here to mention that the Polish Arts Club has contributed in a certain measure toward the rousing of Mr. Putnam's interest in Polish art in general, and especially in the art of Mr. Rekucki.</p>
