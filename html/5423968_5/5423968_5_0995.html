   <p>Yesterday's theatrical performance for the benefit of the new church in St. Hyacinth Parish was a splendid success.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to the limit and the audience was pleased. The acting, we must say, was beyond criticism, and the audience did not spare applause or sincere praise for the actors' good acting and good will.</p>
   <p>A dance followed the show.</p>
   <p>Everybody had an enjoyable time, and the St. John Cantius Circle helped with their singing. Our good people from St. John Cantius, St. Hedwig, and St. Hyacinth parishes enjoyed themselves as real brothers late into the night, and Mr. Grabowiecki, the host, was ever watchful to see that everyone was satisfied.</p>
