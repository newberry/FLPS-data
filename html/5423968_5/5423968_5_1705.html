   <p>One of the most interesting meetings of the year was held at the University of Chicago last Sunday afternoon. Mr. Stephen Jarosz, a student from the University of Posen, delivered a short address on the culture of the "Polish Mountaineers." He illustrated his lectures with songs which were very entertaining to members and guests present. Mr. David Stevens assisted the president of the university in welcoming the members and friends of the Polish Arts Club. He told about the impressions made upon him by Professor Dyboski, whom he met at the University of London, several years ago, and, he said that the faculty is looking forward to having Mr. Dyboski with them next year and they hope that the initial work of the professor will prove sufficiently interesting to result in a permanent chair of Polish literature at the University.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stevens invited the members and friends to remain for tea and refreshments, which were served through the courtesy of the University of Chicago. This gave many of the new members an opportunity to become better acquainted with each other. Two other organizations were guests of the Polish Arts Club, at this meeting; the Upsilon Gamma Sorority and the Polish University Club. Each one was given an opportunity to meet Mr. Stephen Jarosz in his most colorful native costume of the "Polish Mountaineer." The Polish-American people have an opportunity to see Mr. Jarosz, who will give a number of entertaining programs throughout the Polish communities in Chicago, during the next two weeks, the first of which was very entertaining and well received.</p>
   
   <p>This week he is scheduled to make his appearance on the south side of Chicago. On Wednesday May 11, at Adam Mickiewicz Hall; Thursday, May 12, 1927.,at Pulaski Hall; and Friday May 13, 1927, at Kosciuszko Hall.</p>
   <p>There will be no regular meeting of the Polish Arts Club, during the month of June, due to the reception that will be given for Mr. Wojciech Kossak, the famous Polish painter and Madam Ina Burska, who will sing at Ravinia Park this summer.</p>
