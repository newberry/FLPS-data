   <p>"Saint Eustace," a drama in three acts and eight scenes, written by Reverend J. Gieburowski, was presented yesterday at the Polish Hall before a crowd that almost filled the place. The audience was thrilled by the play, in which scenes of the days of Rome during Hadrian and Trajan were depicted. It was during Hadrian and Trajan that the Christains were greatly persecuted by the pagans. Eventually, however, the spiritual triumphed over the material and the Church triumphed over hate and subversion.</p>
   <p>The music for this play was written and arranged by Reverend S. Cosimi. Nowicki's Orchestra supplied the music. No money or detail was spared in the costumes and the scenery to bring out as authentic a picture of the times as possible.</p>
   <p>The public rewarded the amateurs with enthusiastic applause for their superb acting. Credit is also due to the stage director, B. Klarkowski. No comment <span class="page-break">\2</span>is necessary about the acting of the amateurs individually since all gave their best.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's performance of "Saint Eustace" will undoubtedly get a favorable response on the Polish-American stage. It should be presented by every Polish amateur group throughout America, for the play is very instructive and spiritual.</p>
