   <p>On November 11th, the University group will make its public appearance and will show evidence of its prosperous and successful existence by sponsoring a theatrical party and dance. The Upsilon Gamma Sorority is an organization of which the members are women of Polish descent and have attended a university. Thus, its membership is composed of physicians, lawyers,dentists and school teachers; and students who are now attending classes with a view of entering the professional field after graduation.</p>
   <p>From this intelligent group which holds future leaders for our people, and after a most painstaking selection and preparation, only the finest type of entertainment, may be expected. It is, then, no wonder that all of the social functions sponsored by this group in the past have met with complete success, and excited envy in other groups.</p>
   <p>This program is arranged in a manner which will amaze the attending public. Further details will appear in the next issue of this publication.</p>
