   <p>Last Sunday the Casimir Brodzinski Library presented an interesting historical drama in four acts and five scenes entitled "Wojna Szwedzkopolska" (The Polish-Swedish War) at Pulaski Hall, 4831-33 South Throop Street.</p>
   <p>The play, for an amateur performance, came out rather well, although short-comings were evident in the mass scenes. Nevertheless, those shortcomings may be charged up to the fact that the stage at Pulaski Hall really lends itself only to the performance of one-act plays, in which only a few characters appear, and not to a regular play. Mr. W. Filipiak as director, deserves recognition for the successful presentation of so serious a play on so small a stage. Mr. Anthony Dobrzanski owner of a costume shop-at 1703 W. 18th Place, supplied appropriate costumes for the play. Mr. S. Halkowski's orchestra supplied the music for the social dancing which followed the play.</p>
