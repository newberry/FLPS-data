   <p>The Polish amateur play produced last night at Walsh's hall on Milwaukee Avenue and Emma Street was a great success. There was a large attendance in spite of the very cold weather which is unusual for this time of the year, and the many political meetings that were being held the same evening.</p>
   <p>The play "Gwiazda Syberyi," (the Star of Siberia) was presented and the amateurs were splendid in their roles. The leading role was played by Miss Helen Sawicki, who gave a distinguished performance. She has great artistic ability and her talent is of great importance to our stage. Every role was well played and the presentation was excellent. Let us have more of them.</p>
