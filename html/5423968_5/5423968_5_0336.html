   <p>On the 30th of June the Polish Hunters' Lodge completed a year and a half of its existence.....We should be pleased to acquaint our readers somewhat with the activity of this lodge.</p>
   <p>We referred to this organization several weeks ago in an article entitled "Why Don't We Establish Associations?" Speaking about the small amount of interest taken by the public in this institution, we expressed our opinion, perhaps not with sufficient clearness, that Americans pay no attention to who organizes an association but rather inquire what prospects it possesses.</p>
   <p>In consequence of this statement we have been charged with knowing little about American conditions. That is possible; we will not deny this. We understand, however, very well that no man, be he an American, a German, or a Jew, will approach an association to which he is encouraged by people of doubtful character. In the Hunters' Lodge, which we have discussed, there were no such <span class="page-break">\2</span>people, a fact which the names of citizens widely known here will attest; and for that reason we expressed our thought in brief terms, perhaps without sufficient clearness. That, however, should not be considered as our fault. And then again, as in every society, so too in every lodge, among the good one can also find the evil; the lodges are nothing else than parts of societies. If, therefore, some one in a group of forty members should notice, let us say, four to whom he would not intrust his savings, that still is not sufficient reason to set an association like that aside without understanding its principles. Every lodge enacts its laws in mass meetings where the majority of the members decides. If this majority is free of charges against its character, then such an association as that must be honest. It is another matter as to whether it is practical. One can find out about this partly by its constitution, partly by the numerous examples of other societies acting in the same manner. Our fellow citizens, again, do not investigate the foundation. Without considering the practical side of such an association, without in the least knowing its purpose, they pass judgment upon it casually and say,</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"Eh, what is that to me? I already belong to one or two lodges from which I can obtain aid in the event of sickness; why should I associate myself with one that does not promise me a thing?"</p>
   <p>Because of such an attitude we constantly complain of the Jews that they abuse us, that they make fortunes on our labor; but we do not endeavor to organize ourselves into capitalistic associations, by the aid of which we could displace every foreign trader among us. The Hunters' Lodge has determined not to detract from a soundly established business but to add to it. Has it accomplished a great deal? Thus far, nothing. Why? It did not find popular support. These members who enrolled at the time of the organization of the lodge, either had no sincere purpose, or they had no time to be interested in this, and were it not for the strong will of a few and their faith in the usefulness of such an institution, who knows whether the Hunters' Lodge would exist today?</p>
   <p>Thanks to these few members, the organization still exists, and although slowly, not [so rapidly] as it should, it grows and develops. Thus far it has made no <span class="page-break">\4</span>business transactions because of lack of funds, and despite this the members have lost nothing; on the contrary, they have gained more than if they were to place their money directly in the building and loan banks. We say "directly" because thus far the Hunters' Lodge also invests its funds directly in the building and loan banks, but the lodge does not lose a thing by the withdrawal of individual members, whose shares it continues to pay from its own funds.</p>
   <p>The small number of members, as we have previously stated, has not permitted the association thus far to undertake any larger operations. That is too bad! The lodge has had offers in the last half year on which it could assure its members up to fifty per cent profit, even with the small capital which it possesses. It did not want to dip into doubtful matters because it did not wish to lose the confidence of the members. The entire activity under such conditions had to be limited to receiving the savings and investing them in a building and loan bank.</p>
   <p>We have hopes, however, that in the future, as time goes on, the lodge will <span class="page-break">\5</span>grow and develop.</p>
   <p>There still is time to correct the evil which the idleness of our compatriots has caused. Trading in real estate is not yet finished. Many of our compatriots and many strangers could purchase from us instead of from Germans and Jews; it is only necessary to make sure that we have something to sell. We can attain this only by the compilation of small amounts of capital because there are no millionaires among us. We do not wish to talk our readers into enrolling in the Hunters' Lodge by this article; we only ask of them to become better acquainted with its aim.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, that is, on Thursday, June 7, at 7:30 P. M., a semiannual meeting will be held at Mr. A. J. Kowalski's hall at 617 Noble Street. Let all those who desire organization work among us come to this meeting. There the activities of the last half year will be read; those who are interested will be able to read the constitution, and those who have something to inquire about will be informed. They themselves will decide the rest. It is possible that the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Hunters' Lodge has not developed properly thus far because its members have not advertised its qualities loudly, as have the other associations; they did not promise gold mines to their shareholders. But the members of the Hunters' Lodge have always held to this principle, that it is not necessary to praise the good, and they would consider it an insult to themselves to induce some one to become a member. The only fault of this organization was this, that it did not make itself known to a wider populace, and for that reason it vegetates. However, we now have hopes that it will change for the better, and that we shall find that such articles as "The Causes of Our National Stagnation" are not ignored. We shall show that patriotism consists not only in conducting exercises and practicing elocution but also in organized work.</p>
