   <p>We need a Polish bank, Polish funds are deposited in other various banks, often in uncertain or dishonorable ones. Other nationalities are portraying us as uncapable to establish such an enterprise. They shun us and say that even though there are so many Poles in Chicago we can't establish a bank of our own.</p>
   <p>The committee which is organizing this bank, Mr. V. F. Smulski, Thomas Krolik, and Theo. M. Helinski, together with many other Polish businessmen, have and are working energetically on this affair and so the work of organization is nearing its goal.</p>
   <p>The capital of this bank amounts to $200,000, with a surplus of $25,000, which makes the price of each share $112.50. The state auditor in Springfield has issued a state permit for the organization of this bank, which will be made under the control of the state government. Many Polish businessmen have already subscribed as stockholders and everybody welcomes the cheerful news of the opening of the new Polish state bank.</p>
   <p>The entire building, located at Milwaukee and Haddon, at present occupied by three stores, will be leased about the first of May and there shall be changes made in establishing this large and new local bank.</p>

   <p>In conjunction with the savings bank, there will be fire and burglar proof safety deposit vaults to preserve money and other valuables.</p>
   <p>The name of this bank corporation will be The Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, a Polish bank. The number of shares will soon be sold out, so we invite the Poles to come as soon as possible and register for these shares before the first of April. You may sign up for these shares in the offices of Mr. John Przbysz, 814 Milwaukee Avenue, in the building where the bank will be located.</p>
   <p>While registering for a share you must pay a deposit of $25 per share, the balance of the payment will fall due the first of May.</p>
   <p>We are sure that the shares will bring us profit and their value will shortly rise.</p>
   <p>Let there be a vast number of you Poles prepared to join us in opening a way for our nation to future financial enterprises.</p>
