   <p>The firm of Mr. Smulski and Company, booksellers and printers, enlarged its business considerably. The present print shop was enlarged by addition to it of a big new building where more presses will be installed which will necessitate hiring of quite a large number of new workers. The machines will be run by electricity instead of by gas at the present time.</p>
   <p>As a result of this enlargement of the plant the partner of the firm Mr. Szopinski is making a business trip to the "old country" in order to enter into commercial relations with the book publishers in all three part of the dismembered Poland.</p>
   <p>We wish this well-merited firm luck and success.</p>
