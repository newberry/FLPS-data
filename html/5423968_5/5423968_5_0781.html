   <p>On February 21 the B. Dembinski Choir held its first concert and ball at W. Templin's Hall, South Chicago. The Wanda and Chopin Choirs, under the direction of Anthony Hallek, took part in the concert.</p>
   <p>The undersigned, in the name of the Dembinski Choir, extends an old-fashioned "God Bless You," especially to Messrs. Wojtalewicz, Gorski, E. Kloskowski, and Mrs. Szularecka for their solo and duet contributions. Thanks are also extended to Miss Malolepsza for her impressive declamation; also to Mr. Wolman, and the Misses Elgodt, Siuda, and Polaczyk for their songs.</p>
   <p>Thanks are also given to the White Eagle Band for its beautiful concert arrangement of national airs. In conclusion, thanks are also extended to Mr. Pawlowski, director of the B. Dembinski Choir, whose efforts during <span class="page-break">\2</span>so limited a time developed this choir into its present state of efficiency. Thanks are also extended to the audience for its fine co-operation.</p>
   <p>The net proceeds from the concert, $24.46, were turned over to the Reverend F. Wojtalewicz.</p>
   <p>Once again I wish to take this opportunity to thank all participants for making this concert a success.</p>
