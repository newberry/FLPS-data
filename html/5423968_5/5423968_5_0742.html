   <p>We are mentioning for the second time the fact that the Poles in Chicago would like to witness on the stage a Polish opera.</p>
   <p>I judge that with the material strength we have here, we could present Moniuszkis' creations.</p>
   <p>To support us in this event we could ask Mrs. Kwasigroch, Smulska, Nering, J. Kowalska and Messrs. Kowalski, from South Chicago; Szymanski, Kondziorski, Nering and many others. Our public delights in stage shows, especially if they consist of singing.</p>
   <p>The organization of organists should confer upon this matter as soon as it is possible for them.</p>
