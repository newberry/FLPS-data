   <p>Brother Casimir Zeglen, of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, last June applied to the United States Patent Office for a patent on a bullet-proof vest he had invented.</p>
   <p>The inventor received two patents, one for a lightweight bullet-proof vest (pistol), weighing less than a pound, the other for a heavyweight bulletproof vest (rifle). The patent numbers are 577,999 and 573,000.</p>
   <p>We wish our compatriot success in marketing this invention, since we know the great value of a vest of this sort. From the demonstrations we have seen, we can safely say that the bullets rebound from the vest like beans from a wall, leaving no trace on the vest.</p>
