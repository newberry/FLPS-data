   <p>The Bridgeport Polish Day Committee, consisting of Theodore Wikaryasz, M. Wojtalewicz, Francis Bemke, Michael Wleklinski, and Nicodemus Piotrowski, held its last meeting at the home of F. Bemke on November 10, for the purpose of closing its accounts. The financial statement showed an income (from collection of contributions in the community of Bridgeport) of $699.35. Expenses totaled $608.34, leaving a balance of $91.01.</p>
   <p>The committee voted unanimously (only Wleklinski was not present) to donate this balance to the fund for a new organ at St. Mary's of Perpetual Help Church. In accordance with the decision, the committee's treasurer, M. Wojtalewicz, placed the money in the hands of the Reverend Nawrocki, pastor of the church.</p>
   <p>To all those who contributed to the success of the "Day" with money or work, the committee sends its thanks, and the old Polish "Bog Zaplac" [May God repay you].</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
