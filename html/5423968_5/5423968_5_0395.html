   <p>This fall and winter we will have many diversified pleasures within our circle. The director of the opera promises a series of beautiful presentations, likewise many new and able singers and songstresses. A series of orchestral concerts will also be held. One of the choice concerts in the heart of the Polish center in Chicago will be held next Sunday in Schoenhofen's Hall. The Polish Symphony Orchestra organized through the efforts of Messrs. Edmund Zygman and John Kapalka, will appear for the first time.</p>
   <p>This orchestra has wide plans for the future, because it does not desire to limit itself only to appearances among the Polish center, but they wish to acquaint the American Public with the creations of our composers. An intention worthy of support! To enable the organizers to bring their intentions into action, they need the support of all the Poles, who undoubtedly will comprehend the matter and will hurry in throngs to the concert next Sunday.</p>
