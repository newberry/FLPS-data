   <p>The opening of the St. Stanislaus parish hall took place last night. This hall, which is very large, is located at the new school building.</p>
   <p>The opening was celebrated with the presentation of an amateur play sponsored by the parish choir with the cooperation of the Knights of the Crown of the Polish Queen.</p>
   <p>The beautiful hall was filled to capacity. Its beauty, of which the Poles should be proud, did not pass unnoticed, and many people from the audience admired its beautiful chandeliers, the curtains, and the decorations. The Poles never before had such a beautiful hall. Its design, its large windows, its magnificent ceiling make the hall beautiful. In addition to its beauty, it has a good heating system and good ventilation. Another feature of importance is the two main stairways and four side-exits for the convenience of the public. The stage is so large that battles could be fought on it. Indeed, this is some thing to see and to admire.</p>
   
   <p>The play selected for the opening of the hall was "The Polish Insurrection of 1863," a drama which pleased the public immensely. And why not? The actors played the roles of ardent patriots face to face with the hated foes. There were victorious encounters, and loathsome scenes of Russian abuses contrasted with the Poles' lofty examples of true patriotism, true love of their country and self-sacrifice.</p>
   <p>The author of the play did not present the sad end of the insurrection because he feared that it might arouse hatreds. His purpose was to amuse the audience with scenes representing victorious encounters of the Polish patriots with the Russians, and at the same time he desired to convince the audience that the insurrection was justified because it was forced by Russian outrages. The author put great emphasis on the bravery of the insurrectors, who indeed performed heroic deeds wherever they could.</p>
   <p>Our amateurs were so deeply affected by their roles that one could perceive that they felt their actions and thoughts. Deserving special attention was the role of a patriotic Polish mother in whose bosom raged a battle between motherhood and patriotism. The mother role was played with deep emotion by Mrs. Pauline Kiolbassa, and the roles of the two daughters by Miss Lessner and Miss Zukowski. All the amateurs were emotionally affected by their roles and played splendidly.</p>
   <p>The insurrectionists were presented as great patriots and the Muscovites not only improve the acting but also make possible the acquisition of better costumes.</p>
   <p>We have noticed that sometimes the actors are handicapped by the behavior of the public, who make so much noise that the actors are forced to speak too loud if they expect to be heard, especially in a hall as large as St. Stanislaus's. Actors are also interrupted by outbursts of laughter at the wrong time. This is done by the young folks who think they know everything and like to criticize. Amateurs should send complimentary tickets to all Polish newspapers and see to it that their critics be provided with good seats.</p>
