   <p>The first concert arranged for the benefit of the Educational Department of the Polish National Alliance took place yesterday at Holy Trinity Parish Hall.</p>
   <p>The carefully prepared program pleased the audience, which showed its satisfaction by frequent applause. It is too bad that the attendance was so small, which no doubt was due to the rain that fell all evening on the dirty streets of our city.</p>
   <p>The numbers on the program were rendered by the Chopin Choir, assisted by the three talented amateur artists--Miss Large, Miss Hofler, and Miss Cady.</p>
   <p>Miss Large played Beethoven's "Sonata" and Chopin's "Nocturne" on the piano. Miss Hofler sang "Spring Song" and Dvorak's "My Mother Taught Me" very beautifully.</p>

   <p>Miss Cady, a young but very promising amateur, literally captivated the audience with her skill in playing the violin. She played a piece by Schubert, and "Polish Dance," by Szarwenko. The latter piece pleased the audience so much that Miss Cady was forced to repeat it twice.</p>
   <p>The Chopin Choir completed the program.</p>
   <p>It is worthy of note that this Choir has made a noticeable improvement under the direction of Mr. Anthony Mallek. The singing of the choir was clear and harmonious and was applauded time and again.</p>
   <p>The ladies were presented with beautiful bouquets of flowers.</p>
