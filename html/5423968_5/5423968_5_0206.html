   <p>Our popular Polish artist, better known to us as the "King of all Polish photographers". Mr. John W. Idzikowski, opened a photography school at 433 Milwaukee Avenue, here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Idzikowski's aim is that the Poles, who care for a career in this branch of art, can assure themselves of being well-tutored here for their future, when they seek better positions in the art of photography.</p>
   <p>At present there are three Polish photographers, while in other nationalities we find hundreds, as for instance we have 445 German photographers, 305 Italians, 210 French, and 150 Irish.</p>
   <p>We wish Mr. Idzikowski the best of luck and success and support his aspiration--working for the benefit of the Poles, that being his aim.</p>
