   <p>The Society of St. Cecilia gave a theatrical presentation and an entertainment in the Schoenhoffen hall last Sunday. A merry one act play was produced under the title "Jak mozna oswoic'tesciowa," "How to tame the mother-in-law." The best among the players was Miss Ciesielska who ably presented the role of a talkative and jealous wife. The rest of the amateur actors were not so sure of themselves. The entertainment was great, for which they deserve thanks.</p>
