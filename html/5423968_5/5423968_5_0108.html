   <p>We often hear that some bank has gone bankrupt. One of such recent instances we find in the bankruptcy of Lorimer's four banks. It is not surprising then that people lose confidence in banks and prefer to keep their money in mattresses, though by doing so they are subjecting their savings to the danger of fire, and to professional robbers and burglars.</p>
   <p>It appears that of all money saving institutions the most secure is that of the Building and Loan Associations. One of the oldest and largest is the King Jagiello Building and Loan Association, located at 1455-57 W. Division St., where the workingman's savings are securely invested in mortgages, which do not lose their value and bring 8% interest.</p>
