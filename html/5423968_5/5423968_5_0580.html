   <p>During the summer there are picnics, arranged by individual choirs.</p>
   <p>Every district has an annual song festival when the choirs of the different districts compete for the first prize.</p>
   <p>Every three years the best choirs of each district in the country take part in a contest to determine which is the best Polish choir in the U. S. A. The city where the next national contest is to take place is always decided upon at the last national singing contest.</p>
