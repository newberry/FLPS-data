   <p>The temporary committee of twenty-five in charge of drawing up a plan for the reception of visitors from Poland, held a meeting yesterday. The subcommittee presented the following plan, under which the Reception Committee is to operate:</p>
   <p>I. The name of the committee will be "The World's Fair Polish-American Reception Committee of Chicago".</p>
   <p>II. The duties of the Committee are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. To receive properly all Poles and Polish organizations or societies, whether from Europe or from other parts of America, arriving in Chicago for the World's Fair.</p>
   
   <p>2. To facilitate their stay in Chicago, to conduct them through the Fairgrounds, and above all to shield them against exploitation and disappointments.</p>
   <p>3. To aid them in becoming acquainted with the Polish-American community in Chicago.</p>
   <p>III. The Reception Committee will be composed of one hundred one members--all Polish-American citizens living in Chicago. The committee will be named at a mass meeting to be called for this purpose. The members of the temporary committee of twenty-five are ex-officio members of the Reception Committee, the remaining seventy-six to be appointed on their recommendation. Immediately after its installation, the Reception Committee will choose from among its members an executive committee of seven.</p>
   <p>IV. The Executive Committee will include the president, two vice-presidents, the secretary, two vice-secretaries, and a treasurer. The duty of the Executive Committee will be to attend to the details decided upon by the Reception Committee at large.</p>
   <p>V. The Reception Committee will accomplish the above-stated duties by:</p>
   <p>1. Establishing a permanent bureau of information at the Committee's headquarters.</p>
   <p>2. Appointing guides able to speak both Polish and English to conduct the visitors through the Fair grounds.</p>
   <p>3. Arranging appropriate receptions for prominent individuals and deserving societies.</p>
   <p>VI. In general, the duty of the Information Bureau will be to supply applicants with all possible information as to the city and the Fair itself. It will supply information on train rates to Chicago from any given point, on living expenses, and will suggest suitable living quarters. The Bureau will protect Polish visitors against exploitation. It will suggest sight-seeing tours through Chicago and the Fair. The Information Bureau will be located at 141-43 West Division Street. This space has been offered free of charge to the Reception Committee by Father Vincent Barzynski, manager of the Polish Publishing Company, for use as Committee's headquarters. Letters will be sent to Poles in various sections of the city asking that they let the Committee know if they would be willing to board Polish visitors. Such accommodations will be listed at the Information Bureau. Finally, the Information Bureau will recommend guides who will conduct visitors about Chicago and the Fair grounds.</p>
   <p>VII. The Executive Committee will appoint as guides individuals who are familiar with the city and who speak both the Polish and the English languages. These guides will be, above all, persons of proven integrity--persons able to meet certain qualifications required by the Committee to safeguard the welfare of World's Fair guests entrusted in their care. Besides men, women guides will also be employed. If advance notice of arrival is received, giving particulars as to time of arrival and station, the Bureau will assign guides to meet the trains on which such individuals are arriving. In such cases, the guides will wear suitable badges with Polish inscriptions, and will carry proper identification supplied them by the Executive Committee.</p>
   <p>VIII. Detailed instructions for the Bureau of Information and the guides will be prepared. The Executive Committee, in conjunction with the Reception Committee as a whole, will prepare announcements which will be sent to Poles in Poland and in America, acquainting them with the existence and purposes of the Committee. Special reference will be made in these announcements to the functions of the Bureau of Information and guides.</p>
   <p>The president of the Reception Committee, together with the chairman and secretary of the Executive Committee, will have the power to assign duties to other members of the Reception Committee as the need arises. The executive secretary will notify members when such appointments are made.</p>
   <p>None of the offices in either the Reception Committee or the Executive Committee will be remunerative.</p>
   
   <p>The official news organ of the Reception Committee will be Dziennik Chicagoski. The editors of this paper have already promised to publish free of charge all notices and announcements submitted by the Committee. All other Polish newspapers are respectfully asked for cooperation in this matter.</p>
   <p>After some debate, the above-mentioned plan was accepted at yesterday's meeting of the temporary committee, which decided to continue its activity in accordance with this plan.</p>
   <p>A mass meeting will be held at the school hall near Bradley Street, at three o'clock, April 9, for the purpose of presenting this plan to the public and to choose the remaining seventy-six members of the Reception Committee.</p>
   <p>Other matters in connection with the reception were discussed at the meeting. Among other decisions reached, it was decided to communicate with the Immigrants' House in New York and request that it instruct visitors on their way to Chicago.</p>
