   <p>The not too numerous but select audience assembled in Szulc's hall to see the comedy "Ulica had Wisla" (Street near the Vistula) was much pleased with the performance given by the young amateurs composing the Dramatic Circle of Saint Hyacinth Parish.</p>
   <p>If we consider that the members of this new Circle had never before appeared on any stage, then it must be admitted that they portrayed their various roles in an excellent manner. Of course, here and there the acting could have been better but on the whole the play was acted beautifully. One striking feature of the performance was the pure Polish spoken by the amateurs, which is a rarity among Polish-Americans.</p>
   <p>In a word, the Circle proved that it possesses very valuable amateur talent.</p>
   <p>Their excellent coaching is the work of Mr. Casimir Neuman, who deserves <span class="page-break">2</span>full credit for his disinterested work among the patriotic youth of Saint Hyacinth Parish.</p>
   <p>The Theatrical Club of Avondale has decided to help the parish in a material manner, and to study Polish literature and Polish history. We extend to them our heartiest wishes for the greatest possible success.</p>
