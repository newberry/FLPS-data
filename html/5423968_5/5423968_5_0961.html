   <p>Two short comedies were presented yesterday at the St. Hedwig Parish school hall by a local dramatic circle. The first, "Ten Thousand Marks," in two acts, was a musical farce, while the second, "Tajemnich" (The Secret), was a light comedy. Both proved enjoyable to the capacity audience.</p>
   <p>In the first play the following took part: T. Lama, S. Pawlicki, J. Naskret, T. Jablonski, A. Matza, F. Piszczek, Miss M. Pochelska, and Miss C. Lama. Those taking part in the second play were: E. Wiedeman, J. Gasikowski, Miss M. Kaminska, and Mrs. A. Wiedeman. All played like veteran artists.</p>
   <p>Laughter reigned throughout both plays and each received enthuslastic applause at its conclusion. Mr. Wiedeman demonstrated that he not only is an able organist but also a capable actor.</p>
   
   <p>The St. Hedwig Dramatic Circle and the St. Hedwig Choir should be lauded for their outstanding performances.</p>
