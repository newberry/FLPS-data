   <p>Although for quite some time we have not said anything about the work connected with the preparations for our participation in the Lwow Fair, this work is progressing very rapidly, with cash donations and exhibits coming in from everywhere. The Lwow Fair Central Committee, which has been working very energetically, will begin within a short time to ship the articles to be exhibited.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday the Lwow Fair Committee met again and settled many problems. Reverend T. Jakimowicz, who attended this meeting, furnished the Committee with all necessary information concerning the Polish churches in the United States.</p>
   <p>This valuable information, which will be used in statements, was gladly received, and the Committee thanked the informant by rising. Reverend T. Jakimowiez was made a member of the Committee.</p>

   <p>Shipping of the exhibits to the Lwow Fair was entrusted to Mr. F. Bieszez, who has already made the necessary arrangements with several transportation companies and who promised to present a statement showing the cost of transportation.</p>
   <p>A special committee for arranging the photographs and contacting the Polish businessmen in Chicago was formed.</p>
   <p>This committee, which has already begun its work, consists of Mr. W. Smulski, Dr. Casimir Midowicz, Mr. H. Nagiel, Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, and Mr. L. Szopinski.</p>
