   <p>The newly organized theatrical club staged its first performance yesterday at Walsh's Hall. The play "Stary Piechur i Syn Jego Huzar" 'The Old Infantry Soldier and His Hussar Son) was attended by a capacity crowd. The leading male roles were played by Zdziblowski, J. F.

   <p>We have learned from the program that the new theatrical club will present five plays during the winter season. The next play, to be presented at Walsh's Hall on November 20, is "The Renegade," by Laczynski. The plot of this play is based on historical events that took place during the November Insurrection of 1831.</p>
