   <p>The new building of the Polish bank, which is being constructed by Mr. Sikorski, grows like mushrooms after rain. The splendid building of this Polish financial institution will not only afford decoration to the Polish district, but will also prove the spirit and enterprise of our compatriot, Mr. J. Smulski, who through honesty and thriftiness came to such a remarkable fortune.</p>
   <p>In addition to this, all construction works of the Polish building have been confided to the Polish tradesmen.</p>
