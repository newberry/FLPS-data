   <p>Well known by her frequent appearance at the meetings called to discuss the Upper Silesian question, Miss Anne Rydlinska, an actress of Cracow, Poland, and a graduate of the Cracow Conservatory of Music, has opened a school of piano music at 1355 West Chicago Avenue. Miss Rydlinska's school is conducted according to European methods, and it teaches both classical and modern music. Special stress is laid on the use of the pedal, practice in which is completely neglected by many piano teachers. For those who wish to give to their children a musical education and at the same time to provide them with an opportunity to develop their sense of beauty and to refine and ennoble their instincts, the instruction in Miss Rydlinska's school will be an effective help. Music, it is well known, is a revitalizing and ennobling source from which we should drink generously; it soothes and diminishes our pains and worries; it strengthens the patriotic spirit; it ennobles men. Do not spare expense [in prompting] such a study, in ennobling the young generation, for it is the insurance of the future.</p>
