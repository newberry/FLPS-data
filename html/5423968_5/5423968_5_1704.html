   <p>Members and friends of the Polish Arts Club are cordially invited to attend an informal reception and tea in honor of our fellow member, Janina Burska, on Sunday June 19, at 4:00 P. M., in the Georgian room of the Drake Hotel, at North Michigan Avenue and Oak Street. A short program will precede the tea.</p>
   <p>Since it is not convenient to visit with Madam Burska, either before or after her appearances at Ravinia Park, we know you will welcome this opportunity to meet her. Because of the approaching warm weather, a suite with a northeast exposure and overlooking Lake Micigan was selected, at the Drake Hotel.</p>
   <p>We also take this opportunity to bid "bon voyage" to our members, Frank Nalbor, who is leaving for Poland to study at Cracow University and the Art school affiliated with it. (he has been awarded a Kosciuszko Foundation scholarship) and Miss Jenny Tomaszewski, who is leaving for a summer in Paris, and ports unknown.</p>
