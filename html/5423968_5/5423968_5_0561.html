   <p>National culture is the sum total of what the people of any country have accomplished in the fields of science and aesthetics during their upward climb toward the goal of spiritual perfection. Every nation has institutions which determine its continuance or its downfall, its progress or retrogression, its power or weakness, its fame or its dishonor.</p>
   <p>The first of these institutions is the government, which molds the destiny of the nation at home and abroad. The second institution is that of the church, whose representatives are the mediators between God and man. They have the power either to lead the trusting people along the right road, illuminated by the light of their own virtues, or to obscure the vision of the people by teaching them fanaticism, and permitting them to hear only the thunderous voice of the shepherd compelling them to blind submission.</p>
   <p>The third institution is that of education which, like a plow uproots the weeds of prejudice from the human mind, changing it into fertile soil bearing beautiful flowers of knowledge which absorb healthy thoughts of the world. The fourth institution is that of art. Knowledge and art supplement each other; the first enlightens the soul and the other improves it by making it more noble and beautiful.</p>
   <p>How would our temples, our buildings, and our bridges look, had they been built according to mathematical calculations only, had they not been beautified by art? This rule can also be applied to man. Even an educated man, without an artistic understanding is unable to perceive the beauties of nature; they do not appeal to him because their bright rays cannot penetrate his heart.</p>
   <p>It is when actors are capable of transmitting with fervor the thought of the author and hold the audience spellbound; when eyes are filled with tears because of some sad scene or with joy when they share the happiness of others, that love arises in the hearts of humanity for that which is good and noble. Theaters are, therefore, an important factor in the education of the masses; they are a living record of human history, and a presentation of life in plastic form. Examples of heroic deeds, historical facts and customs of the various classes when portrayed with realism, present the sad events, family celebrations, and sorrows as well as joys - all of this is expressed in dramatic art.</p>
   <p>The degree of any nation's culture is judged by the development of its art. The theater had its origin in ancient Greece. Next to the temples, the structures there, devoted to theatrical purposes, were most imposing. The theater passed through many stages of evolution before it reached its present state. A theater is like an institution of higher learning, because it enlightens the masses by presenting to them examples of that with which millions of souls are filled; and with which the whole nation is inspired. We Polish-Americans should have such institutions in Chicago. We are quite prosperous, and should therefore use every means to insure the continuation of the theater and its arts.</p>
