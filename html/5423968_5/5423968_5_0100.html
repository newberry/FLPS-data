   <p>While we are mutually urging each other with praiseworthy zeal to work for the homeland, we must not forget that this work will be more productive if the main exponents of our commerce and industry--our stores, shops, factories, and other Polish businesses--are appropriately supported and strengthened.</p>
   <p>Our merchants and our few industrialists, who, without inherited capital, have earned independent posts through their own efforts and who capably conduct their businesses to the satisfaction of all of us undoubtedly deserve the enthusiastic support of the press and of all Polish people in general.</p>
   <p>In order that this support may be effective, our Polish People must be urged to shop at Polish stores.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>For this reason, the board of directors of the third commune of Holy Trinity Parish invited many prominent Polish merchants and industrialists to meet last Sunday at the Polish National Alliance building to consider ways and means to encourage Polish patronage and in particular to discuss the matter of having a Polish fair in our district during the pre-Christmas season between December 1 and December 15.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Szymanski, president of the commune, was chairman of the meeting. After Dr. J. K. Orlowski, secretary of the commune, had presented an exhaustive study of this matter, a detailed discussion took place in which the following people took part: Commissioner Adam Majewski of the Polish National Alliance, Waclaw Perlowski, Walter Sajewski, Alexander Busch, Waclaw Graczykowski, Michael Idzikowski, Struzyinski, Hibner and J. P. Szymanski.</p>
   <p>Mr. Waclaw Perlowski, president of the Union Liberty Furniture Company, our largest furniture store, discussed the importance of this matter and the condition of Polish commerce and the fact that it can develop only through <span class="page-break">\3</span>the united support of all of our countrymen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sajewski asserted that the participation of the communes of the Polish National Alliance in this action will do a great deal toward fostering more effective support of Polish commerce.</p>
   <p>Mr. Graczykowski declared himself for united action in this matter, since this would affect the attitude of the press and would increase the confidence of the Polish people in general.</p>
   <p>Mr. Majewski suggested inviting neighboring communes to join in this action.</p>
   <p>Mr.Idzikowski lauded the efforts made in this direction by the commune in Holy Trinity Parish and expressed the conviction that the outlook of our people will change completely and that they will realize that Polish businessmen provide them with a powerful means of improving the social welfare of our people here.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>President Szymanski assured those present that the third commune would willingly offer its hand in fraternal co-operation in order to win better conditions for our commerce and industry.</p>
   <p>Mr. Busch appealed to the Polish press not to neglect this matter and advised sending a list of our firms to groups, to be read at all of the meetings.</p>
   <p>The study prepared by the board of directors was modified to incorporate the suggestions made at the meeting and the following was resolved:</p>
   <p>"The Polish merchants and industrialists meeting at the invitation of board of directors of commune three at Holy Trinity Parish on November 1, 1914, have resolved to begin energetic action in order to develop Polish business here in America, to foster initiative and a spirit of enterprise, to continue to encourage and train young people for commerce and industry, to consider business as an important factor in our economic existence in this country, and to imbue our Polish people with a sense of duty toward supporting Polish commerce <span class="page-break">\5</span>and encourage them to order and purchase all of their goods from Polish businessmen."</p>
   <p>It was then decided to form a permanent committee at once, which is to call a general meeting of all Polish merchants and industrialists for Friday November 5 at the Polish National Alliance building.</p>
   <p>The committee was comprised of the following members: Mr. Waclaw Perlowski, representing the two largest Polish furniture stores, both named the Union Liberty Furniture Company; Mr. A. T. Hibner, representing the Polonia Clothing Company; Mr. Michael Idzikowski, owner of a haberdashery; Mr. W. Sajewski, owner of a gramophone and musical instruments store; Mr. Felix Augustynowicz, head of the Ecclesiastical Goods Company; W. Graczykowski, owner of an iron foundry; Mr. Alexander Busch, owner of the largest rug and clothing dry-cleaning concern, Superb; the brothers Plucinski, men's haberdashers; the brothers Struzynski, medicinal honey and wine merchants; Mr. Michael Woitecki, jeweler; Mr. John Mlotowski, jeweler; Mr. J. P. Szymanski, electrical supplies <span class="page-break">\6</span>merchant; Mr. Adam Majewski, real estate agent; and Mr. Joseph Karpinski, leather goods merchant.</p>
   <p>This committee, together with the board of directors of the third commune, cordially invites all Polish Merchants and industrialists and all of our store owners, agents, and factory owners to come to the meeting on November 5, at 2 P. M., at the Polish National Alliance building, to take part in our joint discussions.</p>
   <p>The matter of Polish industry and commerce in this country is of vital importance. It is everyone's duty, for his own good and the benefit of all Poles, to support this matter with all his strength.</p>
