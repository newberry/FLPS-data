   <p>The Chicago Musical College arranged a public examination and concert held in the Auditorium June 18, 1901, being its 35th Anniversary.</p>
   <p>The large auditorium was filled to capacity with a select mixed crowd among them a large number of prominent Polish-American citizens from Chicago and other parts of the United States.</p>
   <p>Also present were a number of choirs representing Polish Singers Union in America, who came in order to witness this examination and the triumph of our Polish artist Mrs. Agnes Smulski, who is a member of this organization, and who received first honors after finishing her musical studies on May 25, 1901</p>
   <p>The program of the concert was varied and choice in classical selections. With nervous anxiety we awaited the appearance of our honorable countrywoman. In our breasts and hearts we felt a troubled uncertainty and restlessness.</p>
   <p>Here was a national ambition for honor at stake, among the 5,000 people, gathered there, so it was that a quiet whisper wishing success to Mrs. Smulski left the lips of our honorable daughters and sons of LECHA.</p>

   <p>Upon her appearance on the stage a great applause greeted her. Mrs. Smulski with the orchestral accompaniment sang a beautiful ballad" IL GUARANY" by GOMEZ from memory without the slightest hesitation in a beautiful and artistic voice, enraptured the hearts of the listeners, so after the completion of the song a great applause greeted our artist.</p>
   <p>Present at this concert was our Hohorable Mayor Carter H. Harrison who greeted her with well wishes. Not only did he extend these good wishes to her, but also extended congratulations to Mr. John F. Smulski and the entire family for having such wonderful talent in their midst.</p>
   <p>Director of the Conservatory Rev. Dr. H. W. Thomas presented Mrs. Smulski with a beautifully engraved gold medal set with diamonds.</p>
   <p>This medal was donated to the conservatory for this occasion by Mr. L. Leiter.</p>
   <p>At the feet of Mrs. Smulski lay eight beautiful bouquets, and a lage basket of flowers.</p>
   <p>The flowers were grouped upon the stage by Mr. JOSEPH WIECZOROWSKI, these flowers were strictly a Polish gift tendered by her many friends and well wishers.</p>
   <p>The joy we feel from the successful triumph of Mrs. Smulski in the ovation arranged in her honor -- we are in no position to estimate. This we must say, that the Polish name gained much honor to our Polish Singers Union and to all Poles in America.</p>
