   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the St. John Cantius parish gave a performance of "Genowefa" (Genevieve) yesterday, in Walsh's hall.</p>
   <p>The hall was so filled that there was a shortage of chairs, and the gallery was packed to the edges.</p>
   <p>The main role of "Genowefa" was played by Miss M. Sikorski with such feeling and understanding that many of the audience could not stop crying. The role of "Golo" was portrayed by Mr. F. Gibasiewicz excellently. "Boles" was the eleven-year-old P. Kielczynski, a pleasant, nice lad who acted well and deserved all the applause he received. Mr. J. Wasielewski, in the role of "Zygfryo," was excellent. The role of "Hengo" was played by Mr. J. Rydwelski, and he amused the audience considerably. Miss W. Hanke deserved praise and applause for her wonderful portrayal of the witch, "Dulda".</p>

   <p>The entire performance was unexpectedly successful, and the acting by all the individual players was splendid.</p>
   <p>The youthful orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Jax, gave a spirited exhibition. Yesterday's performance, which really was wonderful, proves that the young people of St. John Cantius parish are studying, and they deserve much credit.</p>
   <p>It is too bad that, during the performance, we could hear a little too much talking, in the audience, in the English language.</p>
