   <p>The St. Josephat parishioners were entertained by the school children Sunday afternoon at Hage's Hall. Songs, sketches, recitations, and declamations marked the program of entertainment. The presentation was of such a high calibre that it deserves a few words of commendation.</p>
   <p>"Tom's Practical Joke," a humorous skit, provoked the capacity crowd to laughter. It should be mentioned that this play was presented in English. A short sketch, "Leszek Bialy" (The White Leech), impressed the audience.</p>
   <p>The Polish songs, including solos, duets, and quartets, rendered by the Polish school children, brought them great acclaim. The recitations and declamations were equally good.</p>
   <p>Just before the close of the program, several Negroes appeared on the stage and <span class="page-break">2</span>entertained all with song and dance.</p>
   <p>The pastor opened and closed the event.</p>
   <p>Credit should be given to the pastor and the Sisters of Nazareth for making this program possible.</p>
