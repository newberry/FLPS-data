   <p>The subject of all conversations in Saint John Cantius Parish is the coming fair. Everybody is asking when it will begin and who will participate in it. To satisfy this curiosity, I will give here some details about the coming event.</p>
   <p>The fair is for the benefit of the Saint John Cantius Parochial School and will be opened on Saturday, September 15, at 7:30 P.M. It will last until October 7.</p>
   <p>Admission fee will be ten cents. Tickets for the duration of the fair will cost one dollar. Regular admission tickets will be sold at the gate but tickets for the duration of the fair must be obtained at the rectory.</p>
   <p>As to who will participate in the fair, I hope that all Saint Cantius parishioners and as many members from other parishes as possible, will come. Admission will be free on the opening day. The fair will be open daily, except Wednesday and Friday.</p>
