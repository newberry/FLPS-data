   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the Central Committee [in charge of arrangements for Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition of 1894] was presided over by one of its vice-presidents, Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>After the minutes of the previous meeting had been read, the secretary presented two letters, one from Erasmus Jersmanowski of New York, and the other from the New York [Lwow Exposition] committee. The letter from Mr. Jerzmanowski was received with genuine enthusiasm. Our estimable countryman informs us that he has sent a chock for five hundred dollars to Peter Kiolbassa as his contribution to the fund for Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition. This donation is All the more deserving of acknowledgment, as Mr. Jerzmanowski has already sent, 5,000 guldens [about $200] to know to help <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>cover the general exposition expenses. In his letter, he expresses his satisfaction that the Poles living in America are conscious of their relationship with their motherland and will show this by participation in the Exposition. The Central Committee decided to thank Mr. Jerzmanowski publicly for his generous offer. His donation has moved the matter of Polish-America participation is the Lwow Exposition considerably forward. Erection of a Polish-American pavilion is how a certainty.</p>
   <p>The second letter, from Adam Bautro, secretary of the New York Committee, gave a report on the Committee's activities to date and requested further information, which the secretary of the Central Committee was accordingly instructed to forward.</p>
