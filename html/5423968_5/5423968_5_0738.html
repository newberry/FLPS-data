   <p>A plea from Blue Island, Illinois, has reached the Poles in Chicago and its locality.</p>
   <p>Dear Fellow-citizens:</p>
   <p>I inform you of the fact that the parish of St. Isadore in Blue Island is arranging a concert for the benefit of a new church. This concert will be held February 3, at 7:30 in the Pyterek Hall, at Grove Street, only one block south of Western Avenue. This is the first concert that we are preparing with such great caution in order for it to be a success.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Father Pyterek is at the head of this project. This concert should not only benefit the elderly Poles, but the young Polish youth also shall benefit from it morally.</p>
