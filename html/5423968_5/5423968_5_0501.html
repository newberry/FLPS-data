   <p>Mr. Antoni Mallek of Chicago, well known for many years in the field of music published a church song book of Polish songs for two voices and the organ. This is the first series, others will follow.</p>
   <p>We hope this song book will be received gladly by the parochial schools so that Polish children will praise God in their own language. Mr. Antoni Mallek, who is a well known musician is also an organist at the Polish Holy Trinity Church, and a conductor of the Polish Singers' Union. He may be assured, that he contributed new laurels to his merits in the field of Polish songs in America.</p>
