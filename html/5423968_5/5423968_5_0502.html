   <p>The noted Polish musician Paderewski, wishing to have a great Polish attendance at his concert, made it possible for the Poles to secure tickets at the low price of fifty cents.</p>
   <p>The first concert was held Wednesday, at 2:30 P. M., in the Auditorium. The next concert of our maestro will take place Saturday, the 22nd, at the same place and time.</p>
   <p>We expect that the Polish public will not hesitate in hurrying to hear this rare treat and see this famous person. Who didn't attend Wednesday's concert, let him or her be sure to make it his business to go this Saturday.</p>
