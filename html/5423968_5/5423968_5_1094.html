   <p>"Dear Editors:</p>
   <p>"The criticism of the Polish drama "Children of Israel," which appeared in No. 48 of Gazeta Katolicka, needs a few remarks. Kindly grant me the courtesy of answering the critic in the columns of your journal.</p>
   <p>"A cool, impartial, and even sharp criticism is often necessary, but to mislead the public is destructive, and the author of the article criticizing 'Children of Israel' in Gazeta Katolicka is guilty of it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"He is indignant because Dziennik Chicagoski said that 'probably a drama as beautiful as this one has never been written for the Polish people'. Since 'probably' means, 'it seems to me' [sic], the statement does not denote a positive fact, and hence there is no reason for attacking Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>"The critic continues, 'I do not know all dramas based on the life of the common people,' and yet he criticizes. Will the critic from Gazeta Katolicka be so kind as to state whether there is another drama in Polish literature, based on the story of Joseph, written with such precision as 'Children of Israel'?</p>
   <p>"The critic may say, 'I do not know'; if so, then, why does he criticize? The critic agrees that the first act was very beautiful, and this opinion was confirmed by the public, who listened to this act with such great attention and observed it with such concentration as was never heard of before. And this may be said about the whole drama: The public, whose instruction and entertainment were the author's object, is the best critic of the work, and its judgment <span class="page-break">3</span>was favorable.</p>
   <p>"It happened that dramas written according to the standards of theatrical plays did not please the public, and on this account were dropped and never presented again.</p>
   <p>"The drama 'Children Of Israel', however, has pleased the public, and for this reason was not dropped.</p>
   <p>"'The role of the wife of Potiphar was indeed immoral', said Gazeta Katolicka. Then what kind of a role should it have been? It is a fact that Potiphar's wife was not a Christian; neither was she a Jewess. She was a pagan; therefore she spoke and behaved as such. Could the author of the drama present her differently? But the auther portrayed a profound thought in this role.</p>
   <p>"Liberalism and socialism are trying to outdo each other in condemning and <span class="page-break">4</span>befouling Christianity, and the adherents of these doctrines would rather have paganism.</p>
   <p>"The author, therefore, presented a libertine in this role for the purpose of condemning her conduct and discouraging others from imitating it.</p>
   <p>"The expression 'Pfui' used by Gazeta Katolicka is quite right, but it refers to the conduct of the wife of Potiphar, a conduct which brought cries of indignation from the public.</p>
   <p>"Perhaps the expressions used by Potiphar's wife are too coarse, but let Gazeta Katolicka furnish us with substitutes less coarse and yet equally effective.</p>
   <p>"The contrast between the villains and Joseph, in the prison, was a great <span class="page-break">5</span>success. On one side crime and yielding to human passion were depicted while on the other the law of morality and immortal Jehovah was presented. The author causes the villains to use expressions that are trivial, coarse and vulgar. Is he to blame for that? Should villains be presented as gentlemen attired in dress suits and using parlor language? The author of the drama had no desire to present such modern regues, for they did not exist in Egypt. Their expressions fit their class and the youth who heard them will avoid such words and say: 'We will not speak as the villains in the drama 'Children of Israel,' and this will be the greatest triumph of the author.</p>
   <p>"We saw that the drama pleased the public, and this is enough for the author. He guarantees that it was a moral play.</p>
   <p>"There were, however, in this drama historical, technical, and scenic defects which the author could not avoid. Why, then, didn't Gazeta Katolicka point them out?</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>"I wish to make one more remark: Taking for granted that the drama is not perfect (the author will pardon me for this remark), no one should criticize the author so severely. He is still young and diligent, and such criticism will not only discourage him but will also rob him of strength for further work.</p>
   <p>"I, however, wish him good luck in his literary work. God bless him."</p>
