   <p>We had a very pleasant time last evening at the rehearsal of the Filaret Choir.</p>
   <p>We must admit that Polish songs have not had such representation in America before. We saw grouped together the most excellently schooled Polish singers, such as it would be difficult to find in another choir.</p>
   <p>The concert, in which the Filaret Choir appears next Sunday, will be a public exhibition, and which will best give proof of the praise, expressed by us in these few words.</p>
   <p>Among the many attractions, one's attention is called to the "Song of the Shepherd" on the flute. This number fills more than one listener with emotion, reminding him of the poems of our native land.</p>
   <p>Not desiring however to prejudice our readers by rendering our judgement, which can be nothing but very praiseworthy, we advise everybody, who can take advantage <span class="page-break">2</span>of the opportunity next Sunday, to go to Atlas Hall, 32 - 34 Emma Street to hear the singing of the best Polish choir in America.</p>
   <p>Let these singers know that their efforts answer the spiritual needs in this country, where in the general pursuit for gold, the spirit grows stale and the heart cools - and for a long time we will mention with pleasure about the emotions experienced by their song.</p>
