   <p>At a meeting held yesterday afternoon, officials of the societies in Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish agreed unanimously to hold a fair for the benefit of the orphanage on Division Street. The fair will start on October 20.</p>
   <p>All Polish and Bohemian parishes are invited to co-operate, inasmuch as the orphans should be supported by all the people. We are certain that no parish, either Polish or Bohemian, will refuse to do its share.</p>
   <p>Further information concerning this fair will be given after the next meeting.</p>
