   <p>The Central administration of the Polish Singers' Alliance has adopted the constitution proposed at the General Assembly held in South Bend, Indiana, in May, 1926.</p>
   <p>For convenience and economy, the administration has included receipt forms, enough to last five years, in the books containing the constitution. These receipt forms read as follows:</p>
   <p>"Initiation and entrance fee to the Polish Singers Alliance_____</p>
   <p>Entrance and dues of the choir_____</p>
   <p>Badge_____</p>
   <p>Book_____</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>_____</p>
   <p>Secretary."</p>
   <p>These books, strongly bound with imitation leather, are small and convenient, fitting easily in a man's vest or coat pocket or a woman's purse. The price is fifteen cents each, ten books being the minimum order accepted. All orders should be sent to the general secretary.</p>
   <p>A new insignia has also been adopted by the Singers' Alliance. It is a custom-made pin--a work of art indeed. It is small and attractive--gold-plated, too. The insignia consists of a lyre superimposed on the national colors. The price is only thirty-five cents per pin. Ten pins is the minimum order accepted. Orders should be sent to M. Wyrzynski, General Secretary, 11412 So. Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
