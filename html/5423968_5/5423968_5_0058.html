   <p>Polish-Slavic real-estate agents met on April 17 at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Building and elected the following officers for their club: W. Helezer, president; J. Mazur, vice-president; J. Ruszkiewics, vice-president; M. Pociask, recording secretary; W. Skoczylas, assistant secretary; I. Laszkiewicz, financial secretary; J. Ochala, treasurer; J. Szymanski, secretary; J. Placzkiewicz, J. Kulik, A. Zuwalski, S. Jakiel, F. Skwirut, J. Nowotarski, and G. Placzkiewicz, directors.</p>
   <p>This new organization will endeavor to improve the profession and in this way get ahead of agents of other nationalities, to rouse the spirit of speculation among the Poles, and to help increase their wealth through honest means.</p>
   <p>Every real-estate agent is welcome at the club so long as he is honest and earns his living at this profession.</p>
   <p>This club is to be a sort of school for those needing experience in this field, <span class="page-break">2</span>and it would be very nice indeed if all real-estate agents would join it instead of dividing into classes.</p>
   <p>Martin Pociask, recording secretary.</p>
