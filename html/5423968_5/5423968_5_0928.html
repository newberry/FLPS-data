   <p>A beautiful variety program along Christian lines was presented Sunday evening, December 26, at the St. Hedwig Parish [hall] by the choral groups and school children. The affair marked not only the holiday season but also the name day of Reverend John Piechowski, C. R., pastor, who was showered with good wishes. The children's program was repeated last night.</p>
   <p>Songs, declamations, and acting marked the Sunday entertainment. A comedy, "In School," and a village skit, "Peasant," were presented in masterful style.</p>
   <p>Last night's program, repeated by the children, was mostly made up of piano solos, group singing, dialogues, and recitations. A short play, "The Whimsical Punished," was also given.</p>
   
   <p>Sunday's and last night's presentations were examples of the fine work the pastor is doing for the parish. Although he has been here only three years, but three hard years, Reverend Piechowski has accomplished a great deal in bringing order out of chaos, and succeeded in bringing back many of the schismatics to the true fold.</p>
