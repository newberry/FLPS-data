   <p>The Fair being held in the St. John Cantius parish is quite successful, considering the times.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday evening the St. Florian Young Men appeared en masse, representing the Holy Trinity parish. They enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>
   <p>Some of the local societies were also present.</p>
   <p>On Sunday the Fair was visited by the members of the Pulaski Court Number 482. They remained until midnight, and although not very many came, still those that did come upheld the honor of their society very nicely. One for all. They won a beautiful picture of St. John Cantius, which will decorate their meeting hall. Good humor and happiness prevailed.</p>
   <p>Also quite a few from Avondale came with their pastor, for which we wish to <span class="page-break">2</span>thank them sincerely.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday is the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish day. On Sunday a raffle will be held for a dog donated by the Reverend Father Joseph Gieburowski, pastor of St. Hyacinth parish. The dog was imported directly from Switzerland, from the hills of St. Bernard. Whoever wins it will have a good watchdog, who will only need to be fed, and not paid, which is a good idea considering the times.</p>
   <p>The donkey was won by the son of Mr. Mazur on Fry Street.</p>
   <p>The Lady Foresters are making strenuous efforts to have all the Women's Courts at the Fair next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>Those who came to the Fair in the first few days really did so at a sacrifice because the heat was terrific.</p>

   <p>Today and Thursday admission to the Fair is free for all.</p>
