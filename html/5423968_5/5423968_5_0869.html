   <p>Last Sunday, April 22, Sokol Polski No. 8 of the Alliance of Polish Falcons presented a humorous three-act comedy, entitled "Kachna, or Milosc d La Majatku" (Kathie, or Love for Money), at A. Miczkwicz's hall, 3310 South Morgan Street.</p>
   <p>The play, as a whole, came out rather well, though one could notice frightened glances in the direction of the prompter's box and lack of assurance on the part of the actors. Mr. W. Buciak, in the role of "Jan," gave the best performance of the evening. Mr. J. Hawrylewicz, in the role of "Frank," Mr. M. Hawrylewicz, as the Jew "Mosiek," Mrs. Penczek, as "Dorothy," and Mrs. S. Bauer, as "Kachna," gave adequate performances. Other roles, as those of "Stanley," "Rose," and "Jacob," were not bad. The play was followed by dancing to the tunes of Mr. Czeslawski's orchestra. Mr. Hawrylewicz, the director, deserves praise for the success of the play.</p>
