   <p>Yesterday's production of the drama "Jasnogora," in the hall of the school building at Bradley Street, should be numbered among the most successful Polish performances of the current year. Amateur actors, under the direction of the author himself, Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, made every effort to become worthy of an award of excellence, and they were completely successful. Efforts were again made to get authentic Polish and Swedish costumes which were truly magnificent. Perhaps only this could be said against them, that they were too magnificent for wartime. The financial success must have also been good, although it could have been better; besides the seats on the main floor of the hall, many seats in the balcony were also occupied.</p>
