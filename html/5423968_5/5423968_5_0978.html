   <p>The Polish Tailors' Society gave a beautiful theatrical performance the other night in Walsh's hall. It played the well-known Lubowski drama, "The Jew".</p>
   <p>The casting of the roles was excellent. Mrs. Ziolkowski portrayed the role of the Countess beautifully, with true artistic feeling. Mrs. Barszezewski was a very pleasing Helen, and Mrs. Olbinski, as usual, played her role like a real artist.</p>
   <p>The men's roles were also played in an excellent manner. Mr. Klafta as Count Adam was grand. Mr. Wojnicki, as usual, did justice to his role. Mr. W. Sikucki and Mr. J. Sikucki rounded out the performance very nicely.</p>
   <p>The audience, which was quite numerous, applauded warmly and frequently.</p>
