   <p>At the second meeting to discuss Polish commerce, held on Friday November 6, ways and means to improve Polish business conditions were discussed in detail. [Editor's note: The first meeting is reported in Dziennik Zwiazkowy, November 3, 1914.]</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph P. Szymanski, president of the Commune in Holy Trinity Parish, presided at the meeting. Representatives of thirty-six Polish firms were present at this meeting, among them Mr. Adam Majewski, commissioner of the Polish National Alliance; Mrs. Sypniewski and Mrs. Milaszewicz from the Polish women's Alliance; representatives of the press; and delegates from neighboring communes.</p>
   <p>Following President Szymanski's welcoming address, Mr. Orlowski presented the results of the previous discussion, the purpose of which was to discover a means of improving our commerce and industry and of giving immediate aid to our businessmen by arranging a fair during the pro-Christmas season.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Perlowski was of the opinion that they should first become strongly organized in order to have the means to carry out special undertakings.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alexander Busch was of the opinion that the introduction of trading stamps would encourage our countrymen to make their purchases at their own stores. In the future, these stamps would afford the best means of collecting funds for the general needs of Polish business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Mierzynski presented a detailed program for nationalizing our commerce and industry, for issuing stamps, and for joint advertising by the firms belonging to the organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karol Olszowy declared himself opposed to neighborhood fairs and in favor of action which would help all of our businessmen in Chicago. Mr. Struzynski, also, doubted that our merchants whose stores are a little farther away from the main business district would benefit by neighborhood fairs, but was in favor of forming our own permanent organization.</p>
   <p>Mr. Czechowicz declared that business does not need to be illuminated as much as it needs to be enlightened, in order to correct and improve business conditions. Mr. Paluszek declared that he wanted to see the strong new businessmen's organization undertake real work. Messrs. Magdziarz, Wronski, and Ulanowski seconded this motion enthusiastically and urged those present not to be discouraged by previous failures.</p>
   <p>Mr. Orlowski declared that the Commune in Holy Trinity Parish would rejoice at the news of the establishment of a strong organization of businessmen, which was so badly needed. He agreed that the matter of establishing such an organization was pressing.</p>
   
   <p>Adopting the motion of Mr. Waclaw Perlowski and Mr. Hibner, the representatives of Polish firms who were present, agreed to form the Polish Businessmen's Association of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Following the speeches of President Szymanski, Mrs. A. Milaszewicz, delegate of the Polish Women's Alliance, and Mr. A. Majewski, commissioner of the Polish National Alliance, these motions were passed unanimously.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Perlowski and Olszowy then moved that a temporary board of directors of the Association be appointed to conduct the work of the organization.</p>
   <p>The following persons were elected to the board: Mr. Alexander Busch, president; Mr. Karol Olszowy, vice-president; Mr. Orlowski, secretary; Mr. Joseph Magdzianrz, treasurer; and, also, Mrs. A. Milaszowicz as representative of the Polish Women's Alliance, Mr. F. Perlowski, Mr. A. Czechowicz, Mr. Michael Idzikowski, and Mr. John Jaglowski.</p>
   <p>This board of directors is to formulate a plan of action which is to be presented at the first full meeting of the merchants and industrialists, which is to be held next Friday.</p>
   <p>The board of directors will meet this coming Monday.</p>

   <p>Mr. Alexainder Busch assured those present that the temporary board of directors would at once get to work energetically to get as many Polish businessmen as possible to join the organization. He expressed his fervent thanks to Commune Three, which embraces Holy Trinity Parish, for laying the cornerstone of the great undertaking.</p>
   <p>The temporary board of directors immediately sent the following appeal to all Polish merchants and industrialists:</p>
   <p>"Countrymen! During such hard times for our homeland, when horrible battles are raging throughout the lands of former Poland, making ruins of cities, destroying factories and Polish commerce and industry, it is our sacred duty to create a strong and energetic organization of our businessmen here in the United States, in Order to assure respect for Polish national work among strangers and among ourselves, to support and encourage those who are younger and weaker, to awaken the spirit of enterprise and mutual assistance, and to get all of our country men--all Polish families--to do their purchasing at Polish stores. [Translators note: The next sentence has been destroyed].</p>
   <p>"With this patriotic thought in mind, we have decided to act for the benefit of all of our businessmen here in Chicago. Commune Three of the Polish National Alliance in Holy Trinity Parish initiated the idea and, after long deliberations on November 1 and 6, we organized the Polish Businessmen's Association of Chicago. We invite you to join our organization and co-operate with us in this work.</p>
   <p>"Therefore please come to our meeting on November 13, at 2 P. H., at the Polish National Alliance building, and try to bring your business colleagues who would like to co-operate.</p>
   <p>"When we have our own strong organization everyone will treat you with greater regard and you will be better able to meet the competition of others. You will find energetic fraternal help during slack seasons. You will be able to install the newest and most appropriate system in your business. You will help us train a new generation of young and brave businessmen and you will become pioneers of Polish commerce and industry both here and in the old country.</p>
   <p>"He who disdains co-operative work automatically deprives himself of the greatest help and the only effective support--that which a Polish merchant or industrialist can find among his own people.</p>
   <p>"Brother merchants and industrialists, join us. Come, at once, all of you, bringing with you all of your enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>"The new organization is your wall of defense, the means by which you can improve yourself, your own home, and the whole future of Polish business. It is a permanent support for Polish national work, based on our own strength and on the strength of all our people.</p>
   <p>"We expect all of you Friday at 2 P. M. at the Polish National Alliance building.</p>
   <p>"If any of you cannot come in person write to us in care of our secretary, Dr. J. K. Orlowski, 1747 West Division Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"With fraternal regards,</p>
   <p>"Alexander Busch, President</p>
   <p>"Karol Olszowy, Vice-president</p>
   <p>"J. K. Orlowski, Secretary</p>
   <p>"Joseph Mazdziarz, Treasurer</p>
   <p>"A. Milaszewicz</p>
   <p>"F. Perlowski</p>
   <p>"Michael Idzikowski</p>
   <p>"John Jaglowski</p>
   <p>"A. Czechowicz"</p>
