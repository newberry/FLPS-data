   <p>Last evening, at Walsh's Hall, a Polish band conducted by Francis Przybylski, a musician well known in Chicago, gave a concert. The performance was an excellent one, and it is a pity that more people did not come to hear it. The members of the Polish band are fine artists, and can compete with the musicians of such bands as that of Kryl and others. We expect to hear them more often. The entire performance, [as we have said,] was excellent, but the best number of the program was F. Suppe's "Light Cavalry". Unusual talent was displayed by the soloists....</p>
   <p>The Chopin Choir, under the direction of Mr. B. Rybowiak, and the Halka Ladies Choir, under the baton of Mr. B. J. Zalewski, sang very well. The concert was followed by dancing.</p>
   <p>The following notable program was performed at yesterday's concert.</p>
