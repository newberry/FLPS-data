   <p>Last Sunday, January 19, the Society of John III Sobieski celebrated the tenth anniversary of its organization. Mr. W. Pacholski, the organizer of this society, opened the celebration with an appropriate speech. Then a group of amateur players presented a comedy, "Weselena Pradnikv" (A Wedding on the Pradnik. River in Poland; also name of a suburb of Cracon): The performance was excellent. Reverend [Adolph] Nowicki and Reverend [Francis] Wojtalewicz from South Chicago were also present at this celebration. There were so many guests that Mr. Templin's hall could not accommodate them all.</p>
