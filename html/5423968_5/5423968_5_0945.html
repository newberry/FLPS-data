   <p>The Kosciusko Guard Society (under the guidance of St. Florian) of St. Michael Archangel Parish staged an interesting play "Krotki i Dlugi" (Short and Long) last night. The theme of the drama was based on the thieves of Chicago. All the amateur players were at their best.</p>
   <p>Despite inclement weather, the parish hall was filled to capacity; some had to stand.</p>
   <p>It is requested that this organization present more plays of this type in the future. They deserve a hand for their fine work.</p>
