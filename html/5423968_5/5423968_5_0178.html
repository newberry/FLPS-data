   <p>From one of our readers, Mr. John Jasinski, 782 N. Wood St., we received an interesting letter in which he informs us of an invention by one of our fellow Poles.</p>
   <p>A friend of his, Mr. Anthony Bartosz, 754 Noble Street, whom he had visited during the holidays, showed him a patent he had received from Washington, for inventing a brush apparatus to clean shoes from the snow, mud, etc.</p>
   <p>This apparatus,we believe, shall be of great help to all of our housewives when placed by the door. It will clean the shoes of every entering guest and will not soil or mar your floor.</p>
   <p>We give our heartiest congratulations to Mr. Anthony Bartosz's invention and sincerely wish him to prosper financially, and make famous the Polish nation</p>
