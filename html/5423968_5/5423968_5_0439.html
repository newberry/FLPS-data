   <p>At the time of writing, crowds of people are gathering at the home of the late Anthony Mallek, 2125 Haddon Avenue, to pay their last respects to the father of Polish song, the meritorious national worker who practically to the end of his life remained a champion and who did not let go for a moment of the ploughshare with which he plowed a hard and frequently ungrateful soil.</p>
   <p>Great preparations have been made for the funeral, which will be unusually impressive. The procession will leave the house of mourning at 10:15 A. M. and will proceed on Haddon Avenue to Division Street, passing before the Polish National Alliance building, which has been draped in mourning. The family of the late Anthony Mallek has considered the suggestion of the Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance of having the body rest for a while at the Alliance building too difficult of execution, because of lack of time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Therefore, the funeral procession will halt in front of the Alliance building, where everyone will get out of the automobiles and walk to Holy Trinity Church.</p>
   <p>The entire Board of Directors, together with the honorary vice-president and Mr. S. Litko, official representative of the censor of the Polish National Alliance, will proceed en masse to the house of mourning to witness the sad rite of transporting the body of the former secretary general and member of long standing of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The Requiem Mass will be celebrated by Reverend Casimir Sztuczko, rector of Holy Trinity Parish, where the deceased fulfilled his duties for many decades and was the spirit of the parish. Reverend Roman Marciniak and Reverend Iwaszewski will assist.</p>
   <p>The choir of the Society of Polish-Lithuanian Organists will sing during the <span class="page-break">\3</span>Mass under the direction of Mr. Alexander Karczynski, organist of St. Peter and Paul Parish.</p>
   <p>Many people from other localities have come to Chicago for the funeral, among them Reverend W. Kruszka of Milwaukee and Reverend T. Trusinski and B. Sztuczko of South Bend, Indiana. The obituary will be spoken by Reverend Casimir Sztuczko at Holy Trinity Church.</p>
   <p>The funeral rites at the cemetery will be performed by Reverend W. Zapala, rector of St. Stanislaus College, and Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, will speak in the name of the Alliance and other friends.</p>
   <p>We wish to add that during the funeral procession the offices of the Polish National Alliance will be closed and the employees will repair in a body to the church for the services, with the exception of those departments which must work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The respect with which the work and deserts of the father of Polish song are regarded by our people is attested to by the unusually large number of people from all strata of society who are taking part in the funeral.</p>
   <p>The casket will be carried from the home to Holy Trinity Church and from the Church to the hearse by John F. Smulski; John Scherman, Stanley Pliszka, Leon Wojczynski, Caesar Dluzewski, Stephen Gorecki, John [B.] Pallasch, Peter Rostenkowski, August [J.] Kowalski, and Teophile Weyna.</p>
