   <p>The two concerts given yesterday, one by Mrs. Agnes <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ering and the other by the Chopin Choir are the best indication that the Poles of Chicago have no reason to complain of a lack of excellent artistic talent among their numbers. Our artists can compete in every respect with the stars of other nationalities. We have no cause to complain.</p>
   <p>There is not the slightest doubt that Mrs. Agnes <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ering's concert and the Chopin Choir concert were successes in the full sense of the word. The audience at both concerts left the halls well satisfied with the execution of the programs.</p>
   <p>Now a few words about each of the concerts.</p>
   <p>At Mrs. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ering's concert Mrs. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ering starred supported by Mrs. Dombek and <span class="page-break">\2</span>Miss B. Dyniewicz. "The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of Song" and the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Polish compositions, were excellently read by <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. The recited with so much feeling and so well <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> soul that the stood out decidedly from the number of others who took part in the concert. Excellent direction, skillful emphasis on specific phrases, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the unusually successful shading of the three phases in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> place Miss E. Dyniewicz among first rate elocutionists. The second-best number on the program from the stand point of performance was <span class="gap">[gap]</span> from <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Butterfly," beautifully sung by Mrs. Agnes <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>"La Serenata," "Elegie," "Amore," <span class="gap">[gap]</span> song from the "Countess," <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Butterfly," and the encore, "A Girl Lived in the Village," sung by Mrs. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, received deserved recognition, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> also did the "<span class="gap">[gap]</span>" and "Evening Is High," sung by <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Bombek and Messrs. Kowalski and <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Their rendition left nothing to be <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>One of the very successful parts of the program was <span class="gap">[gap]</span> "Legend" and "Mazurek" (solo) played by Constance Arenz, a violinist who is well known to the Poles of Chicago. The piano solo by Miss Cecelia <span class="gap">[gap]</span>allek, "Polonaise, Opus <span class="gap">[gap]</span>," also deserves honorable mention.</p>
   <p>A decorative note was added to the program by Polish, Scotch, and Spanish national dances.</p>
   <p>Now a few words about the accompaniment. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> played the accompaniments as only a pianist of Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span> could be expected to play them. The success of last night's concert should, no doubt, be ascribed in a large measure to her skillful accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The Chopin Choir Concert</p>
   <p>The most important groups participating in yesterday's concert were Chopin <span class="page-break">\4</span>Choir No. 1 of the Alliance of Polish Singers, the ladies' choir <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, the Filaret Choir, and Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Symbor, violinist, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> all of the other people taking <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in the concert aid their number well.</p>
   <p>The concert was a great success in every respect. Mrs. Rose <span class="gap">[gap]</span> sang very well the solos "My Flower" by Traswel and "Once I Saw" by Kratzer. Mr. L. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>who is seeking fame as a tenor, was surer of himself yesterday in the aria from <span class="gap">[gap]</span> than at his own concert.</p>
   <p>The choir numbers also came out very well. The Chopin Choir opened the concert with "Jagiello's Frayer," and if this was a case of passing an examination over a year's work, we must <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that the choir passed it successfully.</p>
   <p>Among the choirs the Filaret Choir under the baton of Professor Rybowiak and <span class="page-break">\5</span>the Morning Star, Halka, and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> choirs gave the best performances. The Warsaw Choir's number was the weakest. However its encore number saved its reputation somewhat.</p>
   <p>Among the solo numbers one must mention Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span> beautiful piano playing and the solos of Miss W. Symbor, who accompanied by Miss <span class="gap">[gap]</span> played "Souvenir de Bate" by Leonard and "<span class="gap">[gap]</span> and <span class="gap">[gap]</span>" by <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. These numbers won much applause.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert left very pleasant memories, largely owing to the fact that one saw almost all of the choirs and singing societies on the stage and the fact that all were competing with each other to display the greatest progress made during the year.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by a very gay ball and the singers turned to dancing in spite of the gravity of these times.</p>
