   <p>The two concerts given yesterday, one by Mrs. Agnes Nering and the other by the Chopin Choir are the best indication that the Poles of Chicago have no reason to complain of a lack of excellent artistic talent among their numbers. Our artists can compete in every respect with the stars of other nationalities. We have no cause to complain.</p>
   <p>There is not the slightest doubt that Mrs. Agnes Nering's concert and the Chopin Choir concert were successes in the full sense of the word. The audience at both concerts left the halls well satisfied with the execution of the programs.</p>
   <p>Now a few words about each of the concerts.</p>
   <p>At Mrs. Nering's concert Mrs. Nering starred supported by Mrs. Dombek and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Miss B. Dyniewicz. "The Shadow of Song" and the "Snow Legend," Polish compositions, were excellently read by Miss B. Dyniewicz. The recited with so much feeling and so well expressed the aching soul that the stood out decidedly from the number of others who took part in the concert. Excellent direction, skillful emphasis on specific phrases, and the unusually successful shading of the three phases in "Shadow of a Song," place Miss E. Dyniewicz among first rate elocutionists. The second-best number on the program from the stand point of performance was Puccini's duet from "Madam Butterfly," beautifully sung by Mrs. Agnes Nering and Harriet Dombek.</p>
   <p>"La Serenata," "Elegie," "Amore," "Vissi d'Arte," Bronia's song from the "Countess," "Maiden and Butterfly," and the encore, "A Girl Lived in the Village," sung by Mrs. Nering, received deserved recognition, as also did the "Magificat" and "Evening Is High," sung by Mesdames Nering and Dombek and Messrs. Kowalski and Nering. Their rendition left nothing to be desired.</p>

   <p>One of the very successful parts of the program was Wieniawski's "Legend" and "Mazurek" (solo) played by Constance Arenz, a violinist who is well known to the Poles of Chicago. The piano solo by Miss Cecelia Mallek, "Polonaise, Opus Nine," also deserves honorable mention.</p>
   <p>A decorative note was added to the program by Polish, Scotch, and Spanish national dances.</p>
   <p>Now a few words about the accompaniment. Miss Magdalene Massman played the accompaniments as only a pianist of Miss Massman's measure could be expected to play them. The success of last night's concert should, no doubt, be ascribed in a large measure to her skillful accompaniment.</p>
   <p>The Chopin Choir Concert</p>
   <p>The most important groups participating in yesterday's concert were Chopin <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Choir No. 1 of the Alliance of Polish Singers, the ladies' choir Halka, Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, the Filaret Choir, and Miss Wanda Symbor, violinist, Although all of the other people taking part in the concert did their number well.</p>
   <p>The concert was a great success in every respect. Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch sang very well the solos "My Flower" by Traswel and "Once I Saw" by Kratzer. Mr. L. Wyszatycki, who is seeking fame as a tenor, was surer of himself yesterday in the aria from Moniuszko's "Haunted Manor" than at his own concert.</p>
   <p>The choir numbers also came out very well. The Chopin Choir opened the concert with "Jagiello's Prayer," and if this was a case of passing an examination over a year's work, we must admit that the choir passed it successfully.</p>
   <p>Among the choirs the Filaret Choir under the baton of Professor Rybowiak and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>the Morning Star, Halka, and Harmonia choirs gave the best performances. The Warsaw Choir's number was the weakest. However its encore number saved its reputation somewhat.</p>
   <p>Among the solo numbers one must mention Miss Walarie Sowka's beautiful piano playing and the solos of Miss W. Symbor, who accompanied by Miss Niedzwiecka played "Souvenir de Bate" by Leonard and "Dumka and Kolomyjka" by Wronski. These numbers won much applause.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert left very pleasant memories, largely owing to the fact that one saw almost all of the choirs and singing societies on the stage and the fact that all were competing with each other to display the greatest progress made during the year.</p>
   <p>The concert was followed by a very gay ball and the singers turned to dancing in spite of the gravity of these times.</p>
