   <p>"Thanks to your initiative, gentlemen, there is no longer any doubt that a Polish Day will be celebrated. The only question that remains is how it will be celebrated. You are now considering this question; whatever you decide will, of course, be good and proper. Although I am a newcomer here and have not as yet had a chance to become acquainted with you, I hope you will be kind enough to accept a suggestion from me. I believe, as you do, that nothing that has to do with our homeland can be of indifference to us.</p>
   <p>"When the Polish Day question was still a matter for speculation, I read in Dziennik Chicagoski the list of floats that were to embellish the parade. In this list, I noticed the absence of one float--Polish womanhood--which cannot be omitted if the allegorical panorama is to be complete. If the aim of such a parade is to emphasize the important events in a nation's history, <span class="page-break">2</span>then more so in our history than in any other do women occupy a noteworthy place. They have had this place since the very dawn of Polish history to its final hour--beyond it even, forming a glorious bridge between the past and the future. Wanda, who drowned herself in the Vistula River rather than marry a German prince [legendary]; Rzepicha [wife of Piast, first Polish ruler, also legendary], that first example of capable, hospitable Polish womanhood; Dabrowka, by whose efforts Miecislaus I accepted baptism at the hands of Bohwid and introduced Christianity into Poland[962]; Kunegunda, the saintly wife of Boleslaus, who discovered [the salt mines of] Wieliczka, the greatest deposit of its kind in the world; Jadwiga, that Lithuanian Dabrowka, who christened Lithuania and gave it and the Jagellons to Poland [1386]--what a splendid array of women! What nation can boast of its like? Later, there was Chrzanowska, whose valor exceeded that of the men at Trembowla [1675]; Teofila Zolkiewska, the hetman's widow....; finally, Emily Plater, who fought and died for liberty [insurrection of 1831]; and Mother Makryna, who by her saintly life, endeavored to appease God's anger.</p>
   <p>"And later? Later, the number of heroic women was counted by the thousands, and although there are no longer wives of kings or daughters of generals, the Polish woman arises--she is the wife of an insurrectionist, or an exile's <span class="page-break">3</span>mother--and stands guard over the nation's memories. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Polko!'] cried the poet Mickiewicz, and in truth, no longer on the sword of her husband, but on the tear-washed prayer book, she teaches her children to rand in Polish, there where one is not even allowed to think in Polish. Often she must <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to save her child for Poland and for the Catholic faith. From the villages of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> all the way to the exile camps of Siberia, she travels the bloody read with a babe at her breast, leaning upon the are of her husband, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the tears of Poland 'in her hair', as the poet says, sowing the seeds of future vengeance.</p>
   <p>"Hail to our Polish women, who have aroused everyone's admiration, and who are feared by our enemies; it was not long ago that the Iron Chancellor [Bismarck] said that Polish we anhood is the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of Polish nationalism (Polskosc).</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Let us then pay tribute to Polish womanhood on so solemn and significant an occasion as Polish Day. Would that you could share by views,gentlemen! With this fond hope, I am,</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
