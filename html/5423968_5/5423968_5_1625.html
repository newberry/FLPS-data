   <p>The mass meeting held yesterday at the school hall near <span class="gap">[gap]</span> was attended by a great many people. Besides St. Stanislaus' parishioners, there were representatives of other parishes. Father J. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> pastor of St. Hedwig's church, and Father <span class="gap">[gap]</span> pastor of St. Michael Archangel's, were present, each with a large number of parishioners. Also present were members of St. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Conception parish of South Chicago.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Father Vincent Barzynski, who named Mr. H. Magiel secretary and called upon Father Nowicki to preside. The meeting at once came to the business of naming the Reception Committee of One Hundred and One representing all Polish sections of the city. On a motion by Mr. W. Jedrzejek, it was agreed that the Temporary Committee of Twenty-five should be incorporated in the Reception Committee. Attention was called to the <span class="page-break">2</span>fact that, due to the shortage of time, not all of the Polish parishes in Chicago were represented at the meeting. It is necessary, however, that all parishes in the city be represented on the Committee. Father Vincent Barzynski, Father Nowcki, S. Szwajkart, Sczesny Zahajkiewicz, W. Jedrejek, and others talked on this subject. Finally, on a motion by Mr. Szwajkart, it was decided that twenty-five appointments on the Committee be left open, with a request that the pastors of the parishes not representes recommend candidates for these appointments. It was stipulated, however, that if such recommendations were not received within a the Reception Committee would have the right to fill in the vacancies itself to <span class="gap">[gap]</span> delay. It was decided also that six appointments be left open to provide for the representation of Poles not living within the boundaries of any specific Polish parish. After thus reserving thirty-one places on the Committee, there remained forty-five appointments to be made. Of these, the first to be appointed were representatives of those parishes that had sent delegates to the meeting. From St. Hedwig's parish, Father J. Barzynski and St. Truzyna were chosen. Father Barzynski was given the right to appoint three additional <span class="page-break">3</span>members. From St. Michael's five were chosen--Father Nowicki, and Messrs. Lenart, Szostakowski, L. Machnikowski, and I. Machnikowski. Father Nowiski was asked to choose two others. From St. Mary's of Immaculate Conception, Father Pyplatz, and Messrs. Wior, Folmer, Dudek, Koziczynski, Solski, and Wasowicz were chosen. It was generally agreed that because the parishes in South Chicago were nearer to the Fair grounds, their representation on the Reception Committee should be greater.</p>
   <p>Following these, the remainder of the Committee was chosen. The following men were appointed: F. Remerowski, A. Sowinski, Peter Okoniewski, Casimir Frycz, Vincent Wiza, Joseph Moeller, Dr. K. Midowicz, Dr. Czerniewski, Alderman Stanley Kunz, J. J. Dahlman, S. Szczech, M. Durski, S. Piotrowski, F. Murkowski, Judge [M. A.] La Buy, J. Kedziorski, F. Kaczmarek, Dr. Train, and W. Pyterek. The remaining five vacancies are to be filled by Father Vincent Barzynski.</p>
   <p>The Committee thus far is composed of sixty members, there remaining forty- one more to be appointed. Before adjournment, it was decided that the <span class="page-break">4</span>Reception Committee of 101 would meet on next Sunday, April 16, at two in the afternoon. At this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the Committee will be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> organized. It will no longer be necessary to call mass meetings on this subject in the future. During the course of the next week, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Committee of Twenty-five will carry on its preparatory work for the Reception Committee as a whole.</p>
   <p>We are pleased to add that the meeting proceeded harmoniously, which is proof of the interest with which this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> has been received.</p>
