   <p>The World's Fair in Chicago has undoubtedly had a far-reaching effect. There is scarcely a civilized nation in the world that has not taken this occasion to demonstrate its existence one way or another by participation in the Fair, by presenting lectures at the many congresses being held there, or by outside manifestations. We the Poles have shown the least signs of life; we have stayed in the background, knowing well that the duty of manifesting Polish existence and culture rests with us as representatives of an oppressed people occupied with a ceaseless struggle against its oppressors.</p>
   <p>Public opinion and the Polish press have more than once advanced the idea of participation in the Fair, or in one or more of its congresses, of which the Catholic Congress presents the best opportunity. Plans for a Polish Day, a council of Poles, Polish representation at the Catholic Congress, a memorial addressed to this body, etc. have all been mentioned in the columns of Dziennik Chicagoski from time to time, awakening our <span class="page-break">2</span>countrymen to a desire for the realization of at least a few of these projects. Today, we are pleased to say that these plans are beginning to materialize; the first step in that direction was taken yesterday.</p>
   <p>Upon the initiative of several members of our[World's Fair]Reception Committee, a group of Polish priests and public-spirited citizens gathered at the Committee's headquarters to discuss the possibilities of a Polish demonstration at the World's Fair. The Reverend Adolf Nowicki of South Chicago presided; Boleslaus Klarkowski, was secretary. The purpose of the gathering was explained by Maryanski, Szwajkart, the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, H. Nagiel, and others. Each question was taken under separate consideration. The result of their deliberations is given below in summarized form.</p>
   <p>I. Polish Participation in the Artists' Congress and the Inauguration of a Polish Art Section.</p>
   <p>The question was discussed by Mr. Zmigrodzki, of Galicia, Poland, who is a delegate to educational congresses here. He said that next week, a Congress <span class="page-break">3</span>of Artists will be held at the Memorial Art Palace, in which all nations will be represented. The Poles have an exhibit at the Fair, but they are treated rather high-handedly and at present are even threatened with losing their representation on the jury. According to Mr. Zmigrodzki, we ought to be represented at the Artists' Congress. This is an opportunity of presenting at least a short lecture on the history of our art before representatives of many nations. Mr. Zmigrodzki promised to prepare such a lecture and to arrange a place for it upon the Congress' program. He asked only that he be supplied with reproductions of the works of Grottger, Mateyko, Siemiradzki, and others. His proposition was accepted enthusiastically by the gathering and Mr. Zmigrodzki was authorized to take all necessary steps. A committee, consisting of Leon Szopinski, B. Klarkowski, and J. F. Smulski, was appointed to provide Mr. Zmigrodzki with specimens of the Polish masters' work. In connection with the lecture, H. Nagiel proposed the inauguration of a Polish art section at the World's Fair. It was decided that this be done on the same day that the lecture would be given, to serve, more or less, as a further illustration. Two speeches will be made at the inauguration: one in Polish and the other in English. Peter Kiolbassa, Dr. K. Midowicz, Judge <span class="page-break">4</span>[M. A.] La Buy, I. Machnikowski, and the Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek were appointed to the inauguration committee. The lecture and the inauguration will probably be held on Wednesday or Thursday of next week. The exact date will appear in a later issue.</p>
   <p>II. Polish Participation in the Catholic Congress and a Memorial to That Body.</p>
   <p>Discussion of this subject was taken up by the Reverends Vincent Barzynski and Adolf Nowicki. Father Barzynski explained that although the program of the Congress is arranged in such a way that it would be difficult to introduce any discussion of Polish religious questions, he thought that it would be possible to deliver at least a short address because of the religious oppression in Poland. The Archbishop will name one delegate for every thousand families in each parish. Thus, St. Stanislaus Kostka parish will be represented by five or six delegates, while the total number of Polish delegates will be from twelve to fifteen. It is possible that at least one of these delegates will find an opportunity to speak in our behalf. The gathering received with enthusiasm the news that some progress had already <span class="page-break">5</span>been made. The Polish priests of Chicago were asked to take charge of the matter, especially those priests present at the meeting: Fathers V. Barzynski, J. Barzynski, A. Nowicki, and E. Siedlaczek. In connection with active participation in the Catholic Congress, M. Maryanski proposed the preparation of a short memorial, giving a resume of the oppression of Roman Catholics in Poland. The gathering agreed that the memorial should be prepared, translated into English, and copies distributed among the delegates to the Congress. Copies are to be sent to all the newspapers in America. Preparation of the memorial was entrusted to a committee consisting of Father V. Barzynski, H. Nagiel, and M. Maryanski. The memorial will be read at the next meeting, to be held on Sunday, August 13, and upon acceptance, will be translated and printed, so that copies will be available for distribution when the congress convenes on September 4. At the same time, Mr. Maryanski informed the gathering that Dr. Pawlowski of San Francisco had sent him some very important material to be used in the memorial and at the Catholic Congress. It was decided that a letter of thanks be sent to Dr. Pawlowski and that he be included as an honorary member in the Memorial Committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>III. Polish Participation in the Legal Congress.</p>
   <p>On a motion by Mr. Zmigrodzki, it was decided that efforts should be made to present the Polish cause, which represents flagrant violations of the laws of all countries, at the Legal Congress. The matter was placed in the hands of the young lawyers M. Drzemala, J. F. Smulski, M. Kaczmarek, and N. L. Piotrowski, of Chicago, and K. Gonski, of Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>IV. Council of Poles and the Polish Day.</p>
   <p>This question was the subject of a very lively discussion. The necessity for a "Council of Poles," and its purpose, were considered in principle; the gathering reflected chiefly upon the possibility of creating a council that would not represent only one faction, but all of American Polonia. The discussion was carried on by Father Barzynski, Dr. Midowicz, H. Nagiel, and others. As a result, it was decided that a "Council" is possible only if the local organizations are willing to lend their co-operation. Since it was admitted that the "Council" can be arranged only upon private understanding, it was decided that nothing definite could be settled now, but to take <span class="page-break">7</span>the question up again at the next meeting on August 13. In the meantime the reactions of our organizations to this question will be sounded.</p>
   <p>With this, the meeting was closed. As can readily be seen, much was accomplished. We believe that the committees will perform their self-imposed duties conscientiously and that their work will achieve the intended useful results.</p>
