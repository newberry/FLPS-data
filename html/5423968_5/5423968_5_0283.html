   <p>Mr. Adam Szwajkart and Mr. Ladislaus Burda, proprietors of a Polish drugstore at the corner of Noble and Blackhawk Streets, yesterday purchased the Masonic Temple Pharmacy, one of the foremost drugstores in Chicago, in the Masonic Temple, corner of Randolph and State Streets. They have already taken possession of this place but intend to continue doing business in the old location on Noble Street also. We extend our best wishes for success in this new venture to our countrymen.</p>
