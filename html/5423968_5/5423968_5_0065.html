   <p>The contestants have trimmed their windows so tastefully and in such a grand style that they are really worth looking at.</p>
   <p>The window displays of the above-mentioned merchants deserve particular notice. It seems as though the judges will have a hard nut to crack in deciding who is to win the prizes.</p>
   <p>A contest of this type as inaugurated by Ekonomia, the organ of the Polish-American Businessmen's Association, deserves recognition, and we hope that Ekonomia will continue to arrange similar contests, as this will have a good effect on the development of our business enterprises.</p>
