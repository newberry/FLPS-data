   <p>In yesterday's issue of Dziennik Chicagoski I read an article stating that the Dramatic Circle of the St. Stanislaus Parish has been dissolved.</p>
   <p>This is a false report.</p>
   <p>There is a certain misunderstanding that will be explained on Sunday, at 4 P. M., at a meeting to which all the members of the Circle are invited.</p>
