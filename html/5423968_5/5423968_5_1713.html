   <p>The Polish Arts club and other organizations are to welcome Dr. Thaddeus Mitana, of the University of Cracow, who will lecture in Polish on "Polish Culture from the Historical Standpoint" next Sunday, February 13, at 4 P.M. at the Polish Alma Mater hall, 1643 Milwaukee Avenue, under the auspices of the Polish Arts Club and with the cooperation of the Polish Alma Mater. The public is cordially invited to attend, and urged to be prompt, as the program will start at exactly 4:P.M. Admission is free.</p>
   <p>The musical program will consist of a vocal solo by Miss Anne Czerpik, piano solo by Miss Eleanor Koskiewicz and a string quintet by George Jasinski, Zozislaw and Stanislaw Skubikowski, Frank Szadkowski and Fred Berg. After the program there will be a reception and supper in honor of Dr. Mitana who came to the University of Michigan last September from Cracow, thanks to the efforts of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of Michigan. After supper he will speak about his work at the University of Michigan and his impression of America.</p>
   <p>Dr. Mitana will be entertained by the Polish university students on Saturday evening, February 19, at 6:P.M. in the Polish Alma Mater hall. This meeting is under the auspices of the Upsilon Gamma fraternity and the organizing committee of the men's university group.</p>
   
   <p>Due to the fact that Dr. Mitana cannot arrive in Chicago until Saturday morning, it will be impossible for him to visit all the institutions he would like to see on the occasion of this, his firs visit to Chicago. However, let us hope that other Polish groups invite him again so he may spend more time among us. During his short stay he will be a guest of Mr. Edward Prebis, Vice President, North-Western Trust and Savings Bank,at the Illinois Athletic Club.</p>
