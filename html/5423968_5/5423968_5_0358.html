   <p>We will have a school of music in South Chicago headed by the Poles. We need such a school for some time. Our young people take music lessons at any second rate school, and later doubting their ability give up their instruments, for instance piano, for which the parents paid a good price. In order to serve not only Polish but also American public, our popular musician, Mr. Adam Urbanek, who is well qualified, in co-operation with a first class musician decided to establish a first class school of music under the name of Calumet School of music. The faculty will have professional musicians who will teach all instruments. Those interested in music please call at Polonia's office.</p>
