   <p>The Chopin Choir, one of the many groups of the Polish Singers' Alliance, will conduct a magnificent concert on October 2, 1910 at Walsh Hall. All lovers of choral music are cordially invited to attend this spiritual banquet. On the above-mentioned date as many as twelve choirs will be represented upon the stage. The admission fee is nominal; and, hence, it is anticipated that a large audience will attend. Immediately following the concert, a dance will be held on the premises.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>(Signed) The Committee</p>
