   <p>Last night's plays, entitled "Dzieciaki" (The Kids) and "Szkoda Wasow" (My Poor Mustache), staged by the [Polish] Dramatic Club in the hall near Bradley Street, did not draw a large audience but artistically it was excellent, which is rare, and may be said to have been a great success.</p>
   <p>In both plays all artists played in a professional manner. Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch played the role of a beautiful girl in "The Kids." She played like an accomplished artist, so well that even a first-class American or Polish stage would have been proud of her acting. Mr. [S.] Zahajkiewicz, who, as we know from other sources, is very popular among children, played the role of grandfather splendidly. Oszwalkowski, who played the role of the pleasant Lunio in "My Poor Mustache," was also a great success. All amateurs played excellently. Mr. Zahajkiewicz portrayed characteristically the humorous Anzelm. Czekala, as the comical Orgon, was so funny that he could make a dead man laugh. P. J. Kedzierski played the role of Erast admirably. It should be added that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Miss R. Zukowski, who had the role of Dorothy, and Miss W. Chlebowski, who had the role of Emilia, played their parts as usual--exquisitely. The singing was splendid.</p>
   <p>It is a pity, we repeat once more, that such a small audience saw a performance which was such a success.</p>
