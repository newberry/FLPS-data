   <p>The Polish bank located at Milwaukee and Haddon Avenues is the only financial institution in America that is under the control of the Poles, and celebrates today the first anniversary of its establishment. The entire bank is decorated with colorful wreathes, national flags, that of Poland and America.</p>
   <p>The bank personnel adorned the offices of the president and cashier with floral pieces.</p>
   <p>A heap of congratulatory notes were received from eminent Poles and people of other nationalities, with wishes for a most successful future.</p>
   <p>We must state that this "Polish bank" has budded into one of the finest establishments of its kind, and may be compared with any other bank here in Chicago.</p>

   <p>It has a capital of over a million and a quarter dollars. It renders a great service for the Poles in Chicago, also to American Polonia. So then, on this great occasion, we wish the Polish bank and Mr. J. Smulski, president; T. Helinski, cashier; and A. Przybysz, the old Polish saying, "God Bless You!"</p>
   <p>Let this Polish bank live, grow and bud for the good of the Polonia in America.</p>
