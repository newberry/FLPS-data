   <p>Last Sunday evening, Division 18 of the Polish Youth Society presented the play, "Tajemnica Chaty Wiejskiej" (Mystery of the Peasant Cottage) at the J. Slonacki Hall. The play is a three-act musical comedy based on peasant life. The play as a whole was well acted, and among the leading roles the following deserve special mention: Miss Regina Olkiewicz as Kasia, Mrs. P. Lesniewicz as Brzakalina, Mr. Joseph Wrobel as Brzakala, and Mr. Bogulski as the organist. Those having minor roles also performed their parts well. The play drew a large audience which filled the hall, thereby assuring the Society of a financial success for their efforts.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Wroclawski's orchestra supplied the music for the play, and Mr. Anthony Dobrzanski not only directed the play but also supplied the costumes for it.</p>
