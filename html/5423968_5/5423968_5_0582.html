   <p>Scattered all over the world on account of losing their independence, the Poles preserved their soul and nationality through their speech and song. Speech and song, besides the love for their beloved native land, kept up their Polish spirit.</p>
   <p>Together with the Pole in his wandering through foreign lands went his wonderful, soul-soothing native song. Today the Polish song soars under the Polish sky, full of majesty and strength, praising the Polish patriotism, which is the foundation of a new and resurrected Poland.</p>
   <p>Therefore, whoever cherished the Polish song through the years of bondage was a high priest in the temple of love for his motherland, carrying the banner of Poland before his nation, and placing a stone in the foundation of the mighty structure of Polish republic. For the Polish song was uniting not only their voices, but also their hearts. It was uniting them together with the invisible cement of devotion and sacrifice, on the altar of love for their mother country.</p>
   <p>The history of the Polish Singers' Alliance in America dates back to the year of 1888, when the life of our Polish organizations was in its infancy. There are some people who still remember those times. Its narrative ought to serve our younger generation as an example. The Polish Singers' Alliance in America passed through all kinds of experiences. As elsewhere, so in here were people of ill will who tried to wreck the Alliance. In spite of that the Alliance did not cancel any of its programs, but went right through with them; grew in number and gained the respect of the whole Polish community in America.</p>
   <p>It would be almost impossible to write a detailed history of the Polish Singers' Alliance in America, not only on account of the frequent movings of its headquarters, but also because some of its records, including very important documents between the years of 1889-1913, were lost.</p>
   
   <p>In 1897, during its VIII convention in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Alliance split in two. This lasted till 1903. During that time two organs, Ziarno and Harmonia, were published. In 1913 the XVIII convention was held. Before that convention, the secretary of the Alliance was fortunate in securing the records of the Alliance from 1889 to 1913, from which he copied the most important events. Those notations were published in the first history of Polish singers in America.</p>
   <p>In 1924 this history was reprinted on account of the Alliance's 35th anniversary. In 1919 the Alliance almost ceased to exist and all records were lost.</p>
   <p>The cradle of the Polish Singers' Alliance in America was undoubtedly the Holy Trinity Parish. Mr. Anthony Mallek was the real founder of the organization, and for many years he was its leader. Father D. Majer of St. Paul, Minn., was another great contributor towards its success. He assisted by personal agitation and also by making letters. Honor to him.</p>
   
   <p>The first meeting took place on the fourth day of December, 1888. Thanks to Father D. Majer's advice, and Mr. Mallek's motion, it was decided to organize all Polish singers and choirs into one organization: "Zwiazer Spiewakow Polskich w Ameryce," (The Polish Singers' Alliance in America).</p>
   <p>The following choirs joined the Alliance and became the original founders of the organization: "Chor Chopina" No. 1 of Chicago, from the Holy Trinity Parish; "Chor Chopina" No. 2, from Milwaukee, Wis.; and "Chor Harmonia," from La Salle, Illinois, as number 3. Other Polish organizations refused to cooperate with the Polish Singers' Alliance in America, thinking that the singers' organization was harmful to them.</p>
   <p>In 1889 a first convention of Polish singers took place in Chicago, and at that convention many important resolutions were adopted; a statement was published in newspapers that the Singers' Alliance was not organized for the purpose of harming the Polish National Alliance, but on the contrary, for its benefit.</p>
   
   <p>For, through the song the Polish spirit is awakened. At that convention a new management was elected and as all its members were from Milwaukee, Wis., with the exception of the head leader, the headquarters were moved to that city.</p>
   <p>In 1890 the next convention took place in Milwaukee, Wis. At that convention it was decided that Ziarno, (The Seed), would be the official organ of the singers. There were about one hundred compositions in the Alliance's library. At that time there was about $200 in the treasury of the Alliance. In 1890 the choir "Lutnia," from Grand Rapids, Michigan, was admitted into the Alliance as a member.</p>
   <p>The III convention took place in Chicago, 1891. At that time there was $400 worth of musical compositions in the library. The IV convention was held in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1892. At that convention it was decided that each choir should buy its own choir music. Five choirs were represented at that convention. On the 9th of March, 1893, the "Wanda," a Chicago choir, joined the Alliance as a member No. 9, and on the 22nd of March, the choir "Harmonia" followed. The choir "Moniuszko" left the Alliance in 1893.</p>
   <p>In 1893 the V convention was called to Chicago, in which eight choirs participated. In 1893 a new choir, "Antoni Kontski," from St. Paul, joined the organization as choir No. 11.</p>
   <p>On the 31st day of December, 1894, it was decided to incorporate the organization under the state laws and secure a charter. On the 28th of April, 1894, the choir "Moniuszko" rejoined the Alliance, and on the 8th of September, the choir "Halka" joined the organization.</p>
   <p>The VI convention was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1896. It was a very poor year and only five choirs were present. The Alliance had then 194 members and $219.70 in the treasury. The sheet music in the library represented a value of $394.25. It was decided to hold conventions every two years. The VII convention was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the 7th of September, 1897. It was one of the best conventions. There were eleven choirs and thirty delegates. At that time the choir "Kalina" joined the Alliance, increasing the membership to 264 members. There was $2,819 in the treasury. Mr. Boleslaw Dembinski was made honorary member of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>From 1898 to 1904 the Alliance grew continuously. The year of 1898 was a sad one, for in that year the convention, held in Grand Rapids, Michigan, elected a new management, and the headquarters were moved to Chicago. Some of the members were opposed to this and held another convention in Milwaukee, Wis., invalidating by that the one held in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>
   <p>This split the Polish Singers' Alliance in America in two, causing a very unpleasant situation and much antagonism among members. This condition lasted four years, that is, till 1902, when an arbitration committee was selected, and in 1903 a general convention was held in Milwaukee, Wis., at which 96 delegates and 27 choirs took part. All delegates advocated a union for both alliances. This was an important moment in the history of "Polonia" in America.</p>
   
   <p>At that time Dr. Wagner was made the president and the Milwaukee Alliance had then ten choirs or 352 members and $1,334.33 in its treasury. The Buffalo Alliance had twenty-one choirs or 582 members and $1,398.52 in cash. Milwaukee was chosen as the headquarters for the reunited alliance.</p>
   <p>The city of New York was selected for the XV convention which took place in 1905, and was represented by 58 delegates. At that convention the organization decided to join the Polish National Alliance and the headquarters were moved to Buffalo, N. Y.</p>
   <p>The years of 1906 to 1909 passed quietly. In 1910, the XVII convention was held at Baltimore, Md., at which a new management was elected. This convention not only exhausted all the funds but also produced a deficit of almost $1,000</p>
   <p>Within three years the debt was paid and there was over $3,000 in the treasury. At that time there were 62 choirs and over 3,000 members. On the 4th day of October, 1912, the first number of Harmonia, the official organ of the Alliance, appeared. In 1914 the Harmonia was discontinued. In 1915 things went wrong and the management of the Alliance became neglectful. From 1913 to 1918 most of the choirs left the Alliance. There was a period of stagnation and the organization almost ceased to exist. Another separate organization on of singers in New York was formed but its influence embraced only the eastern states. All this was caused by the negligence of the management. It was found that the $3,000 donated by the Polish National Alliance, had not been used for the purpose for which it had been appropriated. With the $4,000 received from the Polish National Alliance, the management paid off the debts and bought a large supply of first class sheet music, from Poland. The membership reached to 3,115. This did not please some individuals who caused much misunderstanding among the members and within the management. The XVIII convention was rather political. At that convention fourteen delegates had false mandates and twelve delegates had no mandates at all. They even voted lack of confidence for the president of the Alliance, E. Szydlowski.</p>
   
   <p>After that convention the New York choirs held a meeting declaring the XVIII convention invalid. They decided not to send the funds to the headquarters and gave a vote of confidence to president Szydlowki. This was followed by a regular mud-throwing in the newspaper articles and lasted till 1928. The New York alliance had twenty-two choirs and the old alliance only one.</p>
   <p>THE SILVER JUBILEE</p>
   <p>In October, 1914, the Alliance held a silver jubilee in Cleveland, Ohio. That jubilee was a success.</p>
   <p>The XIX congress was conducted in Pittsburgh, Pa., in the year of 1916. The management became neglectful again. In 1917 the Alliance gave a concert in Pittsburgh, Pa., for the benefit of poor children in Poland.</p>
   <p>At that time many of our members were joining the Polish army and the membership began to fall.</p>
   
   <p>The 1919 convention was held in Chicago. A new and energetic management was elected and the Alliance showed some activity. The constitution was respected, many choirs which formerly left the Alliance returned, and a number of children's choirs were formed.</p>
   <p>The XXI convention took place in Detroit, Michigan, in 1923, and was the most successful in the history of the Alliance, for many choirs took active part in it and the Detroit "Polonia" welcomed and entertained them in a Polish fashion. This convention was very imposing. A magnificent concert was held in Orchestra Hall, at which, besides the choirs, also solos and instrumental music was performed by popular artists. The concert was a success and brought $1,460.34 of clear profit. This convention, however, did not pass peacefully; for a contest was held which caused dissatisfaction and later on all Detroit choirs left the Alliance, and Mr. C. Zalewski, the leader, resigned.</p>
   <p>In 1924 the management of the Alliance, in commemoration of its 35th anniversary, held a concert in Chicago Orchestra Hall. This concert was a failure and caused a $2,000 deficit. The deficit was covered by other concerts and donations.</p>
   <p>In May, 1926, the XXII general convention of the Polish Singers' Alliance in America was held at South Bend. Ind., in which 108 delegates representing 42 choirs took part. This convention was disappointing because the auditorium was empty, and financially it was a failure. The newly elected management was neglecting its duties again. There was also a shortage of $600 in the treasury. Some of the officials resigned and one official and the cashier were suspended. Before the convention assembled the Alliance bought 1,000 Polish song books in Poland for $742. Also three months before that convention the Alliance started a publication, Gora Piesn, which was discontinued the next year due to negligence. There was an attempt to unite the New York choirs with the Alliance.</p>
   
   <p>Right after the XXII convention, an opera play, "Dzwony Kornewilskie," was performed three times, and that brought a deficit of $2,000, which in turn caused great consternation among the officials. But another play covered it.</p>
   <p>THE XXIV CONVENTION</p>
   <p>This convention took place at Cleveland, Ohio, in May, 1929. There were 81 delegates, representing 37 choirs.</p>
   <p>The most important moment of this convention was the reconciliation of the New York and Eastern choirs with the old Alliance. The concert, which was held in the Music Hall, was a great success. A new management was elected which worked energetically, and a new publication called Przeglad Spiewaczy was established, but only six numbers were issued.</p>
   <p>Gradually bad times came and there was a general stagnation, the choirs did not pay their dues and all cash assets had been frozen in the closed banks. The wealth of the Alliance, $14,000, was lost.</p>
   <p>During the Chicago World Fair all Chicago choirs, including church choirs, combined and sang on the Polish Day program. In spite of the depression, the Polish Singers' Alliance in America continues its work.</p>
   <p>Short is the history of the Polish Singers' Alliance in America. There is nothing heroic or legendary about it, but its pages show very plainly that our Alliance fulfilled its duties towards our community.</p>
