   <p>A big picnic and summer concert will be given by the singers of Chicago, who combined with many other societies are aiding the Polish national singers' choirs in Chicago to make this picnic a huge success.</p>
   <p>The following choirs pledged their assistance: Chopin choir, Moniuszko, Paderewski, Halki, Polish Echo, Polish Lyric and Zelinski's. The picnic will take place Sunday, June 30, in Louisenheim Park.</p>
   <p>With the aid and assistance of all these well known choirs, this picnic promises to be one of the best and most successful ones undertaken this year. All the Polish businessmen are asked to sell tickets for this affair and donate, if possible, gifts and prizes which in turn are to be awarded to the winner of the various games and races on the program.</p>
   <p>Young couples are cordially invited to attend. Dance music will be furnished by a well known orchestra, and there will be Polish and English selections.</p>
   <p>The committee feels sure that all the Polish people in Chicago will attend. We take this opportunity to thank you in advance.</p>
