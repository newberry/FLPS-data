   <p>The Polish stage at Pulaski Hall was officially opened yesterday with the presentation of "Kosciusko at Raclawice." The hall was filled to capacity and the performance was highly satisfactory. The part of "Kosciusko" was played very well by Casimir Zychlinski. The performances of J. F. Smulski and Mr. Rzeszotarski, both from our section of the city, were also excellent.</p>
   <p>As a whole, the performance was a successful one. The new decorations in the hall improve its appearance, and the new stage is a good one.</p>
