   <p>What would be the result and benefit to our nationality if all Poles put their money in savings and checking accounts in Polish state banks exclusively?</p>
   <p>The answer to this question is very clear and understandable. We would show our national maturity and solidarity. We would greatly increase Polish commerce and industry, which would give employment in Polish enterprises to thousands of our countrymen. Workers would be treated better when they were employed by Polish enterprises instead of strangers. We would be respected by strangers as a wise and wealthy nation. Polish banks would employ not tens, but hundreds, of young Polish men and women showing aptitude in this field. The young people, having succeeded in Polish enterprises would take important places in enterprises of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>The Polish state banks of Messrs. J. F. Smulski and B. Zaleski are under the <span class="page-break">2</span>supervision of the state government and are much stronger and safer than those of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>It is time, countrymen, that we got up by our own strength and supported our own instead of foreign institutions, as all other intelligent nations do.</p>
   <p>We can perform miracles, but we must immediately, without delay, get to work and start action among the masses so that Polish money will flow into Polish enterprises exclusively.</p>
