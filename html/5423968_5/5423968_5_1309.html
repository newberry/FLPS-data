   <p>After one hundred years of hard bondage, our countrymen in Europe are holding a general exposition in Lwow during the year of Kosciusko, for the purpose of reminding Europe that the Polish nation is not yet dead,that it still lives, that it works and develops properly, that it advances together with other nations in civilization, industry, education, thereby endeavoring to regain its freedom and independence.</p>
   <p>Nearly the entire nation is participating in the Exposition. Almost all her children--in the old country and abroad--are taking part in the Lwow Exposition, in order to show their achievements. Only those Poles who live in that part of Poland which is dominated by the Russian Czar--who looks with envious eye at this peaceful manifestation of the nation at this exhibition of Polish art and industry--cannot participate for fear of being exiled to Siberia.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>And we, whom fate has cast on a foreign but free land, have been also invited to participate. We have accepted this invitation because we desire to show the result of our tedious ant-like work in every field; to prove that we love Poland and are united with her in fortune and misfortune despite the great distance which separates us.</p>
   <p>In order to present our Polish-American life fully and completely, without scattering our exhibits throughout all the buildings of the Exhibition, we have erected our own pavilion under the American and the Polish colors. This Polish-American pavilion was built by public generosity. That our pavilion has made a good impression upon our countrymen in Europe can be seen by the complimentary articles which have appeared in leading Polish newspapers of Europe. Let us quote, for example, Przeglad Emigracyjny (Emigration Review):</p>
   <p>"We wish to state emphatically and publicly that the Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition is a great attraction; it is always so crowded that it is impossible to see all the exhibits. This pavilion creates admiration and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>enthusiasm; it changes our opinion about the activities of our Polish emigration to America and arouses patriotism".</p>
   <p>In Nowa Reforma (New Reform), published in Crakow, we read: "The Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition depicts the life and work of our countrymen across the seas, and fills us with pride, for it seems to say--'We are Poles and we feel like Poles.'</p>
   <p>Dziennik Poznanski (Posen Daily comments as follows:</p>
   <p>"Ninety per cent of the exhibitors at the Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition belong to the working class; they are farmers and tradesmen who emigrated from Poland and settled in America. These people have learned their trades by hard work and perseverance and, on account of their good qualities and patriotic spirit, they have gained the respect of their American fellow citizens.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"From the impressions received at the pavilion of our countrymen in America, one is the most striking and dominating--it is their great attachment to the Polish language and literature and, above all, which is very strange in materialistic America, their loyalty to the Catholic Church and to the faith of our fathers. For us this is solving the riddle of preserving the Polish spirit in America. It also answers the question why the Polish emigration to that country has not been drowned in the sea of other foreign elements; why, on the contrary, it has grown to large proportions, for there are more than one million Poles in America now--which is very encouraging. Therefore, we extend our cordial greeting to our countrymen across the ocean and wish to encourage them on this path, at the end of which is written 'By this sign you will conquer.'</p>
   <p>In Gazeta Narodowa (National Gazette) we read:</p>
   <p>"....Our countrymen from across the ocean are giving us a living proof of how ardently they feel, think, and work for their native land, which has not ceased to be and will always be their motherland. They hasten and contribute gladly <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>toward this monument, which will remind the world that we still exist. As soon as they heard about the proposed Exposition in Lwow, they organized a committee in Chicago and began a very active agitation for collecting exhibits for the Exposition. They financed and built their own pavilion in the style of an American villa. In this villa, Polish-American life is depicted. The exhibits which adorn the interior of the Polish-American pavilion depict very vividly the achievements of American Polonia, and this work is so much more important because it is directed by a national spirit. Here we see industry, art, education, agriculture, domestic science, journalism--also a panorama of the life and thoughts of our countrymen in America".</p>
   <p>Przeglad Lwowski (Lwow Review) comments as follows:</p>
   <p>"....The life of our compatriots in foreign countries is illustrated by the Polish-American pavilion at the National Exhibition. Our compatriots see our motherland divided, in bondage, even oppressed by two governments [Russia and Prussia]. Therefore, our compatriots work more energetically because the future <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of Poland depends on work and prosperity. Moreover, by work we can obliterate the faults of the past. This feeling is manifested through very numerous associations--so numerous that anything like it is unknown in any other country--all of which are filled with a patriotic spirit. "There are many religious societies over there, and most of the civic organizations have a religious character, for religion and the Poles are inseparable; besides, the attachment to religion is intensified in foreign countries. Should we be astonished because our emigrants are united in organizations and associations? In our country we constitute one family, but far away from home among strangers, it is necessary for people of one language and one nationality to pull together."</p>
   <p>The foregoing quotations indicate that our compatriots in the old country appreciate our work and achievements in our adopted country. By taking active part in the Lwow Exposition, we have contradicted many ridiculous assertions as to our "helplessness" and "incompetence". We have proved to our compatriots that we are not as bad as some unfriendly newspapers describe us. In this respect, our pavilion has accomplished a great deal. We have attracted the attention <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>of even Berlin and Saint Petersburg. Our enemies have been impressed by the great number of our societies, as could be seen by Russian and German spies on the photographs exhibited at the pavilion.</p>
   <p>They have seen at our pavilion what a free people can do when freed from the iron heel of a tyrant. Our quite organizations work has made an impression even on our enemies. Thus, we have accomplished our purpose through our pavilion. Primarily, we have given proof of our unity and solidarity with our native country; secondarily we have proved that we are Poles and are willing to remain so in this foreign country.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the erection of the pavilion, arrangement of the exhibits, as well as the maintenance and transportation of exhibits to Lwow, have given rise to an expense which the Committee has tried to cover from voluntary donations. The expense, if compared with the great benefit derived from the pavilion, is imperceptible.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>Up to the present time Mr. Bardonski, cashier of the Committee of the Lwow Exposition has received $3,066.90, which together, with $100 sent, by the Polish Roman Catholic Union makes a total of $3,166.90.</p>
   <p>The expenses are as follows: Professor Dunikowski, for pavilion, $2,100; telegrams, $12.96; salary of the manager of the pavilion, 7 months at $50 a month, $350; traveling to and from Lwow, $150; telegrams to Mr. Szwajkat, $5.36; picture frames, $47.60; flags and banners, $54.30; transportation, $54.28; hardware for doors and windows, $15.12; printing and binding of newspapers, $71; packing of exhibits, $67.95; arranging of the pavilion, $200; printing of circulars, $19.75; cashing of checks and miscellaneous expenses, 24. Total $3,172.32. There is a deficit in the treasury of $5.42, that is, $3,166.90-$3,172.32. The following items have not been paid: Transportation to Lwow, $300; plans for the pavilion, $100; circulars, $21; miscellaneous, $46.88; location for pavilion, $168; insurance, $40; attendance, $80; packing and re-shipping to Chicago, $220; carpenter, $80; balance for the pavilion, $380; unpaid <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>The foregoing statement shows that we are about $1,600 short. We should get about $300 for the pavilion. The indebtedness, then would be $1,300. American Polonia would disgrace itself were it not to collect this small sum. We would simply discredit ourselves in the eyes of our compatriots. We should not allow this to happen under any circumstances. We are convinced that this will never happen, that there are among us patriotic societies and clergymen who will come to the rescue and donate the necessary amount despite hard times. We dare not appeal to those who have already contributed toward the Exposition, but we do appeal with confidence to all patriotic people, societies, and clergymen who have not as yet contributed anything toward it. Our participation in the Lwow Exposition is not a personal or private matter. This is a public matter, and our people as a whole should feel that it is their duty to support this noble cause by donations.</p>
   <p>You have read already, dear countrymen, that our pavilion at the Lwow Exposition is a great attraction, that it is always crowded, and that our countrymen <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>are greatly interested in every exhibit. We have been greatly praised for our participation in the Exposition. Therefore, we appeal once more to the generosity of the Polish public in America for contributions to cover the expenses of this noble undertaking. We need funds because the Exposition will close this month and all obligations must be paid before it closes.</p>
   <p>We do not go into bankruptcy by donating a small sum of money to save us from discredit in the eyes of our countrymen in Lwow. We can not allow our exhibits to be sold at auction for debts. We should not come to this extremity. Our honor will not allow it. In behalf of this honor, we appeal to all Poles to do their patriotic duty by contributing toward the Polish pavilion. It is urgent. Bills are waiting.</p>
   <p>In view of this unpleasant situation, the Committee decided at its last meeting to appeal to the generosity of the public. In order to give the example, the members of the Committee have made a special collection, and some of them <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>Many parishes, societies, organizations, and wealthy individuals have not contributed anything toward the pavilion so far. Now is their turn. The pavilion represents our entire American Polonia in Lwow; it brings us credit, and therefore we all should support it.</p>
   <p>All donations should be sent to B. Klarkowski, financial secretary, 42 Bradley Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Hoping that our appeal will not pass unheeded by our countrymen, clergymen, societies, and organizations, we remain</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Central Committee:</p>
   <p>Ladislaus Smulski, Reverend Vincent Barzynski</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, S.F.A. Satalecki,</p>
   <p>Reverend A. Nowicki, Anthony Groenwald, <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>Victor Bardonski, Francis H. Jablonski, Stanislaus Szwajkart, Boleslaus Clarkowski, Stanislaus Slominski, S. Zahajkiewicz, Henry Nagiel, Leon Szopinski, John F. Smulski, Max Drzemala.</p>
   <p>Societies belonging to the Polish National Alliance can send their donations to Michael Majewski, cashier of the organization, 779 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago.</p>
