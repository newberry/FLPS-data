   <p>At a meeting of representatives of national societies, held a few days ago in the central office of the Polish National Alliance, the proposal to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Thaddeus Kosciusko was thoroughly discussed. It was decided to arrange a celebration either on Wednesday, February 12, or on the following Sunday, and to precede the celebration with a grand parade, and if possible, to conclude it with a ball.</p>
   <p>It was decided that all of the societies that take part in the celebration are to be assessed twenty-five cents per member for the erection of a monument in honor of Kosciusko, with the stipulation that the committee begin to build the monument this year. Mr. Adam Majewski, Mr. Pulkowski, and Mr. Moszczynski were selected as a committee to confer with the committee in charge of the monument, and to prepare appropriate resolutions.</p>
