   <p>Despite the rainy and stormy weather a large crowd was on hand to see the presentation of "Eve Miaskowska" at the Aurora Turner Hall, Milwaukee Avenue and Huron Street, last night by the St. Gregory Chorus's amateur players. All the roles were enacted to perfection, the outstanding performance being rendered by J. Wasilewski. On the whole the play was a success. The members of St. John Cautius' parish left hoping to see another play.</p>
