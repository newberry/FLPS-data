   <p>Convention of the White Eagle Business Mens Assn. The White Eagle Polish Business Men's Association will meet at a convention in the Town of Lake Villa early in May. The time for the convention is almost here, and we are sure everyone is mystified as to why so little publicity is given, either to the members or the community. At a convention of this kind, it is possible to bring about reforms and new projects that should be carefully discussed and acted upon. We have on numerous occasions written a great deal about our businessmen's organizations.</p>
   <p>The readers of this daily paper, therefore, know also that to the present time,none of these have been realized. This fact is due to a great deal of talk and no action. This organization at the present time is made up of four groups; the oldest, of which is in the Jadwigowo community and is about five or six years old, with a membership of about 100.</p>
   <p>A program of activities is very plainly and definitely outlined in the constitution which varies but little from the average benevolent organization. They meet 12 times a year, about one-fourth of the members are usually present; they also have one banquet each year.</p>

   <p>The South Chicago group has always been the most active, but at the present time they are reneging. This group has ventured into the cooperative field, and bought a large quanity of goods. They later, established a wholesale business which was a failure. At present dissensions are dominant among its members, due to a misunderstanding arising out of the proposed projects which were intended to be farsighted, and profitable to the organization. It is now evident that a new organization, not related to the White Eagle Polish Businessmens Assn. is about to be formed. This is a sad state of affairs.</p>
   <p>The third group of the White Eagle Polish Business Mens Association, exists in the Town of Lake Villa, and has a membership of about 40. This group appears to be dormant. This same group, however, proved enough initiative to suggest that the Polish Business Men use trading stamps. These were printed a a cost of $100; and were to be used by all members; nevertheless, they are not being used, and are at present, deteriorating in the storeroom of one of the members.</p>
   <p>The newest organization is group number four of the Holy Trinity Parish community. This group seems to be the most active, and from all appearances holds the most promising future. They have a membership of nearly 50. Among these are educated men-well educated men, men that understand business-organization.</p>

   <p>The officers of this organization are recruited from two groups, namely, from Jadwigowo and from South Chicago. It may be possible, with a new membership, bring about reforms that will make for greater progress.</p>
   <p>The constitution of the organization, as far as I could ascertain from the members, is not very favorably received. It is not flexible enough, and too cramping. There is no doubt that energetic understanding men, could do things in a big way, but not existing conditions; radical changes will have to be made.</p>
   <p>We have one more organization, not mentioned above, this one, too, seems to lie dormant. It is located in St. Adalbert's Community. They too, should be invited to the convention, and through the united efforts of all members, something can be done for the benefit of the Polish Businessmen's Organization. Our best wishes to them, for the benefit of all Poles concerned.</p>
