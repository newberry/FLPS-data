   <p>The directors of the Z. N. P. Library are endeavoring to raise funds to purchase new books. After a heated argument at the last meetings the directors agreed to present a play at the Holy Trinity Hall, April 21. This beautiful drama entitled, "Star of Siberia," was directed by Mr. L. Starzenski.</p>
   <p>Well known Polish dramatic artists will take part in this play. We have great hopes that the Polish public will support this movement which is being done for our own benefit.</p>
   <p>The committee is taking this opportunity to ask all Polish societies on the northwest, west and southwest sections of Chicago not to have any dances, halls or other amusements on this day.</p>
