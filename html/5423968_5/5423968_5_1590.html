   <p>The lecture on Polish art at the memorial Art Palace and the inauguration of a Polish Artists' section will both take place, thanks to the energetic efforts of the local Polish intelligentsia and the co-operation of the [World's Fair] Reception Committee, which is in charge of these matters. Both the lecture and the inauguration will take place on Friday, August 4. The lecture will be delivered in Hall number three at the Memorial Art Palace (lake front opposite Adams Street) at 2:30 in the afternoon. The inauguration of the Polish Artists' section will be held in the Fine Arts Palace at 4:15 in the afternoon. The following is a program of both events.</p>

   <p>According to the official printed program of the congresses to be held at the Memorial Arts Palace, a lecture entitled "Polish Art," prepared by Michael Zmigrodzki, will be presented during the afternoon session of the Artists' Congress on Friday, August 4. We have had an opportunity of reading Mr. Zmigrodzki's lecture, and we must admit that it is well written. In the short time allotted for the lecture, he covers the history of Art in Poland and gives a short biography of some of our greatest artists. He mentions a few of the more important paintings and corrects mistaken impressions as to the nationality of the artists who painted them. Finally, he proves that Poland leads other countries in the field of fine arts, thus demonstrating the vitality and the civilization of the Polish nation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zmigrodzki's lecture will be delivered at the Congress by M. Drzemala, who has offered his services for this purpose.</p>
   <p>But the development of Polish art will be demonstrated not only in words.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In order to give the members of the Congress a better idea of the works of Polish masters, reproductions of some of the more famous paintings will be shown--paintings dealing principally with the wars and persecutions our nation has suffered.</p>
   <p>The following reproductions, collected by Mr. Zmigrodzki, L. Szopinski, B. Klarkowski, and J. F. Smulski, will be shown: Nearly all of the works of Grottger, such as, "Polonia," "Lithuania," "Warsaw," and "War"; "Wilno in 1863," "Union," and "Kosciusko at Raclawice" by Matejko, and some of his lesser works; also, Siemiradzki's "Bacchanalia," J. Kossak's "Sobieski," and "Kosciusko," W. Kossak's "Street Scenes in Warsaw in 1863," Malczewski's "Exiles in Siberia Resting," Styka's "Polonia," and Krudowski's "Resurrection of Christ".</p>
   <p>We hope that a lecture of such range will be numerously attended by representatives of our intelligentsia.</p>

   <p>Inauguration of the Polish Artists' Section</p>
   <p>The program of the inauguration of the Polish Artists' section, to begin shortly after the lecture, is completed and will serve more or less as a further illustration of Polish Artistic endeavor. At 4:15, the invited guests and Polish citizens will gather in Hall number sixty-two, in which hangs a portion of the Polish art exhibit. A short speech will be delivered in English, after which the gathering will view the exhibit here, on the stairs and on the second floor at the western end of the Fine Arts Building. The inauguration will then be held. After three speeches, one in Polish and two in English, the guests will be entertained and shown through the exhibit. Hall number sixty-two and the hall on the second floor will be decorated with Polish and American flags and with the banners of Polish societies.</p>
   <p>The director of the inauguration will be Peter Kiolbassa. The English addresses will be made by Judge [M. A.] La Buy, E. Z. Brodowski, and M. Orzemala.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Szczesny Zahajkiewicz will speak in Polish.</p>
   <p>The committee is doing everything possible to insure the presence of at least two or three representatives of each Polish military society at the inauguration. In connection with this, we call the attention of the Polish military societies to the committee's announcement appearing in today's Dziennik [Chicagoski].</p>
   <p>All members of the Committee of 101 (Polish World's Fair Reception Committee) are invited to attend, as are all Poles who have the good of Poland at heart.</p>
   <p>We have no doubt that everyone who can will attend the inauguration as proof of our solidarity and as proof that we honor the Polish masters whose paintings are objects of admiration in Jackson Park.</p>
