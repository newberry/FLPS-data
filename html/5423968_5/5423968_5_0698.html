   <p>Every member of the Polish Singers' Alliance has undoubtedly had the misfortune to meet people who, for lack of something better to do, occupy their time by discussing matters concerning the Polish Singers' Alliance. These are usually people who do not belong to the organization, and are not acquainted with it, or members of the Alliance who are its friends in name only. Sometimes these are simple folk, but again they may be people who are supposed to stand at the head of our Polish settlements. These people express various opinions on the Polish Singers' Alliance. Most frequently one hears the following opinion: "I can see no reason for the existence of the Polish Singers' Alliance. The Falcons and the Military Alliance are different; they can be useful in the event of some important action and they should be supported. But the Singers? There is little use for them." These and similar statements can often be heard from people from whom we expect to hear something quite different.</p>
   <p>The singers Alliance is at a loss to understand the attitude taken by these <span class="page-break">2</span>people. The Polish Singers' Alliance is an organization whose aim is to develop and cultivate the singing of national songs among the Poles in America, to acquaint the Poles, as well as the American public, with the creations of former and present Polish composers, and to maintain through the medium of songs the feeling of the age-old Polish love of the motherland in the Polish-Americans. An organization of that type, according to certain people, has no reason for existence. But are these not highly ideal aims? Are they not worthy of the strongest support? With what did our fathers start every work, if not with a song? Was it not with a song on their lips that our knights left for war? Was not song the teacher of our children, and does it not hold the same position now? Did not those condemned to Siberia look to songs for encouragement and hope? Is it not a song that brings to the mind of every emigrant Pole scenes of fields covered with golden wheat and silvery rye? Moreover, do not our people place such great leaders as Chopin and Moniuszko on the list of their great sons--sons whom they love and revere? Are not these geniuses of song worthy of our preserving the songs which they loved so dearly?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Are not the Polish songs with which they have spread the glory of Poland throughout the universe to be saved now and remembered forever? None of you, gentlemen, will answer these questions in the negative because, after all, it is impossible to answer them negatively. The Polish Singers' Alliance has tasks and aims which are deserving of the strongest support everywhere, and especially here in America. If, then, someone cannot understand the reason for the existence of this organization, if he does not wish, or does not know how, to find a reason for its existence, he should make an effort to become more closely acquainted with the organization. Let him stand in our ranks, let him gaze upon the thousands of our Polish children who are losing their national identity, let him look closely at the enthusiasm that envelops the audience when our groups at the numerous commemorative exercises intone songs of glory and hope; and then he will admit that the organization has a reason for existence. Instead of criticizing us he will begin to work with us. There is a great deal of work to be done which is not less important or easier than that of the Polish Falcons or the Polish Military Alliances.</p>

   <p>To members of the Polish Singers' Alliance the voices of such vain and unreasonable people should never be the cause for discouragement but, on the contrary, should give impetus to further enduring work. This Alliance, in spite of its twenty years of existence, is still like a chickling that needs warmth, care, and assistance. We are not as yet sufficiently strong to take care of the enormous amount of work awaiting us, but we understand that it is our duty to perform this task. Let us, therefore, endeavor to strengthen the organization. Let us not neglect even our most insignificant obligations. Let us not postpone their performance to some future time because the sooner we complete our work, the sooner will those who come after us fulfill their obligations. By our efforts their work will be made easier and, at the same time, the day of rejuvenation of the Alliance will be brought closer.</p>
   <p>The first circuit of the Polish Singers' Alliance, which has its headquarters in Chicago, and which during the past administration met with numerous obstacles which hindered its proper development and were partially responsible for its <span class="page-break">5</span>financial deficit, became revitalized after the Baltimore convention of the organization. Today, as far as we know, this circuit leads all others in every respect. The election of new people to administer the circuit was primarily responsible for this change of conditions. The present administrative staff of the first circuit of the Polish Singers' Alliance is composed of people who have rolled up their sleeves and dived enthusiastically into work. The results of this work are proof that the former contention, that it was impossible to create a strong circuit with headquarters in Chicago, was based upon every weak foundations. Regular free concerts and other recreations contribute greatly to the development of this particular circuit. These come after each regular monthly meeting and are sponsored and conducted by the circuit administration. The idea of conducting social meetings of that type is very commendable and is worthy of imitation by other circuits. It is certain that their local organizations would meet with proportionate success.</p>
