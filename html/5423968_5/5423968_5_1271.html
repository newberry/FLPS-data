   <p>Mr. Adam Szwajkart, of Chicago, manager of the Polish-American Pavilion at the exposition in Lwow, Poland, has just received a letter from the directors of the exposition concerning the diplomas and prizes awarded to the Polish-American exhibitors.</p>
   <p>We are quoting this letter in its entirety:</p>
   <p>Directors</p>
   <p>Of The World's Fair Exposition In Lwow, 1894</p>
   <p>"Lwow, January 25, 1896,</p>
   <p>"(15 Jagielonska Street, 1st floor.)</p>
   <p>"Mr. Adam Szwajkart,</p>
   <p>"Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>"Dear Sir: We are sending to your address, under separate cover, a package containing diplomas, and six bronze, two silver, and one gold medal, awarded to the exhibitors in the American section in accordance with the decision of the judges, and we ask you kindly to hand these awards to the respective winners.</p>
   <p>"At this time we also wish to send you our sincere, thanks, in the name of the entire committee, for your energetic and most successful management of the American exhibits, which helped greatly to bind more closely the ties joining our brethren from across the sea with their fatherland, and to become more thoroughly acquainted with your industrious work.</p>
   <p>"In the name of the Exposition committees,</p>
   <p>"Marcheicki,</p>
   <p>"Director of the Exposition,</p>
   <p>"John Casimir Zielinski,</p>
   <p>"Secretary of the Exposition."</p>
   
   <p>The package mentioned in this letter has not yet been received by Mr. Szwajkart. Very likely it was shipped by freight, so it will probably be a long time before it reaches its destination. Mr. Szwajkart, therefore, asks the Polish people to have patience. As soon as he receives the package he will announce it publicly in the papers.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the above letter is proof that the awarded prizes are on the way.</p>
