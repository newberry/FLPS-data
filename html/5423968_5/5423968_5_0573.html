   <p>Mrs. Helena Modrzejewska came to Chicago yesterday. We hasten to inform you that she shall take part, September 4, at the school hall located at Bradley Street, in the role of "Aristocrats." This Sunday she shall perform in a new play,"Queen Hedwig," playing the role of said title.</p>
   <p>The money collected from these performances will be used for some beneficial purpose. But for what purpose it is not known as yet.</p>
   <p>We don't doubt that Mrs. Helena Modrzejewska, who is such a popular Polish actress, will not forget that in Chicago we are accepting funds for the statue of Thadeus Kosciuszko.</p>
