   <p>An original play, "Jasnogora" (Bright Mountain), by Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, was staged by the Dramatic Circle yesterday in the New Polish Hall, Bradley and Noble Streets.</p>
   <p>The plot of the play is wound around the battle of Lzestochowa against the Swedes (1665), which is described in Sienkiewicz's "Deluge." This story is very dear to the hearts of all the Poles. Mr. Zahajkiewicz has gained a great deal from Sienkiewicz's book, for his dramatic effect in the play shows results of careful study. The play is given in six parts and, although long, has force.</p>
   <p>The force of the entire play was well carried out by the members of the Dramatic Circle. The character of Reverend Augustine Kordecki, an outstanding Polish priest and figure, was ably portrayed by Vincent Jozwiakowski. This role fitted perfectly with the character and talent of Mr. Jozwiakowski.</p>

   <p>J. Kondziorski played the part of Miller with great force. The roles of Miecznik Zamojski and Peter Czarnecki were finely executed by John Nering [also Nehring] and J. Domek. Parts were also played by J. Czekala, J. Cszwaldowski, S. Piasecki, M. Siudzin, J. Nowak, M. Reptowski, W. Pyterek, J. Szczepanski, and others. Miss Wanda Barwig portrayed Constantia.</p>
   <p>The singing of the chorus group was enjoyable. The costumes and scenery were beautiful. The work of the author was rendered by the cast in the best style. Applause by the large audience was unsparing at the close of the performance.</p>
