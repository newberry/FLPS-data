   <p>Among Polish business institutions planned on a larger scale, first-place is occupied by the Bank Polski (popularly known as "White Corner bank"). The bank advocated the idea of saving; as a result the savings accounts were increased by four-million dollars. The honest and efficient service rendered by this bank has made it very popular not only among people of the Polish settlement but even in Poland.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. F. Smulski, president of the bank has recently, come in contact with the Bank Krajowy (Country bank) in Poland; through which, all international transactions will be handled. The Bank Polski has been operating only a few years, but because of the useful service rendered to the people, it has become a very popular institution.</p>
