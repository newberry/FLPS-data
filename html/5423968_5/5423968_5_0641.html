   <p>Yesterday evening a concert was held at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall, the proceeds of which will be donated half to the Polish Army in France, and half to the Polish orphans in Switzerland. The public gave its wholehearted support, filling the hall to capacity. The concert was successful in every respect.</p>
   <p>Before the program began, Michael Perlowski, one of the organizers of the Polish Army, introduced to the audience the new recruiting officer for Recruiting Center II, Alexander Wolski, who thanked the public for its generous support of so great a cause as that of the Polish Army.</p>
   <p>The program of the concert began with an octet from Halka Choir singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Jeszcze Polska Nie Zginela" (Poland is Not Yet Lost).</p>

   <p>Mrs. A. Zebrowski-Perlowski charmed everyone with her unequalled [violin] playing. The applause was unceasing, and Mrs. Zebrowski-Perlowski was forced to return to the stage for a number of encores. It seemed as if the audience would never be satisfied.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Harriet Smulski entertained with songs. Her sweet voice carried her listeners away into unknown lands, so that whenever she stopped singing the audience awoke as if from a trance, and with thunderous applause refused to allow Mrs. Smulski to leave the stage.</p>
   <p>Others who aided in making the program a success were J. E. Chapek and Dr. E. Chapek, who played a Dvorak trio with Mrs. Perlowski so well that the audience forced them to return for an encore. Recognition is also due Mrs. A. H. Chapek and Mrs. M. Smietanka, pianists, whose accompaniment did much to make possible the successful appearances of Mrs. Perlowski and Mrs. Smulski.</p>

   <p>During the intermission, Judge E. Jarecki delivered an address in which he urged everyone to buy War Savings Stamps and thus help the United States win the war. If the Allies win the war, it is also a victory for us, for only then can a free, independent, and united Poland arise. Several young women passed through the audience selling Stamps.</p>
   <p>Before conclusion of the program, Recruiting Officer A. Wolski and Organizer M. Perlowski took up a collection for the benefit of the Polish Army. The concert was concluded as the audience sang to Mrs. Zebrowski-Perlowski's accompaniment.</p>
   <p>Pleasant memories of this unequalled concert will long remain with those who heard it.</p>
