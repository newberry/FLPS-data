   <p>The Philaret Male Chorus has given the highest proof of its willingness to sacrifice personal ambition and personal gains. As is well known to everyone, the fall concert of this chorus was to have been given next Sunday at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Hall. All preparations had already been made--the hall was hired, the programs printed--in a word, the Chorus was prepared to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its existence in proper style.</p>
   <p>And the concert would have been given as scheduled--if a matter of a hundredfold greater importance had not arisen to cross the plans made by the chorus. A telegram from the great artist, Paderewski, arrived yesterday. Paderewski had composed, in honor of the recognition of free Poland by the nations of the world and the arrival in America of the delegation from German-occupied Poland, a hymn entitled "Hymn Wolnej Polski" [The Free Poland Hymn] which he requested <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be sung at Sunday's manifestation, to the accompaniment of a large orchestra under his own direction. He would be assisted by T. Wronski, artist of the Boston Opera.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Chorus had to make a choice--to accept the invitation and to postpone their own concert or to refuse the invitation and proceed with the concert as scheduled. The opinion of the musical advisory board favored the former and, despite the expenses that had been incurred in preparing for the concert, it was decided to postpone it.</p>
   <p>This act was really the height of civic sacrifice and we shall permit ourselves to doubt whether any other group would be equal to a sacrifice of this kind. When the telegram arrived, we rather expected that the Philarets would accept the invitation and so we were, to a certain extent, prepared for their decision. As a matter of fact, the honor of being the first to sing "Hymn Wolnej Polski," a hymn that will undoubtedly be a national prayer in the future, both among the Poles in America and in the homeland, is a great one, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and we can be proud that it falls to the Philarets, who have always and everywhere been among the first to offer their services for the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>The members of the Philaret Male Chorus, who might accept with some disappointment this decision made by their officers and musical board, ought to be broadminded and understanding over the fact that it was made without asking the approval of the Chorus as a whole, for the decision had to be made immediately, since Paderewski was awaiting a reply, and it was impossible to wait until Friday, at which time the Chorus would meet.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, Wronski will arrive in Chicago with the music on Friday, and thus the Chorus will hold its regular rehearsal at St. Stanislaus Hall on that day. On Saturday, a rehearsal will be held under the personal direction of Paderewski, while on Sunday a rehearsal will be held with the orchestra consisting of outstanding musicians.</p>
   <p>It would be wonderful if the Philaret Chorus could appear in such force as in <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the memorable concert held in Riverview Park where, with some eighty voices, it outsang a number of other choruses. The first rendition of "Hymn Wolnej Polski" ought to be done with a force and power comparable to that which is spreading the news of Poland's rebirth. It should echo and re-echo throughout the entire length and breadth of the United States, and carry on across the ocean to our oppressed homeland, Poland, which has outstretched its arms to us and is crying, "Freedom!"</p>
