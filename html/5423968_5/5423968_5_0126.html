   <p>The Polish settlement in Chicago is growing fast and with it the Polish enterprises. The best evidence of this progress is in the growth and development of the Eagle Brewing Co., 2608-2620 N. Western Ave., which was organized by a group of Poles who are members of the Polish National Alliance, and are at this time enlarging their quarters at a cost of $50.000.</p>
   <p>The beer brewed by the Eagle Brewing Co. is among the best in the country. The corporation was founded with a capital of $30.000, which has increased to $100.000. This year a 10% dividend will be paid on all invested capital. The Eagle Brewing Co. is at present under the management of T. Wardenski, president; J. Szymczak, vice-president; W. S. Zwiefka, secretary; J. Szymkowski, treasurer, J. Kortas, M. Marach, P. Opiela, S. Jaskowiak and J. Trandel, directors.</p>
