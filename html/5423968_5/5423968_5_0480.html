   <p>Universally liked for his unpretentiousness, discretion and honorable character is the organist at Holy Trinity parish, Mr. Anthony Mallek, who is celebrating his 40th jubilee today as an organist and composer.</p>
   <p>There are on file not a small number of Polish-American church songs and music, although this jubilee will be celebrate in Europe, mainly Poland. He is an old veteran, gray haired from the strain of his musical work, but upon his shoulders are glory and praise for his contribution to the musical world. He makes all the Polish people happy and deserves the highest sympathy, appreciation and thanks for his true character, disregarding the hardships of his life so that the musical world might profit.</p>
   <p>A true Pole in flesh and blood, he was bord May 5, 1851, in the town of Ogorzelina, in the county of Chelminski, in Southern Prussia. At first he was taught music by his father, Stanley, who was an organist <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the parish located in the town of Waldon. Later he was taught by Professor T. Noryskiewicz. In his early childhood, Anthony, under the guidance of his father, showed wonderful musical talent. Young Mallek showed signs of love for music, and his father, Stanley Mallek, greatly encouraged him at home. When he was a young man times in his native country changed. During the Franco-Prussian war, at the request of his father, he refused to serve in the army against his country.</p>
   <p>Accompanied my Mr. Francis Matza, he left for America in the year 1871 at the age of 20. He showed faked credentials to the border officers and even bribed them to make sure he was not caught and held to serve his term in the army. When he arrived in Chicago he began to look for work and was finally hired by the Illinois Central Railroad. He held this position until the Chicago fire. He was one of the workers retained after the fire to help search for the million dollars that was lost by this company as a result of this fire. The following year Mr. Mallek took the place of Mr. Wiland as a teacher and organist at St. Stanislaus Parish.</p>

   <p>In this energetic young man's life the love for music was then unfolded. It was the opening of his golden opportunity. He was the first organist to teach the choir of St. Stanislaus the Figurative Mass, "Pashala." For the next two years he fulfilled the duties of a teacher and organist at the parish of St. Stanislaus in Milwaukee, Wis., where he organized their first church choir. In the year 1875 he went to Northeim, Wis., where he was hired as a teacher and organist at St. Kasimir parish.</p>
   <p>Here is where he found Miss Zych, a talented singer. Later she became his wife. He also took an active part in organizing societies for Polish veterans and church societies.</p>
   <p>In the year 1879, Mr. Mallek was elected Justice of the Peace in the County of Manitowoc. During this same year he married Miss Zych. In the year 1880, Mr. Mallek was promoted as teacher and organist at Holy Trinity parish in Chicago, where he is still employed at the present time. As a beginning he wanted to combine all Polish singers into one group, and with the aid of the Chopin Choir members he began his work <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>in earnest. He called all the representatives of various choir groups from Chicago, Milwaukee, La Salle and St. Paul to meet on the 28th of November, 1888. This was the beginning of the United Polish Singers of America.</p>
   <p>This organization is one of the strongest of its kind in America, and has thousands of members enrolled. Ten times Mr. Mallek was elected general conductor of this society. In the year 1899, the general secretary of the Polish National Alliance admitted Mr. Mallek as the Grand Master of all Polish composers and organists. He composed the beautiful song "Przebudzenie Lwa" (Awakening of the Lion). As guest of honor Mr. Anthony Katski, a well-known Polish composer, took active part in all celebrations that were under the guidance of Mr. Mallek.</p>
   <p>What does the jubilee of today mean to the Holy Trinity parish? The parishioners are well informed about this jubilee in advance, and thousands of letters telling Mr. Mallek about his unfailing work in behalf of this parish and others. His choir, organ, and composition <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>work stand out above all others and the Polish people are supporting him and his work as only a true Pole can.</p>
   <p>At 10 o'clock this morning the finery, festive and sweet-scented fragrance took place at Holy Trinity parish. Solemn mass for the intention of this celebrated jubilee was performed by the Most Rev. Father O. K. Sztuczko, assisted by Most Rev. Father Szalewski, Rev. Father Sypniewski, and Rev. Father Szybowicz. Many other priests and prelates took an active part in this 40th year jubilee.</p>
   <p>The society of organists, under the direction of Mr. Mallek's oldest colleague, Mr. Kwasigroch, organist at St. Stanislaus parish, sang Rosewig in F for this figurative mass. The organ was played by Mr. Al Karczynski, organist from the Apostles, St. Peter and Paul parish.</p>
   <p>A concert will be held tonight at the Association Auditorium, located in the heart of the city; as part of this jubilee the various choirs, combined with the choir of Holy Trinity under the direction of Mr. Kwasigroch, will pay high honor to Mr. Mallek.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Mr. Mallek is quietly working, writing and composing church songs as well as national songs. He is a quiet home loving man, forgetting at times his friends and family, only living with the inspiration and ambitions of his life's work. His motives of patriotism play a strong part in his life, and he is always thinking of doing something to help continue the true love of all Poles in America.</p>
   <p>He deserves the utmost gratitude from all true-blooded Poles today, on his 40th jubilee as an organist and composer and may his work and life be happy for years to come.</p>
