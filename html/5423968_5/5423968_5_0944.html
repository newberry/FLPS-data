   <p>The St. Casimir Young Men's Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish, affiliated with the Polish Falcons of America, is contemplating the erection of its own gymnasium on parish grounds.</p>
   <p>This is a noble thought and worthy of support. As soon as the building is completed, the Society will expand rapidly. This is something that everybody wishes for this organization.</p>
   <p>In order to raise funds for the building, the Society is staging a dramatic program at the Polish Hall. Besides the comedy "Posag w Kominie" [Dowry in the Chimney], drills will be displayed.</p>
   <p>It is anticipated that the Polish public will support this worthy enterprise.</p>
