   <p>He said that Poland is very anxious to publish reports of the progress which is being made in all Polish communities in the United States-not only along commercial lines but especially in the field of music, art, and literature. He offered his co-operation in the work and expressed the hope that such events as the Polish Concert of Ravinia Park and the present exhibition of paintings would become annual events, not only in Chicago but in every large Polish community in the United States.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edmund Kalenski, Polish vice-consul, congratulated the Club for what it had accomplished in less than two years, expressing wishes for a still greater activity in the future.</p>
