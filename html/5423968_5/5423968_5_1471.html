   <p>In reference to the project devised by the representatives of the Polish artists whose paintings are on exhibit at the World's Fair, of which we wrote yesterday, we have received the following additional information.</p>
   <p>The plan involves the lottery, not of twenty-four paintings, as we erroneously stated, but of all the paintings at the Polish exhibit that are as yet unsold, that is, one hundred and thirty. This increases considerably the chances of ticketholders to win a painting.</p>
   <p>Photographic reproductions, one of which each ticketholder will receive, will be made of the twenty-four paintings listed yesterday [in Dziennik Chicagoski].</p>
   <p>We will return to this matter in a later issue.</p>
