   <p>The question of Polish-American participation in the Kosciusko Exposition at Lwow, which we discussed recently in a series of articles, is being widely considered. The press, the clergy, and the general public are becoming interested. Contributions are already flowing in, and we do not doubt that the matter will take a favorable turn.</p>
   <p>That the state of affairs is as we say, is proved by the following letter from the Reverend Adolf Nowicki of St. Michael Archangel Parish in South Chicago;</p>
   <p>"Oct. 25, 1893.</p>
   <p>"While it is true that times are hard and economic stagnation prevails, and that Polish Day was quite an expense to us, yet we cannot but consider Polish-American participation in the Kosciusko Exposition at Lwow.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"The splendid Polish Day proved to other national groups in America that we exist as a nation and that we are making progress on the path of civilization. Our participation in the Lwow Exposition will be proof to our brethren across the ocean that if we exist, it is because faith and homeland are our ideals, that we have not forgotten Poland--on the contrary, that we desire to maintain a closer spiritual and national relationship with Poland. If the purpose of the Kosciusko Exposition is to raise the Polish name after a hundred thirty years of subjugation, and to disprove the words which were falsely attributed to Kosciuko: 'Finis Poloniae,' then we as Poles ought to have a part in the matter. It is a patriotic duty.</p>
   <p>"The persons who accomplished the difficult task of making Polish Day a reality can, with a little good will and work, make possible a Polish-American pavilion at the Lwow Exposition. In times as hard as these, it will be so much the greater accomplishment. Our pavilion will carry so much deeper a message to our countrymen in Poland if its erection represents sacrifice on our part. It will undoubtedly be a great attraction <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>at the Exposition, and contribute not a little to the Exposition's success.</p>
   <p>"Do not cease then, dear editor, to remind American Polonia of its duty. There will be hearts that will be moved to this noble and patriotic cause, there will be minds that will understand it--and hands to do the work. It will be work for the Polish cause, for the good of the Polish people, and for the good of the church, which is always so closely bound to our national life that separation is unthinkable.</p>
   <p>Reverend A. Nowicki.</p>
   <p>"Postscriptum: I am enclosing ten dollars as my own contribution to the Pavilion fund, and twenty dollars as an initial contribution from my parish."</p>
   <p>As we see from the above letter, the fund for the Polish-American pavilion in Lwow has gained thirty dollars. Acknowledgment is due to Father Nowicki and his parishioners for this noble contribution. However, the Central Committee <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>has already started a collection for this purpose, and contributions are flowing in from other sources. The first list of contributors has been published by Gazeta Katolicka; contributions in this list amount to fifty dollars. [List of contributors omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>In addition to the above, further contributions to the fund for the Polish-American pavilion in Lwow were made by P. Kiolbassa ($50), and Mr. Poszwinski ($25). Nearly fifty dollars had been collected for this purpose at the Polish National Alliance Convention.</p>
   <p>Thus far, including the donations made by the Alliance and the Polish Roman Catholic Union, almost a thousand dollars has been collected for the pavilion. Another thousand is needed.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all people of good will for further contributions, which should be sent to the secretary, L. Szopinski, 559 Noble Street, or to the treasurer, W. Bardonski, 638 Bradley Street, corner of Noble.</p>

   <p>Arrangements concerning the Polish-American pavilion are already in progress in Lwow. Dr. Dunikowski writes that a site has already been chosen--a very beautiful place near the Palace of Fine Arts. The pavilion will occupy about two hundred square meters and will be situated on a high terrace from which it will be visible from a great distance.</p>
   <p>Due to Dr. Dunikowski's efforts, the grounds are already being prepared and preparations for laying the foundation are being made. Construction will begin as soon as the plans are received.</p>
   <p>Dr. Dunikowski will shortly send plans of the Exposition and announcements concerning it to Chicago. These will be displayed in public places here in Chicago as well as in other cities, in order to spread detailed information on the 1894 Exposition among the Poles throughout America.</p>
