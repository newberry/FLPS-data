   <p>The opening of the World's Fair on May 1 presents to us, the Poles of Chicago, a singular opportunity for improving our relations among ourselves and with our homeland, since on the one hand, Chicago has a very large Polish population and on the other, we can expect numerous visitors to the Fair from abroad.</p>
   <p>We have taken steps to make use of this opportunity to its fullest advantage. At the same time, we intend to show our brethren from abroad that the Poles' innate hospitality is kept alive, here, as are others of our Polish virtues, and that American Polonia feels a close spiritual union with its homeland. To this end, a Reception Committee of 101 has been organized. Its functions are to supply Polish visitors from abroad, as well as from other parts of America, with all necessary information; to protect them against unpleasant experiences, to which visitors who don't <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>speak English are often subjected; and to aid them in understanding Polish-American conditions in this city. The Reception Committee has established a free Information Bureau at 141-43 W. Division Street, where information can be obtained on steamship and railroad rates, on comparative costs of living in Chicago, and on all matters pertaining to the Exposition itself. Such information can be applied for in person or by letter. The information Bureau will keep a list of available lodgings in all sections of the city for the duration of the Fair. The Bureau will also maintain a staff of guides, who will speak Polish as well as English, for the convenience of visitors. The bureau's guides will guarantee the best possible service at a minimum cost. On request, the Bureau will supply women guides for ladies. If notification of arrival is made in advance, specifying station, date and time of arrival, guides can be sent to meet such arrivals at the railroad station. At such times, each guide will wear an appropriate badge and will be supplied with the necessary identification carrying the signitures of the members of the Executive Committee. To avoid possible abuses, it is advisable to demand this identification at all times.</p>
