   <p>Our brilliant country-woman, Madame Helena Modrzejewska shone in continued triumphs on the stage of the Grand Opera House. Last week she protrayed the title roles in "Camille" and in "Adriene Lecouvreur."</p>
   <p>We do not need to emphasize that she played the roles in a masterly fashion.</p>
   <p>Our country-woman, not only found appreciation and enthusiasm in the numerous audience, but also got favorable ciriticisms in the English language newspapers. Last Sunday, Madame Modrzejewska played, with her entire dramatic company, "Mary Stuart" for the benefit of the Polish Hospital. After the third act the talented Polish actress received two beautiful bouquets of flowers, one from six Polish Editors, and the other from the management of the Polish Hospital.</p>
   <p>After the first act the newspaper editors were all introduced to Madame <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Modrzejewska. Last Monday the first performance of "Macbeth" this season was rendered. Madame Modrzejewska played the role of Lady Macbeth and as usual she played the role with great success.
