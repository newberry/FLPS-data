   <p>The St. Hedwig Parish Choir staged two plays yesterday at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish School Hall before a capacity audience. Over twenty priests were present at the performance.</p>
   <p>This marked the first attempt of this choir in the amateur theatrical field. The two short plays were: "Na Przekor" (For Spite) and "Zaslubiny Z Przeszkodami" (A Marriage Ceremony With Hindrances). Both were under the capable direction of Szczesny Zahajkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The music, by a local orchestra, was entertaining and the songs by the St. Hedwig Choir, under the direction of Stanislaus Bieganowski, were very pleasing to the audience.</p>
   <p>Credit must be given to Mr. [?] Wojanski for his capable characterizations.</p>

   <p>It was difficult to believe that this was the initial endeavor by the St. Hedwig Parish Choir as the plays were so expertly executed. After all, only two weeks were spent in preparations.</p>
   <p>The humor, beautiful singing and art acting thrilled the audience. At the close of the plays long applause greeted the performances.</p>
   <p>This is only a beginning of the work being laid out in St. Medwig Parish since the Reverend John Piechowski recently took over the pastorship.</p>
