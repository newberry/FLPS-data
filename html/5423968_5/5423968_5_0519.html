   <p>Henry Turner Bailey, director of the Cleveland School of Art, offers his recently published reading course, Pleasures from Pictures, as a guide for those who would steer between the Soylla of science and the Charybdis of "gush" in their attitude toward pictures. After a brief introduction, Mr. Bailey recommends six books and one series of art reproductions as a guide toward an intelligent appreciation of painting. Among the books recommended are a readable history of painting, a discussion of modern painting, and books on the Italian and American Schools. The reading course, together with these books, is now available at the Pulaski Library.</p>
   <p>This is the twentieth course in the "Reading with a Purpose" series published by the American Library Association. Others in the series deal with architecture, music, physical science, modern essays, and English and American Literature.</p>
