   <p>The annual meeting of the stockholders of the Polish gold mine known as the Bonanza Cripple Creek Gold Mining Company, which took place on Tuesday evening in the Sherman House, was characterized by lively discussions. Some of the stockholders demanded additional reports and specific lists of expenditures from the retiring board of directors. The discussion lasted until midnight. Those taking part in them, besides the directors, were Mr. T. Stan, Mr. Janocha, Attorney Palt, and Mr. Czarnecki.</p>
   <p>As a result of the length of the meeting, it was impossible to elect a new board of directors. For this purpose and to satisfy the just demands of the stockholders, the meeting was adjourned to Tuesday, June 16, at seven o'clock in the evening, in the Sherman House.</p>
