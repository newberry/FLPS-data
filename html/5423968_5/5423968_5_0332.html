   <p>In the latter part of 1890, a group of hunting enthusiasts conceived the idea of establishing a hunters' club. The chief promoter was Mr. M. Durski, with the assistance of Messrs. Brodowski, Piotrowski, Marson, the two Augustynowicz brothers, and a few others.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, it was decided that at present there are not enough Nimrod adepts among Chicago poles properly to develop their activities. The idea was not neglected, however, and a resolution was agreed upon to broaden the club's field of activities, which could be done by uniting pleasure with business. In view of this, a constitution was formulated on the basis of which all members of the Hunters' Club were obligated to purchase at least two shares in the building loan, irrespective of the ordinary twenty-five cent monthly dues. The funds derived from the payment of these shares were to be used to purchase a large tract of land. This tract was to be subdivided into either lots or farms which the Hunters' Club would, after the American <span class="page-break">\2</span>custom, sell to small owners. In order to justify the inclusion of the original motive in the name of the club, it was decided to hold hunting and fishing excursions which the members were not obligated to attend unless they wished and had the time.</p>
   <p>On this basis, the Polish Hunters' Club was incorporated in January, 1891, at Springfield, Illinois. The administration consisted of the following officers: A. J. Kowalski, president; Francis Wleklinski, vice president; A. Szulc, treasurer; M. Durski, financial secretary; J. I. Migdalski, recording secretary. J. Marson, T. Ostrowski and A. Kaletta were in charge of the treasury. When founded, the club had thirty-three members.</p>
   <p>In the beginning, while the customary Polish enthusiasm was still glowing, the club held a number of fine excursions. Everyone busied himself with the search for more capital with a view of starting commercial operations, since this was the ambition of many members who had not been interested in hunting when they joined the club. Shortly afterwards, this enthusiasm wore off and the public took on an attitude of indifference toward the club, which <span class="page-break">\3</span>depended so much upon its support for there was no other organization that involved a larger real-estate business. A number of the Polish salesmen of lots would not take into consideration the fact that by selling their own lots [sic] they would please their customers more and secure greater profits for themselves. The public at large showed very little interest, as evidenced by the fact that the high point in membership was only forty-two.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, many members have resigned, either for lack of time, or because of departure from the city; a few new members have been initiated, The early ardor has deserted everyone, and were it not for the strong determination of a few administrators who had faith in the advantages of such an institution and who also had hopes of breaking their fellow citizens' indifference, who could tell whether or not this club would still exist? Thanks to the efforts of these men, however, the club is progressing--even though at a snail's pace,-- and we hope that in the near future it will yield the longed-for fruit.</p>
   <p>Justification of the title is still necessary, since most people have the <span class="page-break">\4</span>impression that in addition to hunting the club has no other field of activities, and for that reason they have kept aloof. The title probably might be changed to "Real-Estate Company", and then undoubtedly the club will increase its membership.</p>
   <p>The present administration consists of Stanley T. Piotrowski, president; F. Wleklinski, vice president; P. Okoniewski, treasurer; M. Durski, financial secretary; J. I. Migdalski, recording secretary; while J. Marson, M. Baranski and W. Wleklinski are in charge of the treasury.</p>
