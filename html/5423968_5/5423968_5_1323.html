   <p>The Saint John Cantius Parish fair began last Saturday in the new but still unconsecrated Saint John Cantius Church, on the second floor of the building, and it looks good. The hall is beautifully decorated, and the exhibits are systematically arranged. There is a great variety of articles, many of them very beautiful. It seems that everyone is happy, and the enthusiasm of parishoners and guests is great. Many people were at the fair yesterday.</p>
   <p>Of great attraction and interest is a picture of the Blessed Virgin of Czestochowa; there are ten stones in the crown of the Virgin and eight in the crown of the infant Jesus. The picture is valued at two hundred dollars. As stated in our last article, this picture will be raffled among the Womens' Rosary sodalities of Saint Stanislaus Kostka and Saint John Cantius Parishes. It appears that the contest will be very close. There was great activity among the contestants yesterday. Four branches of the Women's Rosary Sodality from Saint Stanislaus Koska Parish have already chosen a committee for the contest.</p>
   <p>The beginning is very good, and indications are that the fair will be a success.</p>
