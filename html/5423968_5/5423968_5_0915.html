   <p>On Sunday, April 29th, the Poles in Chicago celebrated the first appearance of the newly formed Polish Theatre, a creation of Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, and worthy of full consideration. It promises to become a regular theatrical institution, and is to stage regular Polish theatrical productions in the larger theaters of downtown Chicago. If these promises and beautiful intentions are realized, then this city of the Poles in America will take another step forward from an intellectual viewpoint. For this they will be indebted to Mr. Zahajkiewicz, director of the Polish Theatre.</p>
   <p>He can count on the inception of this Polish theatrical institution as one of the first and most important results of his activities in America.</p>
