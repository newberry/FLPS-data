   <p>Preparations are made being for a big orchestral concert to be rendered by the Nowicki Brothers, with the help of the Polish Catholic Federation. It will take place in a parochial school at the corner of Exchange Avenue and 88th Street, Sunday, May 10, at 10 P. M.</p>
   <p>Wagons filled with palms and ferns are being brought in to decorate this large hall. In front of the stage there has been arranged a suitable platform for the organization singers, who will also take part in this program.</p>
   <p>The orchestra that will furnish the music is well known, as it has played during the last season in concerts at Humboldt Park and from time to time has played in conjunction with the Thomas Orchestra.</p>
   <p>We are told that the aim of presenting this concert is not to benefit financially, but to present a useful pastime, wholesome and pleasant.</p>
   <p>Another object of the Federation is to get acquainted with the public in general, and so the entertainment, musical and literary, is going to help the Federation in its aim.</p>
