   <p>Yesterday the funeral of the father of Polish song in America and former secretary general of the Polish National Alliance, Anthony Mallek, took place. The funeral was impressive because the deceased earned this last service with his whole life.</p>

   <p>The funeral procession formed in front of the Alliance building on West Division Street, where the hearse and a hundred automobiles halted. The wreaths had been previously taken to the Alliance building, from whence friends took them and carried them to the church. The Alliance building was hung with crepe and the flag was at half mast. Work was stopped at the Alliance building for two hours in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>order to enable the employes to attend the church services.</p>
   <p>All the members of the Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance attended, and the censor was represented by his secretary, Mr. S. Litko of Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>The funeral procession started at 11 A.M. from the Alliance building, preceded by a platoon of police which kept order, since the crowds were so great. Mr. F. Przybylski's orchestra, composed of several dozen musicians, played funeral marches and was followed by a long string of people, friends of the deceased, who carried magnificant wreaths.</p>

   <p>The church ceremony lasted a long time, and it was not until about 5 P.M. that the funeral procession arrived at St. Adalbert's Cemetery, where the remains of Anthony Mallek were laid to eternal rest in the family lot.</p>
   <p>Reverend W. Zapala, rector of St. Stanislaus College, made a moving speech over the grave. He was followed by Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, who spoke of the great work which the deceased had done for the Alliance, and who expressed the final farewell in the name of 120,000 Alliance brothers and sisters.</p>
   <p>The organists' choir sang funeral responsories at the grave. A prayer was said for the peace of the soul of the deceased and bits of soil began falling on the grave. Thus ended the last service rendered the deceased champion.</p>
   <p>May he rest in peace.</p>
