   <p>Last Sunday, December 4, the Dramatic Club of the parish of St. Stanislaus B. M., in Cragin, presented a variety program at the parish hall. A one-act farce "False Address" and a five-scene musical comedy "Three Rogues" filled the entertainment bill. All who were present experienced a treat which will long be remembered.</p>
   <p>J. K. Borowinski, organist from St. Hyacinth's Parish, played the piano accompaniment. The singing was directed by F. Pawlowski and the directors of both plays were W. J. Rentflejsz and L. Czosek.</p>
   <p>The same program was presented for the school children of the parish, earlier in the day.</p>
   <p>Actors of this dramatic club are willing to repeat their performances, but it must be for a benevolent deed. If there is any society or organization <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>wishing to take advantage of this offer and willing to sponsor some kind, charitable program, the Cragin amateur actors will be willing to do their share without any cost.</p>
