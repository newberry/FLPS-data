   <p>The four-act historical drama "Wojna Szwedzko Polska" (Swedish-Polish War) presented yesterday evening by the Varsovian Choir at the Polish Women's Alliance Building, reminded the audience that work for one's country meets with reward while betrayal meets with punishment.</p>
   <p>The performance, despite obvious deficiencies on the part of some of the anateurs (we do not want to mention any names, because it would hurt these people), came out fairly well, thanks to the good acting of Miss J. Sokolowski, Miss J. Witkowski and several of the male actors.</p>
   <p>The audience in general was satisfied with the performance, which should constitute the best reward for the amateurs, who, in spite of everything, put in a great deal of work in order to attain success. The young people had a very good time at the dance which followed the performance.</p>
