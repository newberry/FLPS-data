   <p>Poles of Chicago and vicinity have been promised an unusual musical production, with beautiful scenes, presenting a renowned singer, and a company of eleven solists. It will truly be, a musical extravaganza, because we will witness the opera of the immortal Pole Stanislaus Moniuszko, "The Haunted Mansion", in three acts and five scenes.</p>
   <p>The Poles of Chicago were successful in inducing the famous Polish basso, Mr. Adam Didur, to come to America and take the leading role in this great operatic work. The name of Mr. Didur is well-known throughout America, even though this is his first appearance in this country. This program will be held on May 2, 1927, at the Ashland Boulevard Auditorium, at Van Buren and Ashland Boulevard.</p>
   <p>The opera, "The Haunted Mansion" by Moniuszko, does not need publicity. It has been staged successively for the past thirty years in Poland, and it shall continue in its appearance, for it is the work of the immortal Moniuszko. A cast of 50 people, tutored and directed by Adam Didura, will appear on the program; they will arrive from New York on a special train. Artists who will participate in the program are: Marja Bogucka, Teodozia Bandycz, Salomea Zbytniewski, Walter Grigajtys and John Zuchlinski.</p>
