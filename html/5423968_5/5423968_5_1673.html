   <p>The Alpha Rho Omega Fraternity is exceedingly active and arranged an affair which is somewhat different than its usual festivities. From numerous suggestions, the Illinois Women's Athletic Club was chosen as the place for the spring dance to be held on Saturday evening, April 6th. The selection is most appropriate since the popular demand of those who formerly attended the Omega's dances was considered. It is the hope and desire of every member to satisfy the ever obliging patrons to the 'nth degree. The experience, howerve, gathered from former dances is obvious enough and assures a jovial time, good music, courteous gatherings of young men and women amid-pleasant atmosphere and surroundings.</p>
   <p>Those factors still linger in the memories of many patrons and friends of the Fraternity. That policy with the added desire to accomplish the most, and offer the most for a comparatively small charge will always be retained by this group of young University men. For the complete satisfaction of every one, an orchestra that records for the phonograph has been engaged for this dance. The day is Saturday, April 6th . The place: The Illinois Women's Athletic Club.</p>
