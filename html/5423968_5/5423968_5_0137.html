   <p>Through the efforts of the popular mason contractor and vigorous supporter of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. Edward Labendz, in co-operation with Mr. Joseph Petlak and several other citizens, the strong Polish Masons' and Bricklayers' Society, numbering over one hundred members, will soon become affiliated with the Polish National Alliance, as a group. It will be the first group composed of masters of the trowel who will stand under the national banner. Thus far there were various individual groups of Polish tailors, carpenters and businessmen in the Polish National Alliance. Now the masons are to join the circle that they may also aid in the building of this national edifice. The Alliance extends its cordial invitation to this group.</p>
   <p>The administration of this society is composed of the following members: Messrs. Edward Labendz, president; Joseph Lewanski, vice-president; Stephen Dzwonkiewicz, recording secretary; John Brauer, financial secretary; Charles Buchman, treasurer; Dzierzanowski, Marshal. The meetings of the society are held on the last Thursday of the month, at 8:00 P.M., at Mr. J. Petlak's Hall, at Hamburg and Leavitt Streets.</p>
