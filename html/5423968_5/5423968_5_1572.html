   <p>Each day brings Polish Day at the World's Fair closer to realization. Since the last meeting held at the [Polish World's Fair] Reception Committee's headquarters on the 18th of last month, an announcement on this subject from the citizens in St. Adalbert's Parish appeared in Dziennik Chicagoski. Finally, another meeting was held yesterday in the reception committee's headquarters at 141-143 Division Street, through the initiative and efforts of those who made possible the Polish art lecture and the inauguration of the Polish Art Section in Jackson Park. A considerable number of Poles from our part of the city and from South Chicago attended. The Reverend A. Nowicki was named chairman of the meeting and H. Nagiel was appointed secretary.</p>
   <p>Our readers will probably remember that at the last meeting (Dziennik Chicagoski, July 19, 1893), the Polish Day question was discussed in conjunction with plans for a "Council of Poles". It will also be remembered <span class="page-break">2</span>that the discussion was deferred until it would have been possible to determine the amount of interest this project would arouse in our two large organizations. At yesterday's meeting it was explained that this last aim cannot be realized--that a "Council of Poles," which would require representation of all of American Polonia, would necessitate preparations for which there is no longer enough time left. decided, therefore, to shelve plans for the "Council of Poles" for the time being....and to confine efforts to the Polish Day preparations.</p>
   <p>Before the general discussion began, the announcement from the Poles on the Southwest Side was read to the meeting. The announcement invited all Poles to a meeting on this subject at Pulaski Hall on Saturday, August 19. Since it proved that the Polish Day questions is arousing even greater interest in other Polish communities, the announcement was warmly applauded. The gathering decided to work hand in hand with the Southwest Side group toward the common goal. A delegation will be sent to the Pulaski Hall meeting. In the meantime, action will be taken to heighten general interest in this matter in our own part of the city.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In order that the delegates should not attend the meeting empty-handed, a discussion was begun on the manner in which the Polish Day can be arranged, for definite plans would facilitate proceedings considerably. Stanislaus Szwajkart spoke on this subject, giving a complete description of the floats that should be used in the parade, which will constitute an important part of the program. Among others who spoke on the same subject were Reverend Vincent Parzynski, Reverend A. Nowicki, S. Eahajkiewicz, L. Szopinski, J. Tomaszewski, and L. Machnikowski.</p>
   <p>The twelfth of September, anniversary of Sobieski's defense of Vienna, was decided upon as the day upon which these celebrations would be held. In the event that the time should be too short for the necessary preparation, the date will be postponed to the end of September.</p>
   <p>The gathering decided that the Polish Day program should consist of: (1) a great Polish parade through the center of the city, with floats depicting events in Polish history, and (2) celebrations at the World's <span class="page-break">4</span>Fair. It is planned that all Polish societies will march in the parade, especially the uniformed societies; members of civilian societies will wear some sort of badge. Naturally, bands will accompany the parade. There ought to be about twelve floats in the parade, depending, of course, upon good will and on our ability to meet the costs.</p>
   <p>Among others, the following floats are planned: Jagiello and Jadwiga, a scene depicting Jagiello's envoys asking Jadwiga's hand in marriage; Nicholas Copernicus and his solar system; the Lublin Union (Union of Poles, Lithuanians, and Ruthenians in the sixteenth century); King John Sobieski receiving the Turkish standards; Kosciusko and Pulaski with George Washington; Poland in chains; a scene from Siberian mines; slaughter of the Unites, according to the painting by Elias; and Poles seeking safety beneath the flag of the United States.</p>
   <p>Naturally, floats with pictures of this kind will be very expensive. In order to cover the costs, it was decided, on a motion by Szwajkart, that it <span class="page-break">5</span>would be best to call upon businessmen, organization leaders, etc., to furnish one or more floats each. Polish saloonkeepers, for instance, could furnish one float; newspaper publishers, printers, and editors, the second; Polish doctors and druggists, a third; Polish grocers and bakers, a fourth; Polish women, a fifth; Polish youth, a sixth; and so on. This plan was approved by the gathering. A few offers were made immediately. It was thought possible that the Polish priests would furnish one float; a few South Chicago citizens expressed the hope that that community would also furnish a float. In a word, it is entirely possible that the floats with their living pictures will appear and will be admired.</p>
   <p>It was decided also that it would be proper to include one or more floats with children in Polish national costumes. It will also be necessary to invite the Poles, and more especially the Polish military societies, from neighboring towns and cities, such as Hammond, Lemont, Joliet, South Bend, and even from Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>As to the celebration at the World's Fair, it was agreed that it should <span class="page-break">6</span>start with a great gathering at the Festival Hall, which the directors of the Fair will undoubtedly place at our disposal. The most appropriate program for the celebration would be: two or three speeches in English, one in Polish, a few Polish choral numbers, orchestral music, including Polish national hymns, etc. The celebration would be concluded with a tour of the Fair grounds.</p>
   <p>These, more or less, are the plans for the Polish Day discussed at yesterday's meeting. Naturally, no final decisions have yet been made. Such decisions can be made only after a permanent committee has been formed to take charge of the matter. In the meantime, these are merely preparatory plans.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that the above plans would be presented at the meeting of representatives of Polish societies and businessmen of this part of the city, to be held on Wednesday, August 16, at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall. A committee was named to prepare the announcement that appears in this issue of Dziennik Chicagoski. All details concerning the <span class="page-break">7</span>meeting are contained in this announcement.</p>
   <p>Thus, through the combined efforts of all Poles, working together in harmony, the desired Polish Day will be possible.</p>
