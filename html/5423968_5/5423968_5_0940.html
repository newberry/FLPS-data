   <p>The St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Dramatic Circle presented two outstanding Polish comedies, "Posazna Jedynaczke" (Rich Heiress) and "Falszywego Jakajle" (False Stammerer), at the Polish Hall last night (Sunday). The audience was greatly pleased with the expert presentations and laughed throughout both plays. All the amateur performers were at their best. Some of them displayed the Polish of a finished artist. Their performance left us without a word of criticism. The public deprives itself of fine entertainment by not attending. It is unfortunate that all the seats were not filled.</p>
   <p>Between the acts the following young ladies played on the piano: the Misses Wleklinska, Krolik, Bardonska, Schultz, Panthen, Pyterek, Klatecka, Ostrowska, and Kwasigroch. Duets were rendered by the Misses Kozlowska and Kosinska. Generous applause, which is one of the best mediums of recognition of talent, was accorded all the performers.</p>
   
   <p>This is a good idea of filling the pause between the acts. It is anticipated that at all future performances beautiful solos and duets, played by the sons and daughters of local parents, will be a part of the program.</p>
