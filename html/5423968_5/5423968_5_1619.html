   <p>We have received the following letter from Mr. Sigmund Slupski, with a request to publish it:</p>
   <p>"Allow me to call your attention to the fact that February of this year marked the 420th anniversary of the birth of our great countrymen, the world-famous astronomer Copernicus. This anniversary is always solemnly observed in Poland. Next month, again, will mark the 350th anniversary of his death.</p>
   <p>"Since astronomy and navigation are so closely related, we can place Columbus and Copernicus side by side. On the occasion of the Columbus jubilee, then, it would be perfectly proper to honor the memory of our countryman also in a solemn exercise on May 24. Such a celebration, held during the Exposition, in the eyes of the whole world as it were, would have special significance, for the Germans quite groundlessly claim that Copernicus was not Polish at all, but German. We will show at the same time that we can <span class="page-break">2</span>honor not only the memories of great warriors, but also of those who, rendering invaluable service in the field of knowledge, contributed to the fame of Poland.</p>
   <p>"The time is short; we must act briskly. In every city, but particularly in Chicago, we must arrange the most magnificent celebration possible, even if it should have to be delayed.</p>
   <p>"I would like to remind our countrymen in general of this, and especially those organizations whose duty it is to arrange national exercises."</p>
   <p>Dziennik Chicagoski reserves its comments on this subject for a later issue.</p>
