   <p>Dr. Thaddeus Mitana, outstanding lecturer on Polish language and literature at the University of Michigan, will lecture, on Sunday afternoon, January 15th at 3:30 P.M., in the large hall of the Polish Women's Alliance. The lecture is under the auspices of the Polish Arts Club and is receiving the cooperation of the Department of Education of the Polish Womens Alliance of America. Members and friends will please note that to postpone the lecture from the second to the third week of January, it was necessary to suit the convenience of Dr. Mitana.</p>
   <p>Dr. Mitana delivered a lecture in Chicago a year ago, leaving a very favorable impression with all those who heard and met him. The history of Polish culture from the physical standpoint was the subject of his lecture last year; the subject of his next lecture will be announced as soon as it has been decided upon. Dr. T. Mitana was called to the University of Michigan, one and one-half years ago, as instructor of Polish language, and literature. Last summer Dr. Mitana visited Poland, returning in September again to resume his work at the University. He will, no doubt, have much of interest to tell us concerning the progress of education in Poland. Dr. Mitana will be entertained at the home of Mrs. V. B. Zielinski, president of the Polish Arts Club. Following the lecture on Sunday a supper will be given in his honor by the club members.</p>
