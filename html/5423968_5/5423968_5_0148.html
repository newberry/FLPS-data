   <p>A prominent Pole, Mr. Antoni Zdzieblowski, a talented dramatist and author of many stage plays, such as "The Siberians," "Unfortunate Wives", and others, well-known throughout Polish circles in both the U.S.A. and Europe, has ventured into the field of inventions. He has perfected a folding table which is both useful and practical. The largest model of this table can be hidden in any nook or corner. Because of its compactness its uses are many; that is, it can be used by merchants and manufacturers where space is very limited.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zdzieblowski, was granted a patent for his invention, and many furniture firms are considering the purchase of this patent. The inventor, however, is undecided whether to form a corporation and manufacture this table himself, or to sell the patent outright.</p>
