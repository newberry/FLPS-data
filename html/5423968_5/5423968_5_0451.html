   <p>Inexorable death has taken from us a great musician of the common people, who brought up a whole singing generation of young Poles in America, whose patriotic songs have lighted the burdens of the Polish immigrants in the free land of Washington for a quarter of a century.</p>
   <p>Polonia has lost a worthy citizen, the church has lost one of the best religious poets, the family has lost a most eminent representative, and the singers and musicians have lost their best bard.</p>
   <p>Sincere sorrow touches us to the depths. We will miss him for a long, a very long, time! Honor to his spirit; respect for his tireless work and great deserts!</p>
   
   <p>May God reward him with heaven, may his song and memory live in Polish hearts for ages!</p>
   <p>To the grieving family we send our heartfelt sympathy.</p>
