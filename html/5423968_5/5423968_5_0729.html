   <p>Last night, in Walsh's spacious auditorium, the great music master, Frederic Chopin was feted. The affair was arranged and sponsored by the Chopin No. 1 Zwiazek Spiewakow Polskich (Alliance of Polish Singers, abbreviated as follows: Z.S.P.) of America choral society. In the center of the stage, beautifully decorated with national flags, wreaths, palms, and eagles, was conspicuously set the portrait of Chopin, the creator of the "Funeral March" and other noted compositions.</p>
   <p>An unexpectedly large crown attended. Orderly silence reigned throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>The program, which was not lengthy, was well liked; the selections were greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>A sixteen piece orchestra, under the baton of F. Przybylski took part in the festivities; it offered its services gratis. The rendition of Chopin's "Nocturne", opus 9, No. 2 and of his "Funeral March" was acclaimed by the entire audience.</p>

   <p>The Chopin Choral group, under the direction of Mr. Rybak, sang Chopin's "Funeral March" in his honor. It was noticed that the director, as well as each singer of the choir, gave his best, for when the number was completed the audience applauded with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Guest speakers for this memorable occasion were Reverend W. Zapata, and Reverent S. Orpiszewski. Both paid homage to Chopin's immortal compositions, lauding his efforts enthusiastically, for his songs have embodied th spirit of his people, each note captivating Polish hearts. (The themes of the speeches have penetrated deep into the hearts of the listeners.)</p>
   <p>During this program our celebrated singer, Miss Rose Kwasigroch, honorary member of the Polish Singers Alliance of America, sang with her usual talent "Whose Fault" and "If I were The Sun In The Sky". She was recalled several times by the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>As a solo, Miss Helen Kempski sang Chopin's "Falling Leaves." Her melodious voice captured the entire audience and she was called to repeat the number.</p>
   <p>The "Womens Halka" choir rendered Chopin's "Farewell" with excellence. The audience demanded an encore.</p>
   <p>A collection for a flag for the Polish Singers Alliance brought $23.97.</p>
   <p>Not to be overlooked, the program was opened by Ignace Stankiewicz, president of Chopin's Choir, and Joseph Chmielinski, president of the Western District of the Polish National Alliance, was conductor. Mr. Chmielinski thanked the audience for their great support and ecorous attention. After singing "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland) the audience left, taking home pleasing memories. The short time was not only pleasant but it fulfilled the purpose of the program in honoring the great composer, Chopin.</p>
   <p>Members of Chopin's Choir should be complimented for planning and executing so well this program of Polish song and music.</p>
