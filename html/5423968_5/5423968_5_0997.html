   <p>The St. Cecilia Society Theatrical Entertainment was held yesterday in Schoenhofen Hall, Milwaukee and Ashland Avenues.</p>
   <p>Two one-act comedies were played: "Schadzka" (A Date) and "Stryj Przyjechal" (Uncle Arrived). Those acting in the first comedy were Mrs. Gorzynski, Mr. Huntowski, and Mr. Wieckowski. Mr. Huntowski, as usual, was excellent; Mr. Wieckowski played well, and Mrs. Gorzynski performed her part artistically. She really should appear oftener, and we hope she will shortly be one of our foremost theatrical stars.</p>
   <p>In the comedy "Stryj Przyjechal," the main roles were acted by Mr. John Czekala, Mr. Oszwaldowski, Miss Koppa, and Miss Kryzak. Czekala, as usual, created gales of laughter and applause and all the others played very well.</p>
   <p>The hall was crowded. After the performance a dance was held.</p>
