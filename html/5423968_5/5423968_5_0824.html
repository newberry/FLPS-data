   <p>The Dramatic Circle held a meeting last night, Monday, December 4. After the singing of the Polish national anthem, "Boze Cos Polske" (God Save Poland), the chairman, Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewiez, explained a few facts to the "ladies who do not attend the financial meetings." The outing of the Circle's members to Milwaukee was also debated, and it was finally decided that such an outing is more comfortable and convenient in warmer weather--during April or May.</p>
   <p>After this matter was decided, Miss Kunkowska and Miss Lubowiecka sang a duet. Then Mr. Jozwiakowski, with his well-known vigor, recited "Katedra Na Wawelu" (The Wawel Cathedral).</p>
   <p>Miss Barwig appealed to the hearts of all those present with a patriotic recital entitled "O Polskiej Mowie" (About Polish Speech), and Mr. Oszwaldowski, with praiseworthy modulations of his voice, recited "Na Ukrainie" (In Ukraine).</p>
   <p>A melodious, interesting duet, "Na Dolinie" (In the Valley), by Miss Nering <span class="page-break">\2</span>and Mr. Barwig, enthralled the audience, and the tearful recital by Mr. Wargin and the still more heart-rending solo "O Sierotce" (About an Orphan) by Miss Barwig moved the audience so deeply that the chairman, fearful lest a river of tears be let loose, told a story about a learned man and a fisherman which cleared the countenances and brought smiles from all. After the laughter ended, Mr. Burchardt recited in his pleasant voice a poem, "Ostatny Z Karlinskich" (The Last Karlinski).</p>
   <p>Reverend E. Siedlaczek arose to criticize some matters, and the members, after a lively dispute, passed appropriate resolutions. It was decided that in the future, at every meeting, besides a recital and singing, there should also be read a sketch. Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz agreed to prepare a sketch for the next meeting.</p>
   <p>After singing "Jeszcze Polska" (Poland Is Not Lost), the members adjourned, feeling the evening was spent very congenially and profitably.</p>
