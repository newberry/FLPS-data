   <p>The children's chorus, Morning Star Number Two Illinois District of the Polish Singers' Alliance of America, holds its meeting every Saturday afternoon at three o'clock in the hall of the Sherman Park fieldhouse at 52nd Street. We ask the parents kindly to send their children regularly for every lesson. We shall give a concert in Lent, and so every member of the chorus must be thoroughly prepared. Parents who wish to enroll their children in the chorus may do so at any lesson. The dues are only five cents a month.</p>
   <p>May we also remind parents to return to us any songbooks taken by their children from our practice hall. We bought these songbooks for the chorus and not for individuals. The monthly meeting of the chorus will take place on Monday, January 30, at four o'clock in the afternoon in the hall of the Sherman Park fieldhouse.</p>
   <p>Long live Song!</p>
