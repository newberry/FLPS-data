   <p>We have already written of the victory of the Polish artists exhibiting at the World's Fair in Jackson Park, and of the judgment on Polish paintings. In spite of the protest lodged by the German and Austrian commissioners, the Polish section is permitted to participate in the distribution of awards.</p>
   <p>We feel it our duty to express sincere acknowledgment to a few of the representatives of American Polonia who contributed to the victory by their energetic efforts. One of those who vigorously defended Polish art against the German and Austrian commissioners' attacks was Mr. Erasmus Jerzmanowski, of New York. Upon request from Mr. Sosnowski, who represents the Polish artists, Mr. Jerzmanowski wrote letters to his friends, directors of the Fair, F. S. Winston and K. G. Billings. After receiving encouraging replies, he wrote also to the chairman of the Awards Committee, Mr. Thatcher. These <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>efforts undoubtedly contributed much to the favorable outcome of the matter.</p>
   <p>Here in Chicago, effective steps were taken by Peter Miolbassa and J. F. Smulski. Mr. Smulski attended a meeting of the World's Fair commissioners with Mr. Sosnowski and spoke on the question. The Italian commissioners proved themselves friends of the Poles by lending their support.</p>
   <p>The Poles owe their gratitude to all who helped bring about a decision in our favor.</p>
