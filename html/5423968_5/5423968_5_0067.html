   <p>The Polish Merchant's Association is happy to welcome and add to its membership a new business enterprise under the name of Central Cornice Company. The president of this new firm is Mr. Stanley Porazinski, and Mr. Piatka, the well-known architect, is vice-president. The plant, located at 2940 N. Avers Ave., is employing about twenty-eight people, and will increase this by 50% in the immediate future. This is the only Polish firm of its kind in the city of Chicago. Therefore, all Polish contractors, in ordering material, should remember that we have our own firm which is worthy of support.</p>
