   <p>Through the efforts of the St. Hedwig Society of St. John Cantius Parish, "The Renegade," a drama by H. Laczynski, was presented Saturday evening October 2, at the Aurora Hall, Milwaukee Avenue and Huron Street. The drama was prepared for the stage and directed by Szczesny Zahajkiewicz. It would be redundant to say that the play was a success, since it is one of the favorites of the Polish stage.</p>
   <p>Among the actors were Mrs. P. M. Sikorska, P. T. Wasielewski, F. Osuch, Miss M. Karamel, and A. Medrzyk.</p>
   <p>The only sad note was that the audience that came was rather small.</p>
