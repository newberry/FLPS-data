   <p>Three benefit bazaars have already been held for the Saint John Cantius Parish School, and each time there has been a small profit, even if much further progress has not been attained. Our church stands unfinished while the parish is constantly getting bigger. With this expansion the needs for accommodations become greater. Fortunately, the support from other parishes has not diminished (as evidenced by the list of contributors in Dziennik Chicagoski for the parish bazaar), and as a result we beg that this support be continued at our parish bazaar, which is to open this evening at 7:30 o'clock. The bazaar will be open Saturdays, Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. Admission will be five cents, except this evening, which is free. We anticipate that many of our parishioners will be present. Remember that, as brothers in Christ, we should support one another. If everyone contributes a small sum, the bazaar will be a success and God will send us greater blessings. Let the parishioners be on hand each day at the fair.</p>
