   <p>A group of twenty-two youngsters on the Northwest Side organized a Polish choir on May 19.</p>
   <p>The group will practice music and singing, especially Polish national songs.</p>
   <p>The officers of the new choir are J. Szymanski, president; M. Nowakowski, vice-president; K. Golebiewski, recording secretary; K. Szlachta, treasurer; Z. Perlowski, librarian; A. Majewski, financial secretary; and R. Checinski, host.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hentzel, who is well known among the Poles in Chicago, will be the director, and we expect his services will be eminently satisfactory. Choir practice will be held every Wednesday night at 8 o'clock, in Ignacy Perlowski's hall.</p>

   <p>Perlowski will make no charge for the use of the hall, for which he deserves the thanks of all members.</p>
   <p>Regular choir meetings will be held the second Tuesday of every month, and all those wishing to join may come either to the meeting or to the choir practice.</p>
   <p>The group's name is "Choir of Polish Singers, of Paderewski in Chicago."</p>
   <p>In the near future, the choir will join the Polish Singers Alliance of America.</p>
