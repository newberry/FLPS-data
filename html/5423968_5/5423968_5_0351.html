   <p>Whoever passes by the streets, in the neighborhood of Milwaukee and Noble Street, must have noticed the Polish business establishments going out of business while others not only stay in business but manage to make nice profits. The Poles, are forced to close their establishments, because they cannot meet their expenses. When you pass some of the stores you will be dragged in by the arms and find yourself in the hands of a Jew and bidding for some article that you may need. But never fear he will meet your price. Many of our Poles, especially the women folks, claim they have saved money by their ability of knowing how to "Jew down".</p>
   <p>Naturally our Polish business men do not use this method, although their prices are not any higher than the Jews, and don't seem to progress in their trade.</p>
   
   <p>We should be ashamed of ourselves, that we take our hard earned money to the others, instead of to our Polish business man.</p>
   <p>The Jew or German would never aid a Pole, if he were in need, and not one cent would he give for Polish affairs, although from the Poles he manages to secure his wealth. So then for this reason we wish you would patronize your fellow-countryman and not others.</p>
