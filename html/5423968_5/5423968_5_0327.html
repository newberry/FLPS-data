   <p>Building and loan associations under the statutes of the State of Illinois have long existed among the Poles of Chicago. The main purpose of these associations is to grant loans to the shareholders for the purchase of real-estate and for the construction of homes. The resources are derived from the weekly or monthly dues, and depend on the number of shares bought. Usually, the loan made to the shareholder is not more than two-thirds the value of the home he is building on his own grounds. The building association collects from six to eight percent interest from the shareholder on this loan, along with the so-called premium which is variable with the size of the loan. The capital loaned is repaid to the association by means of these weekly or monthly rates on which is placed an interest charge and sometimes a premium.</p>
   
   <p>Those who pay their dues regularly and do not make a loan save money in the same way. As soon as the shares reach a nominal value, the shareholder receives the principal from the association. On the other hand, for those who have made a loan from the association, the debt is discharged.</p>
   <p>The earlier associations of a similar nature differed from these in that they were more profitable because, with the exception of the secretary, no other officer was paid. Besides this, the halls for meetings were secured either free of charge of very reasonably. Therefore, the benefits were greater and the associations more prosperous. The associations which collected twenty-five cents on a share were able to pay one hundred dollars for each share within five years and about two of three months.</p>
   <p>The first association among the Poles to decide upon the collection of twelve and one-half cents a share was the Polish National Building and Loan Association, founded in 1883. According to calculations, it would take about eight years for the shares to reach their par value of one hundred dollars. This duly incorporated association has been operating since April 6, 1888. New series are opened quarterly, at which time new shareholders may join the association.</p>
   <p>The first directors of this association were Messrs. M. Osuch, president; P. Binkowski, vice-president; I.N. Morgenstern, secretary; J.A. Adamowski, assistant secretary; A.J. Kowalski, treasurer; K. Szeszycki, R. Meclewski, J. Klosowski, and M.Rzeszotarski. The association secured a considerable number of shareholders, for in the first series over twelve hundred shares were sold.</p>
   <p>After a year and a half, this association met with a catastrophe. The secretary, I.N. Morgenstern, upon losing his position after the convention of the Polish National Alliance, disappeared with a few hundred dollars. Naturally, this created a panic among the shareholders, although the sum was comparatively small and, in any case, easily replaceable, since it was insured. The more broad-minded shareholders decided at a shareholders' meeting that the members of the association should cover this loss, for by so doing the value of a share would depreciate only a small fraction of a cent--a loss which no one would feel. In spite of this, many shareholders began to drop out and to withdraw their investments to such an extent that within six months the association was unable to make any new loans, at the same time being compelled to pay out the money for the withdrawn shares.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the energetic efforts of the president, Mr. M. Osuch, and other directors, and, as well, to the faith inspired by the new secretary, Mr. S. Szwajkart, and the new notary public, Mr. John F. Smulski, the association survived this misfortune. Today it is progressing nicely, with the eighteenth series already opened, and a considerable gain showing in every quarterly statement. In the first quarterly series following the misfortune, at the most only about one hundred to two hundred shares were sold, whereas in the sixteenth series this had increased to over 640 shares.</p>
   <p>The most inspiring facts are that, by the provisions of the new charter, the yearly accounts are sent to the State Auditor; and, also, the fact that this is the first building association to do so.</p>
   <p>The present administration consists of Messrs. M. Osuch, president; R. Meclewski, vice-president; S. Szwajkart, secretary; F. Romanowski, assistant secretary; T. Nalepinski, treasurer; J. Adamowski, K. Dorszynski, G. Litewski, J. Sztermer, and J. F. Smulski, the notary public.</p>
   <p>The loans made to the members during its four-year existence amounted to seventy thousand dollars. New series are opened on the first Fridays of January, April, July, and October. Regular meetings are held every Friday. The address of the secretary is: S. Szwajkart, 141-143 West Division Street.</p>
