   <p>For the first time since the organization of Ravinia Park, over fifteen years ago, Polish music and Polish songs will be heard by the many hundreds of music lovers who gather there every Sunday afternoon during the summer concerts and opera season.</p>
   <p>Every good American citizen of Polish birth or extraction who can afford the small expense ($2 including railroad fare). should try to attend on the afternoon sponsored by the Polish Arts Club; because if the number of tickets guaranteed by the Club is not sold, such a program will never be arranged again as the management of the Ravinia Company would say, "You Poles are not interested in your own music".</p>
   <p>The first number on the orchestral program will be Richard Wagner's inspiring intermezzo "Polonia", which is based on familiar Polish themes; "Poland is not Dead Yet", and many others. Compositions by Paderewski and other Polish composers will follow. Finally, our own Janina Burska, (Mme. Ina Bourskaya) of the Metropolitan Opera of New York, will sing three songs - one by Zelenski, another by Noskowski, and the third by Kosobudzki.</p>

   <p>If we are there one thousand strong, there no doubt will be many encores.</p>
   <p>If you do not have a ticket as yet, be sure to get one for only $1, which includes admission to the park and concert auditorium.</p>
