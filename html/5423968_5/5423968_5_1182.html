   <p>Saturday's parade of the members of the Alliance of Polish Military Societies, marching through the Loop to Grant Park, made a very nice showing.</p>
   <p>The parade, which started at 4 P. M. from Division Street and Marshfield Avenue, was headed by a detachment of cavalry consisting of about thirty stalwart men on powerful horses. This was followed by infantry. The hospital division closed the parade.</p>
   <p>The weather was fine for the marchers. Wherever the Polish soldiers marched, crowds gathered to watch them. Frequently cheers were heard in honor of our soldiers. [uniformed members of so-called Polish military societies].</p>
