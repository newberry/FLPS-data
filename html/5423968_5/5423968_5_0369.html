   <p>We are about to hear the Polish artist Mr. Mieceslaus Ziolkowski who has just arrived in America from Poland. His concert in Kimball Hall is sponsored by an American producer, Bertha Ott.</p>
   <p>The unusual programs have attracted the attention of critics who recognized the talent displayed at our concerts. At the conclusion of Mr. Paderwski's performance, at the University of Poznan, he requested the Polish artist, Mr. Meceslaus Ziolkowski, to play his own composition.</p>
   <p>Mr. Paderwski's enthusiasm for the composer Mr. Meceslaus Ziolowski was beyond measure. The maestro invited the young musician to his magnificent villa in Morges, Switzerland, where music was discussed for hours.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meceslaus Ziolkowski will appear in a series of concerts, which mark the implanting of Polish culture in the United States. We are delighted to share this news with our readers, who are proud of their Polish name.</p>
   <p>In future editions, we will publish, without exception, all unusual criticisms of our great poet pianist. We are exceedingly happy to know that the lovers of music in our society are interested in the unusual talent of this Polish artist.</p>
