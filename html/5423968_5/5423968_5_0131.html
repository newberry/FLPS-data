   <p>The thirtieth anniversary of the Polish Businessmen's Society, Group 3 of the Polish National Alliance, was celebrated with a banquet on October 22, 1910. That the entire affair was a huge success can be attested by all who participated. At 9 P. M. Pulaski Hall began to be filed with members of the society and their families. The dance was in full sway to the melodious strains of Mr. Skowronski's orchestra.</p>
   <p>At 11 P. M., Mr. Blaszczynski appeared upon the stage and delivered a brief, but very sincere, speech. In it he noted that thirty years have elapsed since the founding of the society and that only four members who built this association are still alive. Those, he said, who have left us permanently have left not just a memory of themselves, but a great deal more--they have left their proxies in the persons of their children.</p>
   <p>The following speaker, the well-known Mr. K. Zychlinski, was greeted with tumultuous applause. He spoke at length and pointed out the straight road, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which is shown to our people by the greatest and most powerful Polish organization, that is, the Polish National Alliance. The Poles should be motivated by the feeling that there is a certain goal toward which every emigrant Pole should strive, and the most certain way to attain it is to follow the path indicated by the Polish National Alliance, because it was recognized and approved by the Polish people living in our motherland. The distinguished speaker was interrupted frequently by waves of hearty applause, and at the conclusion of his speech it seemed as if there would be no end to the manifestation of the peoples' approval.</p>
   <p>At 12 noon, the president of the society, Mr. Blaszczynski, and Miss P. Brukwicka, as the first pair, and Mr. Brukwicki and Miss Bak, as the second pair, led the Polish dance known as the polonaise, in which 150 pairs of dancers joined. The happy and friendly affair lasted until 6 A. M., when all left for their respective houses.</p>
