   <p>I wish to thank the firm of E. L. Schultz for their help in patenting my two inventions.</p>
   <p>The knowledge possessed by Engineer Schultz in the realm of inventions deserves the attention of every Pole in America contemplating or an improvement of an invention. I had been thinking for some years past about realizing my projects, but on receiving discouraging advice from incompetent people, who demanded large sums of money to patent my ideas, I decided to postpone matters until a more favorable opportunity. I was also unwilling to entrust my ideas to any foreigners, for fear they would appropriate it for themselves, so was practically forced to forget about them. Unaware of the rewards from these inventions, I did not hurry to get my patents. Today, thanks to Mr. E. L. Schultz, I heard the wonderful news that my ideas have a real value and may be very beneficial to the human race.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>F. F. Sawadzki</p>
