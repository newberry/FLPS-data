   <p>The St. Stanislaus Kostka Young Men's Society presented a five-act play, "Wesele Na Podlasiv" [Wedding in the Woods], last night at the St. Mary of Perpetual Help Parish Hall. A capacity crowd came to see this historic drama. The amateurs did not disappoint the audience, for their acting was of the best.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's performance demonstrates that the Polish youth of this parish does not take a back seat for any other similar group. They can be compared to the St. Casimir Young Men's Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. Whenever a helping hand is needed, the St. Stanislaus Kostka Young Men's Society is ready to help. May God help them in their future work.</p>
   <p>The net profit of this play was turned over to a fund to buy an iron fence for the church.</p>

   <p>It is difficult to say which of the amateurs acted the best. It would be fairer to say that all were excellent. A fine job was done by the stage director, Miecislas Klarkowski.</p>
