   <p>The Stanislaus Moniuszko choir and Dramatic club is sponsoring a dance and choir singing on October 27, 1912, at Klacela Hall, 19th and Leavitt Sts.</p>
   <p>The committee has arranged a splendid and very interesting program for this evening.</p>
   <p>The Moniuszko choir and Dramatic club deserves the support of the Poles of Chicago and vicinity, therefore we assume that the hall will be crowded to capacity.</p>
