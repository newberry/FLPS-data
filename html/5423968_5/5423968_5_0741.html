   <p>Tomorrow night there shall be a concert of the Singers' Organization in the Walsh Hall. The fact is that not only shall our famous Chicago songstress Miss Rosa Kwasigroch participate at this concert, but also other famous people shall be our guests. Mr. Rosenthal from St. Paul, one of the best Polish baritone singers in America -- and Miss Clementine Mallek from Milwaukee also has a very remarkable and splendid voice. We urge all of the Poles to be present at this interesting concert and give the artists a splendid reception.</p>
