   <p>Saturday was one of the liveliest days at our Fair.</p>
   <p>The Choir of Saint Gregory and the Dramatic Circle attended in a body and enjoyed themselves until late at night, sparing neither the throat nor the pocket, to the accompaniment of the orchestral music.</p>
   <p>They sang, toasted each other, and played the various games until the lateness of the hour forced them to go home.</p>
   <p>The same thing happened yesterday.</p>
   <p>A great crowd of people attended, all anxious to win the sensational "talking donkey". He is a constant attraction for amateurs who seek something new. Shortly after as somebody wins him and takes him away, he comes back to change ownership again. Yesterday Mrs. S.K. won him.</p>

   <p>The fair has indeed become a place of lively interest.</p>
   <p>The St. Joseph Society of the St. John Cantius parish and the St. Joseph Society of the St. Stanislaus Kostka parish gave a good account of themselves.</p>
