   <p>The first day of the New Year was started in grand style at the Illinois College of Music and Dramatic Art, which is under the direction of Marion S. Rozycki. A special entertainment program apropos the holiday season was given. A capacity crowd attended the festivities despite the severity of the weather. Parents, children, followers, and teachers filled the hall at Wicker Park, on Sunday evening.</p>
   <p>The musical program was opened by the young string orchestra, under the direction of Mrs. Wanda Simbor-Manke, which played Schubert's "March Militaire." The second number on the program was the presentation of the scenic epilogue "A Scouts Trip to Fairyland." The students of the school, both boys and girls, took part in the play. The stage and musical direction was handled by Miss Leokadja Ziemba. She not only showed that she was an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>able director of the orchestra but also a talented stage director. The amateurs gave their best. The orchestra gave a splendid rendition of their numbers throughout the play. Their harmonious tunes added color to the songs of the singers on the stage. A great hand was given to both at the conclusion of the play. A silver cup was presented to Miss Ziemba by the college. Incidentally, this was her first [or debut] appearance as a music director.</p>
   <p>During the course of the play Miss Ziemba recited Barclay's beautiful verse "The Wheels of Time." A monologue was executed in professional style by Miss L. Rozycka. The title was "The Cullud Lady on the Phone." It was given in humorous and rapturous style. Another monologue was presented by Miss A. Rozycka, it was "The Youngest in the Family." All received generous applause.</p>
   <p>"Around the Christmas Tree" by Tobani was the next musical number to be played by the orchestra, under the baton of Miss Ziemba.</p>

   <p>After the program Mrs. E. Jensen was honored with a silver cup for her work. Mrs. Jensen was the piano accompanist throughout the evening.</p>
   <p>At the very close, Mr. Rozycki, the director of the school, came out on the stage and thanked the entire audience for their support and cooperation in making the New Year's program a success. He announced that the school has initiated something new in its annals. Hereafter, every Saturday afternoon, beginning at four P.M. parents are free to bring their children to attend special programs at 2021 North Western Avenue. A variety program will be presented each week without cost.

Santa Claus will present a gift to all, he concluded.</p>
