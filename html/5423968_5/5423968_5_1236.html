   <p>A Fair for the benefit of the St. Hyacinth parish will be held every Saturday and Sunday during the month of September, from three o'clock in the afternoon to eight o'clock in the evening, on the church premises.</p>
   <p>A wooden shed has been built for this occasion in the churchyard, where the wheels of chance will be located.</p>
   <p>Buffet and restaurant service will be located in school classrooms, and if any of our guests wish to breathe our pure, sweet air, they may occupy seats at tables under the open sky, where, in the company of their friends, they may enjoy themselves listening to the wonderful music and participating in this Church benefit.</p>
   <p>Admission to the Fair is free.</p>
   
   <p>We, the poor people of Avondale, cordially invite all our Polish countrymen to our Fair, and hope that they will contribute their help as generously as possible. Every penny spent at the Fair is a charitable donation to the church, which is in such dire need of help.</p>
   <p>I especially extend a sincere invitation to those countrymen who have purchased property in our St. Hyacinth parish, and who will, in time, become members of our parish.</p>
   <p>Reverend Joseph Gieburowski,</p>
   <p>Pastor of St. Hyacinth's Parish.</p>
