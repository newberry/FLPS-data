   <p>One of the outstanding entertainment programs of the year was presented last night at the regular monthly meeting of the Young Ladies' Choir of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish. The bill listed no less than twenty-seven numbers.</p>
   <p>Outstanding patriotic declamations were delivered by the Misses Gierzk, Frydrychowicz, Bardonska, Michalak, Trzuciel, Ciemiecka, Suchomska, Rozniakowski, Maciejowska, Ignatowska, Dabrowska, Kaminska, Ciesinska, Lubinska, Sonnenbeck, and Czerwinska.</p>
   <p>Especial credit is due to Sophia Knapinska for her recitation.</p>
   <p>Piano solos were expertly executed by the Misses M. Pyterek, M. Schultz, M. Bardonska, F. Ostrowska, and Klatecka. Beautiful solo melodies were sung by the Misses Wirkus, Ochwat, and A. Krolik.</p>
   <p>Outstanding performances were the duet numbers given by the Misses Kozlowska and Frdrychowicz and others. The Tautma Choir, under the direction of A. Kwasigroch, choirmaster of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Church, sang a number of enchanting airs.</p>
   <p>Ordinarily this choir does not seek publicity; however, this performance was so elaborate that it merits mention. Great results are expected from such a group, which works earnestly and quietly. May God bless your efforts.</p>
   <p>The chaplain of this group is the Reverend F. Gordon, C. R.</p>
