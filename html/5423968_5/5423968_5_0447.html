   <p>At the meeting of the St. Cecilia's Choir of St. Wenceslaus Parish, in the district of Avondale, on the news of the death of Anthony Mallek, father of Polish song in America, a resolution was unanimously accepted expressing honor to the memory of him who elevated Polish song here in a foreign land to the heights and who established it permanently here among us. He was justly considered the father of Polish song in America. The St. Cecilia's Choir has deeply felt the loss of this worker in the field of song and music, and in quiet concentration over the grave of this worthy colleague decided to express its sincere sorrow at this irreparable loss and to send the orphaned family, plunged in sorrow, its condolences through the paper.</p>
