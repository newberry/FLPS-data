   <p>The Polish Philharmonic Society sponsors the presentation of symphonic compositions by Polish composers to the American musical public.</p>
   <p>The field of Polish symphonic literature is unusually rich and interesting, and thus we find that the concerts given by the Co-operative Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Mr. Edmund Zygman, are engaging the attentions of a circle of music lovers.</p>
   <p>The first two concerts given by the orchestra in November 1925 and May 1926 were an artistic success, and elicited much favorable criticism from professional sources.</p>
   <p>The Polish Philharmonic Society will give several concerts during the season of 1926-1927, which will illustrate the modern trend of Polish composers like Rozychi, Karlowicz, Szymanowski, Paderewski, Fitelberg and others.</p>

   <p>Inasmuch as this society is one of the few cultural factors of our community life, it deserves our unqualified support.</p>
