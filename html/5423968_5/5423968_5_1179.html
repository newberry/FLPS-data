   <p>The long-advertised and well-prepared bazaar in Holy Trinity Parish started with great success yesterday afternoon (October 7), thanks to the generous support of the local societies, families, and individuals. It was the task of the Alliance of Polish military societies and the mothers of Holy Trinity Parish to open this bazaar on a large scale. The societies of the Alliance worked energetically. They gathered, in uniform, in front of Holy Trinity Church in considerable numbers, together with the Holy Trinity Band, at about four o'clock in the afternoon and paraded down Noble Street, arriving finally at the new school building on Division and Cleaver Streets. The parade of military societies was at once a gala opening of the bazaar, a fine advertisement of it in Holy Trinity Parish, and an invitation to the public to participate.</p>
   <p>The mothers of Holy Trinity Parish gathered in great numbers, showing by this their own great interest in the bazaar and their willingness to support an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>enterprise for so noble a cause, as the bazaar is being held for the benefit of the new school. Amongst others, we noticed many members of St. Mary of Perpetual Help Society, the Patriotic Polish Womens' Club, the Apostles of Prayer, the Rosary Women's Society, and the Association of Holy Trinity Choirs.</p>
   <p>With such willing and active participation of the parishioners, the opening of the great bazaar was eminently successful. From the time of its solemn opening to the late hours of the evening, people kept arriving in sizable groups, so that the large parish hall was always filled and active.</p>
   <p>The preparations in the hall presented a splendid picture. The booths are arranged very well and it needs but one look to see that the various local societies which undertook to conduct them have done their jobs carefully.</p>
   <p>Yes, the bazaar gives promise of great success, especially if one takes into consideration the present high prices which, amongst our people, who are on the average none too well off, have begun to make themselves felt. But despite high <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>prices, we give whatever we can. We shall bring this bazaar to a conclusion as successful as its beginning. And so, ladies and gentlemen who attended yesterday, tell your friends and neighbors about it. Tell them what you saw, tell them about the arrangement of the booths, of the amusements, and of the capable, courteous service rendered by the men, women, young men, and young women who are working to make the bazaar a success. You need tell them nothing more, just describe honestly what you have seen and you can be sure that your friends and neighbors will also come to the bazaar.</p>
   <p>This evening, the bazaar will be conducted by the Womens' Auxiliary of the Catholic Order of Foresters, the Free Polish Women in the Land of Washington, and the Citizens' Clubs of this parish.</p>
