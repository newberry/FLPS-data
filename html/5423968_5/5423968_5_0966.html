   <p>The Dramatic Circle of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish has donated one half of its net profit from a play, "Two Orphans," staged on January 10, to the Holy Family Orphanage. The contribution amounts to thirty-two dollars.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to J. Jarzembowski for offering free transportation to and from town in order to deliver costumes used in the play. This kind gesture made possible a savings of two dollars, which should be considered as a direct donation on the part of Mr. Jarzembowski.</p>
