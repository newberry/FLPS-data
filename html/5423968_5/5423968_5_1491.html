   <p>Polish Day preparations are definitely under way at St. Hedwig's parish. St. Hedwig's Society, listing eighty-four members, has decided to participate in the celebration and will pay the fifteen-cent-per-member assessment. It is hoped that other societies will also lend their support to the project.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed at a meeting held last night for the collection of donations in this community. The committee consists of J. Sakwinski, F. Szczepanski, J. Warszynski, J. Jablonski, K. Armknecht, M. Niwczyk, S. Fruzyna, F. Jaktorowski, and A. Glowczewski. Donations amounting to forty-seven dollars were collected immediately. [Itemized list of donors omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>On next Thursday, September 14, a meeting of society representatives will be held at the St. Hedwig's parish hall for further discussion of this matter.</p>
