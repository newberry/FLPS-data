   <p>The first Polish exhibit of commerce and industry, which was held during the past week at the home of the Polish R. C. Union, closed yesterday. It was successful beyond all expectations.</p>
   <p>Credit is due those who arranged the exhibit and especially to Attorney Bisek, who with courage overcame various difficulties and obstacles, and started a good thing, which we hope will be accepted.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, for example, about 3600 persons attended the exhibit which vouches for what universal interest was awakened by the exhibit. The satisfaction of the exhibitors also attests the fact, because throughout that week their business was good and due to their insistence, the exhibit was extended another day.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion, moving pictures were taken of the exhibit by D. Goff, Inc. These pictures will be shown in local theatres. Pictures of almost every booth were taken. This will be an excellent memento of the first Polish exhibit.</p>
