   <p>Considering that inexorable death has taken from our midst and the midst of the Polish emigres in America a noble, sincere, and true Pole, Anthony Mallek, father of Polish song in America, a good adviser, and official notary of our association; and</p>
   <p>Considering further that Anthony Mallek encouraged young Polish-Americans in every way possible toward productive efforts in the social field; and</p>
   <p>Considering that our young people have been deprived of a wise councillor and friend,</p>
   <p>We the undersigned directors of the Alliance Building and Loan Association and former pupils of the deceased do hereby offer the widow and family our sincerest sympathy in their hour of grief.</p>
