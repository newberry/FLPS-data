   <p>A quiet marriage of Stanislaus Szukalski, eccentric Polish artist-sculptor, with Miss Helen Walker, took place yesterday. The news about the probable marriage of these two was received with interest in the circles of the financial aristocracy. Evidently the father of the young bride, Dr. Walker, agreed to their union, because there was no objection on his part.</p>
   <p>The sensational American newspapers having become very much interested in Szukalski, have written extensively about him as well as the marriage. The reporters insisted on knowing the date of the marriage, when Szukalski called for the license. The mysterious artist suggested that they study the "mysterious ouija board" and they will positively find out. The marriage took place yesterday in the St. James Protestant Church. After the ceremony the young couple left for a trip to Toronto, Canada.</p>
