   <p>Dear citizens and members of St. Stanislaus Kostka's Parish:</p>
   <p>The Parish Fair will open tonight. The purpose of the Fair is well known to the public. The committees are prepared to meet and accommodate you and your families at the newly furnished parish hall. This will provide a splendid opportunity for wholesome entertainment in the free hours of the evening.</p>
   <p>The Fair will be open every day with the exception of Wednesdays, Fridays, and St. Stanislaus Day, which is a parish holiday. The Fair will also be open on Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving Day.</p>
   <p>On November 26, that is Thanksgiving Day, there will be a regular Thanksgiving dinner for those who desire it.</p>
   
   <p>We hope that all members of the parish--men and women, boys and girls--will participate in this Fair. We hope that the idea of the church tower with gold crosses will draw all members of the parish and all Poles in America.</p>
   <p>We hope that the church of St. Stanislaus Kostka will be finished completely, and that our parish will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its founding and invite all neighbors to the celebration.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill., Nov. 6, 1891. Signed (in the name of the Parish Committees): John Kortas, Albert Jedrzejek, John Maca, Paul Ratkowski, Frank Wleklinski, Joseph Paszkiewicz, Theodore Ostrowski, Thaddeus Krolik, Rev. Vincent Barzynski.</p>
