   <p>On Wednesday, February 19, the Polish Landlords' Protective Association of Chicago was incorporated in Springfield, Illinois. The following signed the papers: Frank A. Bieszki, August J. Kowalski, John F. Smulski, Isidor Komorowski, and others.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the Association is to protect landlords from tenants who do not pay their rent, or who pay it irregularly. The names of such tenants will be entered on a blacklist, for the convenience of landlords who are members of this Association, so that they can know to whom to refuse to rent.</p>
   <p>Members will pay one dollar and fifty cents a year for each tenant, which will be used to maintain the office. Actual business of the Association will not begin, however, until May 1, although the office at 602 Noble Street will be open in a few days.</p>

   <p>This office will also collect rents, and will employ its own attorneys and constables. Such a business is a necessity in our community, as it will stop the landlords from being victimized. The membership of the Association is composed of citizens of this locality, namely St. Stanislaus Kostka parish.</p>
