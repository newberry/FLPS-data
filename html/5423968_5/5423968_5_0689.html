   <p>A musical contest was held in the conservatory at the Chicago College of Music, at Milwaukee Ave. A Polish girl, Miss Constance Krenz, the daughter of a shoe store proprietor at Milwaukee Ave. and Noble St. was awarded a gold medal. On Friday a second contest will be held. The winner will be given a diamond medal, and at the termination of this school-year will be enrolled as a soloist with Thomas' orchestra at the auditorium. We extend a hearty wish for her success.</p>
