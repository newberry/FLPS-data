   <p>At the meeting of Polish businessmen and officers of Polish societies held on the sixteenth of this month to discuss Polish Day arrangements, it was decided to call upon businessmen and representatives of various professions to furnish floats for the Polish Day parade. It was also decided to call a special meeting of Polish businessmen of this part of the city, in order to determine the extent to which they can contribute to the efforts now being made for a Polish Day celebration. The meeting will be held on Friday, August 17, at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall at 7:30 in the evening.</p>
   <p>In behalf of the citizens who met on Wednesday, we invite all Polish businessmen to favor us with their presence. We ask that all efforts be extended to make this Day possible, that the honor of Chicago Poles may be vindicated. We appeal to you to contribute, though the times are hard. Let <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>us remember, however, that sacrifices are unavoidable if we are to prove to the world that Poland still lives and that we are her faithful sons. With best wishes,</p>
   <p>W. Jedrzejek,</p>
   <p>president of the meeting.</p>
   <p>H. Nagiel, secretary.</p>
