   <p>In an earlier issue, we mentioned the idea of a Polish Day at the World's Fair suggested by Kuryer Polski of Milwaukee and supported by the Chicago Gezeta Katolicka. Celebrations on the order of those conducted by states, other national groups, and organizations are suggested.</p>
   <p>We set aside the fact that a few months ago Dziennik Chicagoski was the first to ask American Polonia: Is it not the Poles' duty to celebrate a special day at the World's Fair? We are not concerned with the origin of the idea; we are concerned primarily with the idea itself, which, in any case, is worthy of consideration. We willingly devote some space in our columns to it.</p>
   
   <p>It is true that Kuryer Polski was the first to discuss the projected Polish Day in detail. We can omit the reasons for which this paper urges such a celebration; they are obvious. The idea is to show that we exist as Poles, that we have not forgotten our homeland and past, and finally, that we already constitute something of a power here in the United States. In principle, the idea of such a manifestation is sound, especially during a great exposition which represents all the peoples of the world. The main point is how to accomplish it. Can it be accomplished? As to the activities or the Day itself, it is suggested that there be a great parade of Polish uniformed societies, including triumphal floats upon which would be grouped figures representing Copernicus and his solar system, King John Sobieski, Kosciusko, Pulaski, Washington, Mickiewicz, and others. Naturally, the program would include appropriate speeches, music, etc. As to the possibility of accomplishing this, it is thought that the Poles here ought to have sufficient energy and means for its realization; the fact that two great Polish organizations are soon to open their conventions should simplify the matter.</p>
   
   <p>The proposed Polish Day has been treated with considerable interest in Polish-American newspapers. Echo praises the idea and sees difficulty only in the fact that the conventions of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and of the Polish National Alliance will occur at different times. Polak w Ameryce is also enthusiastic, but would like to have it a "Polish Catholic Day"; Gazeta Polska [published in Chicago] warmly supports the idea and suggests that a great celebration be held on August 12, commemorating the 210th anniversary of Sobieski's defense of Vienna. Finally, Wiara I Ojczyzna [published in Chicago] remarks pertinently that the celebration should be a solemn one, that it ought not to be of a joyous nature, in view of the present sad fate of our homeland. It states further that it would be of equal importance to call a great mass meeting (Wiec) of Poles during the Exposition, for the purpose of discussing important matters, both of America and of Poland, concerning ourselves.</p>
   
   <p>As can be seen, the idea is acceptable in principle to everyone. The problem is how to put it into effect. Dziennik Chicagoski is definitely of the same opinion as Wiara I Ojczyzna. Less parade and festivity, and more usefulness of purpose--as would result from such an exchange of thoughts and opinions, and from decisions that might be reached at a general council of Poles--such is Wiara I Ojczyzna's opinion. The observation is a pertinent one. A general council of Poles, a nonpartisan gathering of representatives of all American Polonia, has been proposed more than once by the Polish-American press. If it is ever to be an actuality, the most appropriate time is this exposition year, a year during which many conventions will be held in Chicago. Such a council would serve to bring our oppressed homeland before the public eye, to raise that protest of which we have so often, though unavailingly, thought and spoken. In our opinion, the council should be the most important consideration, while one of the days during which it is held could be designated Polish Day and marked with parades, processions, etc. Only in this way could it be realized. Undoubtedly, a Polish Day, if it can be arranged, will cost much effort and money. If this effort and money are forthcoming, let their fruit be something more than a mere parade; let it be something profounder, more serious, an exchange of viewpoints on a broader scale, the beginnings of a national organization on more general lines; let it record our position on matters of general importance; let it be a political act in the form of a protest or otherwise, etc. All of this can be achieved only by a general council of Poles. It is our opinion, then, that a council of Poles be held and, upon this occasion, a Polish Day be celebrated at the World's Fair--on a smaller scale, perhaps without expensive triumphal floats. We do not deceive ourselves--we see in advance the difficulties ahead.</p>
   <p>The difficulties are great. How shall the necessary expenses be met? How shall we arouse the interest of Poles not of Chicago, without whom neither the Council nor the Day can have any general significance? Who will direct it? Is there still time enough for the necessary preparations? Will not the conventions of our two organizations, occurring at different times, be a hindrance rather than a help to a third general convention? These are some of the questions that suggest themselves. All of them might be satisfactorily answered. But the greatest obstacle remains, an obstacle that is well-nigh unsurmountable--the lack of unity amongst American Poles, the misunderstandings and jealousies, which (if only the writer of these words be a poor prophet!) will never permit all of the Poles, without exception, to gather together and go forward hand in hand.</p>
   <p>So, the obstacles to a council of Poles and to a Polish Day are great; they do not, however, authorize us to remain inactive. Let us push them aside. Let a group of well-wishing people meet and discuss the matter. Let a plan be proposed and placed before the convention of each organization, demanding co-operation. Let all American Polonia be asked to help. And we shall see that in spite of antagonism, in spite of all obstacles, this beautiful project can be realized.</p>
