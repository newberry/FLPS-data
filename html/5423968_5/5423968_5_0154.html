   <p>From all sides we hear menacing complaints about the steady increase of prices of staple articles and factory products; a tendency which has been repeating itself year after year. There are several outstanding causes which force market prices upward, the first of which is the steadily increasing demand on the market. The second lies in the raising of the workingman's wages, while the third, and most important factor lies in the operation of big industry. Based on large capital, industry creates exchanges, and establishes trusts; and, by these dictates such market prices as it deems attainable.</p>
   <p>Because of the high tariff which bars the foreign manufacturer from our markets, foreign competition is not feared by our industrialists, who, in many fields control the markets. Rising prices hit, not only the consumer, but also the merchant as the middleman, whose income was reduced to a minimum. Rather than discourage the customers or indulge in controversy over the proportionate raise of price, he will sell at the lowest possible margin. High and steadily rising rent, increased wages, overhead and expenses in general, add to the many burdens of the merchant; depriving him of a profitable income. The only recourse a merchant has in a situation of this kind is to establish or join trade groups; thus, merchandise is bought in larger quantities at a lesser price, which enables the merchant to sell at a better profit.</p>

   <p>Forming merchant groups, will make it possible to consume the usurping impulses of the manufacturers, and even to boycott the unjust middlemen. Such trading and mercantile groups could organize factories and other enterprises, of their own, and have a ready market for their own group. We believe therefore, that the merchant should accept this suggestion with genuine regard for the betterment of his existence, and for the welfare of his employees as well as that of his family.</p>
   <p>We hope that this suggestion will be regarded in a grave manner by the Polish Businessmen's Association and it is for this reason that we are bringing up that matter today; and shall do so again and again, until we see the coveted results.</p>
