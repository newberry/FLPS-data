   <p>The Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, received the following letter:</p>
   <p>"Twenty-two years have already elapsed from the time when the Chopin Choral Society founded its work in the interest of Polish songs. Almost a quarter of a century of difficult and tedious work has not brought any great financial wealth to the society because that work is dedicated to an ideal, to the Polish people and to the maintenance of Polish songs. The Chopin Choir has not only itself organized a choral society during its twenty-two years of existence, but has also instituted Polish national choirs at other cities-- it encouraged the lovers of song to work, and in that way our great Alliance of Polish Singers in America was organized. This alliance is affiliated with our greatest Polish organization, that is, with the Polish National Alliance.</p>

   <p>"Not everyone is aware of the fact that a member of the choral society not only sacrifices a great deal of his spare time, which he would rather spend in the open air than in standing for two hours, studying and obeying the director's commands, but besides this he must also pay large dues so that a choir of this type may exist, that it may be prepared to appear with beautiful songs at every invitation. Consequently, every choir, and especially the Chopin Choir, which is always ready for performances, be they funerals, weddings, national exercises, jubilees, dedications of banners of our Alliance groups or, again, for a concert of national choral societies--a choir of that type has enormous monthly expenses and a very small income.</p>
   <p>"In order that the now diminishing financial condition may be strengthened, the Chopin Choir will give its annual concert October 2, 1910. Every right - thinking Pole and member of the Polish National Alliance should be present and in that way manifest his sincerity. The concert hall should be filled beyond capacity, so much so that a future concert of so old a choir may be held in some gigantic concert hall in the heart of the city.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Further particulars relative to the concert will be announced by the committee in all the Polish newspapers."</p>
   <p>J. Handke, Secretary.</p>
