   <p>The St. Agnes Young Ladies' Choir of St. John Cantius Parish staged three short Polish comedies Sunday (May 30) at the Parish hall [Names of plays not given]. As soon as the first comedy started it was evident that the amateurs were well trained for their parts. Each actor gave his best, much to the entertainment of the audience.</p>
   <p>One of the plays, "Smieszna Rozmowa" (Laughable Conversation), scored well with the crowd, although it was one of the most difficult to perform. The songs in some of the plays were also ably executed.</p>
   <p>From these performances it is obvious that the St. Agnes Young Ladies' Choir is not only growing but is working hard, and will someday reach great heights through such efforts.</p>
