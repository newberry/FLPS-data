   <p>Yesterday's presentation by the Theater Club at Walsh's all was eminently successful. The sprightly comedy "Parnaba Fafula" kept the audience in constant laughter. References to 'Park Commissioner' [E. Z.] Brodowski and to the Polish restaurant at the Fair brought great applause. Among the amateurs who took part were Mr. Rzeszotarski and John F. Smulski.</p>
