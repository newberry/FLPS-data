   <p>This year's carnival of events among our Polonia is expected to be popular. Many organizations are arranging banquets and thetrical programs. The dramatic circle from the South Side will present a play on New Year's Day, "Women and Hussars," after which amateurs will dance a "Mazurka" in four parts.</p>
   <p>The Central Polish Women's Alliance in America will present a stage play, entitled "The Two Orphans," the first Sunday in January, on the South Side. The play has been translated into Polish by the author of "Three Floras," Miss T. Somolinska.</p>
   <p>We also hear that our carnival singers will be in the concert program. The variety of entertainment will be extraordinary.</p>
