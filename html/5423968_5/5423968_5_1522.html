   <p>Without exception, all civilized nations, even nations not politically autonomous, have already celebrated or will celebrate a national "day" at the World's Fair in Chicago. Nations have regarded this great international exhibition as an opportunity for manifesting themselves, for saying to the world: "Here we are." Likewise, we Poles, descendants of the heroes of Grunwald [defeat of the Teutonic Order, 1410] and Vienna, must keep pace with other nations. This is required by our national self-respect and by our duty of manifesting our national vitality before our enemies.</p>
   <p>As a matter of fact, all the hundred and fifty thousand Poles of Chicago have understood the necessity of staging a "Polish Day" celebration--and are industriously preparing for it. Having admitted that the task can be accomplished only if the Poles act as one man, if all co-operate, without exception <span class="page-break">\2</span>and without regard to individual differences, members of Chicago's Polonia from various neighborhoods and camps have joined hands; consequently, progress toward the desired goal is rapid.</p>
   <p>At a meeting of representative Poles, held on August 19 at Pulaski Hall, a Central Committee of fifty-seven, representing all neighborhoods, was chosen to take charge of "Polish Day" plans. At subsequent meetings on the 22nd and 25th of August, the Central Committee elected its officers and made a number of important decisions. The following are the decisions reached as to the nature of the celebration and its date:</p>
   <p>1. After consultation with the World's Fair officials, it was decided that "Polish Day" would be celebrated on October 7 of this year.</p>
   <p>2. The celebration will consist of (a) a parade, with floats, through the city streets, and (b) national exercises at Festival Hall on the Fair grounds.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>3. Representative Poles from all parts of the country, especially from those Polish communities lying nearest to the City, will be invited to participate.</p>
   <p>As to the method of raising funds and the general procedure, the following decisions were reached:</p>
   <p>1. The Central Committee will direct all activities. Parishes and societies will participate as separate units under the general supervision of the Central Committee. Each society and parish will furnish music and floats for the parade at its own expense. Each neighborhood or parish will form part of the general parade.</p>
   <p>2. The costs of the celebration at Festival Hall, decorations, entertainment of visitors, general parade expenses, as well as advertising and other incidental costs, will be covered by an assessment of fifteen cents for each <span class="page-break">\4</span>person marching in the parade, this sum to be collected by each society or neighborhood and deposited with the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>3. Members of the Central Committee from each given parish or community will constitute a special committee for that parish or community, with the duty of organizing local forces, collecting necessary funds, and keeping the Central Committee in touch with that particular parish or community.</p>
   <p>4. Finally, for the purpose of carrying out necessary duties in connection with arrangements for the celebration, members of the Central Committee have been named to constitute a number of special committees; namely, a financial committee, a parade committee, a float committee, a committee to take charge of the Festival Hall celebration, a music committee, a decorations committee, and a publicity committee.</p>
   <p>As can easily be seen, the Central Committee is hard at work; the special committees are also busy and their activities will shortly be made public. We <span class="page-break">\5</span>have high hopes that God will bless our efforts and permit the "Polish Day" celebration to be so successful that it will do full credit to our dignity as Poles.</p>
   <p>While we on our part are making every possible effort, we urge all of our brethren in Chicago to work along with us. We appeal to all Polish communities and parishes for immediate and energetic co-operation. With the above-outlined program in mind, we appeal to all societies and organizations, those which have already promised to participate as well as all others, for the necessary co-operation to make our "Day" a success, and primarily for collection of the necessary funds. We appeal to Polish priests, newspapers, businessmen, and all other well-wishers, both here in Chicago and in America at large, for their kind support, aid, and co-operation. This beautiful work, so promisingly begun in fraternal harmony, will end beautifully also. "Polish Day" will announce to the world that "Poland is not lost--nor ever will be!"</p>
