   <p>Our country-man, Mr. L. Smiejkowski, who is a member of the Polish National Alliance, has invented a very practical and interesting window-sash. The invention consists of a metal frame in to which a window pane is inserted. This frame is practically weather-proof and fits the window sash so snugly that putty is not necessary.</p>
   <p>Windows equipped with these frames will not deteriorate rapidly because they are weather proofed. The window-pane can be replaced very easily and quickly because putty is not necessary. This frame can be used for any type of window.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smietkowski has patented his invention and has started manufacturing. His factory is located at 1725 North Ashland Ave. and the name of the firm is The Puttyless Window Pane Fastener Mfg. Co. We wish him success.</p>
