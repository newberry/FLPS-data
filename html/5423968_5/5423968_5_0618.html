   <p>The subject of organizing children's choruses in America has, for a long time been seriously discussed by that important organization of Polish choruses, the Polish Singers' Alliance. We did not have a man among us who would or could put this lofty project in operation because there seemed to be various obstacles in the path of its realization. But about a year ago there came to our city a musician, an ideal man, as it appears, with thorough knowledge of music and strong will power, who without any outside help and in spite of many difficulties has been able to produce in the field of children's choruses quite important results, if we consider what conditions were among us.</p>
   <p>After eight months of tedious work, with the help of only a few amateur singers of both sexes and under the guidance of the Polish Singers' Alliance for the State of Illinois, we possess at the present time in our city five patriotic nationalistic children's choruses, and the number of these charming Polish nightingales is approaching the seven-hundred mark. Similar organizations of <span class="page-break">\2</span>juvenile singers have been formed in other cities also, and we are justified in hoping that their number will grow, for the Polish community in the United States is becoming more and more interested in Polish folk music as it is cultivated by children's choruses. There are already evidences of a better understanding of this noble, purely patriotic, and useful endeavor.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, in the Town of Lake district, the first concert of the Dawn Chorus of children was given, and it proved to be a tremendous success. Yesterday, that is, on Sunday, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the first concert of the [two] children's choruses, Promyk (Sunbeam) and Poranek (Daybreak), was given in Pulaski Hall, on Noble Street, with a richly diversified program. Besides singing, dancing, and declamations a children's orchestra also took part, entertaining the audience with a few selections.</p>
   <p>The undersigned, who has been following closely the activities of the rapidly growing children's choruses, firmly believes that our Polish public will continue to show its interest in the concerts given by children and will loyally <span class="page-break">\3</span>patronize them in order to hear the great [little] singers of our city.</p>
   <p>To be more specific, I should like to add that candies, chocolate, and sweets of all kinds will be accepted with enthusiasm by our big singers if the confectioners, and lovers of song and music will deliver them for the concerts.</p>
