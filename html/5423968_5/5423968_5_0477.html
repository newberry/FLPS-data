   <p>Not very long ago we gave the information in these columns that Mrs. Marie Mroczkowski (formerly Miss Dobrocki) received the right of free scholarship in the Chicago Musical College; because our information was incomplete, therefore we complete it today with a letter received from the president of the above mentioned college, Mr. F. Ziegfeld. This letter literally sounds as follows:</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>My Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I would state that our free scholarships were awarded in September 1908, and the regular examination of all applicants was held at the college on September 2, 3, 4 and 5 before the entire faculty of the different branches. Mrs. Nering was awarded a full free scholarship in Vocal <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>($320), and receives now free instruction from Mrs. O. L. Fox for the entire year. Since then no free scholarships have been awarded except in Italian and Harmony to Mrs. Marie McClosky, formerly Miss Marie Dobrocki.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>P. Ziegfeld</p>
   <p>President of the Chicago Musical College.</p>
