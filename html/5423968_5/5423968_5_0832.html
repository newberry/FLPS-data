   <p>Chicago Poles apparently have not as yet cultivated a taste for classical and semi-classical music, for the first musical concert in this series by the Nowicki brothers, was poorly supported. The Polish Hall was void of the crowd it harbored only a week before. It is unfortunate that this happened to this fine organization. They have always been ardent supporters of every Polish movement and have always given their services willingly.</p>
   <p>The financial outcome of this concert was not promising.</p>
