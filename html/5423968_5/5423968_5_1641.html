   <p>Several months ago, we took up the question of Polish-American participation in the 1894 Lwow Exposition in the columns of Dziennik Chicagoski. Our opinion, as already stated then, is that this [Exposition] offers a splendid opportunity for furthering the relations between Polish-Americans and their homeland. These relations have already been improved by such events as Dr. Dunikowski's visit, the publication of the Emigration Review's [published in Lwow, Poland] discussion of our affairs at the attorney's congress, etc. At the time, out remarks were received with ridicule. We have always considered the idea worthy of support, and we waited but for the occasion in which we could again bring the matter before the public.</p>
   <p>That occasion has arrived sooner than we had expected. While the idea of Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition was scoffed at in America, it was accepted not only by the general public in Poland but by the directors of the Exposition themselves as entirely proper and worthy of realization.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Proof of this is to be found in an official letter to Peter Kiolbassa, City Treasurer of Chicago, from the directors of the Lwow Exposition, and in a very interesting article appearing in the Emigration Review. We present both the letter and the article below.</p>
   <p>"Lwow, January 30, 1893.</p>
   <p>"In view of the prominent position which you occupy among our countrymen across the ocean, we turn to you with a request for co-operation in an important undertaking now in preparation for 1894. Agricultural and industrial circles of our country brought forward the idea of arranging a general exposition on the greatest possible scale, and we have organized with the purpose of putting this thought into action. A fortunate coincidence joins this project with one of our greatest national anniversaries. Next year will mark the passage of a hundred years since our immortal leader, Thaddeus Kosciusko, donned a peasant's coat and raised his sword to strike off the chains that bind us in political slavery, calling the common people of Poland to their duty as citizens--to national defense. This anniversary, important <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in the history of Poland and, first of all, one which cannot be regarded with indifference by Americans, ought to be appropriately celebrated. The unanimous opinion of our people connects the observance of this anniversary with a panorama of the works undertaken for the preservation of Polish nationalism and of external rebirth. It is our desire to achieve in this Exposition such a panoramic view of all the ramifications of Polish life; in the fields of agriculture and industry, in science, the fine arts, literature, and journalism, is the development of public utilities, humanitarian institutions, etc. And by the same token we wish to honor the memory of Kosciusko and urge ourselves onward to greater work toward political rebirth. That such a national spectacle would be incomplete were our brethren across the sea unrepresented, is self-evident.</p>
   <p>"The great distance, and the difficulties and cost of travel will in truth prevent most of our American countrymen from attending the Exposition. It is our earnest desire, however, that the picture of life and work in this new Poland which is developing so successfully across the ocean, should be as complete as possible. We turn, therefore, to you, sir, to ask you to be kind <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>enough to disseminate this idea among your fellow Poles and to gain enthusiastic support for this cause. Particularly, we ask that you take the necessary steps toward the realization of a 'Polish-American Pavilion' at our Exposition, in which capable craftsmen, industrialists, inventors, farmers, technicians, etc. may exhibit the products of their labor before their mother country. We believe that the World's Columbian Exposition will be a great help in bringing this about, for articles already exhibited there may be sent on to us. Furthermore, we judge that in spite of the great distance, participation of American exhibitors would not be a matter of indifference to trade. We need but to mention our wicker industry and your machinery to show that reciprocal trade exists between us.</p>
   <p>"We have no doubt, sir, that this matter upon which we have touched will receive your warmest support. We ask that you let us know your opinion on this matter as soon as possible, and let us know also in what form or manner participation of our brethren in the 1894 Exposition at Lwow will be possible."</p>
   <p>Reserving all comment for the present, we ask all other Polish newspapers to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>reprint the above letter.</p>
   <p>We find in the Emigration Review a very interesting article concerning the Lwow Exposition addressed to the Polish-American press. This article points out the need for closer relations between the Polish-Americans and their homeland--and that closer relations are being realized through the medium of Polish-American newspapers sent abroad. It continues:</p>
   <p>"....However, these packages of newspapers, traveling as they do to a great number of places, do not completely acquaint our public with the Poles of North America. Advantage should be taken of the splendid opportunity afforded by the Galician General Exposition at Lwow in 1894. The year 1894 will probably be universally remembered by the Poles. Proofs have accrued by which we can demonstrate to the world what has been accomplished by virtue of our national vitality, after a hundred years, and how insignificant are the results of all efforts to curb it. And these losses, after all, have been the efforts of great powers. The year 1894 will be designated with Kosciusko's name; the figure of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>our leader in his peasant garb will dominate it.</p>
   <p>"Polish authors and newspapermen in Galicia [a province in Poland] have decided that some sort of memorial should be erected to mark the passage of one hundred years of intellectual effort. It is too early to say what this memorial will look like, or of what it will be composed; we can only say with certainty that it will be erected.</p>
   <p>"Another decision in the same spirit has taken more definite shape. It is a projected exhibit of all the Polish, White Russian, and Lithuanian papers in the world, including all the Yiddish, German, and Russian papers published in Poland.</p>
   <p>"The young Polish press in America ought to occupy an important and independent <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>place, and there should not be a single contemporary publication lacking. We believe it is not too early for America to begin preparing specimens which will portray the development of Polish journalism in the new world.</p>
   <p>"And so we call upon our brother publishers across the sea to reach, either in a group or individually, an understanding with the Exposition's director of the newspaper section in Lwow. This understanding would include sending information on all the Polish, White Russian, and Lithuanian papers published in the United States, in sending individual specimens to Lwow, and, in general, in setting forth a practical plan for co-operation.</p>
   <p>"The important issue of acquainting European Poles with North American Polish newspapers should not be limited to the Exposition in Lwow. The specimens, instead of being destroyed, or returned at considerable cost, could continue to remain in public view in the hands of the Ossolinski National Institute, an institution created for the preservation of Polish informational sources. We assume also that extra specimens could be provided without great inconvenience to the editors; at the same time, therefore, the Polish library and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>the Polish museum in Chicago could be supplied with specimens of every contemporary Polish publication in America. Undoubtedly, more than one item will be found at the Exposition which our Polish-American visitors will regard as worthy of retaining for their own collections. It is possible that the material and spiritual exchange between us may reach unforeseen proportions. Our unity may attain a strength which we cannot now calculate."</p>
   <p>Our opinion in the matter of Polish-American participation in the Lwow Exposition has already been stated. We emphasize once more that the principles of the matter have our completest approbation and that we are ready to lend our enthusiastic and unqualified support. Our own suggestions as to methods of its realization we leave for the future.</p>
