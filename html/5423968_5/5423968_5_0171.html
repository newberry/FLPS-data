   <p>Mr. Henry Paurowicz, the owner of a bakery at the Walsh Hall, received a patent for his invention, the so-called "serving dish," which is very practical besides being an elegant utensil.</p>
   <p>The patent number 38,140 was given by the Patent Bureau in Washington, on July 31, 1906 and could be bought from the inventor. Any person who possesses sufficient capital and who would care to manufacture this item, could make for himself a little money.</p>
