   <p>Last night an entertainment was given in the Sherman Park hall by the St. Cecilia Chorus of St. John of God's parish. The singers, men and women, enjoyed themselves till late in the evening. Their only complaint was that the time passed so fast, and that the "old singing gang" had to go home.</p>
