   <p>Andrew Kwasigroch was born October 20, 1855, in Poland, in West Russia [Translator's note: Nicknamed by the Germans after the World War the Polish Corridor]. He obtained his elementary education in his native town. After graduation from grammar school he was sent to a relative of his who was a teacher of singing and organist that he might obtain instruction in organ music. At the same time he was preparing for an entrance examination to a Normal school, and in 1871 he successfully passed the examination and entered the school in Keynia, province of Poznan (Posen), to prepare for the profession of teaching.</p>
   <p>On the advice of his parents he discontinued his studies and emigrated with them to America, settling in Chicago in St. Stanislas' parish. There he continued his musical education with Professor Gondlach, attending at the same time Loyola College. Soon after his arrival in Chicago he joined the St. Stanislas Kostka church choir, which was then under the direction <span class="page-break">\2</span>of the late Anthony Mallek. In 1875 a vacancy occurred, and he assumed the duties of parish organist, continuing in this capacity for forty-six years, until serious illness forced him to relinquish his beloved post. The attack took place suddenly while he was conducting the parish choir in its rehearsal. The sad news of his illness was a great shock to the friends and acquaintances of the beloved organist. Seeking to regain his health, he went to California, but he was only partially successful; his strength never returned, and he could not resume his duties at the organ.</p>
   <p>In 1882 Mr. Kwasigroch married Miss Josephine Siuda. The marriage was blessed with eight children. He lives in St. Stanislas Kostka's parish at 1458 Blackhawk Street.</p>
   <p>Besides belonging to many singing and music clubs Mr. Kwasigroch is a member of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and of the Order of Catholic Foresters, in which he is a senior. He was one of the organizers of the Casimir Pulaski Building and Loan Association and is a member of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>board of the Polish Publishing Company. In his time he has frequently directed the united national and church choruses on festive occasions or at national celebrations. A few of these were the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, the Polish national celebration in honor of Joseph Kraszewski (famous Polish novelist), the silver anniversary of Archbishop Feehan, the commemorative celebration in honor of Adam Mickiewicz [Poland's greatest poet] in the Auditorium, the Chopin celebration, and the Army show in Grant Park in 1918. These performances were among the most elaborate artistic productions ever undertaken by the American Polonia.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kwasigroch belongs to the older generation of Polish immigrants who awakened, sustained, and strengthened here the Polish spirit. It is therefore right that he should be so generally honored, this noble citizen and true patriot.</p>
