   <p>On the 22nd day of July at 8:15 in the evening, at Pulaski Park hall, there will be staged a free entertainment for Polish audience staged by Mr. K. Jasinski's school of music. A cast of more than thirty performers, young ladies and children who are the pupils of Mr. Jasinski's school, will take part in this beautiful program. These pupils are well prepared for public performances; many of them are engaged in down town theaters. The public will have an opportunity to judge the efforts of the young Polish artists.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jasinski's School of Music is an institution that was badly needed by our settlement. Mr. Jasinski's School of Music is equal to any school of music in Chicago. This can be proved by any person who cares to visit the school. Mr. Jasinski's School of Music is not a business institution for he is interested more in development of talent than in making money. He specializes in teaching children who are quite often mistreated in schools of other nationalities.</p>
