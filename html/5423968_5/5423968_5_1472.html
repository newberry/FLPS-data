   <p>The fifth consecutive meeting of the Polish Day Central Committee was held yesterday at Pulaski Hall. S. Slominski presided and K. Zychlinski acted as secretary. After the reading of the minutes of the last meeting, community committee reports were presented. The reports show that each community is doing its best toward making Polish Day a great success.</p>
   <p>Letters from the Kosciusko Guard of Milwaukee, the Battalion of Polish soldiers of Buffalo, and St. Stanislaus and St. Anthony's Societies of Hyman [sic], expressing their intention of participating in the Polish Day celebration either en masse or through delegations, were received with acclaim. The letter addressed to Peter Kiolbassa by the Chicago Day Committee was read and accepted. It was decided to contribute two floats to the Chicago Day festivities, namely, one float depicting Kosciusko, Pulaski, and Washington, and the other, Sobieski at Vienna. Chicago Day will be held on October 9 [two days after Polish Day].</p>
   <p>Reports of the special committees followed. The parade committee requested that a delegation be sent to Peter Kiolbassa, inviting him to lead the parade. The delegation will consist of [J.] Napieralski, Szmiot, and Lisztewnik.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of arrangements at Festival Hall reported that the Fair authorities have given it permission to decorate the hall.</p>
   <p>The music committee proposed that two orchestras be hired--one to play at Festival Hall and the other to lead the parade. On a motion by Bielinski, the proposal was accepted.</p>
   <p>The publicity committee reported that it had sent announcements to various [out-of-town] societies and priests. On a motion by Bielinski, this committee was instructed to prepare an appeal to employers, asking that Polish workmen be released for that day, to be published in the American papers.</p>
   <p>Next, a reception committee was appointed to receive and find lodgings for out-of-town visitors. The committee consists of [Anthony] Stefanowicz, [F.] Smietanka, [W.] Jedrzejek, and J. Gniot.</p>
   <p>It was further decided that the treasurer of each community be asked to help dispose of the official Polish Day pins. Each treasurer will receive from 150 to 200 pins to sell.</p>
   <p>Judge [M. A.] La Tuy, P. Kiolbassa, Bielinski, Kozlowski, and S. Slominski were appointed to a committee which is to invite Mayor Carter N. Harrison and the entire city administration to attend the celebration. This committee will also endeavor to gain permission to hang the Polish flag in the City Hall [on Polish Day].</p>
