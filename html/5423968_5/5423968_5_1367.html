   <p>The St. Stanislaus Kostka Society in the parish of the same name in Chicago has decided to participate in the Lwow Exposition in 1894. The Society is contributing twenty-five dollars to build the Polish-American Pavilion in Lwow, and the secretary was ordered to prepare all possible data regarding the Society. The St. Stanislaus Kostka Society will also ship its seventeen-year-old banner to the Lwow Exposition.</p>
   <p>These motions were passed at a meeting presided over by Mr. Jakob Tomaszewski. He and the other members of the Society merit our due appreciation.</p>
