Although we cannot all be artists, authors and musicians, we can however help those who possess a higher learning and ability, and in this manner increase our own knowledge, and create a sincere appreciation of the better and finer things of life.</p>
   <p>The Polish Arts Club is a haven not only for those artists who are considered finished, but also for those of our members who are lovers of literature and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>art, and truly value such culture.</p>
   <p>An exhibit of carvings and paintings will open in the Home Bank Building on November 25, 1928. The social attractions of this exhibit will be an informal tea, and a musical and vocal program every evening. Every indication points to a successful venture.</p>
