   <p>We received the following belated report of last Sunday's performance in South Chicago:</p>
   <p>On Sunday, June 11, an amateur performance took place at Temple Hall for the benefit of the Kosciusko Memorial Fund. Receipts were considerable. Before the performance began, Mr. Ignacy Machnikowski delivered a short patriotic address, extolling Kosciusko as a Pole, a soldier, and a man.</p>
   <p>The performance was excellent in every respect. Mrs. Urbanowicz was charming as "Zosia," and Mr. Grabowski played the part of "Tomek" correctly. "Protazy" (Mr. Stefanski) evoked great merriment by his comical gestures and by his brisk, confident acting. The character "Szymon" was interpreted so well by Mr. W. Darowski....that one would swear that a real native of Lobzow [see note] had come especially to take part in this performance.</p>
   
   <p>With due acknowledgment to all of the other amateur actors and actresses who took part in the play, as well for their work as for their support of a noble cause, we add with pleasure that the performance will be repeated soon.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Lobzow is a district in the vicinity of Cracow, noted for its colorful peasant costumes.]</p>
