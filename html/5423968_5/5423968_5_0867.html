   <p>The St. Cecelia Choral Society last Sunday presented an amateur theatrical performance, together with singing, dancing, and a bazaar. The All Saints' Parish Hall was filled to capacity and many people had to be turned away due to lack of room. The first part of the evening's program consisted of a lively one-act comedy entitled "Slowiczek" (Little Nightingale). In this play, Miss K. Brzezinski in the role of Zosia, the flower girl, displayed unusual talent. She was ably supported by J. Nowak in the role of the gardener.</p>
   <p>In the second part of the program, Miss M. Biba danced a Spanish dance and sang, accompanied by Miss A. Biba. The third part of the program cosisted of two very lively comedies entitled "Zywe Worki" (Live Bags) and "Kichajace Maszyny" (Machines that Sneeze). In the plays the following persons showed ability: Miss M. Singer, in the role of Magda, and Mr. M. Sobaczynski, in the role of Jedrzej the farm owner--although the rest of the cast played rather well. Mr. G. F. Biba, organist of this parish, directed the plays. In a word, the evening <span class="page-break">2</span>was a complete success in every respect, and all numbers on the program were applauded enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>At the request of the public, these plays will be repeated at the All Saints' Parish Hall on Sunday May 20, at 7:30 P. M.</p>
