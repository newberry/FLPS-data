   <p>As in other cities of the United States, an "Allied Bazaar" will be held in Chicago from January 10 to January 20, 1917. The Poles will also participate in this Bazaar; the General Bazaar Committee, under the direction of the Polish Central Relief Committee, has been working for the past few weeks to make the Polish section at this Bazaar as successful as possible, so that the income from it for Poland will be large.</p>
   <p>We must not even think that the Poles of Chicago will not give this venture their wholehearted support, for it has, besides gathering a few thousand dollars for the relief fund, other aims; namely, it will give the thousands of people who pass through the Coliseum a passing acquaintance, at least, with our solidarity, and our desire to do everything in our power to give our motherland the aid she so badly needs.</p>
   
   <p>The chief concern is that the Polish section at the Bazaar shall be as tastefully and well arranged as possible. Having seen the list of persons who are active members of the General Committee, we have no doubt but that it will, and that it will also be adequately stocked. We do not doubt but that the Polish merchants will do their part.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that there are plenty of generous people among us, and that everyone will donate the very best that he can afford to the Bazaar. Not all of us can, and not all of us have the time to share the task of making the arrangements for the Polish section, but it is our duty to lighten that task by not waiting until we are asked for a contribution, but by placing voluntarily our donation or a sum of money into the General Committee's hands.</p>
   <p>With the general support of the Bazaar by our organizations, the Polish clergy, the Polish press, and with the good will and efforts of the members of the General Committee, we can only believe that the Polish section at the Bazaar in the Coliseum will not be the least significant section, even if it cannot lead the others. Let us remember that this work is not for our own glory, but for Poland; in a few days, we can gather a considerable fund for relief purposes--money with which we will be able to prevent a great deal of human suffering during the severe winter [months] and during the period of the famine which now exists in Poland.</p>
   <p>If the General Committee needs, as an incentive to work, our assurance that the Bazaar itself will be a success, we can give that assurance, knowing the generosity of our Poles very well. We can easily visualize the great crowds that will hurry to the Bazaar from various Polish communities in Chicago and its vicinity. We hazard a guess that on Polish Day, the huge Coliseum will not be large enough to accommodate all those Poles who will hurry there, conscious of their duty to Poland, anxious to contribute their bit to the sum the Bazaar will yield for Polish relief.</p>
   <p>If only we are unafraid of the work, if only we spare no effort, everything will run smoothly.</p>
