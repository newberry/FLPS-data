   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish gave a performance of two short dramas, "Jam Bogaty" (I Am Rich) and "Tajemnica" (Secret), last night.</p>
   <p>In the first play, Miss R. Gorzynski must be awarded the honors, and, in the second, Mr. J. Oszwaldowski portrayed the role of "Jedrus" very well. Besides those mentioned, the following also took part in the performance: Mr. August Klafta, Mr. J. Burchardt, Mr. R. Szajkowski, Mrs. Koppa, Mrs. Debkowski, and Mrs. Baczynski. All of the players portrayed their individual roles as best they could. The first play was rather weak; the second one pleased everybody. Unfortunately, the audience was comparatively small.</p>
