   <p>Despite the fact that the St. Casimir Young Men's Falcon Society presented a stellar performance last night (Sunday), a small crowd was present. This was a great disappointment because the members were counting on the support of the Polish public. Their hopes of raising funds for the proposed gymnasium were dimmed. The small attendance may be accounted for by the fact that many dances were being held in the vicinity.</p>
   <p>Boleslas Klarkowski opened the program with a short speech. He substituted for the Reverend Francis Gordon, C.R., who had left town on an urgent matter. The speaker pointed out the importance of gymnastic drills for the Polish youth as well as for grownups.</p>
   <p>Acrobatic stunts were presented for the first time on the stage, much to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the enjoyment of the audience. One of the acrobats, J. G., was the outstanding performer of the evening.</p>
   <p>The comedy "Posag w Kominie" (Dowry in the Chimney) was presented with exceptional humor.  Josephine Kowalska, Rosalie Koppa, August Klafta, W. Lipecki, J. Czekala, W. Wieckowski, and others took part in the comedy. The songs as well as the acting were of the best, and the performance deserves to be repeated.</p>
