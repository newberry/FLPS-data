   <p>Pulaski Hall, at which Saturday's Polish Day meeting was held, was filled to capacity. Besides residents of St. Adalbert's parish and numerous delegates from our part of the city, representatives of practically every Polish neighborhood in Chicago attended. Some of the visitors from Poland were also present. The gathering was an unusually animated one.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Mr. [J.] Smietanka, who spoke of the meeting's purpose and of the necessity of celebrating a Polish Day. In conclusion, he called to the platform the committees from the Northwest Side, presidents of societies, editors of newspapers, and the Reverend Adolf Nowicki of South Chicago.....</p>
   <p>Judge [M. A.] La Buy was unanimously elected chairman and H. Nagiel secretary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At the chairman's request, W. Jedrzejek, H. Nagiel, S. Slominski, and W. Bardonski gave their reports of the progress made on the Northwest Side in connection with the plans to celebrate Polish Day. They described the enthusiasm of the people for the project, saying that forty-seven societies had already promised to participate; that the businessmen of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish were ready to furnish floats, and that a few had already pledged themselves. They also reported that the Poles of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, regardless of party views, desire to work in harmony with their countrymen in other parts of the city. Father Nowicki made a speech to the same effect in behalf of the Poles of St. Michael Archangel parish in South Chicago. Mr. K. Bielinski, of St. Adalbert's parish, declared that all the societies in St. Adalbert's, without exception, would co-operate. These and other declarations were vigorously applauded, since they demonstrate eloquently that there is great enthusiasm for the Polish Day.</p>
   <p>Next, the secretary of the meeting proceeded to record the names of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>societies that had promised to participate. In addition to the forty-seven societies that promised participation at last Wednesday's meeting in the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall (see Dziennik Chicagoski, Aug. 17), fifty-one additional societies have promised, more or less definitely, to participate in the Polish Day celebration.</p>
   <p>Declarations to this effect were made by the delegates of the following societies:</p>
   <p>From St. Stanislaus Kostka parish: St. John Baptist Society (represented by J. Gniot); King Miecislaus Society (by Magdziarz); Ag. Giller Society I (by A. Krauze), from St. Adalbert's parish; St. Adalbert's Society (by J. Przymorski); St. Stanislaus Kostka Society (by Drzycimski); St. Gregory Krakus Society (by F. Balcer); Knights of St. Casimir (by J. Nowak); St. Joseph's Society (by J. Napieralski); St. Florian Krakus Society (by S. Bejenka); Polish Hussars of St. Martin (by F. Herek); Sacred Name of Jesus Society <span class="page-break">\4</span>(by K. Bielinski); Brotherhood of St. Dominic (by J. Herman); Henryk Sienkiewicz Literary Society (by I. Dankowski); Holy Name of Jesus Society (by K. Gulcz); St. Adalbert's Council, Catholic Order of Foresters (by I. Dankowski); St. Onufrey Council, Catholic Order of Foresters (by A.

Rokosz); Polish Falcons I (by Zawadzki); St. Joseph's Society (by F. Opielinski); Holy Virgin Mary Society (by J. Wichlaczynski); J. I. Kraszewski Society (by J. Kowalewski); Moniuszko Choral Society (by A. Rosinski); Gmina Polska [Polish Group] (by Wolny); Polish Patriotic Youth Society (by S. Napieralski), from St. Casimir's parish; St. Casimir's Society (by W. Szlajcher); and Stefan Boszczynski Patriotic Society (by M. Marcinkowski).</p>
   <p>From Bridgeport: St. John Cantius Society (represented by J. Janiszewski); King Stephen Batory Society (by M. Wleklinski); King Casimir the Great Society (by T. Wikaryasz); St. Stephen's Society (by M. Wojtakiewicz); St. Mary of Perpetual <span class="page-break">\5</span>Help Society (by W. Derdzinski); and Prince Joseph Poniatowski Society of Polish Marksmen (by F. Sarnowski).</p>
   <p>From Town of Lake: St. Joseph's Society (represented by A. Rus); St. Lawrence Society (by J. N. Brzezinski); King Miecislaus Society, under the protection of St. Adalbert (by L. Kropaczewski); St. John Cantius Society I (by J. Adas); Sacred Heart of Jesus Society (by J. Roszak); St. Stanislaus Kostka Youth Society (by J. Lipinski); and Fourth Regiment of Uhlans (by Z. Schmidt).</p>
   <p>From St. Mary of Perpetual Help parish in South Chicago: St. Vincent Society (represented by S. Solski); St. Josephat's Society (by R. Przybylinski); First Division of Knights of St. Mary (by J. Koziczynski); Legion of St. Joseph (by S. Solski); and King John Sobieski Society (by M. Wiora).</p>
   <p>As we see from this list, the number of societies willing to participate has been increased by three societies from the Northwest Side, twenty-seven from <span class="page-break">\6</span>St. Adalbert's parish, two from St. Casimir's, six from Bridgeport, seven from Town of Lake, and five from St. Mary's of Perpetual Help in South Chicago. On behalf of Reverend [Francis] Wojtalewicz, of Hammond, Indiana, Father Nowicki announced that the St. Andrew Society, as well as the Poles in general from that parish, would participate. Finally, F. [H.] Jablonski, who arrived late at the meeting, announced that the Polish societies of Holy Trinity parish are also willing to take part in the celebration. Thus, the total number of societies registered for participation in the Polish Day celebration is ninety-nine.</p>
   <p>This is indeed an imposing figure. One of the speakers was entirely justified in saying that, in the face of such strength, there can no longer be any talk of opposition to the project. The question is no longer: Shall a Polish Day be celebrated, but how shall it be celebrated?</p>
   <p>On this question and on the question of funds needed to finance the celebration, <span class="page-break">\7</span>spirited discussions arose several times during the meeting. S. Slupski suggested that, instead of a celebration at the Fair, one of the paintings be purchased from the Polish exhibit and presented to the Art Institute after a parade through the city streets. Some were of the opinion that a small tax be levied on all members of Polish societies; others opposed this plan vigorously. Bielinski, Slominski, Kowalewski, Jedrzejek, Wleklinski, Smietanka, Bardonski, S. Zahajkiewicz, and others took active part in the discussion of these and other questions. It was finally decided that the discussion was premature and that the final decisions be left to a central committee which would take charge of all arrangements. The meeting then turned its attention to the formation of a central committee. In accordance with a motion by K. Bielinski, it was decided that the committee shall consist of ten members from St. Stanislaus Kostka parish and five from each remaining parish or neighborhood, that is, from St. Adalbert's parish, St. Casimir's, from Bridgeport, Town of Lake, and from each of the two parishes in South Chicago. It was later decided to include five from Holy Trinity parish, which had sent a representative <span class="page-break">\8</span>to the meeting, and to increase St. Adalbert's representation by two. Five places were reserved for representatives of St. Hedwig's and Lake View, neither of which were represented at the meeting. It was decided, then, that a central committee of fifty-seven would be elected immediately, and in case the two last mentioned parishes reported, that this number be increased by ten.</p>
   <p>The following men were elected to the committee: From St. Stanislaus Kostka parish: W. Jedrzejek, W. Bardonski, Andrew Schultz, H. Nagiel, A. Lisztewnik, M. A. La Buy, J. Gniot, W. Smulski, Peter Kiolbassa, and P. Arkuszewski: from Holy Trinity: S. Slominski, F. Jablonski, P. Bienkowski, J. Adamowski, and D. Ekowski; from St. Adalbert's: K. Bielinski, J. Manna, John Napieralski, Smietanka, A. Stefanowicz, B. Markiewicz, and G. Kozlowski; from St. Casimir's: W. Szlajcher, J. Rosinski, I. Czaja, M. Marcinkowski, and M. J. Szameit; from Bridgeport: T. Wikaryasz, M. Wojtalewicz, N. L. Piotrowski, F. Behnka, and M. Wleklinski; from St. Michael Archangel's, of South Chicago: L. Machnikowski, <span class="page-break">\9</span>J. Szostakowski, F. Jurkiewicz, F. Rydzewski, and E. Wiedeman; from St. Mary's of Perpetual Help, of South Chicago: R. Przybylinski, Stephen Solski, W. Folmer, M. Wiora, and J. Koziczynski; from Town of Lake: Sigmund Schmidt, A. Rus, J. N. Brzezinski, W. Kaptur, and J. Roszak.</p>
   <p>Because of the lateness of the hour, the meeting had to adjourn after the committee had been completed. It had been previously decided, however, that the newly elected central committee would hold its first meeting at Pulaski Hall on August 22, at 7:30 in the evening. An announcement to this effect appears elsewhere in this paper. It can be expected that the date, place, and manner of the Polish Day celebration will be determined at this meeting, and that initial preparations will be made for its accomplishment.</p>
   <p>As we can see, the matter is now well under way. The public is enthusiastic and the committee will undoubtedly set energetically to work--to arrange a magnificent celebration that will be a credit to our past and an indication of our present vitality.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>In a letter by the secretary, received after the meeting, the Polish Industrial Craftsmen's Association of the Southwest Side announced that it also would participate in the Polish Day celebration; this brings the total of participating societies to one hundred.</p>
