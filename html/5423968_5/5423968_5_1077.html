   <p>The Dramatic Circle, a branch of the Polish Patriotic Organization held its last pre-vacation meeting last Saturday, July 9, 1892. An exceptionally large number attended this meeting and the members consider this meeting as one of the most outstanding because they decided to rid themselves, once and for all, of all misunderstandings in the realm of the Circle and to conduct themselves more unifiedly in the future. It was decided to have a vacation but as brief a one as possible because it was to be for a duration of three weeks.</p>
