   <p>Among a group of Polish Chicagoans interested in theatrical performances, a very interesting idea has been born.</p>
   <p>The twenty-fifth anniversary of the first Polish amateur theatrical performance takes place this year. It was probably the first one in America.</p>
   <p>Our amateurs, both men and women, decided to celebrate the anniversary of the first Polish theatrical performance. It is proposed that a performance be given by the best talent among us, together with an appropriate celebration. It is possible that some of those amateurs who took part in the first performance twenty-five years ago will be able to take part in the celebration.</p>
   <p>The idea is very fine. Further particulars will be announced by us later.</p>
