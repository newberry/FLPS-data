   <p>This is the name of Michael Balucki's four-act comedy, which, after a great deal of effort, the Mloda Polska (Young Poland) Society, Group 865 of the Polish National Alliance, presented on Sunday, April 15, at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall.</p>
   <p>The title of the play aptly describes the plot. The author takes us into the home of the Zabskis, where flirtation has become a serious problem. Here wives dissatisfied with their husbands rouse the passions of light-minded men who enjoy themselves at someone else's fireside.</p>
   <p>In a manner full of lively comedy and situations, the author pictures the faults, weaknesses and frivolity of erring people. By exposing them to deserved unpleasantness, Balucki gives one to understand that a flirtation carried on with the wrong people is a fire which, because of its painful results, should always <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>be avoided.</p>
   <p>The characters in the play enter upon erring ways, but, on becoming conscious of their misdeeds, return to the straight and narrow path that leads to real happiness.</p>
   <p>The value of Balucki's "Flirtation" is great, in view of the noble moral it teaches. This moral can be condensed into a sentence: Live right and tear off the mask of illusion before your friends; do not, for the sake of your own pleasure, expose others to misfortune, and you will find life good.</p>
   <p>The Mloda Polska Society, which, as we said at the beginning, presented "Flirtation" last Sunday after a great deal of effort, deserves recognition: first, because it has given the public not just another piece of fiddle-faddle, which unfortunately is always found in the majority of Polish performances, but a work possessing unquestioned value; second, because it has donated the proceeds of the play to the fund to save the Polish National Museum in Rapperschwil, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Switzerland.</p>
   <p>As to the performance of the amateurs, it may be said that in general it was very good. The play as a whole, in spite of a few shortcomings that we will not mention here for lack of space, was better than the average amateur performances. The women's roles, with a few exceptions, were well played. Special mention is due Mrs. Michalski, in the role of Sofia; Mrs. Lubicz, in the role of Adel; and Miss Hahn. The male members of the cast revealed more shortcomings than the women. The best performance was given by Mr. Jedlinski, who played excellently the role of "Flirtowski," a great connoisseur of the weaker sex. Mr. E. Scholl gave a rather good portrayal of the unfaithful husband.</p>
   <p>The cast of characters was as follows: "Adel," Mrs. J. Lubicz; "Zabski," Mr. K. Chmura; "Flora," Mrs. B. Chmura; "Fela," Miss Felicia Hahn; "Plytnicki," Mr. L. Olyniec; "Sofia," Mrs. Michalski; "Murski," Mr. A. J. Paluszek; "Kochanski," Mr. E. Scholl; "Adam," Mr. L. W. Paluszek; "Dzikiewicz," Mr. Jambrozik; "Julia," Miss J. Kozlowski; "Jozia," Miss B. Jaworski; "Izia," little <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Miss Z. Lubicz.</p>
   <p>The play was ably directed by Mr. W. Riegier.</p>
   <p>The stage settings were made attractive by the paintings of Mr. A. Baranowski, a promising young painter. The paintings are the property of Mr. and Mrs. Paluszek.</p>
   <p>The play was followed by dancing, which lasted until 2:30 A. M.</p>
