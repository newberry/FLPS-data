   <p>We need Polish banks. Our funds are present deposited in foreign banks, sometimes in unreliable and irresponsible ones.</p>
   <p>People judge us not competent nor able to organize and establish a bank.</p>
   <p>The organization committee consist of Jan Smulski, Tomasz Krolik and Theo. M. Helinski also many other energetic Polish businessmen.</p>
   <p>The bank's capital is $200,000.00 with a surplus of $25,000.00.</p>
   <p>The price of a share will be $112.50.</p>
   <p>The state auditor in Springfield has issued a certificate recognizing this organization under the control of the state.</p>
   <p>Many Polish businessmen are shareholders, and all received the news about the Polish State Bank with enthusiasm.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The whole building consists at the present time of three stories located on the corner of Milwaukee Ave. and Haddon Ave.</p>
   <p>It is rented for this purpose, and about May 1 alterations will be started, for the large new bank.</p>
   <p>There will be installed in the bank "Safety Deposit Vaults" fire and burglar proof boxes for money and valuable papers, etc.</p>
   <p>The title of this corporation will be "North-Western Trust &amp; Savings Bank".</p>
   <p>The shares will soon be for sale and we are inviting all Poles to come and register.</p>
   <p>Registration for the shares is in the office of Mr. Jan Przbysz, 814 Milwaukee Ave. in the building where the bank will be located.</p>
   <p>A payment at $25.00 should be deposited on each share, the balance may be paid about May 1.</p>
   <p>Without any doubt the shares will pay good dividends, and their value will increase.</p>
   <p>Let as many Poles as possible join this successful endeavor so as to show our people a way to future business and financial establishments.</p>
