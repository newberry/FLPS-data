   <p>A Polish company is being organized to take over the permit given to Count Lubienski to operate a Polish restaurant at the Columbian Exposition. According to reports this company is to be incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois at a capital value of $25,000. These reports further state that the following individuals have taken ten shares of stock at a par value of one hundred dollars: Peter Kiolbassa, Andrew Szulc, A. J. Kowalski, and F. Wleklinski. The following have subscribed for five shares of stock: Mrs. Barzynska, Andrew Kwasigroch, Mr. Kobrzynski, P. Arkuszewski, T. Krolik, Mr. Suwalski, Mr. Zalinski, M. Drzemala, and M. Mucha. Count Lubienski's share will be $10,000, or one hundred shares. At the present time the stock is being handled by F. Wleklinski, who is the acting treasurer. Shares are being sold at 25 per cent of their original value.</p>
   
   <p>It appears that this Polish enterprise is being capitalized by private subscription. This is a deviation from the regular form, that is, an appeal for support before the company is organized. This company, however, is not asking for any help.</p>
