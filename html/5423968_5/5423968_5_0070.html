   <p>Information has reached Dziennik Zwiazkowy to the effect that certain uninvited guardians of the Polish National Alliance and its institutions are spreading rumors to the effect that the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, at whose head stands Mr. John F. Smulski, well known in Polish-American circles, has made an enormous profit in the recent transfer of money from the Department of Independence to Europe.</p>
   <p>Rumors of this type can be nothing more than pure imagination on the part of the opponents of the Department of Independence. They are put into circulation purposely so as to harm the Polish National Alliance and the bank of which Mr. Smulski is president.</p>
   <p>We want to veryify the fact that, before going to the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, we visited all the other important banks in Chicago dealing in <span class="page-break">\2</span>foreign exchange. We did this with but one purpose in mind--to send the money to our needy brethren in war-torn Europe at the lowest possible rate of exchange. We attest with our own signatures to the fact that the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank made no profit whatsoever in this transaction.</p>
   <p>C. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance</p>
   <p>John S. Zawilski, general secretary</p>
   <p>Joseph Magdziarz, treasurer</p>
