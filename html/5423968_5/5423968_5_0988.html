   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Patriotic Organization, in the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, about which we have had occasion to write often in a very favorable manner, and which has worked for quite a few years for the benefit of the Polish people, in the theatrical and patriotic fields, was dissolved the other day.... The reasons for this step are unknown to us.</p>
   <p>We are given to understand, however, that many of the young amateurs, who understand the purpose and importance of such a patriotic and dramatic circle, have called on the reverend pastor with an appeal to revive the Circle, or to form a new one.</p>
   <p>We are told that the pastor promised the brave young amateurs to do all he can. At present, we wish them success in their undertaking, and if anything is done we will gladly publish the news.</p>
