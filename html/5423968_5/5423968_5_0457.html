   <p>He who in a foreign land revived and encouraged Polish song with all his might, who nursed it and spread it abroad, has passed away.</p>
   <p>Our father, mentor, and teacher is no more. He has left us in deep sorrow, us his youngest children of song.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless he lives and will continue to live in his work and in the noble maxim, "Service of the nation, service of God calls me."</p>
   <p>May this foreign soil weigh lightly on this indefatigable worker.</p>
   <p>To his family immersed in grief we send sincerest expressions of sympathy.</p>

   <p>Holy Trinity in Chicago</p>
