   <p>The company is progressing satisfactorily. The board of directors made the second payment of $8,500 a few days ago.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the company, Mr. Maryanski, received a telegram from California requesting one of the directors to come to the mine at once, because there is an opportunity to lease an old but well kept mill, to which half of the iron tracks are already built. This mill is operated by electricity. If the company will be able to lease this mill on favorable terms, then we can undertake the exploitation of the mine immediately.</p>
   <p>Engineer Maryanski descended to a depth of one hundred and twelve feet in order to tap the main gold vein. Another Polish engineer, Mr. Jurski, is assisting him. Both of them came to the conclusion that near the main entrance, where samples of gold ore have been mined to be shipped to the Lwow Exposition, a new vein so rich in gold has been uncovered that now there can be no doubt that this <span class="page-break">\2</span>rich-in-gold ore does not extend right along the center of the vein for several hundred feet. A rich gold-bearing ore has also been found about thirteen feet below the surface in the tunnel.</p>
   <p>In view of such a favorable report, the Polish mine will commence operations soon. At their last extraordinary meeting the directors decided to send one of their number to California, who is to thoroughly examine the offer for the mill standing idle near the Polish mine, and, if competent people consider it adequate, then he is to sign a lease for it.</p>
   <p>Mr. John F. Smulski, the secretary of the board of directors, will probably travel to California.</p>
