   <p>Twelve public programs in the form of theatrical, concert, and other social entertainment were staged yesterday throughout the Polish communities in Chicago. This is indeed a record, one that the remainder of the Poles in the United States could not match. It must also be added that all the halls where the exercises were staged were filled to capacity. All events were unusually pleasing to the audiences. Unfortunately, it is impossible to write about all the celebrations because of lack of space, but a few words must be said about the St. Casimir Young Men's Society.</p>
   <p>The Polish Hall, located on Bradley Street near Noble Street, was practically filled to capacity. The drawing power was the play "Cave of the Condemned," in five acts, by A. S. Zdzieblowski. All actors were at their best. A great deal of the success of the drama must be credited to Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>director.</p>
   <p>Instead of offering high praise to the Polish youths for their excellent performances, we will emphasize that we desire more programs of this sort from them.</p>
