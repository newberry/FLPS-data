   <p>A meeting of the committee of the Educational Department was held last night in the offices of the Polish National Alliance. The committee is composed of a number of men and women.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held for the purpose of making arrangements for a concert for the benefit of an educational fund.</p>
   <p>This concert will be held on Saturday, April 11, in the Holy Trinity Parish Hall. The concert will be given by the best Polish and American talent available in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>As is to be expected, this concert will be a pleasant and varied entertainment, and it should bring a good profit to the Educational Department of the Polish National Alliance. The ball will be free and all the other expenses will be slight, if any at all.</p>
   <p>Many societies have already signified their willingness to participate and to help this good cause. The prices of tickets are very low: reserved seats, thirty-five cents, other seats at twenty-five cents; and children will be admitted for fifteen cents.</p>
