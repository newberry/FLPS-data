   <p>"South Chicago, November 1, 1893.</p>
   <p>"At a private gathering of the Polish Republican Club, held on Sunday, October 29, at the home of P. Szymanski, a collection was taken up for the benefit of the Fund for the Polish-American Pavilion in Lwow. The total amount collected was twenty-one dollars.</p>
   <p>"This is, in truth, a small sum for so noble a purpose as that of making Polish-American representation at the Lwow Exposition possible, but in times as hard as these, more is hardly possible. God grant that the times improve--South Chicago's generosity will then increase also.</p>

   <p>"The money was placed in the hands of the Fund's treasurer, W. Bardonski.</p>
   <p>W. Pacholski,</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Polish Republican Club."</p>
   <p>Editor's note: We offer our sincere thanks to the donors from South Chicago for this noble contribution. Let the representatives from other Polish communities follow their example and we will have no need to feel concern for the fate of the Polish-American pavilion in Lwow.</p>
