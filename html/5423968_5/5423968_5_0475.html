   <p>The elite of our Chicago Polish settlement gathered at the Y.M.C.A. Auditorium last night; doctors, lawyers, journalists, many Polish businessmen with their wives and daughters, and, probably, all members of our Polish dramatic clubs and choirs, every Pole who is even slightly attracted by music, as well as every one who desired either to see or hear the singer, was present.</p>
   <p>Miss Felicia Romanowski, known as the master of Polish songs, proved last night at the Y.M.C.A. Auditorium, that she is entitled to that honor.</p>
   <p>Those sweet melodies of Polish songs, revered by every soul, were expressed so thrillingly and artistically by Miss Romanowski that she won the hearts of all.</p>
   <p>The first two songs: "Dudziarz" and "Gustava," composed by Paderewski, revealed her great talent and thorough study but these selections did not prove very effective. However the other airs, especially "Wracaj" (Return) by John Gall, with its sweet appeal to Polish wanderers, entreating them to retun to their homes, the forests and fields, stirred the soul and captivated the public. Last night's concert gave our youth an opportunity to hear and admire our euphonious language and music.</p>
   
   <p>Miss Romanowski, aside from being a singer is also a capable actress; she was rewarded with enthusiastic applause and the concert must be recorded as having been a great success.</p>
