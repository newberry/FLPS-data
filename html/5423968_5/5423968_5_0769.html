   <p>A special program of interest was staged yesterday, before many selected guests at the Holy Family Orphanage, by the Sisters of Notre Dame, who are in charge of two hundred Polish orphans. The program was staged in honor of the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, C.R., pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish and founder of the Holy Family Orphanage.</p>
   <p>Besides the Reverend Barzynski, the following priests were present: The Reverend Fathers Francis Gordon, W. Rapacz, T. Szybkowski, S. Cosimi, Andrew Spetz, John Piechowski, Joseph Gieburowski, Brother Joseph Osowski, and the more important supporters of the home. The special audience had an opportunity to see the results of the methods of education and training applied to the unfortunate children in the Orphanage, and how they are being prepared as future Polish-American citizens. The children, although not garbed in the finest clothes, are well fed and well trained. They had a pleasant appearance with their winsome smiles. Many of them are not aware <span class="page-break">2</span>of their plight. Although some have no mothers or fathers, they have found a substitute affection in the many attendants and supporters. Yes, instead of finding a father they have found a guardian, which brings to mind the immortal words of Jesus, "Whatsoever you shall do for one of the unfortunate children, you are doing this for me" (sic).</p>
   <p>Yesterday's performance was given as a token of thanks for the efforts of the priests and of the private individuals who have given their support. All were convinced that their efforts were not wasted. The children congratulated the pastor on account of the day's being named for him, and wished him endless days of health. The congratulatory remarks were made in the Polish language, which prevails throughout the institution. Although there are two Irish children in the institution, they have learned not only the Polish language but the customs as well. This, of course, does not mean that English is not taught to the children. All children are instructed equally in the Polish as well as the English language.</p>

   <p>The program took place as scheduled. Declamations, songs, monologues, humorous verses, and drills were only a part of the entertainment. Little girls in white dresses, made-up as mothers, appeared on the stage with baby dolls in their arms. This was designed to portray how the girls would appear when they reached adulthood. The song "Let Us Go Together" was an example of the spirit that prevails in the Holy Family Orphanage. The pastor was greatly moved by this performance and promised the children a special May Day event as a reward. He appointed a committee which will lay plans for this event. An outing will be held in one of the city parks.</p>
   <p>What reward is given to the hard-working Sisters of Notre Dame, guardians of the Holy Family Orphanage? A feeling of gratitude from the Polish people who help to support this institution. This help is rendered through quiet and energetic work on the part of spirited people.</p>
   <p>We recommend this Polish institution to all Polish parishes throughout Chicago and vicinity, for this orphanage has an important meaning to all Poles.</p>
