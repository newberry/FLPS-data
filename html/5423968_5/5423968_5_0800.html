   <p>Last night a number of friends of Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, director of Polish theatrical performances for many years, met in Szulc's Hall to honor his birthday with an extremely comical musical entertainment.</p>
   <p>Everybody had a good time. The monologues by A. Chrzanowski and John Czekala were excellent and brought a terrific outburst of applause. Songs by Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch, Miss Wanda Barwig, and Mrs. Jozwiakowska were also vigorously applauded. The entire program was excellent.</p>
   <p>The hall was overcrowded, which proves that Mr. Zahajkiewicz has many sincere friends.</p>
