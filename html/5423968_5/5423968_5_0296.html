   <p>I feel obligated to publicly express my thanks to the Polish firm E. L. Schultz &amp; Company of Chicago for the businesslike way in which they had my invention patented. For a long time there had been a need for such a Polish business in America, and I feel certain that the new firm will help many of our countrymen.</p>
