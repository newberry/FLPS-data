   <p>On Easter Monday, April 9, the musico-literary society Promien (Ray) presented a drama by Julius Slowacki, entitled "Mary Stuart", at the Polish Women's Alliance hall, 1309 North Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>This play takes us back several centuries. We see a young beautiful, sensitive woman occupying the throne of Scotland, a woman brought up in luxury and excess, and therefore a queen of weak will. She is Mary Stuart. A series of figures circulate about her representing various shades of her feelings and dreams. We see, therefore, Henry Darnley, her husband, Chancellor Morton, lutist Rizzio, the mysterious Bothwell, and further the manly Douglas, Lindsey, admirer of lions, the page, Nick the jester, and the "wise" astrologer.</p>
   <p>The queen finds herself in a difficult situation. At a time when the people are rebelling, when her husband suspects her, and when a strong will is needed most in order to control herself and her people, she indulges her caprices, yielding to promptings of vanity and coquetry.</p>
   <p>Beginning with the page, burning with almost childish love for her, up to the typically Byronic Bothwell, all love her. And she, like a spike of rye, turns first in one direction, then another, with every breath of the wind.</p>
   <p>The main axis of the play is the queen's love for Bothwell. Everything circles around it. The queen, who has summoned Bothwell to a tryst, yields to him with strange ease. She does not retreat, but continues on her downward path, until finally she becomes a criminal. Having lost the principles of her faith, her queenly pride and self-respect, for worthless fancies, she considers herself the most unhappy woman in her kingdom. Her conscience reproaches her terribly. Under the dreaded vision of her future fate--imprisonment and punishment--she wants to retract the murder, but it is too late.</p>
   <p>The entire drama, presented by the amateurs of the Promien Society more or less successfully, made a great impression on the audience. Everyone was completely convinced that only good deeds can bring peace and contentment.</p>
   <p>Mrs. W. Wachtel played the role of Mary Stuart. Her articulation, voice modulation, movements, understanding and feeling of the role made Mrs. Wachtel's performance very good. If Mrs. Wachtel were a little shorter and looked a little younger--her characterization of Mary Stuart would have been excellent.</p>
   <p>The role of Henry Darnley, husband of the queen, a man unreasonably jealous and fanatical, was played by Mr. Scholl, whom the public knows from several previous stage appearances. During the opening acts his performance did not create much of an impression on the audience. It was not until the fourth and fifth acts that the audience was able to feel satisfied.</p>
   <p>Despite considerable shortcomings, primarily in the opening scenes, Mr. Scholl's role as a whole came out rather well.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. J. Urbanski, in the role of Morton, the doddering old Chancellor, performed his part in general rather well, although some gestures and the modulations of his voice in certain scenes were not in complete harmony with the character of the role.</p>
   <p>The role of the lutist was rather well played by Mr. K. Jedlinski, with an understanding of the part and appropriate gestures and tone. The scene portraying the death of Rizzio in the Queen's chamber, in our opinion, was the best.</p>
   <p>Mr. K. D. Kasperek presented a typically Byronic Bothwell of mysterious mien, bitter smile, and scorn on his pale face interrupted by violent outbursts of passions and desires. This is an especially difficult role to portray. It takes a true artist to play it. Therefore, it is not surprising that Mr. Kasperek, who is one of the younger amateurs, and not an artist, was not able to re-create the Bothwell Slowacki had in mind.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. K. Wojtowicz played the role of Knight Douglas to everyone's general satisfaction. In our opinion, he gave a better performance than in any of his previous appearances.</p>
   <p>The role of Lindsey, the great admirer of lions, made no definite impression. Some say that this was due to the fact that this part has not much meaning in the play itself; others, that Mr. Wroblewski, who portrayed it did not possess the necessary stature and voice which Lindsey requires. We believe that both opinions have much to recommend them.</p>
   <p>Miss M. Dach made a very charming appearance in the role of the page. This role had a great deal to do with lightening the tone of the entire play, thanks to the graceful figure of the page and skillful presentation. It would be difficult to find a better page among the amateurs and the followers of the stage in Chicago.</p>
   <p>And who was not enthusiastic about Mr. K. [Karol] Wachtel's portrayal of Nick the jester? It seemed to the audience that Mr. Wachtel lived and breathed his clowning part. In the beginning the jester created the impression of a mischivous imp, later he became gentler, and finally roused the sympathy and feeling of the audience. In this play Mr. Wachtel deserves the palm in every respect. Nevertheless, he deserves particular recognition for the scene portraying Nick's death. Parenthetically speaking, it will not hurt to add that Mr. Wachtel was the director of "Mary Stuart."</p>
   <p>We cannot pass over in silence Mr. Paluszek's portrayal of the role of the terribly learned and serious astrologer. Despite the monotony of his voice, Mr. Paluszek made a good impression, and his role may be ranked among the successful ones.</p>
   <p>"Mary Stuart" is an unusually difficult play for amateurs to perform. In spite of this, the musico-literary society Promien, which obviously has taken the idea "Measure your strength to your intentions, and not your intentions to your strength" as its motto, dared to select it from a mass of other much easier plays. The Promien Society did not have much time to prepare for the presentation of the play, and the work that had to be done was tremendous. Therefore, one should make allowances in reviewing the play, and give the Promien Society the highest recognition for its energetic efforts.</p>
   <p>There were not so many deficiencies in the portrayal of specific roles as there were good points, and that is why the play as a whole came out very well.</p>
   <p>The Promien Society deserves recognition for acquainting the public with so beautiful a play as "Mary Stuart".</p>
