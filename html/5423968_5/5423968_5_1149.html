   <p>The Polish Day World war Exhibition committee held a meeting on Friday, September 13, 1918, at the Polish women's Alliance headquarters. The meeting was conducted under the chairmanship of Judge Edmund [K.] Jarecki. All members of the committee, as well as the two chorus directors, Messrs. A. Kwasigroch and B. Rybowiak, were present.</p>
   <p>Judge Jarecki informed the committee that Mr. Roman Dmowski, president of the Polish National Committee in Paris, will arrive in Chicago today. The chairman suggested that the entire world War Exhibition committee and representatives of the Polish National Department greet the distinguished guest upon his arrival at the railroad station. A motion was made and carried to record formally these statements made by the chairman. The committee then occupied itself with the details of the program for the World war Exhibition.</p>
   <p>Recruiting Officer Zub was also present at this meeting. He asked the committee to offer suggestions on the manner in which the booth assigned to the Polish Army should be arranged. A thorough discussion of this question ensued. It was finally decided to decorate the recruiting booth with the photographs and pictures in the central recruiting office. In the center there is to be a picture of the late Peter Wojtalewicz, the first Pole in the Army of the United States to be killed in action. The decorative part was left in the capable hands of the popular Polish artist, Mr. Casimir Majewski. During the Exhibition a member of the committee, to be chosen by the committee itself, will have the task of describing in English the life of Polish soldiers in camp and in the trenches. In addition the national aims and aspirations of the poles will be portrayed, and the ardour of the Polish people for the cause of liberty.</p>
   <p>Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary of the Polish Women's Alliance, and Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz were also present at this meeting. They announced to the committee the glad tidings that beginning tomorrow, that is, September 14, 1918, the Polish national flag will wave from the city hall of Chicago, the greatest and largest Polish settlement in America. Miss Napieralski announced that although the flag was purchaced by the Polish women's Alliance, nevertheless that Alliance makes no pretense of owning it, and it is to be considered the gift of all Polish women and not the contribution of any individual organization. An invitation is therefore extended to all Polish women in America to participate in the dedicatory ceremonies. Miss Napieralski also appealed to the committee, urging them to be present at the city hall on this auspicious occasion. A personal invitation was also extended to Lieutenant Zub, requesting him to let Polish soldiers attired in uniform constitute an honorary guard at the dedication of the Polish flag. Alderman Adamkiewicz announced that in the absence of Mayor Thompson the Polish flag will be accepted by the Commissioner of Public Works, Mr. Barnett.</p>
   <p>The committee accepted with great enthusiasm the reports given by Miss Napieralski and Alderman Adankiewicz. The members expressed their gratitude for the painstaking work of these two prominent Polish leaders. The committee decided unanimously to participate in the dedicatory ceremonies at the city hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vincent Jozwiakowski, the secretary of the Polish Day World War Exhibition committee, gave a report of the committee's finances. He then announced that badges for the committee will be ready for distribution on Saturday, that is, on the eve of the Polish Day, and may be obtained at the Northwestern Bank, Milwaukee Avenue and Division Street. He further declared that the Exhibition committee has nothing to do with the sale of badges and souvenirs at the Polish army booth at the Exhibition. That will be left in the hands of the Polish National Department. This Department will exercise control over the profits thus obtained, which will be turned over for relief work in Poland. Upon a motion made by Dr. W. Kuflewski it was decided to direct the Polish public to be present at the grounds of the exhibition on later than one o'clock in the afternoon, last admittance be denied them because of the large number of people expected, since the Polish Day will also be the last day of the Exhibition. It was also decided to direct our people to gather before the Statue of Liberty, where the most important part of the program will take place.</p>
   <p>The program of the Women's Committee of the Kational Council of Defense will consist principally of vocal renditions by Mmes. R. Kwasigroch and Agnes Nehring and by their pupils.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kwasigroch, the director of the choruses, declared that the Poles will shatter all records by presenting a united chorus of seven hundred well-trained singers. The largest national chorus which has appeared thus far at the Exhibition was the Swedish chorus of five hundred voices. Young Polish ladies, dight in the colorful Polish national costumes, will occupy the front rows. An appeal is hereby made to all singers who are to participate in this affair that if any of them have national costumes of their own, they will kindly appear in them at the Exhibition grounds.</p>
   <p>The main program is to be composed of the following numbers:</p>
   
   <p>1) The American National Anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner"</p>
   <p>2) Polish Song, "Smoke of Conflagration" (Z Dymen Pozarow)</p>
   <p>3) Introductory address by the president of the Polish Day World War Exhibition committee, Judge Edmund [K.] Jarecki, in which he will present Mr. Roman Dmowski</p>

   <p>7) Polish National Anthem, "God Save Poland, "sung by the chorus</p>
   
   <p>It might be mentioned here that in addition to the choral pieces mentioned above the chorus will sing many other songs which undoubtedly will be extraordinarily attractive.</p>
   <p>Dr. W. Kuflewski made a motion, which was carried to select a committee which in co-operation with the Polish National Department will formulate a telegram and send it to president Woodrow Wilson, expressing the American Pole's unwavering loyalty to American and to her ideals. The following were selected for that committee: Dr. Kuflewski, maker of the motion, and Mmes. M. Sakowska and A. Korzeniowska.</p>

   <p>Judge Jarecki, president of the Polish Day committee, and the other members of the committee have worked diligently to assure the success of the festivity, and sincere recognition is due to them. The Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, appeals to all Poles to consider September 15, 1918, as a national holiday of primary importance. Our people are therefore urged to prove how closely the interests of Poland are combined with the interests of their adopted country, America. This they can best snow by attending the World War Exhibition on Polish Day. Let the voice of the Polish-American citizens congregated at tomorrow's festivity, a report of which will be transmitted in the form of a telegram to the chief of the nation, our defender, president Woodrow Wilson, prove to the world at large that the aims of Poland are identical with those of America. Let our people show by their attendance their loyalty to the Star-Spangled Banner and to the Polish white Eagle, both of which represent the highest principles of true freedom.</p>
