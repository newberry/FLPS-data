   <p>The Dramatic Circle of the Holy Trinity Parish held a dance in Groenwald Hall on the last Sunday before Lent. It lasted until the break of day.</p>
   <p>At the suggestion of the president of the Circle, a collection was taken for the Kosciusko Monument fund. Four dollars and five cents were received.</p>
   <p>The next theatrical performance will take place April 23. The play, "Emigracya Chlopska" (Peasants' Emigration) will be given.</p>
   <p>I wish to remind the members that our quarterly meeting will be held next Tuesday. Absent members will be fined twenty-five cents.</p>
