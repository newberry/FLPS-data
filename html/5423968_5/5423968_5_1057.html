   <p>Yesterday's performance of "Vengeance" at the school hall near Bradley Street is worthy of praise. "Vengeance" is a drama of rather difficult performance by amateurs, for, since it has been performed in Poland by the best professional actors, it affords a precedent for uncomplimentary comparisons. The fact that it is written in verse contributes likewise to the difficulty of the task. Despite all this, however, it was played to the satisfaction of even our severest critics. Every actor performed his part at least well--some brilliantly. The whole play proceeded easily, with a mastery to be expected only from professionals.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adam Szwajkart, who played the most important role, performed brilliantly, with real artistic finesse. It seems to us--and it is not flattery--that Mr. Szwajkart is one of our best amateur actors in Chicago. We suggest that he should give more attention to the stage than he has given it heretofore. Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, of whom it is said that whether he writes or teaches or acts he is always excellent, lived up to his reputation. Other difficult <span class="page-break">\2</span>roles were played by Mr. Ignatius Kowalski, Mr. Jozwiakowski, and Mr. Grabowiecki. The feminine roles, which in this drama are secondary, were played by Countess Lubienski and Miss Chlebowski. Even the minor roles were played irreproachably. The effect of the whole was one of artistic excellence.</p>
