   <p>Now when the great war rages in Europe, inexorable death, as though mocking our fate, strikes in our ranks, taking away our leaders and Poland's best sons, not only on Polish soil but in all the countries where thay have gathered to work for her deliverance from bondage.</p>
   <p>Here we stand at the bier in which rest the remains of Anthony Mallek, our dear brother in the Alliance, indefatigable worker in the nationalistic field and in the Alliance, the first composer and father of Polish song in America, secretary general of the Polish National Alliance, a citizen of great virtues and deserts.</p>

   <p>Whereas, Anthony Mallek took over the office of secretary general of the Alliance at the eighth convention, at a most difficult and critical time, when from all sides thunderbolts were being hurled at our small ranks in an attempt to break them up and destroy them, and to bury the patriotic work begun by the Alliance; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, Anthony Mallek, as secretary general, persevered in his policy, and by great effort, tact, and good advice saved our organization from destruction; therefore be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, That the members of the Central Board of Directors, gathered today at their meeting of February 5, 1917, motivated by deep grief at the loss that the Alliance bears through the loss of this fearless champion, honor him by rising; and be it futher</p>
   <p>Resolved, That they shall be guided by his example and will persevere in the work for the homeland to the end; and be it further</p>
