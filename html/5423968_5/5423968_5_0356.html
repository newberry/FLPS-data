   <p>Mr. Juszczenc, a Pole living on West Division Street, has just completed a very remarkable piece of work. He has constructed an occasional table of 6,235 pieces of wood without the use of a single nail or a bit of glue. It is a very beautiful and original piece of work. Persons who would like to buy it, can apply to Dziennik Chicagoski for further information.</p>
