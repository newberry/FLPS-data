   <p>Yesterday was a festive Sunday for South Chicago Poles.</p>
   <p>The members of St. Michael Archangel Parish celebrated their pastor's birthday in a befitting manner. The kindergarten class presented a play. The rectory was decorated with flowers, and two local orchestras, founded by the endeavors of Reverend A. Nowicki, pastor of the Parish, played mazurkas and polonaises in his honor.</p>
   <p>The large number of persons attending the celebration was sufficient evidence that the pastor is well beloved by his parishioners.</p>
   <p>The play staged by three, four, and five-year-old children moved every one to tears. The play, "Boleslaw Smiazy Dzieckiem" (Boleslaus the Valiant as a child), was a great success and was loudly applauded by the audience. The cadets, commanded by L. Machnikowski, gave a drill that was faultless, and received much applause. The little Kosynierzy (Scythemen) have made great progress and are ready to fight the Russians at Raclawice even today.</p>
   <p>There was quite a large attendance but not too large for comfort. It is a pity, however, that more people were not present, for the play by the kindergarten class indeed thrilled the audience and was well worth seeing. This kindergarten should be supported.</p>
   <p>It was a long program, consisting of more than twenty numbers, and, because of its length, it could not be completed, as it was getting too late.</p>
   <p>In general, yesterday's play was done extremely well. Children who can learn to sing and recite at such a young age should make good strides and become well educated patriotic citizens.</p>
