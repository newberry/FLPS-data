   <p>Interesting to the mind and stimulating to the emotions, will be the third annual Polish Arts Club concert to be held at Ravinia Park on Sunday, August 5th, 1928, at 3 P.M.</p>
   <p>A glance at the program shows that most of the compoitions to be heard, are the works of modern Polish musicians. Mr. Ziolkowski will play his own much discussed, "Polish Mountain Fantasy, 'Tatry'". Mr. Ziolkowski's genius as a composer is recognized by musicians in Poland as well as by many in America.</p>
   <p>A rare opportunity awaits those who are especially interested in the modern movement of Polish music, in the orchestral works of Noskowski, Karlowicz and Szymanowski - those leading lights among the moderns. Mr. De Lamarter will surely give this work authentic and interesting reading.</p>
   <p>Then there are two very excellent choruses, the Philharmonic and Filarets, who will bring to the program their usual enthusiasm and finished work.</p>
   <p>The only number which is not of Polish origin is "Handel's Sonata," it will be played by Wilkomirski and Szpinalski, who are new-comers to the Chicago colony, but they have been heard often in their perfect ensemble and always provide a <span class="page-break">2</span>pleasant experience.</p>
   <p>In the evening the Ravinia Opera Company will present "Carmen," with Janina Burska playing the title role.</p>
   <p>The offering this year will surpass even the finest programs of previous years.</p>
