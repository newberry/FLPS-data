   <p>The representatives of four societies from St. Josephat's Parish, of Lake View, applied to the financial secretary of the Polish Day Central Committee and announced their desire to participate in the parade on October 7. These societies are St. Josephat's Society (120 members), Holy Virgin Mary Society (220 members), Heart of Jesus Society (170 members), and St. Francis Xavier Society (60 members). The last mentioned society has already paid its assessment; the other three will pay on next Thursday. And so it is that our brothers, the Pomeranians [Kaszubi, Polish Pomeranians], will participate with us in Polish Day. They and the pastor of their parish deserve acknowledgment.</p>
