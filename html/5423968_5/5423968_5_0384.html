   <p>Yesterday we listened to the concert of Olga Orlenska, Polish opera prima donna. Miss Orlenska fulfilled her concert engagement at Kimball Hall, which was filled to capacity by the public. She was accompanied by John Wiederhirn, and the program consisted of six numbers: operatic arias and Polish folk songs.</p>
   <p>This concert can unquestionably be listed as one of the best given at any time to our lovers of song and music in this country.</p>
   <p>Miss Orlenska without doubt possesses a rich and sonorous voice. Technically she uses this voice in an expert manner without exerting much effort, and pouring into the technique much feeling and ardent temperament, leaving the listener overwhelmed with delight.</p>
   <p>The program yesterday opened with an aria "Our Child is Dying" from the operas "Halka" by Moniuszko. Miss Orlenska rather colorfully protrays in the song the emotions of the loing, though perplexed mother, who despairingly and revolting at destiny, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>gazes apathetically at her only child, dying. In the aria from the opera, Aida, by Verdi, the artist, conforming to the libretta and the colorful military melody, excellently enchanced the spirit and the power of heroic music.</p>
   <p>The operettas by Moraczewski and the Russian debauchery song, "Today He Laughs" were also very good.</p>
   <p>The aria from "Madame Butterfly" by Puccini, and a selection from the opera, "Cavaleria Rusticana" by Mascagni rendered in Italian were done very well, because undoubtedly they would be accepted with recognitions on any first-class American stage, and perhaps even in the operatic world.</p>
   <p>The chain of operatic selections was ended with a ballag from the opera, "The Dutch Vagabond" by Wagner, in which Orlenska sang the passages from the mighty Wagnerian music extremely well.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with Polish folk songs, but due to much applause the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>artist, as an encore, sang the well-known and lovely song, "The Last Mazur".</p>
   <p>Miss Olga Orlenska surely belongs to the better Polish songstresses, known here to us in America. However, her program yesterday, for some unknown reason, was so arranged that it did not allow her to display either the technique, so characteristic of well accomplished artists, or the volume of her vocal range. In the entire concert there was not even one cadenza or one difficult passage, nor was there a single note beyond high "C". In this, however, it was not the fault of the artist alone, who sang, as aforementioned with facility and grace, as much as that of the one who selected the compositions for the program.</p>
   <p>Besides this, in yesterday's concert at certain times, the artist lacked the freedom of a stage veteran, that sturdy certainty of movement, that ardor and temperament, which enraptures the listener and puts him into a frame of wonderment, charm, and compels him to admire the artist.</p>
   <p>These few observations presented themselves to us yesterday at the concert of the prima donna.</p>

   <p>This concert, nevertheless, is ranked among the best which have been heard here in our colony in recent years, and the kind which we want to hear often, not only within a circle, strictly Polish, but American, international, so that the renown of Polish art will go forth far and wide.</p>
