   <p>Polish student's annual play by the Polish Literary Club of St. Stanislaus School took place last Wednesday Jan. 18th. The Polish students of that institution conducted a very difficult play entitled Hermenogild or (two crowns). The role of the feeble king was played by the student, M. Wenta. He played his part wonderfully.</p>
   <p>Mr. Domachowski played Hermenogild's part to the taste and satisfaction of the most particular observer. As to the pose, action, enthusiasm, noble charcterization, confidence in his part and strong attachment to the Catholic faith for which he suffered exile and imprisonment, Mr. Domachowski played his part completely. His acting brought tears to the eyes of the audience. His brother Mr. Rekared Domachowski took part of loving brother realistically. So was played part of Goswin's son and decent teacher of Hermenogild Bozand played by Mr. Przybyt and R. Olszewski. Mr. A. Kubiak played the part of intriguer (plotter) in a masterly manner. Fr. Czerwinsky in a role of Arigmund presented an excellent type of a rowdy. K. Swoboda and M. Szlachetka executed their parts as king's messengers (envoys) and intriguers very well. The light effects combined with appropriate scenery reveals the artistic - abilities of the stage manager. The play was a great success. The hall was filled to its capacity.</p>
