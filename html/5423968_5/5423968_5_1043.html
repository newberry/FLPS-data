   <p>On Sunday, November 26, a theatrical performance was staged in Hayes' hall, corner of Southport and Clybourn Avenue, in St. Josephat Parish. The title of the play was "Blazek Opetany" (Blazek Bedevilled). The hall was filled to capacity, due, no doubt, to the fact that the play was given for the benefit of the parish church.</p>
   <p>The amateur players did excellent work, especially Mr. Mudlaf in the role of Blazek, and Mr. Bieszka as Walek; Mr. Bieska's comic acting kept the audience in a constant state of laughter. Miss Sophia Klein as Anastazya excelled among the ladies. Her portrayal of the role was both artistic and realistic. She is a real artist and it is a pity that we see her on the stage so seldom. Mr. Suwalski directed the performance, which was a complete success. It would be well if more of these shows were given in our community.</p>
   
   <p>The other roles worth mentioning were as follows: Czeslaw, by Mr. Winowicz; Celestyn, by Mr. Budzislawski; Soltys, by Mr. Bachinski; Salus, by Miss Chojka; and Klementyna, by Mrs. Sychowska.</p>
   <p>CONCERT FOR THE BENEFIT OF HOLY TRINITY PARISH</p>
   <p>A concert was given by the Chopin and Wanda Choirs last Sunday, November 26, at Schoenhofen Hall, for the benefit of Holy Trinity Parish. The concert was a success and the large audience filled the hall. The orchestra, under the direction of Professor Fitzek, gave a finished performance and was enthusiastically applauded by the audience. The Chopin and Wanda choirs together sang "Wmaju" (In May) by Kontski, and then the male choir sang Chopin's "Marsz Pogrzebowy" (Funeral March) and the peasant songs rendered lately at the Art Institute, and followed these with "Marsz Spiewakow" (The Singers March). The Wanda Choir sang Komorowski's "Kalina," the singing of which was excellent.</p>
   <p>The Holy Trinity school children also sang a couple of numbers. These were followed by our tenor, Mr. G. Wojnicki, who sang so artistically that he was forced to sing two encores. Mr. A. Mallek sang "Wrozba" (Prophecy), by Stanislaus Moniuszko; and Messrs. John Smulski and J. Xelowski sang a duet. All were applauded enthusiastically. Miss J. Mikitynska and Miss R. Meiler played a few piano selections. Mrs. Lande, newly arrived in Chicago, also played some piano numbers, and her rendition of Paderewski's "Krakowiak" was especially pleasing. The concert was successful in every particular.</p>
   <p>THE HARMONIA SOCIETY STAGES TWO COMEDIES</p>
   <p>Last Saturday, November 25, the Harmonia Society staged two one-act comedies in the Aurora Turnhall, on Huron Street. The comedies were entitled "Dyament Nieoszlifowany" (Uncut Diamond) and "Na Przekor" (Teasing). The players in both comedies acted in a truly professional manner. Mrs. Dorszynska and Fritsch performed excellently, and Mrs. Oblinska was the perfect soubrette. Mr. Osuch and Mr. Baczkowski were also very fine. Mr. John F. Smulski enacted his role in the first comedy in truly comic style, while in the second he portrayed the serious lover to perfection. The entire performance was excellent. After the show the small but select audience had a good time dancing.</p>
