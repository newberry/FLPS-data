   <p>We are confirming the fact that the well-known Polishchoir Filareci has been triumphant to a degree which has not been surpassed by any Polish group of singers in America. Last night's concert, at Atlas Hall, though the first staged by Filareci, was indeed a great success and created much enthusiasm. This chorus is composed of Chicago's best Polish singers who have appeared at various national festivals, where they were enthusiastically received. Although organized only seven months ago, it convinced the public that the united effort of good singers can accomplish wonders.</p>
   <p>Due credit should be given to its members, and especially to Mr. B. J. Zalewski, the director, for the great treat given us last night and also for the diligent efforts he expended in training them. It would be difficult to describe to anyone not present, how truely awe-inspiring last night's performance has been. The concert was well rehearsed and only members of the choir appeared. The program showed good taste and everyone present appreciated the artistic accomplishments of the singers. The Shepherd, a song by the young composer Mr. Lachman - the first number on the program - won the hearts of his listeners, holding them spellbound throughout the evening. The audience showed profound respect and reverence for the work. A charming addition to the delightful melody proved to be the Polish fife.</p>

   <p>The public, lost in deep revery, felt itself transplanted to its native heath, expecting at any moment to see the materialization of a poor, barefooted indigenous shepard. The people were charged anew with each succeeding number, not only by the enchanting power of the music but also by the talent of the singers and felt convinced, that the Polish chorus Filareci has that subtle technique so essential to singing.</p>
   <p>Solos, duets, quartets and choral selections were offered. Mr. Borkowski, a tenor, deserves encomiums; he distinguished himself and won prolonged applause. The Filareci concert must be acclaimed as a successful achievement.</p>
