   <p>All sorts of Polish circles and societies in Chicago try to produce, from time to time, for the cultural elevation of the Poles here, the plays of famous dramatists, full of deep thoughts and ideas. Plays of this sort have a great value because they reflect a complete picture of our national life with its joys and sorrows, pointing the way along which we should proceed in order to gain our cherished goal. In spite of their many virtues these plays have one bad point: they are too difficult to be presented on small stages by amateur groups.</p>
   <p>The four-act drama by Lucien Rydel, entitled "Na Zawsze" (Forever), which was presented Saturday evening at the Polish Women's Alliance Building by the Esperanto Dramatic Circle, was one of these plays which are so very difficult to produce.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We realize the tremendous amount of [work] which was put in on the casting of the play by the following people who took part in it: Mr. T. M. Piotrowski, Mrs. J. Frydel, Mr. Joseph Piotrowski, director, Mr. J. Jejot, and others, and that is why we would like to give them the highest acknowledgment for selecting a play of such beauty as "Na Zawsze."</p>
   <p>This play is a mirror of our sufferings after the loss of our freedom; it is the clanging of chains, the weeping of mothers and sweethearts who have lost their loved ones. It is full of words of mourning and the throbbing of an aching heart!</p>
   <p>In order to portray all of this it is necessary not only to understand the plot and to feel it, but it is also necessary to possess inborn acting ability and talent, and an appropriate stage.</p>
   <p>The writer of these words saw "Na Zawsze" a few years ago on the Cracow stage played exclusively by professional actors, and on Saturday observed the unfolding <span class="page-break">3</span>of this same drama on the stage of the Polish Women's Alliance.</p>
   <p>What a difference! Over there the priest was not so monotonous as here. His voice portrayed deep feeling. There was a cry, pain, muffled despair escaping from his breast, and then again a powerful voice which commanded one to believe in the future despite the blows of misfortune. Over here the priest, in our opinion, preserved the same apathetic expression and tone of voice, the same I-don't-care-what-happen [attitude], the same gestures throughout the entire play.</p>
   <p>In our opinion the best performance was given by the director himself, Mr. Joseph Piotrowski, who played the role of the condemned man who escaped from Siberia. His diction and facial expressions were entirely appropriate. If, in addition, a few of his gestures had been a bit more successful, Mr. Piotrowski could compete with the actor of the Cracow stage.</p>
   <p>Mr. T. M. Piotrowski, in the role of the husband of the former mistress of the <span class="page-break">4</span>man condemned by the Russian government, was much weaker. Nevertheless, his voice in some lines was completely appropriate to the thought of the play, and some of his gestures were very successful, yet both his voice and gestures failed dismally in many scenes, especially the last few.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Frydel, in the role of the woman suffering because of her unfortunate love, spoke too fast and in some scenes declaimed her lines too obviously. Her make-up made her appear decidedly too old in this play.</p>
   <p>In praise of Mrs. Frydel, it should be admitted that she portrayed some scenes with a great feeling for the plot and an appropriate tone of voice.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frydel, in the role of the servant, was not bad, but he would have been better had he shown more energy and courage. The servant in this play is really an old veteran, whose blood boils at the sight of the enemy, not an old man broken by life and depressed in spirit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The police showed the least acquaintance with a stage. They came on as timidly and fearfully as a condemned man would approach the spot where in a few moments he would be deprived of his life.</p>
   <p>In spite of the shortcomings which were quite in evidence, those taking part in the play deserve acknowledgment for doing everything within their power.</p>
   <p>It is surprising that so few people attended the performance of such a beautiful and interesting play. Our people come in droves to all sorts of fiddle-faddle, but when they have the opportunity of seeing more serious things they are conspicuous by their absence.</p>
