   <p>The success of the Fair for the benefit of the St. John Cantius parish seems to be assured.</p>
   <p>Many novel articles were purchased for distribution at the Fair. Besides the chance wheels, there will be a "Negroes Table" and two "David Slingshots," where for a few cents one can win a valuable article.</p>
   <p>The committee received a suggestion that a pair of goats be bought to raffle at the Fair, but the committee decided against the idea because of the inconveniences involved.</p>
   <p>Those who feel tired may have a bite and a drink at low prices at the "buffet bar". Buy all you can eat today--tomorrow it will be free.</p>
