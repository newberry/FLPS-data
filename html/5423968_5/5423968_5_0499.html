   <p>There will be a forty-five piece band concert sponsored by the Seventh Regiment, on the 28th of August, in Douglas Park, and so you Poles should benefit by this opportunity given you.</p>
   <p>The admission is free to all listeners. The program consists of Polish musical compositions, like Mazurki by Mr. B. J. Zalewski, and "Public Cracow," gathered and arranged also by Mr. Zalewski. There can be more Polish festivals presented, but that is up to the public to demand them.</p>
   <p>It would be wonderful if the Poles turned out in vast numbers and filled up this park, so that our national dramatic and musical creations could get the admiration they deserve.</p>
