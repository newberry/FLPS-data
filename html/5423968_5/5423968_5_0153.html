   <p>The Polish White Eagle Businessmen's Association is undergoing a thorough reorganization. The plan, approved during the Association's last convention, calls for setting the organizations on more solid, financial ground in order to accumulate a more substantial capital.</p>
   <p>Details of the plan are now being considered at the meetings of all groups of the Polish White Eagle Businessmen's Association, and will finally be confirmed or rejected by the Association's constitutional assembly, which will convene July 27.</p>
   <p>To our knowledge, the plan has been unanimously accepted by the members of Group IV, who have agreed that each member contribute $50.00 a year to the central fund of the Association; the majority of Group I however wants more time to consider the proposition.</p>
