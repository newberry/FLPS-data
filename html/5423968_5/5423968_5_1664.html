   <p>Tonight at 7:30 P. M. there will be a general meeting of the committees representing the Parish Fair, which will open tomorrow night.</p>
   <p>All persons who were employed at the Fair last year are invited to the meeting. This is in the interest of the parish and for a good purpose, since the proceeds of the Fair will be used for completing the unfinished church tower and for laying a stone sidewalk at the front of the church. We hope that every member of the parish, including boys and girls, will do his share and help a good cause.</p>
