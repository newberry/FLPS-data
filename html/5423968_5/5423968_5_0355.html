   <p>In Mrs. Slominski's workshop we have seen two beautiful banners--one for the St. Barbara Society of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, the other for the St. John Cantius Society of St. Joseph Parish in Town of Lake. The first has an image of St. Barbara on one side and on the other the beheading of this Saint. On one side of the St. John Cantius Society banner is an image of this Saint and on the other Christ on the Cross.</p>
   <p>The banners are richly embroidered in gold. Besides these, Mrs. Slominski is making many other banners for various societies in Buffalo, Detroit, and other cities.</p>
