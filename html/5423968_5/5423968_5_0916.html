   <p>The National Theatre, a newly founded organization, is developing well and it may be that it will interest itself better than it has been up to now in regard to the social relations in our colony. So far there are fifty names of eminent people on its membership list who possibly have differing views on social affairs, but with the understanding that social matters and national matters demand mutual interest and discussion.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting we completed a constitution and made a resolution to give the first profit derived from a play to benefit the orphans.</p>
   <p>There also was chosen a corresponding committee to find a suitable hall downtown where the performance will be held on Sunday, February 25.</p>
   
   <p>The committee chosen is composed of the following persons: Dr. A. Szwajkart, chairman; E. J. Hibner, first vice-chairman; Dr. Wyczolkowaka, recording secretary; Jan Kowalski, financial secretary; August Kowalski, treasurer, and on the board of directors: S. Zahajkiewioz, K. Kaczmarek and Jan Romanowicz. S. Zahajkiewicz was elected stage director.</p>
   <p>The stage director shall present to the management for its endorsement other officers who shall assist him in the production of the play.</p>
