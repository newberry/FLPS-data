   <p>A large audience attended, and enjoyed the first public appearance of Miss Ester Kaczorowska. Her renditions were marvelous and beyond our expectations.</p>
   <p>The "Nightingale" by Liszt, "Gavotte" by "Bach" and the "Sonata Pathetique" by Beethoven were played with profound emotion, with such an adroit, yet graceful, artistic technique that the audience was spellbound.</p>
   <p>Considering Miss Kaczorowska's perseverance and diligence, it is predicted that she will attain stardom in the near future.</p>
   <p>Our Agnes Nering, with her variety of songs, received great applause; likewise a violin solo by Mr. Wisniewski.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion, Dr. J. Szymanski spoke of the necessity of education, and the establishment of a Polish Home or cultural center, towards which the proceeds of this concert are applied.</p>
