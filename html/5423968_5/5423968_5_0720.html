   <p>A concert will be given by the Alliance of Polish Singers of America, Circuit No. 1, at Walsh's hall, Chicago, on Sunday, April 3, at 8:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>The most talented Polish soloists of Chicago and choirs of the Polish National Alliance will take part in this concert.</p>
   <p>The program is made up of compositions, written by the most noted Polish composers such as Moniuszko, Zielinski, Dembinski, etc.</p>
   <p>This concert will linger in the memory of the Polish people of America for a long time, owing to the fact, that the third act of the opera Konrad Wallenrod, will be produced for the first time not only in Chicago, but in the United States. It is a difficult composition, but a grand <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and beautiful opera, and will be sung by combined choirs.</p>
   <p>A tenor solo by Mr. Jos. a. Dumanowski, a bass solo by Mr. Witkowski, accompanied by the orchestra composed of forty musicians. The orchestra will be augmented for the opera "Konrad Wallenrod" by Zielinski. You certainly can expect to be genuinely entertained, especially if you love Polish song and music.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program will be the choir contests, and prizes will be awarded to the winning choirs.</p>
   <p>The choirs have already been training and rehearsing for months, and every body concerned is working conscientiously to make this concert a grand success</p>

   <p>Miss Rose Kwasigroch, the very able and prominent Polish artist, will sing "A New Waltz", by J. W. Rybak.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jos. W. Rybak, the circuit director of the singers, will direct the concert. It is his hard work and promotional ability that are making this concert possible.</p>
