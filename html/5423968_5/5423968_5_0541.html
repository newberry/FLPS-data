   <p>Mieczyslaw Niedzwiedzinski, one of the representatives of the Polish artists whose paintings are on exhibit at the World's Fair, has communicated a very interesting plan [to Dziennik Chicagoski]. The plan provides for the lottery of about twenty of the Polish paintings now on exhibit, from which a portion of the profits is to be used here for public and charitable purposes.</p>
   <p>M. Niedzwiedzinski proposes the sale of a hundred and twenty thousand tickets at one dollar each (or 60,000 at $2), with the prize to be one of the original Polish paintings, to be purchased for this purpose. In addition, each ticket will entitle the holder to a photographic reproduction of one of the paintings.</p>
   <p>The originator of the plan proposes the following paintings for lottery:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"The Itinerant Merchant" and "Mauretania," by Alchimowicz; "The Convalescent," by Gazycowa; "Meditation" and "Darling," by Dukszynska; W. Gerson's "Queen Hedwig," "Christening of Lithuania," and "King Sigmund"; Jasinski's "Holiday Services"; "Kedzierski's "Little Church" and "Return from the City"; Malczewski's "Death of a Siberian Exile"; Matejko's "Wernyhora"; Mirecki's "Unconsoled"; Modenstein's "Under Christian Care"; Pawlowski's "Harvest in Poland"; Piechowski's "Christ on the Cross"; Popiel's "After the Storm"; Styka's "Queen of Poland"; and Zmurko's "Lady in Furs" and "Evening Song".</p>
   <p>Mr. Niedzwiedzinski would dispose of $15,000 of the money collected in the following manner:</p>
   <p>(1) $2,000 for the Kosciusko Monument Fund; (2) $10,000 for the foundation of a Polish trade school in Chicago; (3) $2,000 for the foundation of a newspaper to champion the Polish cause, written in the English language; and (4) $1,000 for the support of the Polish Immigrants' House.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The rest of the money would be spent as follows: For purchasing the paintings, $58,148; for customs duties, $58,722; for 120,000 photographic reproductions, $18,000; for commission to the agents handling the sale of tickets and for incidental expenses, $18,000.</p>
   <p>Mr. Niedzwiedzinski proposes that all arrangements for the lottery be made by a committee of local citizens in conjunction with the artists' representatives. For this committee, he suggests the Reverends C. Sztuczko, V. Barzynski, and J. Radziejewski; also W. Bardonski, E. Z. Brodowski, K. Butkiewicz, Count Chlapowski (New York), Judge [M. A.] LaBuy, F. S. Satalecki (Detroit), S. Slominski, Dr. C. Midowicz, F. Smietanka, J. F. Smulski, L. Szopinski, and others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Niedzwiedzinski counts not only upon Poles to buy the tickets, but upon Americans also. He bases the possibility of the project's success upon the fact that it will serve a public purpose. He said that the representatives of the Polish artists had already been approached by New York agents with a proposition of this sort.</p>
   <p>Here we have given Mr. Niedzwiedski's project, just as it was presented to us. Our own comments on this matter we reserve for a later issue.</p>
