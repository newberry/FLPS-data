   <p>On last Sunday, January 22, the alumni of St. Mary of the Angels' School, celebrating the fifth anniversary of its foundation, presented a play in the parish hall. The organizing committee was disappointed because the hall was not filled to overflowing with spectators. This can be ascribed to the extremely cold weather that gripped our city last Sunday.</p>
   <p>The play began at the appointed hour, without any delay. The alumni presented a musical comedy, "Like Master, Like Man," based on American life. [Translator's note: Here follows a list of the names of the amateur actors, nine men and six women, with the roles which they played.]</p>
   <p>All the actors played their parts splendidly. It was evident that there is much good dramatic material in this group, from which some splendid actors may be developed. The singing was faultless; in short, the whole performance pleased the audience immensely.</p>
   
   <p>The alumni association of St. Mary's parish should give such theatrical presentations more frequently, since they educate the youth in the native [Polish] language and develop their aesthetic feeling and love of art. The stage director was Mr. Anthony Dobrzanski.</p>
