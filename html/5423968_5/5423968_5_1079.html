   <p>The Dramatic club, a branch of the Polish Patriotic Organization, has presented its second theatrical production with undisputed success yesterday at St. Stanislaus Kostki's School hall. The audience regretted very much that S. Zahajkiewicz, one of the leading characters,was too ill to perform.</p>
   <p>The play was of a social-religious nature. The long applause of the audience was ample gratification to the players for their portrayals as the last curtain fell.</p>
