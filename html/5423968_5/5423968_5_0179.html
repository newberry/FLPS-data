   <p>With the greatest pleasure we learn from the auditor of the State of Illinois that he gave a charter to the organization, forming a state bank here in our city, under the name of The Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, which means it shall be an absolutely Polish Bank. The organizers are Mr. John F. Smulski, John F. Przbysz and many other of our eminent Polish business men, whose names at the present we do not announce. The adminstration of this bank will be Polish and naturally quite a number of Poles will hold positions of officials in this bank.</p>
   <p>With great happiness we hail this new Polish enterprise and from the bottom of our hearts we wish it success.</p>
