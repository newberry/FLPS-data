   <p>Anthony Kawalkowski, son of Mr. and Mrs. John Kawalkowski of 5347 Leland Ave., is to be congratulated on being selected as a member of the Chicago Civic Orchestra. This organization is under the drection of Mr. Frederick Stock conductor, and Mr. Eric Delamarter assistant conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Its purpose is to prepare people, who already have mastered an instrument, to qualify as players for the symphony orchestra.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kawalkowski, graduated from Crane High school last June, and since then, has been devoting all of his time to music. He already has several pupils, and we hope that the number will increase so that this promising young musician may devote himself to music exclusively. Mr. Kawalkowski played last Sunday evening, at the reception given in honor of Mr. Alexander Brahocki. Many members of the Polish Arts Club and their friends were present at this reception which was given at the home of the Misses Hyacinth and Agnes Glomski.</p>
   <p>Among others on the program, were Miss Blanche Kula and young Miss Wojciehowski, pupils of Mr. Brahocki.</p>
