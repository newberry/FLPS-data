   <p>The medals and diplomas awarded to Polish exhibitors from America at the Kosciusko Exposition in Lwow, Poland, have arrived at the New York revenue office, according to Mr. Adam Szwajkart.</p>
   <p>Mr. Szwajkart was notified that the medals were being held up by the revenue department until the duty on then is paid or until an official statement is made that these articles are not imported for sale, but that they are strictly honorary medals.</p>
   <p>In conformance with this demand, Mr. Szwajkart has made an official deposition at the Chicago custom house, and we hope that the medals and diplomas will arrive in Chicago in a few days.</p>
