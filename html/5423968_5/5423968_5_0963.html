   <p>A historical drama, "Krysztof Zegocki" (Christopher Zegocki), (Christopher Zegocki), an original play by Anthony Jax, a talented writer, musician, and artist, was presented yesterday at the Polish Hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. It would be impossible to give a complete review of this play. Suffice it to say that "Krysztof Zegocki" has the qualities that make it enjoyable to people of all classes.</p>
   <p>The costumes, the players, and the acting brought out the best effects of the play. The play on the whole was well produced.</p>
   <p>The St. Hyacinth Theatrical Club, of St. Hyacinth Parish, demonstrated that it has taken dramatics seriously. A. Kochnski, P. Myks, Joseph Jaks, Mrs. T. Wachholtz, Miss A. Prenowska, and Mr. Jaszkowski were outstanding among the players. When the curtain fell on the last act, hearty applause filled the auditorium.</p>
   <p>Credit also must be given for the fine singing in the second and third acts.</p>
   <p>A capacity crowd attended.</p>
