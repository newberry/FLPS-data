   <p>We wish to notify the Polish singing societies arranging the concert for the benefit of the Kosciusko Monument Fund that the Zorza Singing and Dramatic Society of Bridgeport decided, at its semiannual meeting held on August 5, that it will take an active part in this concert.</p>
   <p>A committee of two has been selected to confer with the committees of the other societies. The delegates are Casimir Lisowski and Ladislaus Rogalinski.</p>
   <p>The concert is arousing the greatest interest among our members.</p>
   <p>Brother singers! Let us all work together so that this combined concert will be a success and so that we may add our share to the fund. It is our duty, as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Poles, to see that the Thaddeus Kosciusko monument is built in Chicago as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Constantine Wrzesinski,</p>
   <p>Recording secretary of the Zorza</p>
   <p>Society,</p>
