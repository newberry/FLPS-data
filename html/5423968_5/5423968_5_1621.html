   <p>After the Committee had been completed, the plan of action, as accepted by the temporary committee and published in Dziennik Chicagoski, was read. It was discussed in detail and accepted after a few minor amendments.</p>
   <p>On a motion by Count Henry Lubienski, it was decided that the Executive Committee communicate with the Exposition authorities and the official World's Fair Reception Committee to arrange for their co-operation with, and to assure proper privileges for the Polish guides on the Fair grounds. Further, Count Lubienski informed the meeting that in spite of all rumors to the contrary, there would be a Polish fine arts display at the Exposition. A group of Polish artists, aided financially by the Warsaw lawyer, Julian Rodys, have already shipped a number of paintings to the World's Fair. This shipment of <span class="page-break">\3</span>paintings is due to arrive any day. Messrs. Brochocki, Sosnowski, and Kiedzwiedzinski are en route to Chicago to represent the Polish artists, Count Lubienski said. At first it was planned that these works of art be exhibited in a private gallery, but at the eleventh hour the efforts of Count Lubienski and the respect for the Poles by Mr. Ives, director of Fine Arts at the Fair, have secured for them a place in the World's Fair galleries. Mr. Ives has officially reserved Hall number 62 in the west wing of the Palace of Fine Arts, between Belgium and Austria, for the Polish paintings. This important and gratifying news was jubilantly received by the members of the Reception Committee, who agreed to support the enterprise. It was decided that a special committee would be appointed for this purpose.</p>
   <p>The next business of the meeting was to elect officers and to appoint an executive committee. Mr. Peter Kiolbassa was elected president. For vice-presidents, the five priests who had agreed to co-operate were elected. They are Fathers V. Barzynski, J. Barzynski, A. Nowicki, S. Nawrocki, and J. Lange. Besides these, Count Lubienski, T. Wikaryasz, Emil Wiedeman.</p>
