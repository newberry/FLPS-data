   <p>At the last meeting of the officers of the corporation organized for the purpose of exploiting a gold mine in California, the directors decided to commence operations at once.</p>
   <p>The engineer, Mr. Maryanski, was authorized to go to the mine with laborers and at once begin digging a tunnel which will be necessary for a water supply.</p>
   <p>As soon as this is completed the directors will begin the erection of stamp mills. The machines will be brought from San Francisco. One of the largest firms in that city agrees to erect fifty stamp mills under very favorable terms for us. Another firm made an offer to place electric <span class="page-break">\2</span>wires directly to the mine and advises the use of electric current for operating the machines. Our company could save a good deal this way, because it would not be necessary to haul fuel and erect expensive boilers, and we could have electric light if day and night work were desired.</p>
   <p>Finally, we have information that an agent of some English syndicate made an offer to our treasurer, Judge [M. A.] LaBuy to buy this mine, but the directors will not listen to a proposal of this sort. They feel that if the English can benefit why shouldn't the Poles profit by it?</p>
   <p>The directors did not sell a single share to outsiders, so that the possibility that other people can take over our business later on is definitely excluded. There are only a few unsold shares that can be purchased in smaller or larger amounts from Judge M. A. LaBuy, 581 Milwaukee Avenue, or from the secretary, Mr. J. F. Smulski, 561 Noble Street.</p>
