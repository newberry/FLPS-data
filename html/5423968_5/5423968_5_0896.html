   <p>Yesterday evening the well-known J. K. Ordon Society, group eighteen of the Polish Singers' Alliance, gave a three-act drama entitled "November Night," by B. Gorczynski, at the Polish Women's Alliance hall. The play, which is very engrossing from beginning to end, is based on the life of the servants in a manor in the Kingdom [district in Poland] near Warsaw. The main plot of the play centers about the life of a pretty young woman whose husband was called to do military service, and who is subjected to the amorous attentions of the overseer, the farmhands, and finally of the estate owner himself. As a result of the persistence of Piwnicki, the overseer, the young woman goes to the manor in order to ask the owner himself for protection, and not to be deprived, as the wife of a soldier, of her home in the servants' quarters of the manor. The lord of the manor, entranced by her beauty, promises to look after her and be her guardian, but finally takes advantage of the situation. Before the husband returns from the war, the woman gives birth to a daughter. When he returns and discovers the truth, the unfortunate <span class="page-break">\2</span>husband pretends to accept his lot but at every glance at the child that is not his, his soul is torn by dispair. Finally, during the child's christening, the betrayed husband tries to drown his sorrow in drink. Nevertheless, overhearing the jokes of his neighbors on the subject of the disgrace which has come upon his house, in a moment of madness he snatches the child and leaves it on a hill, where the child falls and is killed. Jagna's drunken and desperate husband does not deny his act and gives himself up to justice. As one can see from the plot of the play, the main characters of the play are Maronski, lord of the manor, which part Mr. W. Klimaszewski played well, except that in some scenes he was not energetic enough. Mr. M. Baginski was excellent in the role of the overseer Piwnicki. Mrs. M. Ziernicki played the part of Jagna Sworzen very well. The last of the main characters and the most difficult, that of Sworzen, the betrayed husband, was well acted by Mr. K. Klimczewski, although in the third act he allowed himself to be carried away by his role and overacted his part and his dispair. The secondary roles were played for the most part very well, with the exception of the mass scenes, in which long and unnecessary pauses were noticed.</p>

   <p>In a word, the play as a whole, as an amateur performance, was surprisingly well done. It should be mentioned however, that some of the amateurs in spite of knowing their lines well, could not get out of the habit of looking straight at the prompter's box--which looked very bad from across the footlights.</p>
   <p>The audience was not as large as it should have been, and there were many vacant seats. After the performance there was social dancing, to Mr. A. Holland's orchestra, which lasted far into the night.</p>
