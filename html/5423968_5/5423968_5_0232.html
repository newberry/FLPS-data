   <p>The Polish Pulaski Mutual Fire Insurance Company in Chicago has advanced another step.</p>
   <p>Formerly every person insured therein was obliged to sign a premium vote for the purpose of guaranteeing against loss.</p>
   <p>At present this is no longer necessary, and if you are insured in the Pulaski Company, you need not give any vote.</p>
   <p>This is a very important matter, and all businessmen should take notice of it.</p>
   <p>This company has received the same rights and privileges which are enjoyed by all the greatest insurance companies.</p>

   <p>We sincerely congratulate the officers of the Pulaski Mutual Fire Insurance Company on the success which has crowned their efforts, and we heartily urge all Poles to insure in this Polish Company. We should support our own!</p>
