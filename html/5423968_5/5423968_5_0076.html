   <p>The temporary board of directors of the Polish-American Businessmen's Association called a general meeting of the Polish merchants and industrialists on November 13, for the purpose of submitting a general outline of the constitution and of electing members to the board and to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alexander Busch, president of the temporary board, was chairman of the meeting.</p>
   <p>The secretary asserted that 126 firms were represented. Besides these, a number of firms had applied for membership by letter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Mierzynski, author and publisher of many publications in the field of commerce and industry, was called upon to explain the problems confronting the Association. In an excellent speech he made the following valuable remarks:</p>
   <p>"A merchant is interested in profit. Every one of us is in business in order to make a profit. Every one of us will be glad to join the Polish-American Businessmen's Association if he sees that by joining this organization he will be able to increase his profit and develop his business.</p>
   <p>"It would be a sad thing, however, if we formed an organization, merely for the purpose of getting a larger profit from the general public. If the aim of our organization were to fill the pockets of the Polish merchants and industrialists at the expense of our customers, we not only would fail to gain the support of the public but would deserve condemnation and contempt.</p>
   <p>"We are forming an organization not merely to improve our own living conditions but also to serve the Polish people by supplying them with better merchandise at lower prices.</p>
   <p>"Let us then remember that the Polish-American Businessmen's Association has two important purposes:</p>
   
   <p>(1) to foster the improvement of the living conditions of its members and (2) to serve the public by supplying it with better merchandise at lower prices.</p>
   <p>"A businessman's success depends largely on three things: namely, (1) purchasing of good merchandise on convenient terms; (2) selling this merchandise as quickly as possible at a good profit; and (3) collecting the money due for the sold merchandise."</p>
   <p>The speaker illustrated the great service which the Association could render our merchants and industrialists and all of our Polish people in all three of these directions.</p>
   <p>He went on to explain the advantage of a joint trade-mark--the guarantee of the organization--the great advantage of joint advertising in the press, and the great benefit to be derived from trading stamps, the system of premiums for the customers, and participation in joint profit.</p>
   
   <p>Those assembled listened with great interest to Mr. Mierzynski' arguments.</p>
   <p>Next Mr. J. Orlowski presented the outline of the constitution as worked out by the temporary board of directors.</p>
   <p>According to the constitution, members are divided into sponsors, who lend their support to the aims of the organization; charter members, active members, consisting of merchants and industrialists exclusively; and participating members, recruited from the publrc in general for the purpose of supporting Polish commerce and industry in specific neighborhoods under the direction of specially organized inspectors.</p>
   <p>According to the articles of the constitution, the purpose of the organization is to develop Polish commerce, industry, and trade, and thus to improve the living conditions and economic strength of our people.</p>
   <p>The organization will try to reach its aim by carrying on the following activities:</p>
   
   <p>(a) It will propagate civic spirit among the Polish merchants and industrialists of all categories in this country and foster a spirit of solidarity and mutual co-operation among them.</p>
   <p>(b) It will make a study of business, and of the newest and most practical business methods, in order to satisfy the customers completely and gain their confidence, as well as to enable the individual businessman to reap greater profits.</p>
   <p>(c) It will systematically invest in and develop those branches of commerce and industry for which there is an actual need and will conduct them in accordance with the methods of foreign competitors.</p>
   <p>(d) It will supply working investment, and purchasing capital and will stimulate sales by providing appropriate advertising and widening the selling territory.</p>
   <p>(e) It will help specific trade groups purchase raw materials, merchandise, and manufactured products, of good quality at the lowest price and on the best possible terms.</p>
   
   <p>(f) It will erect and equip stores and shops--both main centers and retail branches-- and will take advantage of all opportunities to bring benefit to our commerce and industry.</p>
   <p>(g) It will unite all of our firms and all Polish people in general in one solid group, so that they will use trading stamps and purchase exclusively from the firms belonging to this group and the profit from the stamps will be turned over to the development of commerce and industry.</p>
   <p>(h) In order to give business a higher social standing, it will gather our best people and finest families about a group of our reliable merchants and industrialists and will create a general liking for business and respect for workers and their families in particular.</p>
   <p>(i) Finally, by giving professional training to the young people, it will enlist this gallant group, who are full of enthusiasm and realize the importance of this field of action, in the battle for the economic welfare of our people.</p>
   
   <p>All the methods mentioned here for the development of our commerce and industry should be put into operation by the board of directors and a general meeting of the organization, in accordance with the precepts of caution and economic reason. They should be put into effect one by one in accordance with the tempo of the development of solidarity among the merchants and national solidarity among all our people and in accordance with the development of the Association's means.</p>
   <p>As to the organization itself, the constitution decrees that the problems of the Association are to be undertaken by one of four main departments. These are: (a) the credit department: (b) the department of advertising, professional enlightenment, and information or expert counsel; (c) the department of social and club life, which endeavors to foster professional solidarity; and (d) the department of the most important special problems, such as joint purchasing, establishing and equipping bazaars, clubs, stores, etc., which are important to the development of commerce and industry.</p>
   <p>The number of inspectors to be appointed should be regulated by the actual need for them. Their job will be to build unity, carry out specific tasks,and to work for the staunch co-operation of our merchants and industrialists and the general public.</p>
   
   <p>The entire board of directors, together with the sponsor, honorary members, and the inspectors, is to constitute the Polish Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Chicago and is to deliberate over general matters concerning the development of commerce and industry and the development of specific branches of trade. It should foster the spirit of enterprise and support unusually capable and hardworking people, as well as specialists in the department of commerce and industry. It should recommend its decisions to the specific departments of the Association. It should extend its care over the patriotic work of our Polish organizations, our press, and our people in general.</p>
   <p>The executive authority of the Association is to rest in the main board of directors, consisting of the president, two vice-presidents, a general secretary, a treasurer, and twelve directors. From the number of directors elected at a general meeting the board of directors is to appoint three to each of the special departments. These three directors will themselves settle their departmental problems but will be under the control of the board of directors as a whole.</p>
   
   <p>These are the most important articles of the constitution which the assembled merchants and industrialists adopted in principle after long deliberations. They reserved the right to have a more specific description of the field of action of the departments embodied in a separate article. In discussing the relation of the Association to its work, the necessity of eradicating all politics and personal matters from discussions and deliberations was asserted. Dealing with the important problems of the organization and arriving at a successful solution demand the careful employment of all energy.</p>
   <p>The following members were elected officers of the Association: President, Mr. Alexander Busch; Vice- presidents, Karol Olszowy and A. Czechowicz; Treasurer, Mr. W. Graczykowski; General Secretary, J. Otlowski; and Directors, County Commissioner Albert Nowak; Mr. Adam Majewski, Commissioner of the Polish National Alliance; Mr. Joseph Mierzynski; Mrs. L Bradel, representative of the Polish Women's Alliance and owner of a flag-making establishment; Mr. Waclaw Perlowski, president of the largest Polish furniture store, the Union Liberty Furniture Co; Mr. Alfonso Dziadul, dealer in surgical appliances; Mr. Bernard L. Maciejewski, secretary of the three largest building and loan associations; Mr. W. Sajewski, dealer in gramaphones and musical instruments; Mr. J. Jaglowski, fashion designer; Mr. A. T. Hibner, of the Polonia Clothing Company; Mr. K. Struzynski, of Struzynski Brothers (honey and medicinal wines firm); Mr. Ulanowski, of the Progress, the largest men's clothing store.</p>
   <p>Further, it was resolved that this board of directors has the authority to appoint district inspectors and advisers. The general secretary was appointed organizer with a salary of one dollar a member.</p>
   <p>Finally the people assembled gave a rising vote of thanks to Commissioner Albert [Nowak] Nowakowski and Mr. K. Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Women's Alliance, and all three organs of the local press, for their support of this important cause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Orlowski, secretary general, asserted that he would serve at his post to the best of his ability and would work exclusively for the good of the cause. He expressed the hope that through conscientious work and loyal fulfillment of his duties he would be able to eradicate all prejudices and unite even the most unenthusiastic people.</p>
