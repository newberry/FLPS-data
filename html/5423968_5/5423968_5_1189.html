   <p>The Allied Bazaar will be held at the Chicago Coliseum from January 10 to January 25, 1917, inclusive. It will include a Polish section. The Poles residing in Detroit have shown that it is possible to collect a considerable sum of money on such occasions. This should serve as an incentive to us Chicago Poles, and we should therefore not permit this opportunity to escape us. We therefore appeal to all Polish businessmen who have stores or wholesale houses for any kind of contribution, either cash or merchandise, and we wish that those who have contacts with such firms would appeal to them also. [Such contributions] will advertise the firms and help our countrymen.</p>
   <p>We believe that this appeal will bring results, for we have confidence in the generosity of the Polish people. We must collect as much money as we possibly can in order to bring relief to the Poles who are dying in our <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>native country because of the war there.</p>
