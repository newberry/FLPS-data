   <p>It is a well-known fact that an expert cast is necessary in order to stage such a play as "Dwa Sieroty" (Two Orphans). With the lack of any great amount of local talent one can easily appreciate the difficulties that must be hurdled in such an endeavor.</p>
   <p>The St. Cecilia Men's Choir, of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, under the guidance of the skillful local dramatist and creator of the play, Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, performed their parts very creditably.</p>
   <p>"Dwa Sieroty" was staged by this group yesterday (Sunday) at the Polish Hall before a capacity crowd. Vincent J. Jozwiakowski displayed the art of a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>polished actor in his leading role. Mrs. Rose Tarkowska and Mrs. A. Jozwiakowska portrayed their leading feminine roles masterfully. Other players were: Mrs. R. Gorzynska, Miss A. Koppa, John Nering, A. Drzonek, and J. Czekala.</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that the performance was a success, and the enthusiastic applause of the audience was sufficient reward for the actors.</p>
   <p>The musical portions of the play were under the direction of Andrew Kwasigroch. The music was furnished by the Nowicki Brothers Orchestra.</p>
