   <p>It is an established fact that even in difficult times the December holiday purchases of furniture, supplies, clothing, house furnishings, underwear, accessories, and food, amount to at least ten dollars a person in every Polish family in Chicago. If there are families which do not spend this much, there are others which spend a great deal more. Since there are 400,000 Poles in Chicago, our purchases in general during this month amount to four million dollars.</p>
   <p>The Polish-American Businessmens' Association of Chicago wishes to call the attention of all the Poles in Chicago to the fact that if these four million dollars are spent at Polish stores the economic welfare of the Polish people will improve at once, and the factories and wholesale houses seeing an increased demand on the part of Polish firms will be forced to give us better terms and to hire Polish employees.</p>

   <p>All the Polish firms which have joined our association and have the association's seal in their windows have obtained good merchandise at a reasonable price and can render best service to our countrymen.</p>
   <p>If these four million dollars are spent in Polish stores, we shall be able during the coming season to make joint purchases on a large scale and shall thus be able greatly to reduce our prices, at the same time that we assure our customers of first-class merchandise of select quality.</p>
   <p>Through joint purchases we shall create a real operating basis for the few Polish factories and enterprises now in existence and shall open a great field of work for our people who are so mercilessly exploited by other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Polish workmen have always been paid highest and treated best by honest Polish firms, and only such will be accepted into our Association.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>It is to the Poles' most vital interest that the December holiday purchases be made at Polish stores belonging to the Association, because they will not only foster the development of our commerce and industry, but at the same time will see to it that Polish people will be properly served and provided with the best merchandise at the lowest prices.</p>
   <p>Let the four million dollars of Polish money go to Polish business. Let it increase Polish wealth. Let joy and gladness come into all our homes on this great family holiday--the holiday of the Nativity--through the knowledge that during these hard times we have wisely protected our welfare to the best of our united efforts.</p>
   <p>Polish men and women, let every penny's worth of purchases be made at the Polish stores which have created our Association. Our seal placed at the head of this article will show everyone the way.</p>
   <p>Our general secretary Dr. J. K. Orlowski, 1747 West Division Street, Chicago, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Illinois, will accept the applications of new firms that want to join our Association.</p>
   <p>The next general meeting will be held on Sunday December 13, at 2 P.M. Seals, buttons, and membership cards, will be distributed at this meeting.</p>
   <p>With fraternal regards,</p>
   <p>Board of Directors of the Polish-American Businessmens Association</p>
   <p>Alexander Busch, President</p>
   <p>K. Olszowy and A. Czechowicz, Vice-presidents</p>
