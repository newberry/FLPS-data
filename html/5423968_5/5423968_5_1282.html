   <p>This evening at 8 o'clock the bazaar for the Polish orphans will open at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall on Bradley Street. All proceeds from the bazaar will be turned over to the Holy Family Orphanage. Starting with tomorrow and through the days to follow, the event will be in full swing.</p>
   <p>An appeal is made to all spirited-minded citizens, organizations, societies, etc. throughout Chicago to support this noble cause.</p>
   <p>"Res Sacra Misera tenet" (It is a Holy task to deal with Misery) is a well-known saying. These words should first of all be applied to children who are homeless, without parents, incapable of self support, and those Polish orphans that have been stranded in this country without means of support. Only an institution of this kind can be of assistance to them.</p>
   <p>Your participation will help to give succor to these unfortunate children.</p>
