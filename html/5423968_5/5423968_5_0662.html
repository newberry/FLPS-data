   <p>The famous Polish choir New Life, under the direction of Mr. B. J. Zalewski, has for the past several weeks worked with redoubled energy to prepare for a concert to be given on the last Saturday of the carnival, that is, on February 13, 1915. The New Life choir gained renown in Chicago and vicinity during the last international contest, held on July 4, 1914, at North Chicago, in which more than twenty choral groups participated. At this exposition the first prize, a silver cup, was given to the New Life choir. Inspired by the appreciation of non-Polish people and by the award, the New Life choir will give a concert of the best type. Its program will consist of creations of the best composers, such as Wagner and Verdi, and many other compositions that have as yet never been sung at Polish performances in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The whole concert program will be given under the auspices of the New Life choir. One of the most beautiful numbers of the concert, a composition from one of Verdi's operas, will be sung by Mme. D. Hryniewiecki, the popular and excellent <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>soprano, with the choir supplying the accompaniment. The solo parts of the program will be rendered by Mr. D. Hryniewiecki and Mr. L. Wyszatycki.</p>
