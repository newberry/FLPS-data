   <p>The Archbishop Cieplak Society is sponsoring an evening of song and recreation next Saturday, January 21, at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall, Milwaukee Ave. and Augusta street. The arrangement committee especially invites the young men and young ladies of Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>There will be contests of dance and popularity and many prizes await the winners. There are many surprises in store for the young people. Headlining the evening's program is Mme Irene Pawlowski, star of the Chicago Civic Opera Company. Should the program at the Auditorium permit Mme Pawlowski to appear, those that attend the Cieplak reception will be treated to her splendid singing.</p>
   <p>Those of us who have heard this Polish songstress on the grand opera stage are awaiting next Saturday night with anticipation and hopes that she will be able to appear on a Polish stage.</p>
