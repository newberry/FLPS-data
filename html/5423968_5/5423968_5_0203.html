   <p>The French Consul put Brother Casimir Zeglen's bullet-proof vest under a personal test yesterday and was dumfounded by the results. He used his own revolver, which was loaded with cartridges using dynamite. Ten shots were fired at the vest, and in each instance the bullets ricocheted, leaving the vest intact. The Consul asked Brother Zeglen for newspaper clippings relative to the various tests held on this invention and promised to submit a favorable report to his government.</p>
   <p>In the meantime Brother Zeglen is to leave for New York City at the request of an official of the Japanese government. On September 15 tests are to be held in the presence of the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, members of the New York State Militia, the Chief of Police, and ambassadors from other countries.</p>

   <p>Brother Zeglen also received an invitation by letter from London and Berlin to come to these cities and demonstrate the value of his invention.</p>
   <p>After his return from New York, Brother Zeglen will go to England, and whether or not he will go to Berlin from there is not definitely known.</p>
