   <p>Polish Day at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago will be inscribed in the history of the Poles of America in gilded letters. It was truly a magnificent spectacle, the like of which the Poles in America had never seen before. Even the Poles in Europe have not seen anything like it for many, many years. Exiled as we have been to another hemisphere by fate, we have shown that we have lost none of our nationalism or patriotism. We have proved that we exist on this side of the world, and that we are always ready to sacrifice ourselves for Poland. We have shown that here, in this most virile country in the world, we have been able to make a place for ourselves; we have established ourselves on a firm foundation, without having lost any of our national characteristics. Our parade through the streets of Chicago amazed the hundreds of thousands of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>people who witnessed it.</p>
   <p>The celebration at Festival Hall was magnificent; it was imbued with the traditions that united Kosciusko and Pulaski under the same banner with George Washington. On the one hand, our Day reminded America and the world of Poland and its bondage; on the other, it placed us in the proper light before the Americans, showing our strength and the high level of civilization we have attained. There is no Pole whose pulse did not quicken at the sight of so many thousands of people united by a common purpose, so many banners, amidst which the starry blue of the American flag served as a background for Polish white eagles, or at the words reminding us of our misfortunes, our heroisms, predicting a much happier future. The seventh of October was truly a day of triumph and joy for us!</p>
   <p>But we hasten to describe the events of the day, which will long be remembered by American Polonia.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Huge Colorful Parade</p>
   <p>The first part of the Polish Day program consisted of a huge parade through the city streets. Participants were fearful of the weather during the latter portion of the week. On the Saturday before, the Irish had celebrated their day, which had been utterly ruined by a downpour of rain. On the succeeding day and until Friday, the weather had been unsettled; then on Friday, it rained heavily all day. How many Polish hearts trembled with fear and uncertainty! Undoubtedly, Polish Day would have been held even under pouring rain, but how? The floats, which were the most magnificent spectacle of the parade, would not have been able to appear; instead of thousands of people barely a few hundred would have participated. The whole manifestation, which had been so carefully prepared, would have been well-nigh ruined. But as night fell on Friday, the skies began to clear, and the Poles were a bit heartened. Saturday morning dawned bright and clear, without a cloud in the sky. It was a beautiful day--Polish Day had to be a success.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The Poles of the Northwest Side gathered on Noble Street, in front of St. Stanislaus Kostka and Holy Trinity churches. In addition to the societies of these two parishes, the societies from St. Hedwig's and St. Josephat's also met here. It was a pleasure to see national and church societies marching side by side, hatreds and rivalries forgotten, a tear of emotion in each eye, joy and brotherhood in each heart.</p>
   <p>The communities from the south of Chicago gathered in St. Adalbert's parish. Two triumphal arches had been erected there, one in front of St. Adalbert's church and the other in front of Pulaski Hall. The colorfully uniformed members of societies from Bridgeport, Town of Lake, South Chicago, and St. Casimir's parish met there.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to add that all Polish neighborhoods were decorated with flags and flowers for Polish Day. Town of Lake also had its triumphal arches.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Finally, at about eight o'clock in the morning, two huge columns moved out toward Wood Street and Jackson Boulevard, (near Union Park), where they joined together under the leadership of Peter Kiolbassa, grand marshal of the parade. The parade then moved east down Jackson Boulevard, watched by throngs of spectators.</p>
   <p>The parade was headed by the Polish policemen of Chicago, who presented an inspiring sight. Then followed Peter Kiolbassa and the marshal of the first division, J. Napieralski. Mayor Carter Harrison rode alone in a carriage, followed by the carriages of the alderman and the Polish Day Central Committee. Then came the military and civil societies of St. Adalbert's parish. The sun, glistening on bright helmets and sabers, heightened the color of the red Krakus uniforms. Three enormous and costly floats from St. Adalbert's parish aroused wonder and admiration. One of the societies from the same parish carried large American flags, the corners of which were held by members. The girls dressed in Cracovian costumes, followed by the float "Poland in Flower," were generously <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>applauded by the spectators.</p>
   <p>The societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish followed under the leadership of Joseph Paszkiewicz. The first of these was a troop of horsemen, numbering more than a hundred, who aroused the intense admiration of the watching throngs. The spirited horses, the uniforms of the men with their sashes of Polish national colors, presented a truly splendid sight. The float, "Slaughter of the Unites," followed the horsemen; then came the Cadets, the Falcons, and carriages with priests and prominent individuals. The figure of "America" was embodied in a float representing Poles on American soil. The float was followed by military societies, who in turn were followed by countless members of civil societies, both with and without Konfederatki [four-cornered caps], then more floats, more military societies, and finally, carriages. Everything was beautifully decorated with Polish and American flags and floral pieces.</p>
   <p>The second great division was led by A. Lisztewnik, who was surrounded by his numerous staff. Next in order was the well-trained Kosciusko Guard, of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>Milwaukee, followed by the Polish National Alliance Central Administration's beautiful float," Third of May". Then came the Central Administration itself, military societies, civil societies whose members wore Konfederatki, and then the floats and societies from Holy Trinity and the South Chicago parishes. Great applause greeted the float furnished by Mr. Meclewski, "Poland in Chains," and the St. Michael Archangel parish float, "Defense of Czestochowa". The members of military societies of both South Chicago parishes distinguished themselves by the splendor of their uniforms. The children's Cadet and "Kosynier" [originally soldiers of Kosciusko's army, armed with scythes] societies, led by L. Machnikowski, evoked great applause from the spectators. The ladies of the Star of Victory Society followed in carriages.</p>
   <p>Town of Lake was prominent in the third great division, which was led by Z. Schmidt. "Wanda" [Polish legendary figure] on horseback and a resplendent troop of mounted Uhlans followed behind the marshal and his staff. The young ladies of Town of Lake, dressed in colorful national costumes, presented a very pretty picture. Farther back, were the St. Hedwig parish float, "Christening of Lithuania," and the societies from Bridgeport and St. Josephat parish, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>with two large floats. The "Cracovian Wedding," and especially the float preceding it, representing a comical Jewish band, caused much merriment. A troop of mounted Uhlans from Bridgeport followed. Societies from St. Casimir's parish and their float, "Resurrection of Poland," brought up the rear of the procession.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of decorated carriages were interspersed throughout the parade. Words cannot describe the color and splendor of the picture. Out-of-town military societies from Michigan City, Indiana, and La Salle, Illinois, participated, while delegates from Buffalo, Cleveland, Red Jacket, etc., were also present. Innumerable flags waved, the jingle of the harnesses of the horses filled the air. Many women were dressed in national costumes or in white.</p>
   <p>The parade, which lasted until about one o'clock, presented the most magnificent spectacle at Michigan Avenue and Twelfth Street, where, in countermarching to turn north, the floats drew up side by side. Mayor Harrison viewed the parade from his carriage on Michigan Avenue. He said that he had never expected the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Poles to produce so magnificent a demonstration. In his opinion, Polish Day was infinitely more impressive than German or Bohemian Day, to say nothing of the Irish.</p>
   <p>All told, there were sixteen floats in the parade. We list them as follows:</p>
   <p>1. "Washington, Kosciusko, and Pulaski" (furnished by St. Adalbert's parish). Figures of the three men stood in the center of the float upon a platform; behind them was the Goddess of Freedom. In front stood a cannon, beside which were four soldiers. At the very front of the float, were two feminine figures, representing "Peace" and "Triumph".</p>
   <p>2. "John Sobieski after the Victory at Vienna" (St. Adalbert's parish). King John, surrounded by a group of knights, stood upon a platform, several Turks kneeling before him. In the center of the float was a cross, before which stood a figure in white, symbolic of Christianity, which our hero defended.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>3. "Poland in Flower" (young women of St. Adalbert's parish). This was the largest float of all. At the very top, toward the end, sat a regal figure representing Poland. Beside her and on descending levels, were a score or more figures, representing the various provinces and districts in Poland, each bearing the appropriate arms. The float was very effective.</p>
   <p>4. "Slaughter of the Unites" (St. Stanislaus Kostka parish). This float showed a little chapel toward which retreated an old man, a woman with a baby, and a number of children and older people. A wounded man lay on the steps of the chapel, a nun bending over him. In the center of the float stood a cross, at the foot of which knelt an allegorical figure representing "Martyrdom". On the opposite side stood Russian soldiers, their rifles aimed at the unfortunate martyrs to their faith.</p>
   <p>5. "Poles on American Soil" (St. Stanislaus Kostka parish). On a high platform in the center of the float, stood a figure with an eagle, representing "America". On one side of it were figures representing Poles arriving in <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>America, on the other, a miner and a blacksmith. In the rear stood a group representing Polish-American citizens, among which were two figures in army uniform. This float was generally admitted to have had the greatest effect.</p>
   <p>6. "Copernicus, or The Polish Parnassus" (St. Stanislaus Kostka parish). A figure representing Copernicus seated under a canopy. Beside him was Kochanowski [father of Polish literature]; above him was Cardinal Hozyusz, a figure placing a wreath upon his head. In the center stood a globe covered with stars. In front were figures representing Mickiewicz [poetry], Chopin, with a gilded harp [music], Grottger [painting], and Kraszewski [Literature.</p>
   <p>Kraszewski was the foremost Polish historical novelist].</p>
   <p>7. "Siberian Mines" (St. Stanislaus Kostka parish). A very gloomy float.</p>
   <p>In the center was some kind of a hut cut into a cliff. On both sides, prisoners with their heads half shaved, wearing drab prison costumes, worked continually with pickaxes, their chains clanging. Beside them, Russian soldiers stood on guard. At the front was a prisoner who had collapsed from fatigue; a <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>Cossack stood in position to strike him with the butt of his rifle, while a woman, also a prisoner, knelt, begging for mercy. The float was trimmed with pickaxes, knouts, thorns, and chains.</p>
   <p>8. "Constitution of the Third of May" (Polish National Alliance). This float represented Stanislaus Augustus [last king of Poland] under a splendid canopy, presenting the "Third of May Constitution" to Poland. Around him were grouped the representatives of all classes; an archbishop, noblemen, townsfolk, and peasantry. This float was very colorful and expensive. The figures were grouped by the well-known sculptor F. Baracz [winner of the Kosciusko Monument competition].</p>
   <p>9. "Stephen Batory Receiving the Envoys of Ivan the Terrible" (Holy Trinity parish). King Stephen, in armor, stood upon a platform, receiving the Muscovite envoys, who knelt before him humbly; around them stood Polish knights. The platform rested upon two cannons. This float was extraordinarily effective.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>10. "Poland in Chains" (Meclewski and Piatkiewicz). A woman's figure dressed in white and representing Poland, wearing a crown of thorns, was chained to a cross. At her feet stood three young girls, representing Poland proper, Lithuania, and Ruthenia. Off to one side stood a Prussian and an Austrian soldier carrying arms, and a Russian soldier with a knout. A very tragic picture.</p>
   <p>11. "Defense of Czestochowa" (St. Michael Archangel parish). This float presented a large, accurate model of the Czestochowa Monastery, surrounded by figures of the Polish soldiers who defended it.</p>
   <p>12. "Polish Mother Teaching Her Children to Read, with a Sword at Her Side" (Town of Lake). The interior of a Polish home; the children grouped around their mother, who is teaching one of them to read.</p>
   <p>13. "Jadwiga and Jagello, or the Christening of Lithuania" (St. Hedwig's parish). Jadwiga and Jagello represented in beautiful costumes, upon a throne.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>In the center stood a cross, and before it, the newly christened Lithuanians dressed in white. In front, stood an old man, destroying images of pagan gods.</p>
   <p>14. "Cracovian Wedding" (Two floats, Bridgeport). The smaller of the two presented a Jewish orchestra; the other, an elaborate wedding scene, which included more than a score of people in extremely colorful costumes. Grouping by Baracz.</p>
   <p>15. "Labor" (Bridgeport). The decoration of this float was very costly. In the center stood the Goddess of Prosperity, with the horn of plenty in her hand; around her, peasants at work. In front sat girls making laurel wreaths. It was a very effective picture. Grouping also by Baracz.</p>
   <p>16. "Resurrection of Poland" (St. Casimir's parish). This float was modeled after the painting by Elias. The scene presented a broken prison gate, from which emerged a beautiful figure representing Poland. In the foreground lay the figures of a number of soldiers [Russian, Austrian, Prussian].</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>The above description can give but a vague idea of the beauty and effectiveness of the floats described. It should be added that most of the floats were photographed during the parade.</p>
   <p>Parade in Jackson Park and Celebration at Festival Hall</p>
   <p>It was 1:30 in the afternoon before the military societies began arriving at Jackson Park. The ranks were re-formed at the Fifty-ninth Street gate by Peter Kiolbassa, who led the parade through the Fair Grounds.</p>
   <p>The parade moved eastward as far as the lake, then it circled the lagoon and the Hall of Commerce and proceeded to the Administration Building, and from there to Festival Hall. At Liberty Bell, the military societies formed a rectangle; at the Terminal Station, they saluted the Polish flag and arms. Previous to the arrival of the parade, Liberty Bell had been struck three times in honor of Kosciusko. The bell rope was pulled by 104-year-old Michael Adamski, <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>of South Chicago, Judge [M. A.] La Buy, and others. The bell was decorated in Polish colors, with an appropriate inscription. Mr. McDowell, president of the Columbian Liberty Bell Committee, delivered a beautiful, though short, address expressing great sympathy for the countrymen of Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>The celebration at Festival Hall was one of the most impressive features of Polish Day. It started somewhat later than had been planned, due to the parade in Jackson Park, and ended after five o'clock.</p>
   <p>After the rendition of the "Third of May" polonaise by the orchestra, S. Slominski, president of the Polish Day Central Committee, formally opened the exercises with a short address. He called upon Judge La Buy to preside, and named F. Jablonski secretary.</p>
   <p>The program, which appeared in a previous issue of Dziennik [Chicagoski], was executed with practically no changes. Only Bishop Spaulding, who was to have delivered an address in English, was unable to attend because of illness.</p>
   <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>
   <p>In addition to a very beautiful musical program, three addresses were delivered, one in Polish by Doctor [C.] Midowicz, and two in English, by Judge La Buy and Mayor Harrison.</p>
   <p>We regret that lack of space prevents us from giving Judge La Buy's speech in its entirety; we submit the most important parts of it below.</p>
   <p>Judge La Buy's Address</p>
   <p>"Nearly every nation in the world is participating in this great industrial, commercial, educational, and artistic exposition. One nation is missing, however, and that nation is Poland. Yet, Poland was once one of Europe's foremost nations, a bulwark, a defender of Christianity. During the time when Jews were being driven from nearly every other country, Poland hospitably admitted them within her boundaries. In her many victories against neighboring kingdoms and empires, she was never greedy for either land or gold.</p>
   <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>
   <p>Poland defended Austria and Germany against the Turks at Vienna, and how have they repaid her?....Sobieski never demanded reward for his services at Vienna. These same nations are responsible today for Poland's absence from this exposition. Poland's rightful place at this exposition has been usurped by three great despotic powers of Europe.</p>
   <p>"After a period of absolute monarchy, which was followed by rule by the aristocracy, a convention or "Sejm" was called in Warsaw in 1778, which proved to be one of the wisest, most discreet, and most sensible bodies that ever deliberated over the rights of man. It was the delegates' intention to prepare a free constitution for Poland. This was just the time when a general movement toward freedom prevailed in all nations. France had shaken off its chains of feudal bondage and unfortunately changed its newly found liberty to a bloody tragedy. Here on the other side of the ocean, George Washington stood at the head of a new and free constitutional government created by his own wisdom and energy. He was aided in this work by our own unequaled patriot, <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>Thaddeus Kosciusko. Amid so many historic events which fired the enthusiasm of patriots, the wisdom, sensibleness, and sober judgment of the Warsaw "Sejm" was well-nigh miraculous. The Polish constitution extended civil rights, established religious freedom, and wisely and justly limited the executive powers of the rulers.</p>
   <p>"In the closing years of the eighteenth century, the Polish banner was unfurled in defense of that country's liberty. It fell and rose again; then it fell once more--but never did it fall with disgrace to the nation. The Polish nation was subdued by despotism, tyrannical laws, and untold oppression. Polish exiles settled in other countries under more liberal governments, as in Switzerland, France, England, and finally, in the United States, where two million Poles sought refuge beneath the proud American flag.</p>
   <p>"We are gathered here to thank God for sending that great man, Christopher Columbus, to discover this continent. We American Poles are gathered here to <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>declare our allegiance to the laws and government of the American nation. It is well that our ancestors, Pulaski and Kosciusko, helped Washington in his fight for freedom, for we now reap the benefits of that great victory. We are proud of the fact that Polish patriots fought in the battles of Bull Run, Wilderness, Shiloh, Lookout Mountain, and Richmond, in defense of the Stars and Stripes. We are here to congratulate ourselves that we live under the American flag. The American constitution is more liberal than the one accepted in Poland in 1791 [Constitution of the Third of May]; we have civil and religious freedom, which was crushed by tyranny and greed in Poland. We have defended the Constitution of the United States in the past, and we will defend it in the future. Liberty is the common heritage of both Americans and Poles."</p>
   <p>Address by Mayor Harrison</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison delivered a brilliant address, which we submit in its entirety, reserving comment:</p>
   <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>
   <p>"Ladies and gentlemen: I was introduced to you as an American, but today I am a Pole. Since the days of my youth, I have admired Poland, and have learned of her tragic history. As a boy, I learned to love Poland. I learned to love Poland for the heroism of Sobieski, who stood as a wall against the Turkish deluge, thus saving Europe from the Crescent, making firmer the foundation of the Cross. I love Poland because it was the motherland of Kosciusko, who fought for the freedom of his own country and was defeated, but who previously had come to these shores to aid in our victorious fight for freedom. (Applause.) I love Poland because of Pulaski, who died in action at Savannah. I love Poland for the victories she has helped us achieve in war--and today I am proud to feel myself a Pole, for I have seen the triumphs that the Poles can achieve in times of peace. (Applause.)</p>
   <p>"Until recently, we had but few Polish citizens, and these were poor people. But they arrived here full of energy, from a land where they had been oppressed. Today, we witnessed....a splendid spectacle.....Nothing of the kind would have been possible in your motherland, in your beloved Warsaw, where the Polish <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>language is barred even from the schools. For a century, Poland has been struggling for liberty; for a century now, no Polish child has dared to sing a hymn of freedom. How long would the Czar remain on his throne, how long would he dare trample upon millions of people if it were otherwise, if the children of that country were permitted to learn and sing Polish national anthems?</p>
   <p>"On seeing the street signs once in Warsaw, lettered in two languages--in Polish and, by order of the authorities, in Russian also--I remember thinking immediately of Chicago, which is second to Warsaw in Polish population. Here you can worship God in your own way, you can think and speak in Polish, and no one will deny you the right to do so. I thought to myself of the Poles in Chicago, where no tyrant's guards watch over them. (Applause.)</p>
   <p>"My friends, this exposition was created for the purpose of teaching, of educating; it is the greatest display of human intellect that the world has ever seen You can see here the architect's visions and the dreams of the poet crystallized, <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>as if by a magic wand, into a reality that words cannot describe, into something which has never before been seen in any country, in any age. It is a wonderous object lesson, which teaches that only the people rule, while governments should be their servants. The Exposition teaches even more. It shows what can be accomplished by a people living in a free country.</p>
   <p>"That freedom, which is so indispensable here, reflects itself in you. This morning Chicago saw thousands of Poles, joyous, intelligent, respectable; your ladies were beautiful and intelligent; your children were such that I would be proud to be the father of any one of them. (Applause.) I saw many girls and young women on the floats. The sight moved my heart....; the whole parade moved through the streets of our city without mishap. (Applause.)</p>
   <p>"What inference can be drawn from this? The fact that our laws, which permitted the Poles to occupy the city streets to demonstrate their existence to the world, were not made to oppress the people. You have come from a land where <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>kings oppress the people in the name of the law, where despots trampled upon you, hanging you, punishing you, all in the name of the law. Here in America, the law is different. Why was your parade permitted to use the streets of Chicago? Because the law here does not molest the people--it protects them. This teaches you that you are the people, you make the laws, you are the rulers. Why should a man resort to violence if the law protects and cares for him? The people make the laws and have the power to change them, for the general welfare.</p>
   <p>"While I stood watching the parade downtown, a man came up to me and asked: 'Why do you, as mayor, permit this sort of thing? Why do you allow the Poles to fill the streets and block traffic, to the inconvenience of other citizens?' I answered: 'How in the name of God and conscience could I refuse the Poles the one most solemn and splendid day they have had in a hundred years?' (Great applause.)</p>
   <a name="p25" class="page-break">25</a>
   <p>"It was a great day for me when I saw you marching down the street, delaying the followers of the golden calf in their daily chase; and you did this without police aid, without violence, by the quiet strength of your own dignity. You were Poles and American citizens, and I am sure you are learning to be good citizens. I was convinced of this in April of this year, when you elected me to office. And so I wanted to help you show the world that the American Poles are good citizens who respect the law, who are honest, industrious, and respectable. (Applause.) If this country were in danger, I am certain that an army of at least twenty thousand Poles, led by my friend, Peter Kiolbassa, would be ready to fight for their adopted motherland. (Great applause.)</p>
   <p>"It is a pleasure to talk to you, but everything must have its end, and so does my speech. In conclusion, I thank you for your attention and the good will with which you have received my words."</p>
   <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>
   <p>Address by Dr. C. Midowicz</p>
   <p>The last address was delivered by Dr. C. Midowicz in Polish as follows:</p>
   <p>"This year the eyes of the whole civilized world are turned upon this 'white city,' this city which houses the great Exposition of the powerful, young United States. Nations enjoying prosperity, having governments of their own, have presented the products of their labor here, staging celebrations and parades in order to attract more attention to their particular exhibits. Thanks to the good will of the city authorities, the flag of our native country, which has no place in Poland, flies here today. We are celebrating, then, a great national holiday--yes, a solemn holiday, for we are gathered here under the eyes of the whole world. We have shown that we exist, in spite of the fact that we have been erased geographically. We will continue to exist as long as a single Polish heart beats and we will settle there where freedom and the rights of man are not denied us.</p>
   <a name="p27" class="page-break">27</a>
   <p>"Although from the very beginning we have been an agricultural nation, it can be said that we bore arms from the very cradle of our existence. We fought there where freedom was endangered, either our own or a neighbor's, or when the freedom of mankind was threatened. Thus it is that a people who had learned to love freedom at the very dawn of history, could not but have gathered here to cry: Hail to thee, O Star-Spangled Banner! Hail to thee, O Free Land of Washington! We pay homage to your accomplishments. We have believed in those ideals which form the foundation of your existence, not merely from today but from the very beginning. When you, noble Land, arose to throw off the tyrant's yoke, our motherland produced heroes who came here to help in your struggle.</p>
   <p>"A century has passed, people have come and gone, but the memory remains. That memory touches our hearts, for lo! a hundred years later, the Liberty Bell peals....in honor of our great leader, in honor of him who always defended liberty, in honor of that great son of Poland, Kosciusko!</p>
   <a name="p28" class="page-break">28</a>
   <p>"We who live in this country, as adopted sons of a voluntarily chosen motherland, wish it the most successful expansion and the greatest glory.</p>
   <p>"Having no political existence, our homeland could not produce an independent exhibit of its products; but Poland was not altogether absent. In a small way, in the field of fine arts, we are here, unveiling the inner depths of Poland's soul, showing the emotions of Poland's children, and how they are able to express them. And in this field, under different conditions, we might have increased our display a hundredfold, for what we have shown is but a small portion, smuggled out of Poland by stealth. One of the conquerors of Poland boasts of a great painting--the work of our countryman Siemiradzki--as one of its outstanding works. Despite its great size and power, it uses the work of an oppressed people as its title to fame. The conquerors of Poland attempted to deny us the right to participate in the art competition, but thanks to the fair-mindedness of the Exposition officials, the attempt was frustrated.....The oppressed were permitted to compete against their conquerors--our existence was admitted, since the products of our work exist.</p>
   <a name="p29" class="page-break">29</a>
   <p>"We are gathered here today as representatives of a nation, to pay homage to the progress of this free United States, to express our joy at the remarkable growth of this country, and to assure the American people that, in common with the whole Polish nation, we the immigrants will always do our utmost for the good of America. As citizens who love freedom, we will strive to maintain the honor of its Starry Banner by quiet, persevering, conscientious work, and a deep respect for the law.</p>
   <p>"During the course of today's celebration, the desire to join the United States with another power was expressed. Permitting myself to use a symbolic comparison, I say that no power on earth can conquer the starry blue heaven.....What, if not the peaceful, cloudless blue, should envelop humanity? This symbol of freedom is very dear to the Polish White Eagle. It is our Eagle's desire that the starry blue of America, the blue of freedom, exist forever, and occupy even greater territory. Our Eagle is ready to shatter any cloud which would dim its brightness.</p>
   <a name="p30" class="page-break">30</a>
   <p>"A century has passed since two nations arose almost simultaneously in the performance of an immortal work: in America, independence was declared, in Poland, the Third of May Constitution was ratified. In honor of the kindred spirit of these two nations, I raise the cry: Long live the United States of America, and long live Poland!"</p>
   <p>The orchestral and vocal portion of the program was artistically successful. The orchestra, conducted by Mr. Czapek, was thunderously applauded for its rendition of the overture from "Halka" [Moniuszko], "Awakening of the Lion," and "Signals of War," by Wronski. The two numbers sung by the St. Stanislaus Kostka Girls' Choir, under the direction of A. J. Kwasigroch, were also heavily applauded. The girls were dressed in white and carried small Polish and American flags, with which they kept time as they sang "Hail Columbia". Their rendition of Polish songs was even better, if possible. The St. Stanislaus Kostka parish choir, under the direction of Mr. Kwasigroch, sang "Polish Heart". The Polish Singers' Alliance and the Wanda Society, conducted by A. Mallek, also <a name="p31" class="page-break">31</a>sang very well.</p>
   <p>Festival Hall was filled to capacity--from eight to ten thousand people attending. The interior of the hall was beautifully decorated with the Polish colors and arms.</p>
