   <p>A capacity crowd filled the Polish hall last night to see the members of the Dramatic club, a branch of the Patriotic Organization, perform the play "Children of Israel," which was their first venture on the stage. This large attendance proved that Poles like amateur shows and that they come to see them regardless of how many other entertainments are going on in the Polish neighborhoods. Even though this show took place the Sunday before Lent and in the midst of political activities, the desire to see a Polish drama was not swayed. The tempting masquerade ball on the South Side, the concert of the Alliance Singers and the many church bazaars failed to draw the audience away.</p>
   <p>This packed-house audience was a direct recognition of the author's talent and the Dramatic Club's ability to present a drama on the amateur stage. The hall was filled early. Many people were turned away before curtain time.</p>

   <p>A majority of the roles were filled by former members who had presented the original play some time ago in Chicago. In yesterday's revised edition, the author did not take part. His role of Jacob was ably filled by Mr. Grabowski.</p>
   <p>Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, the author of "Children of Israel" and other plays, supervised the production, and much of the credit for the success of the play belongs to him. He has proved that he is not only a poet but also a playwright worthy of recognition.</p>
   <p>The audience showed their appreciation with applauses and huzzas when the final curtain fell. For a while it seemed as though the crowd, nearing three thousand persons was not willing to go.</p>
