   <p>Next year a Polish Exposition will be held at Lwow--the Kosciusko Exposition. Our countrymen in Poland have invited us to participate in this Exposition: our brethren across the ocean have extended their hands to us and are awaiting our arrival and our co-operation.</p>
   <p>The numerically strong Polish element in America ought to participate in the Lwow Exposition. Participation in it is a duty which, for patriotic reasons, we should not neglect.</p>
   <p>How can we better demonstrate our love for our motherland than by laying at her feet the fruits of our work in exile, the products of our life outside of her boundaries? We have the opportunity of giving our countrymen proof that this love for our motherland has not died out; we have the opportunity of showing the whole world that we live and work, that we are a strong and virile nation, believing in our future with faith and <span class="page-break">\2</span>hope.</p>
   <p>With its general headquarters in Chicago, a committee organized for the purpose of sending exhibits to the Lwow Exposition has been working energetically and with good results at providing for a proper representation of the Poles living in America. Here is a summary of what the Committee has done thus far.</p>
   <p>It was decided to erect a Polish-American pavilion on the Lwow Exposition grounds. Appeals for co-operation have been sent to all Polish settlements [in America]. We are assured of the help of the Polish clergy, teachers, editors, organizations, and so forth. Today, the Polish-American pavilion at Lwow is almost an accomplished fact.</p>
   <p>We will send our countrymen [in Poland] a picture of our life here in America. Our pavilion will contain photographs of our churches, schools, and factories. There will be sections devoted to journalism, agriculture, <span class="page-break">\3</span>and industry. Our military societies, our church and national societies, will be represented under the Polish and American flags. In a word, we will try to convince our countrymen that we are spiritually and physically strong, that we do not spend slothful lives amid pleasure and luxury, but [that] by dint of hard work, we are endeavoring to make a new place for ourselves so that we may again stand upon an equal plane with other nations.</p>
   <p>In order to make the exhibit in the Polish-American pavilion at Lwow complete, that is, to round it out aesthetically, the Central Committee decided at one of its meetings to create an additional section to the original five--a section devoted to Polish women's handiwork. With this purpose in mind, the Committee addresses this appeal to the Polish women [of America] requesting their co-operation. We do this with the belief that in this patriotic work our countrymen will stand faithfully at our side and, in supplementing the exhibit of Polish industry in the United States, lead us, taking first place as they rightly deserve. Old Polish tradition says <span class="page-break">\4</span>that Polish women have always guarded the honor and virtues of their husbands.</p>
   <p>Polish women of America! Here is a field of activity worthy of your efforts. Show our countrymen in Poland that you are able and willing to contribute your work to the success of our Polish-American exhibit. Please note that, in contributing your work, you are maintaining our national honor and giving proof of your own capabilities and your own national life in America.</p>
   <p>We are concerned here with the creation of a Polish Women's Handiwork Section at the Polish-American pavilion. The beautiful needlework of our countrywomen, collections of children's outfits, and so on, will provide much excellent material for such an exhibit. No special exertion or expensive specimens are necessary. (Each specimen will be returned to its owner.) Whoever can afford it, may prepare something more costly, but as we are concerned chiefly with the handiwork of Polish women, we ask for <span class="page-break">\5</span>anything that may be classified as such; for example, embroidery, lace, serviettes, table cloths, and similar specimens, suitably grouped, will make a very beautiful exhibit of women's work, which would attract the attention and wonder of the women in Poland, thus bringing well-earned fame and pleasure to the Polish women of America.</p>
   <p>In this way you [the Polish women of America] will not only perform a patriotic duty, but you will prove at the same time that the famous thriftiness and capability of Polish womanhood has not been lost, but continues to exist and develop here with equal vigor.</p>
   <p>To work, then, our worthy Polish women!</p>
   <p>Let your reward be the pleasure that comes with the faithful performance of duty and the triumph of the Polish-American exhibit at the Kosciusko Exposition [in Lwow].</p>
   <p>Long live the Women's Handiwork Section! Long live the Polish-American <span class="page-break">\6</span>pavilion!</p>
