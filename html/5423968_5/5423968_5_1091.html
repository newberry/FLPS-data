   <p>The Polish Dramatic Club, under the protection of Saint Cecilia, in Town of Lake, Chicago, staged Father K. F. Slominski's five-act drama, "Innocently Condemned".</p>
   <p>The Columbia Hall, 48th and Paulina Streets, at which the play was held, was so filled that there was not even standing room. Many well-known citizens, even from the West Side, attended the play because they wished to see Father Slominski's play and because they wished to help the new parish. The performance lasted almost three hours. The plot of the play is so interesting that it brings honor to the author. Other dramatic clubs will probably try to stage this play.</p>

   <p>The amateurs played fairly well, but had they memorized their parts, and had their gestures and diction been more natural, the play would have been more impressive.</p>
