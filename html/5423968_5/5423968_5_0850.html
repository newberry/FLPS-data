   <p>Not quite thirty years ago the artistic life of our Polish colony in Chicago began to bud.</p>
   <p>Truly its first and most powerful foundation was the organizing of the Dramatic Circle in St. Stanislaus Parish where S. Zahajkiewicz, who died a few years ago, took active part. These was the beginnings of the reflection of Polish art, popular and historical, from the life of Polish Knighthood. Later there began to sprout up as quickly (as they say) as mushrooms after rain, other dramatic and singing groups. About fifteen years ago we saw the organization of the Polish Peoples Theatre. Appearances of artistic groups, composed of well chosen amateurs met with remarkable success. Elegant and well worked out productions of Polish writers were presented not only in the heart of the Polish sections but there was also presented the work of Adam Mickiewicz "Granzny" in downtown Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Before the Polish Peoples Theatre began to earnestly make appearances the amateurs of the Dramatic Circle in St. Stanislaus Parish had already presented the"Warszawianka" at the Auditorium Theatre for the cause of the flood sufferers in Warsaw. Following that the production "Madejowe Loze" under the direction of S. Zahajkiewicz, was presented in the former Schiller Theatre now the Garrick. The Peoples Theatre with its good beginning did not last lone due to the lack of a good director. After this period, the singing groups began more energetic appearances and Polish song resounded in all the corners of our Polish colonies.</p>
