   <p>The first performance of a new play entitled "Wnuka Piastow Czyli Perla Cyllejska" [Granddaughter Of The Piasts, Or Cyllejski Pearl] by Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz was presented in the school auditorium on Bradley Street by the St. Stanislaus Parish Choir. It is, according to the advertisement, a musical drama in three acts. The plot of the play is as follows:</p>
   <p>Anna Cyllejska, granddaughter of Casimir the Great, lives at the court of her uncle, Count Herman II. She is scorned and mistreated by his three daughters. In order to rid themselves of this girl, who is more beautiful, more accomplished, and of higher birth than themselves, the countesses and their father decide to marry her to the stupid and ugly Count Adolf. But their plans are frustrated. The old minstrel, Jan, devoted to Anna, travels through the land spreading her fame in courts far and wide by singing of the "Cyllejski <span class="page-break">\2</span>Pearl", as he calls her. Because of Jan's song, numerous knights visit the court of Count Herman, desiring to see and meet this "pearl". Among them is masked knight (King Jagiello). While all the other knights search for her in vain amidst the court, Jagiello recognized the "pearl" as Anna, who sits modestly apart. Then follows his profession of love, and the knight receives her scarf. In the last act, as Count Herman attempts to force Anna to marry Adolf, an emissary arrives from Jagiello, demanding from the king's hand, the "Cyllejski Pearl". Presently Jagiello himself arrives, and the poor, unfortunate orphan becomes a queen.</p>
   <p>The resume of the plot shows that the play (and it is indicated by the author himself in the title) is not an historical drama based on actual events. It is merely a dramatic picture with an historical background; a picture in which the author's imagination soars in unhampered flight. In a picture such as this, a critic has no right to expect close adherence to fact; he should be primarily concerned with its artistic qualities, its beauty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In this respect, Mr. Mahajkiewicz's latest play satisfies even the post exacting demands.</p>
   <p>The "Cyllejski Pearl" is indeed a beautiful work, but most of all, it is entirely within the comprehension of our people. Even had it not included such sweet and lively music so aptly chosen from the works of many composers, it would still have left a most favorable impression upon the audience.</p>
   <p>The plot is artfully unfolded and cleverly climaxed in the third act. A succession of colorful characters and yet more colorful group scenes, the masterful use of comic effects, the careful development of dramatic interest, and finally, that elusive poetic quality which appears in many places throughout the play and gives it its air of beauty--on these points does the "Cyllejski Pearl" base its claims to literary merit.</p>
   <p>Yesterday we saw it upon the stage dressed in a clock of music. "Songs", so <span class="page-break">\4</span>modestly mentioned in the advertisement were among the outstanding features of the production. They consisted of choral numbers, solos, duets, etc., raising the play almost to the level of light opera. Naturally, it was not original music; nonetheless, it was very aptly chosen, increased the scenic effect, and evoked thereby a considerable reaction among the audience, although by placing itself in the fore, it may have overshadowed the plot itself.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the "Cyllejski Pearl" is certainly one of the more fortunate additions to the Polish-American repertory. Yesterday's audience greeted it with enthusiasm; certainly it will be greeted thus again in the future. It spoke straight to the hearts of the people; it was understood by them--and thus earned its great success.</p>
   <p>The performance was admirable in every way. The laurel belongs, undoubtedly, to the best amateur Polish actress in Chicago, Mrs. Rose Kwasigroch. Her <span class="page-break">\5</span>lyric and dramatic scenes were equally unassailable. Her performance in its entirety left an effect of artistic perfection. Mrs. Kwasigroch was a real "pearl" in the play, to which the enthusiastic applause bore testimony.</p>
   <p>The remaining feminine roles were satisfactory. Misses W. Chlebowska, A. Nehring and Mrs. A. Oszwaldowska, as Count Herman's daughters, performed and sang very well. The women's chorus proved that Mr. A. Kwasigroch is an excellent teacher of music.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to decide which of the male roles should be awarded first place. Mr. J. Kondziorski was excellent and very realistic as Count Herman; P. W. Jozwiakowski enacted the role of king's emissary excellently. In Mr. Ignatius Kowalski who played the character role of the knight Uciekajlo, a clever comedian was discovered; he repeatedly called forth waves of laughter and storms of applause from the audience. Mr. Wladyslaw Dombek played the part of Jagiello with intensity and feeling. The knights, <span class="page-break">\6</span>Messrs. Stellman, Suwalski, J. Nehring, and F. Kiolbassa were all deserving of the highest praise.</p>
   <p>In general, the production was a great success--and the play has a future before it.</p>
