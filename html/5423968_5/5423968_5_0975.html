   <p>The St. Joseph Society, of St. John Cantius Parish, gave a theatrical performance yesterday in Walsh's Hall, at the corner of Noble and Emma Streets, of the two-act comedy "Oryle" (The Feathers).</p>
   <p>The hall was filled completely, about one thousand persons being present. The amateurs played their parts very well, especially Miss Helen Piatkowska, Mr. Michael Ratajczak, Mr. Jacob Mroczkowski, Mr. John Lama, Mr. Joseph Walinski, and Mr. Stanislaus Pawlowski. A duet was sung beautifully by Miss Frances Mysiak and Miss Julia Grzadzinska.</p>
   <p>The members of the St. Joseph Society are improving all the time. Bravo!</p>
