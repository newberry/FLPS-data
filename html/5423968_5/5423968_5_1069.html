   <p>Without any doubt, a suitable selection of plays is beneficial not only to our youth but to the adults as well. In view of this, the question arises: Why are there so few Polish stage presentations in Chicago, especially in the vicinity of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, where there is a large hall and a large number of Polish people? During the summer no thought is given to this because it is too warm, but during the winter season, with the exception of the time set off for the Fair, stage plays could be presented more often, at least every two weeks. This thought has occupied the minds of many members of Polish societies which have a right to stage plays and derive profits therefrom.</p>
