   <p>It is not the first time that we have had the opportunity of hearing about the trials of presenting a few Polish operas in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Already several years ago, yet even before the war, there was talk in our Polish centers about the necessity of establishing a permanent theatre, or a society, which would present, from time to time, important stage plays as well as Polish operas. This ended as usual with projects for a permanent theater. As to presenting Polish operas or an opera in Polish, this was done twice in Chicago. Through the efforts of Miss Agnes Nering there was staged in 1912 the opera "Stradella" at the Crown Theatre, and next, through the efforts of Prof. B. Rybowiak, the opera "Halka," by Moniuszko, was presented. If we want to be sincere, we must say the presentation of these operas were failures. If in the future we must present "trials"of opera on the stage, then it is better to abandon such work. When it comes to a permanent theatre in Chicago, we cannot even dream about that, even if the Polish organizations would take this project seriously under consideration, then we would have in Chicago a permanent theatre financed by Polish organizations. Alas! the representatives of the Polish emigration do not think as the Germans do and the way they are working for the cultural needs of their fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>The German theatre in Chicago prospered well before the war and is prospering at present. It was closed during the war. All German organizations are obliged to pay a tax for the upkeep of the theatre and every member of the German societies must sell at least ten tickets a year. If something similar was instituted in our organizations, then the Crown Theatre at Division St. would be the property of the Poles. In this theatre there would be staged instructive plays and not nonsense as has been played in secondary Polish theatres.</p>
   <p>The Presentation of Moniuszko's "Halka." An Opera Club has been organized and at present is occupying itself with agitation for members. Every member will have to pay $5, and his name will be written into a memoir book on the occasion of presenting the first opera. The committee is composed of prominent people, but we imagine that demanding $5 will meet with difficulties. It would be better to take for example the Germans and endeavor to get our own theatre in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The committee of the Opera Club did not mention whether it has the intention of permanently presenting operas, but limits itself only to the presentation of "Halka," which could be better accomplished if the committee would turn with this proposition to the Alliance of Polish Singers, rather than to the Illinois Chapter. The names of the persons on the committee give a guarantee that the organizations which they represent would come with aid from the Alliance of Polish Singers, without special agitation in acquiring members. These organizations have an educational fund and can easily give a ready sum for the presentation of Polish opera in Chicago.</p>
