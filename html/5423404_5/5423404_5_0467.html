   <p>To honor Fritz von Schoultz on his 70th birthday, a banquet was given for him last Thursday at the Swedish Club. The Toastmaster was the Club's president, Mr. Einar Lindeblad, and addresses were made by the Hon. A.O. Eberhart, former Swedish Governor of Minnesota, Vice-Consul G. Bernhard Anderson, Carl O. Beroth, attorney and others. A musical program was rendered.</p>
   <p>Knowing well the characteristics of the celebrant, the birthday present from his friends and guests at the banquet consisted of a bank draft for a handsome amount. When accepting the check Mr. Schoultz immediatedy endorsed it and made it payable to the "Swedish Old Peoples Home," Evanston. The plan had worked well.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schoultz came to Chicago from Stockholm, Sweden, fifty years ago. For several decades he was the proprietor of one of the largest theatrical costume centers in the country. The Schoultz Studios are on Lake Street.</p>
