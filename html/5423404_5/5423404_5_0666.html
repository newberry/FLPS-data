   <p>Some time ago, the heirs of the deceased pastor, Herman Lindskog, of the Swedish church of Saint Ansgar, Sedgwick Street, instituted suit against the church for $7,691, claimed to be unpaid salary and house rent for the period Reverend Lindskog served as pastor of the church. No definite salary had been paid the minister, yet considerable income had accrued to him in fees from weddings, baptisims, and funerals, services for which the Reverend Mr. Lindskog had been greatly in demand.</p>
   <p>Replying to the suit, the representatives of the church have instituted suit against the minister's estate, demanding an accounting, showing the income and expenses of the church during the years Reverend Lindskog was minister, as he was also treasurer during the period. It is claimed by the church representatives that the account will show the pastor to have received an ample salary during his period of service.</p>
