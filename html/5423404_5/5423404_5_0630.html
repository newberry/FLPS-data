   <p>Most of the people who are to manage the subscriptions for the Fifth Liberty Loan have performed the same service in the preceding Loan campaigns. One of these is Nels M. Hokanson, who is the Executive Secretary of the Foreign Language Division. Mr. Hokanson, is well-known and is of Swedish heritage, though born in Copenhagen, May 6, 1885. When this occured, the parents, Karl Hokanson, and his spouse, were on their way to America. Here the family resided first in St. Paul, and later moved to Aitkin County, Minnesota, where the father owned a farm, and where the son grew up. The son received a regular public school education, but was not content with this measure of education, and resolved to go through high school, which he also did, earning his own means therefor. He later continued his studies at the University of Chicago, from whence he was graduated in 1911. Later, he completed a course in jurisprudence at Marshall Law School in this city. Shortly thereafter, he was employed by the State Bank of Chicago, where he <span class="page-break">\2</span>was manager of the savings department.</p>
   <p>He is married, lives in his own home in Highland Park. The father still lives, and is a farmer at Aitkin, Minnesota.</p>
   <p>Already, during the First Liberty Loan drive, Mr. Hokanson served as Secretary in the same division, while at the same time, attending his duties at the bank. The circumstances were the same during the Second and Third Liberty Loans. When the latter was completed, Mr. Hokanson became the object of a fine acknowledgement in the form of a banquet, where he was presented with a gold watch in rememberance of the valuable service he rendered the country during the Third Liberty Loan. When the Fourth Liberty Loan was to be taken up, he was again honored with the Secretaryship, as is now the case in the Fifth Loan. Beginning with the Fourth Loan, this position of Secretary has been a salaried one.</p>
   <p>By reason of his energetic work in these loan campaigns, Mr. Hokanson has <span class="page-break">\3</span>been named a member of the Americanization Committee by the Carnegie Foundation.</p>
