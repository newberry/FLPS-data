   <p>The metropolitan newspapers reported last Sunday that Edwin A. Olson, of Chicago, the nationally known Swedish-American jurist, is certain to be appointed United States District Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois in the near future. The present District Attorney, Charles F. Clyne, has tendered his resignation. This scheduled appointment indicates the esteem in which Mr. Olson is held in legal circles, and all Swedish-Americans have reason to be proud that one of their countrymen has been selected for such an important office.</p>
   <p>Edwin A. Olson was born in Cambridge, Illinois a little more than fifty-four <span class="page-break">\2</span>years ago. His parents, Charles and Christine Olson, were among the first Swedish settlers in that locality. He attended the public schools in his home town, and then took a course at Elliot's Business College in Burlington, Iowa, after which he returned home. In 1890 he came to Chicago to study law, and was graduated a few years later.</p>
   <p>Olson began to practice his profession here in Chicago. Shortly afterward, he became associated with the Scandia Life Insurance Company, now the Mutual Trust Insurance Company, and was for a number of years prominent on its board of directors. At the present time he is president of the firm. He has a wide reputation as an exceptionally able lawyer, with plenty of initiative and courage. During recent years he has devoted most of his time to the affairs of the insurance company as head of its legal department, and he is given most of the credit for its rapid and sound progress.</p>
   <p>His fine personal qualities and his practical approach to problems of any <span class="page-break">\3</span>kind have made him a leader in other fields also. He has, for instance, served one term as president of the Swedish-American Republican state organization, the John Ericson Republican League, and was its secretary for four years.</p>
   <p>To the general public he is best known as an orator. Few Americans of Swedish blood can be compared with him in this respect. His skillfully constructed speeches, usually mixed with humor, always command the rapt attention of his audiences.</p>
   <p>A couple of years ago he made a trip to Europe, visiting the northern countries and the continent in general. Upon his return, he lectured on his experiences and the impressions he had received on his tour. He was very enthusiastic about what he had seen and learned in the land of his fathers.</p>
