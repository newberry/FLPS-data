   <p>Ira Nelson Morris ,our Minister to Sweden,is in Chicago. Recently he had an audience with King Gustov when Sweden and the United States were discussed. Minister Morris informs us that food prices are very high in Sweden. Each person gets a bread-card which only permits a limited amount of bread. Sweden has been divided into districts for this particular purpose, in an effort to better conserve what they have.</p>
