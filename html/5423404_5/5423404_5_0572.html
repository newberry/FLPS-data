   <p>Tomorrow marks the centennial of the birth of Dr. Erland Carlson, famed pioneer of the Swedish-Lutheran church in America. This man, who was to become a religious leader among Swedes in this country, was born on August 24, 1822 in Elghult parish, in Smaland, Sweden. He grew up in a modest, God-fearing farm home. At an early age, he took an unusual interest in reading and religious study, and while he was still a boy it was decided that he should be trained for the ministry.</p>
   <p>After having studied under the direction of a private tutor for a few years, he entered the University of Lund in 1843, and on June 10, 1849 he was ordained as a pastor in the Swedish state church. However, his work in the homeland was of short duration, for as early as 1852, he was called to Chicago to take over the pastorate of the Swedish-Lutheran Immanuel Church, the mother church of all later Swedish-Lutheran congregations in America. Dr. Carlson served this church for twenty years, and his religious leadership and the influence which he wielded among his immigrant countrymen during that time is without a counterpart in Swedish-American religious history. From the book Svenskarne i Illinois (The Swedes in Illinois), published in 1880, seven years after he left the Immanuel congregation, we quote the following paragraphs, which provide an idea of the pastor's activities among Chicago's Swedes:</p>
   <p>"During his twenty years of service in Chicago, Dr. Carlson did not limit himself to his duties as a pastor. At that time, a Swedish minister in America had to be almost everything to his congregation; and this was especially true of Carlson, who undertook the double task of looking after both the spiritual and the material well-being of his people. From the very beginning, he became their religious leader as well as their practical counselor, and he was obliged to devote much time and thought to the latter role. His work week may well be described thus: preaching on Sunday; going from place to place on Monday in an attempt to find jobs for members of his flock; helping the latter straighten out a variety of personal affairs on Tuesday; meeting and assisting a carload of immigrants on Wednesday; acting as an interpreter in court on Thursday; writing and reading letters on Friday for those of his wards unable to do so for themselves; and spending Saturday in catching up on these and dozens of other activities. Needless to say, ingratitude was often his reward. But he was beloved and highly respected by his congregation.</p>
   <p>"Pastor Carlson was also a great organizer. Together with some friends, he established the Lutheran Printing Society, and he was also among those who were instrumental in the founding of Augustana College, the school established by the Synod. In short, Dr. Carlson was an outstanding pioneer of the Swedish-Lutheran church in America."</p>
   <p>Pastor Carlson died October 19, 1893, and was laid to rest in Graceland Cemetery. The centennial of his birth will be observed at the old Immanuel Church, Sedgwick and Hobbie Streets, Friday, September 8. On that occasion, a campaign will be inaugurated for the purpose of raising additional money for the Augustana Hospital building fund. A number of prominent Swedish-American pastors will speak.</p>
