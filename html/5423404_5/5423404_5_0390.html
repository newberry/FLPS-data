   <p>The noted Swedish architect, John A. Nyden, died early this week in his home, 1726 Hinman Avenue, of a heart Ailment. The disease seems to have developed suddenly, and the news of his passing comes as a shock to his many friends in Chicago and other parts of the country.</p>
   <p>Nyden was born in Moheda, Sweden, in 1878. His father was a building contractor, and John became familiar with the building industry at an early age. When he was fifteen years old he was already helping his father to supervise the work on the large army buildings which he was erecting for the Swedish government. The boy took advantage of this opportunity to learn to read blueprints and other intricacies of the trade, and thus laid the foundation for his future career.</p>

   <p>But he also developed a strong desire to see America, which he had heard so much about, and at the age of seventeen he came to Chicago. Here he attended technical schools and also obtained practical experience by working on building projects.</p>
   <p>In 1898 he entered the technological department of Valparaiso University, Indiana, and studied there for two years. Later he obtained employment with the George A. Fuller Company, a large building firm in New York State, and in 1902 he went abroad on a study trip, during which he visited England, France, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Upon his return to Chicago he became an executive in the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company here, and remained there until 1905. During 1906 and 1907 he was office manager of the architectural firms of Barnett, Hoynes, and Barnett and Arthur Huen.</p>
   <p>It was in 1904 that Nyden graduated from the Department of Architecture of the University of Illinois and in 1907 he established his own business.</p>

   <p>He was successful from the beginning, and enjoyed a fine reputation as an architect. He drew up the plans for many of the larger buildings here in Chicago and in the suburbs, among which are several hotels, churches, and schools. It may also be mentioned that he was engaged as consulting architect for the Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis and the North Park College here.</p>
   <p>During the World War Nyden served in the army's construction corps with the rank of colonel, and he also served a term as state architect for Illinois. He was much interested in the preservation of Swedish-American historical relics and was a member of the Swedish Historical Society of America and of the John Morton Foundation in Philadelphia. The drawings for the new John Morton Museum in that city were prepared by him.</p>
   <p>He is survived by his widow, Alma Ottelia Nyden, and two daughters, and by one brother here in Chicago and one brother and a sister who are living in Sweden.</p>
