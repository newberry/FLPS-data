   <p>After having referred to several articles in The Swedish Tribune, Chicago in regard to the riots, May 1st. here, Goteborgs Handelstidnine, Sweden reprints the nice statements of the Chicago Tribune, and the Inter-Ocean published recently regarding the Scandinavisns. He continues his article as follows:</p>
   <p>"The newspaper Inter-Ocean report that, according to the census of 1880, there are 194,337 Swedes, 181,729 Norwegians and 64,106 Danes in America. This figure must have grown considerably, in regard to the Swedish element, after 1880, because 160,000 Swedes emigrated during 1880-84 to America.</p>
   <p>The melancholy with which one has not been able to avoid looking at this great emigration, is mitigated through the excellent testimonies concerning the emigrants, when it implies, that they do their old country honor.</p>
   <p>They ought not to be looked upon as people who have ungratefully left the soil upon which they were born. They have been replanted in a stronger soil where they have reached a growth they could not have attained in the old country. If they, in such a way, are making a good and strong stake in the cultivation of the New World, then they have done a good deed.</p>
   <p>They have also been strongly affiliated with the powerful republic as element which is of value to its home country, to which they with their whole hearts are strongly attached. The time may come, when this will show up to good advantage.</p>
   <p>This is already shown by the enormous sums of money, which the immigrants are sending home to their relatives, especially around Christmas time. Several millions of dollars are then sent from Swedish immigrants in the United States to Sweden every year at this time.</p>
   <p>On account of this, and because of other circumstances, one doesn't nowadays look at the emigration with unkind eyes as before. It was condemned by many an unkindness, which only a few Swedish paper dared to oppose, saying that the emigration should not be stopped, as many contended it should be.</p>
   
   <p>It would be for the good of all if men could learn to look at such movements with more sympathy and understanding.</p>
   <p>This experience tells us that movements, which do not rest on a good solid foundation, or that tend to destroy the right thing, do not last long. If they rest on a good solid basis, they ought not to be stopped."</p>
