   <p>The Mayor of Chicago, C. Harrison, has appointed our countryman engineer, John Ericson, to be the Chief City Engineer in Chicago, a very responsible office. The Mayor could not have made a better choice, and the Swedes in Chicago are, therefore, very thankful to the Mayor for this appointment.</p>
   <p>John Ericson was born in Upland, Sweden in 1858. He is a graduate of the Tecnical High School in Stockholm, 1880, and immigrated to America the following year, when he was appointed "resident engineer" for the Toledo, Cincinnati &amp; St.Louis R.R. Mr. Ericson was appointed assistant city engineer in 1886, first assistant city engineer in 1893, and now is Chief City Engineer. Ericson is an eminent man in his profession, which shows that we Swedes have able people fit for various kinds of important work. All honor to such a countryman.</p>
