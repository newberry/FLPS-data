   <p>As we study newspapers from day to day, the reports issued periodically from the Immigration Bureau in Washington, D. C., and in addition, the reports presented by the Commissioner of Immigration in New York City, the evidence is quite convincing that practically every country in the Old World week after week is sending an increasing number of emigrants to the United States. If immigration continues in similar manner as hitherto, it may safely be assumed that at the close of the present fiscal year on June 30, more immigrants will have arrived during this year than during any previous year. Conservatively, the figure is put at 860,000 already, but it does not seem impossible that the million figure may be reached. The highest number of immigrants previously arriving in any one year came in 1882, when no less than 788,992 people arrived.</p>
   <p>With respect to this unusually large increase in immigration, the question presses <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>itself to the front whether this great influx of new entrants is really desirable. With respect to the contingent from the Scandinavian countries, from Germany, England, and from northern Europe in general, people who came to build for themselves a better future than seemed probable in Europe, the answer is definitely, yes. But large as has been the immigration from this section it does not at all measure up numerically to that from Europe's southern and eastern nations. It is a fact that no less than two-thirds of the total for the past few years have come from Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Opinions seem to be somewhat divided as to the desirability of an increase in immigration from these quarters. It is not because these illiterate, poor people, who are suppressed in their own homeland in Europe could not find a place of refuge and a chance to earn a living in the United States similarly to those from the northern countries, but the great question remains whether and when they can be assimilated with the rest of the population, and to what extent do they possess the necessary qualifications for such assimilation. The rate of speed of the process of assimilation with regard to the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>people from northern Europe is well known, and no discussion of the question as it concerns them is required.</p>
   <p>But so far, there is room in "the land of the free and the home of the brave" for all those who seriously and honestly seek a chance to earn a living, which they failed to find in their respective homeland. Perhaps Uncle Sam now has started to take steps for a certain measure of selection in regard to his future acquisition, but his capacity for assimilating the various elements has stood the tests so far, and will probably stand the test in the future, as well.</p>
