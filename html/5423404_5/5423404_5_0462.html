   <p>p.10.............Bertha C. Moller is her name, born in Jamtland and she came here with her parents at the age of five.</p>
   <p>After having graduated from both Northwestern and Minnesota Universities in Law, she opened a legal office in Chicago, where she was and still is the only practicing woman lawyer of Swedish decent.</p>
   <p>In her chosen field of endeavor she is occupying a rather enviable position, and in the Criminal Court Building she has been called"The Lady Darrow." That this flattering comparison is well deserved, she proved, in a trial where she defended a Negro, who <span class="page-break">2</span>was accused of having caused the death of a son of the millionaire basket manufacturer Mickelberry. Her eloquent address to the jury in this case, was one of the most brilliant ever heard in the criminal court.</p>
   <p>Miss Moller is the first Swedish woman to receive a more important official position in Chicago; a short time ago she was appointed Assistant Attorney for the Sanitary District of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Miss Moller is an unusually active and energetic woman, and she has not confined her activities to things pertaining to her legal vocation alone. She is considered an authority on law-questions pertaining to women, and is at present in the act of preparing a review of laws governing her own sex dating back from the 8000th year B.C. up to the present time. In addition she has just about finished a work on "Our State's leading Women and their Accomplishments," which will be published in the early spring.</p>

   <p>Interested as Miss Moller is in the woman's cause, she is rightly proud of her role in the fight for woman's suffrage in America. It was she who prevailed upon James M. Cox, while he was Democratic candidate for the presidency in 1920, to send three personal representatives to Tennesse, to induce its legislature to ratify the amendment for woman's suffrage.</p>
   <p>These three men succeeded in their mission and the victory was won.</p>
   <p>World Peace has found Miss Moller a strong supporter. Her's was the idea, to arrange the Peace-meetings on Easter Day, which are being held every year throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>That our countrymen in Chicago and in particular our ladies should wish to pay homage to a woman who, to such a degree, has honored the Swedish name is only natural.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>With this in view the American Daughters of Sweden, our strongest and most representative ladies' organization whose president is Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, and vice-president Mrs. Fred Westberg, have decided upon a banquet in honor of Miss Moller.</p>
   <p>The event takes place Friday February 4, at the Swedish Club.</p>
