   <p>At its last meeting, which was held in January, the Swedish Singer's League of Chicago appointed Otto C. J. Carlson Chief director. And the League certainly did not pick a man of unknown quality, for Carlson is a veteran singer and Choir leader even though he is still young in years. It may be added here that since this appointment, he has also been made director of the North Star Singing Club.</p>
   <p>He has an excellent tenor voice, and immediately after his arrival in Chicago he went in for Choir singing. He soon began to attract attention in singing circles. He had the advantage of having received fine training early in life. As a boy he studied piano and voice under P. O. Hemming, of Vastra Klastorp, near the city of Malmo, Sweden.</p>
   <p>Carlson was born in Ostratorp, in the province of Skane, June 9, 1875, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>came to Chicago in 1890. Eight years later, we find him in Florida as a church organist. He did not stay long in the South, however, but soon returned to Chicago, and began to study music. After having taken violin lessons for some time he began to take instruction in singing under the well-known choir director John R. Ortengren, who was then assoicated with the Chicago Musical College.</p>
   <p>In 1897, Carlson joined the Swedish Glee Club of Chicago, and for a number of years he also belonged to the Lyran singing society.</p>
   <p>He began his career as choir leader in 1902, when he became the director of the Ebenezer Swedish Lutheran Church here. He held that position until 1904, when he took over the choir of the Trinity Swedish Lutheran church with which he remained until 1908. That year he moved to the Saron Church, whose choir he directed for two years. In addition to his work with these church choirs he directed the Arpi Choir from 1905 to 1907, and the Wennerberg Choir from 1907 to 1914. During 1908 and 1909, he also led the National Festival Male Chorus.</p>

   <p>Upon his arrival in America, Carlson took up the jeweler's trade and has worked for several firms here in Chicago. He is now employed by Lebolt &amp; Company.</p>
   <p>In 1907 he married Hulda Josephina Ostrom.</p>
