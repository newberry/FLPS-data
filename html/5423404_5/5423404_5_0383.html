   <p>Two Swedes, Robert Hilding and John Robinson, were arrested a couple of days ago on a charge of burglary. After being booked, Hilding confessed to Lieutenant Steele that he and Robinson had murdered a young woman in Stockholm on December 1, 1875. A merchant, Perault, paid Hilding five hundred crowns for murdering the young woman. The girls name was Sophia Dahlberg, she was strangled to death with a cord, in the good old East Indian fashion.</p>
   <p>The two murderers will be extradited to the Swedish police some time in September. Of course, the Swedish Government will pay all expenses.</p>
