   <p>"Chicago Swedish Lutherans deeply mourn the loss of King Oscar and today we assemble in our churches in memorial services to offer prayer for your Majesty Trust in God. We offer our deepest sympathy."</p>
   <p>Even in the Norwegian churches memorial services are being held in honor of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>deceased King. In "Our Savior's Church", Pastor B. E. Bergesen spoke of the King's splendid character and rightness. King Oscar will stand out in history as one of the monarchs most highly thought of. He said these were the sentiments also of his brethren. And how anyone could be of different opinion no Norseman will understand. The King's attitude toward the Norwegian people was to seek their confidence and to warrant their kindly feeling.</p>
