   <p>Stromberg has been married since 1865 to Augusta Anderson.</p>
   <p>Their two daughters died in infancy, so he has but his one son left. Mr. Stromberg is one of the foremost Swedes in Chicago and entertains extensively at his residence on Wolfram St. He, Consul Charles Sundell, and Captain Stenbeck constituted a very fine Swedish - American trio for a great many years who attempted to keep alive Swedish speech and culture in Chicago.
