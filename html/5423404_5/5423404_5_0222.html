   <p>Bishop Hjalmar Danell from Skara, Sweden, is visiting America and is at present in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Last Friday Bishop Danell delivered a sermon in the Swedish Lutheran Ebeneser Church on Fester Avenue. Earlier in the day he spoke in flawless English to the Sunday School class that had assembled in the new community house auditorium, which on this occasion was being used for the first time, although the building is not quite ready as yet. However, this constituted a befitting unofficial dedication of the building for its worthy purpose by this eminent Swedish church dignitary.</p>
