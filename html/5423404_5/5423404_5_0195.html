   <p>Scandinavians, familiar with the immigration problem, report that an average of 1,200 Scandinavians arrived daily in Chicago, during the month of May this year. Most of them continued their journey westward and only a few of them settled in Chicago. It is expected that the Scandinavian immigration will be much greater next year.</p>
   <p>More than half of this year's arrivals have been travelling on free tickets paid for in advance and sent home to the old country by relatives and friends in America. It is expected that the American-Scandinavians are going to pay out $1,500,000 towards this, this year. At least 60,000 Swedes are expected here this year and they will settle mainly in Kansas,Nebraska,Iowa,Minnesota, Missouri and Dakota. The majority of the newly arrived are young men and women.</p>
   <p>Not less than 3,500 Scandinavians arrived one evening in Chicago last month. From here they all took different routes and went various places. Extra railroad are running westward night and day, filled with immigrants, but the railroad companies are nevertheless handicapped because they do not know how to accommodate the enormous crowds without delay.</p>
