   <p>If everything goes well at the next election, three Swedish-Americans will be elected to Congress, namely; Irvine L. Lenroot of Wisconsin, Charles A. Lindbergh of Minnesota, Frederick Lundin of Chicago. At the present time, there seems to be no doubt that these three candidates will be elected with large majorities. The last named person belongs to our city, and we present a short biography of him.</p>
   <p>Frederick Lundin was born May 18, 1868 in Tollstad Ostergotland, Sweden. He came to this country as a young boy with his parents, and grew up here in Chicago, which has been his home all the time. The first year in this country, he showed that he had energy and ambition, and this has been characteristic of him in his rise to political fame. He sold papers in the day time and studied at night. He became an errand boy for a clothing company and here he proved his worth by becoming a department manager in a few years. It did not take long before he started in business for himself, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and at this time his firm, Lundin and Company is well-known all over America where Swedes live. The firm makes an extract from which a beverage is made called "Enebars Drink," this being only one of their products.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lundin has taken an active interest in politics here, and has worked with body and soul for the progress of the Republican party. In local politics, he has for many years taken a leading part, and for fourteen years, he has represented his Ward on the Republican Central Committee.</p>
   <p>In 1894, Lundin was elected as State Senator with an overwhelming plurality. In this capacity, he made a splendid name for himself. He was nominated as City Clerk, but was defeated, although he received more votes than the candidate for Mayor on the same ticket. At the primary last August, Lundin was nominated as Congressman from the 7th district, which comprises a large part of the Northwest side of Chicago. His popularity in this district was shown by the large majority of votes he received at the primary.</p>

   <p>It is unnecessary to speak of Lundin's qualifications for the office of which he is a candidate. The best evidence of this is given in a petition which was undersigned by one hundred forty-two prominent Swedish and Danish businessmen, and others within the 7th district. In this petition, Lundin is recommended very highly for Congressman. We are sure that the Swedes within the district will cast their votes to a man for Fred Lundin, and we believe that he will serve his new fosterland with honor in the halls of Congress. It will be an honor to himself and to the nationality to which he belongs.</p>
