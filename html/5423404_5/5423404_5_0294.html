   <p>America's largest and most beautiful theatre is the place where we Swedes have celebrated our most important festivities for the past fifteen years. And this winter it will open its portals for the fifteenth mid-winter festival of the Swedish National Societies on the 19th of January, 8:00 A.M.</p>
   <p>Consul Oscar Ekman mentions the fact that the name of King Gustaf II who recently ascended the Swedish throne has been talked about all over the world. The Swedish National Society wants to celebrate in his honor; therefore Zacharias Topelti's historical play, "Gustaf II and Regina Von Emmeritz," will be given at the mid-winter festival. Professor J. R. Ortengren and Miss Ida Ostergren will play the title roles; they will be assisted by our most accomplished dramatic actors and singers. It is understood that it will be one of the best ever given. Let us Swedes, therefore, assemble at the Auditorium on the 19th of January to celebrate the king's coronation.</p>
