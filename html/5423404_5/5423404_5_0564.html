   <p>The American-Scandinavian Foundation gave a banquet last Thursday, in the Blackstone Hotel, in honor of C. S. Peterson, newly elected member of the county commission. The affair was attended by the consuls of the three Scandinavian countries and a large number of other representative Scandinavians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>A committee consisting of Henry L. Hertz, Birger Osland, and Henry Henschen, representing the Foundation, was in charge of the arrangements, Mr. Henschen acting as master of ceremonies. A number of speakers, among them Superior Court Judge Harry Olson, Oscar Torrison, judge of the Municipal Court, and the three consuls, vied in paying tribute to Mr. Peterson as a great Scandinavian-American leader. The Swedish consul, Carl O. De Dardel, summed up the Swedish sentiment when he said, "Charley Peterson is number one among Swedish-Americans in Chicago. He is a man who, through intelligence and energy, has made a <span class="page-break">2</span>respected place for himself in the community, and I know that he will always remain a loyal and true Swedish-American, faithful to both his new and old country."</p>
   <p>Mr. Peterson, after expressing thanks for the many nice things said about him, briefly outlined the main ideas and principles which had guided his public activities.</p>
   <p>A message, written for the occasion by Dr. Henry Goddard Leach of New York City, was read at the table.</p>
