   <p>Madame Caroline Ostberg, Primadonna from the Royal Opera, Stockholm, will appear for the first time in Chicago at a Grand Concert, given by the Swedish Singing Society, the Swedish Glee Club, Svithiods Chorus, and Lyran, March 22, 1893, at the Auditorium, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Madam Ostberg is, no doubt, one of the most prominent dramatic singers of our time. Her career has been an unbroken chain of triumphs ever since her first appearance at the Royal Opera, Stockholm, in 1870. She became affiliated with "The New Theater," Stockholm, in 1880, where she carried the title roll in "Bocaccio" for two-hundred and fifty nights in succession; she stayed with the theater for five years. Then she went back to the Opera, much to the delight of the public, who greeted her with great ovation, storming applause, and flowers in her role as Agatha in "The Freeshooter." The house was sold out four days in advance.</p>

   <p>The directors of the Opera, as well as the public, became despaired when Madam Ostberg decided to go to America.</p>
   <p>King Oscar gave her a letter of recommendation to the Royal Swedish Consulate in New York praising her splendid work as the most prominent singer in Sweden.</p>
