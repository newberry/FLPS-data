   <p>A well deserved homage was paid our well-known and highly esteemed countryman, Mr. Charles G.Petterson on his 65th birthday, by a large host of friends, who called at his home and paid their respects. Among the callers we noted professor Fridolf Risberd, editor O. Hogfeldt, Jonas Swanson, Norrman Oskerberg, Callin and Andrew Johnson.</p>
   <p>Charles G. Petterson was born on the 8th day of August, 1851 in Marbacks Parish, Smaland, Sweden. He remained with his parents until the age of eighteen, when he in company with many others immigrated to America in 1869. He came direct to Chicago, which has been his home ever since. - In the great fire in 1871 he, with so many others, lost the home which he had established here. Since 1882 he has been engaged in different occupations, but best known is Mr. Petterson for the outstanding ability shown as business manager for "Missions-Vannen" (Friend of the Mission). During this "guardianship" he has earned for himself an enviable reputation for ability and integrity. This reputation has made him a very much "sought after person," outside of <span class="page-break">2</span>his own occupation. It is to a large degree to his credit, that the Mission Society today is on such an economically sound foundation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petterson is recognized both within and outside this Society, as one of its strongest pillars. He stands as a shining example for the Swedish colony in Chicago, amongst whose pioneers he must be counted.</p>
