   <p>A delegation of representatives of several nationalities here left for Washington, D. C., on February 5, for the purpose of seeing and urging President Taft to veto the new immigration measure passed upon by Congress.</p>
   <p>According to this new bill, every immigrant must be able to read and write in his or her own mother tongue. The delegation also represented the Foreign Newspaper Association with Chief Justice Harry Olson as chairman. He pointed out to the President that if this measure becomes a law only people from the cities in Sweden would emigrate, and not from the rural districts.</p>
   <p>"It would be more important," he said, "to investigate the immigrants' health than their education."</p>
