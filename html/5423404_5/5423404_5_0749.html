   <p>Carl R. Chindblom is a candidate for county commissioner on the Republican ticket. He was elected to the County Board two years ago, and has taken an active part in all the Commission's undertakings. During his term, the new County Building has been finished and is now occupied at Clark and Washington Streets. The building for the Juvenile Court has been conducted like a well ordered home where Juveniles are kept until they are tried and their future decided. The Honorable C. R. Chindblom is chairman of the committee in charge of the management of the Juvenile Home. He has been chairman on the Law Enforcement committee; also the City Relations Committee. Besides these, he has been chairman of various committees of importance, such as the finance, judiciary, and the Dunning Institution. He was a member of the special committee that supervised the erection of the new Poorhouse, built near Blue Island Illinois. At the spring election, the County Board was given the right <span class="page-break">\2</span>to sell bonds to the amount of two million dollars to construct new buildings to house the poor, tuberculosis and other sick persons. It is, therefore, important that as many as possible of the present commissioners be re-elected so that they may complete the work they have started so well.</p>
