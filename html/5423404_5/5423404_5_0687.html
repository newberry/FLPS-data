   <p>Frederick J. Lundin is an honest and well known man. He is the only Swedish-born man who ever represented the State of Illinois in the U. S. Congress. Through his office he took the initiative and made himself the advocate of one of the most important social questions ever given voice in our National House of Representatives, "the Old Age Pension" question. This is a question which several of the foremost countries in Europe have already seen the necessity of solving, among which one is our own fatherland of old.</p>
