   <p>Last Wednesday the boys from the land of song and saga whom we have been awaiting so impatiently, finally arrived from the East. The reception committee met the train at Crystal Lake, and with a brotherly embrace welcomed them to the city of the Swedes--Chicago.</p>
   <p>The news of the arrival of the celebrated singers spread like a prairie fire,and Swedes of both sexes and all ages hurried to the depot hoping to get at least a glimpse of the singing students, with their white caps and the blue ribbons on their coat lapels. When the train pulled in there were some two thousand people on the platform awaiting it, among them being seventy male singers who, forming a guard of honor around the visitors, greeted them with the stirring song, "Vart Land" (Our Country). The boys from Lund then stepped into the waiting cabs and were taken to the Auditorium Hotel where they rested after the trip.</p>
   <p>Thursday morning, as a great number of cabs drove up in front of the world-renowned hotel, the festive white caps appeared again. The reception committee had arranged a sight-seeing tour of the city's parks and boulevards. The procession, made up of some twenty-five cabs, set out for Jackson Park about ten o'clock, and when the beautiful scenery had been seen and admired, the sight-seers drove past the imposing buildings of the University of Chicago. They then turned north, through Lincoln Park to the Bismarck Garden where a tasty lunch was served. A most jubilant spirit prevailed, and it was here that the student choir in harmonious and powerful tones conveyed the motherland's greetings to her sons and daughters on this side of the ocean. How was the song received? One might as well ask how the long-lost son feels when he returns and receives his mother's blessing; it cannot be adequately described.</p>
   <p>At eight o'clock that night the students gave a concert in the Auditorium, at the conclusion of which, everybody vied for the pleasure of playing host to the singers from the old land, and until the early morning hours hardly one of them was to be found at the hotel. But they were conspicuous in the best-known restaurants and places of entertainment. We are told that in one of them, the orchestra stopped playing while a double student quartette rendered a couple of numbers, which were enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>Early Tuesday morning the choir departed for Rock Island where it was to give one concert. Sunday our visitors returned to Chicago where they were the guests of the Svithiod Singing Club at an afternoon banquet, and in the evening they gave their second Chicago concert in the Auditorium, after which the boys again did some sight-seeing.</p>
   <p>They left Chicago yesterday for the East, where they are to give a few more concerts, and on July 19 they will embark for home.</p>
   <p>The visit was one of those rare, festive occasions which are never forgotten.</p>
