   <p>p.11... Assistant States Attorney, Harry Olson, has again earned distinction as one of the ablest jurists who has practiced within Cook County Criminal Court, in the now ended case against the insurance swindlers, Dr. Unger and private detective, Brown. Mr. Olson was born in Chicago in 1867, of Swedish parents, and received his book education at Pecatonia High School, Washburn College, and Northwestern University Law School, where he also passed the lawyer's examination. The first, more important court case, which he prosecuted, was the notorious murder case against the police officers, Moran and Healy, in 1893. As is known they were accused of the murder of our countryman, Swan Nelson, and it was the city's Swedes,who, so to speak, raised themselves as one man, who engaged Olson to conduct the prosecution against the accused. We need not go into details about the fact that Olson succeeded in having them sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment. They were, to be sure, twice near escaping punishment, but through Olson's perseverance they were convicted for the third time, although the sentence this time was lightened to but six years imprisonment.</p>
   
   <p>When Deneen became elected States Attorney, Olson was the first he named as assistant. During the time he occupied this post, he has won ten of sixteen more important cases, of which Deneen had charge of. Among these was the case against the murderers Lattimore and Jacks, who were hanged; the case against the embezzler, Chas. H. George; the case against Theo. H. Schintz, who was declared guilty of embezzlement of $40,000; the case against Wm. S. Young, administrator of the county's public funds, who embezzled about $27,000; the case against Geo. H. Bogert, City Attorney in Evanston, who embezzled $8,000; the case against J.N.Moody, treasurer of the Oak Park Building and Loan Association, whose dispersions reached to $25,000; the case against the insurance swindlers Dr. Regent, Delia Mahoney, James O'Brien and Nora O'Brien, against whom he conducted prosecutions three different times and procured their conviction in the end. Now, latest, the assurance swindle case against Dr. Unger and F. N.Brown. This case, together with the Leuter case, have been the most consequential to come up during State's Attorney Deneen's term of office. Mr. Olson enjoys high regard,both among jurists and judges, where-ever his countrymen, with right feel themselves proud.</p>
