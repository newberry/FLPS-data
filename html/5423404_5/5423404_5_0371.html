   <p>The Scandinavian military commissioner's visit to Chicago and their attendance at various festivals are described in both the American and Swedish papers in Chicago. They were frequently invited to luncheons, suppers, balls, and sightseeing tours through the city. The officers also attended a concert given by Nordstjernan Singing Society last Saturday night, and the Swedish Service in St.Ausgarius Swedish Episcopal Church on Sunday morning.</p>
   <p>The streets around the church were packed with people hours before the arrival of the officers. They, therefore, had some difficulty in entering the church. The temple was beautifully decorated with Swedish and American colors, flowers, and palms. Although there were seats for only seven hundred persons, nearly twelve hundred were packed into the church.</p>
   <p>The church choir of forty-two voices sang under the direction of the church's skilful organist, Gustav Nordlander.</p>
   <p>The service was conducted by the rector,the Rev. Herman Lindskog, who preached a good sermon. His text was from John 10; 23. And Jesus went into the temple of Solomon....</p>

   <p>The officers were invited to the Swedish Club after the services for light refreshments, and left for Minneapolis last Friday, the trip being sponsored by the leading Chicago Swedish newspapers.</p>
   <p>The officers were royally entertained in Minneapolis too. It is really surprising that they have been able to stand the strain of attending all these festivities so well.</p>
   <p>Before they departed from Chicago to Sweden, the officers sent to the Swedish Tribune the following statement:</p>
   <p>Before our departure we will not be able to visit in person all the many societies and private homes who, during our stay in Chicago, heaped upon us so much kindness and hospitality. Permit us, therefore, to express our great gratitute to all our Swedish and American friends, with the assurance that the memory of what we have experienced in Chicago will not fade away.</p>
   <p>Chicago, October 15, 1887.</p>
