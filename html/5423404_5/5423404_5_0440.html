   <p>Two prominent Chicago-Swedes have been honored by the Swedish King, namely Chief Engineer Albert Witting, president of the Swedish Cultural Society of America, and Mr. Carl Festin, who is a dynamic factor in Swedish fraternal life in Chicago and who among other notable accomplishments, was the originator and one of the founders of the South Side Swedish Club of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Witting was honored with the order of the North Star and Mr. Festin with the order of Vasa. In this connection we may mention that Mr. Witting was presented several years ago with the Order of Vasa.</p>
   <p>These works of distinction and honor were presented to deserving recipients at a banquet given for them by the Swedish Engineers Society at the club house last Saturday. The presentments were made by Consul Carl O. de Dardel, with the customary accompaniment of festive ceremonies, addresses by guest speakers and a select musical program.</p>
