   <p>Still another member of the Order of Svithiod left this earthly life when Peter E. Jensen died suddenly in his home last Thursday from a heart attack.</p>
   <p>He was very active as an officer in Svithiod. He organized the Manhem Drill Corps, a military organization, and was also a member of the Garden City Lodge A. F. and A. M., the Oriental Consistory, and the Medina Temple. His funeral was conducted from St. Ansgarius Church by Rev. Herman Lindskog.</p>
