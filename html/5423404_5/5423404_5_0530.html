   <p>H. S. Henschen, the well-known stockbroker and former treasurer of the State Bank of Chicago, observed his fiftieth birthday last Sunday. He was born July 29, 1873 in Brooklyn, New York. His father was the noted educator and newspaper man, Dr. William Henschen.</p>
   <p>Young Henschen attended school in Evanston, Illinois, and in Jamestown, New York; but while he was still a young boy his parents returned to Sweden, where his education was continued in Stockholm schools and in the university city of Uppsala. At the age of sixteen, he returned to America, and some time later we find him working in Haugan &amp; Lindgren's Bank in this city, which was succeeded by the present State Bank of Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>Four years after his arrival here, he began to study law, attending night classes at the Chicago College of Law, from which he was graduated in 1896. Shortly thereafter, he was admitted to the Illinois bar; but he continued his work in the bank, and in 1901 he was made assistant cashier. Seven years later, he was promoted to cashier, a position which he held for a number of years. During the last few years, he has been very successfully engaged in the stockbrokerage business.</p>
   <p>From 1909 to 1914, Henschen served as Swedish consul in Chicago, and while in this office he was made a Knight of the Vasaa Order by King Gustaf of Sweden. He belongs to the Swedish Club, the Union League Club, the City Club, and the Chicago Bar Association, and he is also a member of the Chicago Art Institute.</p>
   <p>In 1898 he married Edith Mountain. They have two children.</p>
