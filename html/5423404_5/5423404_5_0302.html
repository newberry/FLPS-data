   <p>The lending library of King Oscar II which was instituted in January 1906 for the purpose of providing a National link between the Swedes abroad and the ones in the old country, has now sent out books to various places in the world. Several books have arrived in the United States to be distributed free of charge and on a lending basis among Swedish societies and assemblies. The books, written by many prominent authors, deal on various topics. These lending libraries will be a substitute for the permanent larger libraries. All books are chosen by a literary committee under Professor Warburg and Dr. Karlfeldt. The Board of Directors' office is in Stockholm, Sweden, under control of the King of Sweden. Those of our countrymen interested in this matter can obtain further information through Consul Lindgren, Chicago.</p>
