   <p>Word has been received that the Tuberculosis Sanitarium, Denver, Colorado, is the recipient of a donation of $5,000 to be used for the beautifying and landscaping of its grounds.</p>
   <p>The donor is our well-known Chicagoan, Frank Gustafson, contractor, singer, and sculptor. This is not the first time Mr. Gustafson has shown his generosity toward the Swedish Tuberculosis Sanitarium and other worthy causes; no, indeed, even so often Mr. Gustafson, in his own quiet gentle way, reaches out a helping hand to a Swedish society or a friend in need.</p>
