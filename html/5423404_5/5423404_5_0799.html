   <p>p.11. The newspaper publisher, Mr. F. A. Lindstrand, had arranged a little party at his home last Friday evening for Dr. V. Hugo Wickstrom, where twelve to fifteen guests had been invited to make the acquaintance of Dr. Wickstrom. A great attack was made upon a delicious "Smorgospord" (Sandwich Luncheon) after which Mrs. and Miss Lindstrand served still more delicacies, and the guest entertained each other in a lively manner. Lastly,the company assembled about the bowl and drank a skaal to the guest of honor, and "the worthy people." Short talks were given by Mr. Lindstrand, Dr. Wickstrom, and G. B. Anderson. A quartette from the Glee Club sang "Frojd i hjartan och pokaler" (Joy in Hearts and Cups), and others.</p>
   <p>During his Chicago visit Dr. Wickstrom has also been the guest of the consul, John R. Lindgren, and the broker, Robert Lindblom.</p>
