   <p>During recent years there has been increased activity within Swedish-American clubs and societies, and among the leaders responsible for this revival among our countrymen is Mr. John A. Sandgren.</p>
   <p>He was born April 10, 1871 in Mortorp parish, Kalmar, Sweden, the son of Postmaster C. A. Sandgren, who was a business leader in the community and held several public offices during his time. After having graduated from the public school, the boy studied for some time under a private tutor, and then attended the Kalmar Business Institute. After graduation he took a one-year course at the Applerum's Agricultural College. He then went to work as a bookkeeper on Baron Stjernstedt's estate at Lokene, Vermland, where he remained until 1891 when he decided to go to America. His first stop was Sheffield, Pennsylvania, but he did not stay there for long. After having worked in Kennedy, New York, and in several other places in the East for some time, he went to Chicago in the fall of 1892, and like most newcomers he could not be choosy but had to take any job that he could get. During the first few years here he worked on farms and in mills and factories until he finally obtained employment with the Chicago Title and Trust Company, where he remained for eight years.</p>
   <p>In 1902 he was elected secretary for the Independent Order of Svithiod, which has benefited much by his business ability and talent for organization. When he took over the job the Order only had a membership of some two thousand, which number has now increased to seven thousand in forty-one lodges which are distributed over several states. This astounding growth is chiefly due to Mr. Sandgren's efficient work and the introduction of practical business methods in the administration of the Order's affairs.</p>
   <p>During these years about half a million dollars have passed through his hands, first collected from the various lodges, and then paid out in benefits to individual members, and such transactions have always been carried out with remarkable precision. No wonder that he has repeatedly been unanimously re-elected.</p>
   <p>In addition to handling the Order's business affairs, Mr. Sandgren also is on the staff of its monthly publication, The Svithiod Order's Journal, which is issued in seven thousand copies, and one can readily understand that he is a busy man.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the Verdandi Lodge and has served as its president and secretary for several terms. He is also a member of the Svithiod Singing Club and serves on its board of directors. For many years he has been a delegate to the League for the Old People's Home, and has also served as its treasurer and vice-president. At present he is president of the League, and a director of the Home, and is now busy looking after its interests during the construction of its new building in North Evanston. He is a Free Mason, being a member of the King Oscar Lodge.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Sandgren married Miss Thekla C. Bogren in 1899 and their home is at 3361 North Ashland Avenue, Edgewater.</p>
   <p>Personally he is a genial and friendly fellow, whose wit makes him much sought after as an after-dinner speaker.</p>
