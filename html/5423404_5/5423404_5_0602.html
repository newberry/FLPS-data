   <p>The widely known educator and preacher, Fridolf Risberg, died last Tuesday night in the Bowmanville Hospital. His death did not come unexpectedly, for he had been in ill health for several months.</p>
   <p>Risberg was born in Nysatra, Vasterbotten, Sweden, November 4, 1848. His father was a practicing physician. In 1874 he graduated from the Department of Theology of Uppsala University and in the same year was ordained as a minister in the Swedish State church. He served several congregations, until in 1882 he resigned from the State church and joined the Free church. His association with the latter was of short duration, however. In the fall of 1885, we find him as a professor in the Swedish department of the Chicago Theological Seminary. He remained with that institution for more than thirty years, until 1917, when the Swedish department of the Seminary was abolished. In recognition of his services, he had been made a Doctor of Theology in 1910.</p>
   <p>In addition to his work as a teacher, Professor Risberg found time for extensive writing, and he contributed numerous articles to religious periodicals.</p>
   
   <p>He was greatly interested in the activities of the Scandinavian Alliance Mission and served as its treasurer for many years. He never married and is survived by two nieces who are living in Sweden.</p>
