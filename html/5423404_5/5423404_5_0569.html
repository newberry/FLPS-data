   <p>The nationally known Swedish-American Baptist preacher and publicist, Dr. Erik Wingren, passed away last Tuesday after a long illness. He had been living in retirement for the last few years, but before his retirement he had been one of the leaders of the Swedish Baptists in America, and had exerted great influence, especially through his newspaper, Nya Veckoposten (The New Weekly Post), upon the development of the Swedish Baptist movement. In 1917 he was forced to give up the editorship of his paper because of failing eyesight. The Posten was then consolidated with the Baptist organ, Svenska Standaret (The Swedish Standard), of which Dr. Wingren was later made honorary editor in recognition of his services to the Baptist cause. When he retired, Wingren had been active in Swedish-American newspaper work for nearly forty years.</p>

   <p>He was born in Mardsjon, in the province of Jamtland, Sweden, December 17, 1843, and would thus have celebrated his seventy-ninth birthday next December. He received his college education in Sundsvall, and then entered the Bethel Seminary, a Baptist institution for the training of preachers. He was the first student to register in that school. As a young pastor, Wingren served several Baptist congregations in Sweden, in the cities of Sundsvall, Kristianstad, and Malmo. In March 1880, he came to Chicago to take over his duties as pastor of the Second Baptist Church, and he made his home here from that time on.</p>
   <p>Soon after his arrival, he became active in newspaper work, and contributed to Nya Veckoposten. In 1884 he became editor of the paper, in which capacity he showed unusual ability. He also found time to serve his church in other ways, and he was instrumental in founding Baptist congregations in Englewood, South Chicago, Lake View, Ravenswood, Edgewater, and Evanston. In 1910 he published a religious work, The Coming of Christ. A few years later, Sioux City College awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Theology.</p>
