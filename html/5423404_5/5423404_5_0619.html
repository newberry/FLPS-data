   <p>Among those who, during the last quarter of a century, have done valuable work and made important contributions in behalf of the Good Templar lodges in Chicago and Illinois, we give you Mr. J. E. Odell, the subject of this week's foreground article. At the present time, he is the delegate of the Illinois Scandinavian Grand Lodge of the Order's Grand Lodge of the World.</p>
   <p>Mr. Odell arrived in Chicago from Sweden on April 1, 1893, and joined the Jupiter Lodge No. 3, of the Independent Order of Good Templars, in May of the same year. He has been a member of that Lodge ever since, and during all those years has held practically every office it has to offer. Most of the time he has been secretary and lodge templar. For about twenty-five years he has been a member of the Swedish Good Templars' Sickness and Burial Association, and for a number of years he served as its president.</p>
   <p>The brief outline given above does not by any means do justice to Mr. Odell's activities as a Good Templar. To do so would require more space than we have at our disposal for this foreground article, and the story should be told by one of his lodge brothers, preferably one who has been associated with him in the lodge for a number of years. Suffice it to say that he is always ready to "go the limit" for his lodge, and his lodge brothers look to him for leadership. They are getting it, and that is why he ranks so high in their esteem.</p>
   <p>Odell also belongs to Ivar Lodge of the Independent Order of Vikings, Harmoni Lodge, V. O. A., and the Thor Society.</p>
   <p>Odell was born in Karlstorp parish, in the district of Kalmar, and was twenty-seven years old when he came to America. He first became a Good Templar in Sweden where he belonged to the Union Lodge. Soon after his arrival here he went into partnership with his brother who was operating a shoe store. Odell married Gerda Victoria Lindberg seven years ago, and their home is at 1666 Edgewater Avenue.</p>
