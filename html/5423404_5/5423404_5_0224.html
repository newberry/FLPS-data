   <p>The Swedish National Male Chorus 'De Svenske has visited Chicago on its "Tour Triumph" from coast to coast in America. While in Chicago, "De Svenske" gave two concerts, the first and principle one at the Auditorium on June 5, and the second one at the Midway Masonic Temple on the South Side on June 7th. At both concerts there was an overflow crowd and it has been received by the chorus directors to arrange for a third concert on a stop-over on the way back to New York around July 1st. The chorus is conducted by Doctor Musici Emil Carelius from Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
   <p>The eminent Chicago music critic, Dr. Glen Dillard Gunn, wrote the following ercerpt to his article about "De Svenske's" concert for his paper: "Singing Vikings" they call themselves, though otherwise known as the National Chorus of Sweden; and they proved their right to represent not only their country but their art in competition with any male choir that has visited us or that we call our own."</p>
