   <p>Our compatriot Gustaf Thalberg, the Norwegian Student Singers' impressario, arrived the other day from a flying trip out Northwest. His expectations as to the success of the Norwegian University Chorus' concert tour are high, in fact he believes that the tour will be a triumphal progression. Everywhere the proposed visit by the singers was spoken of in notes of enthusiasm, and it is probable that the reception of the Norwegian singers will be brilliant in every way. The singers are expected in New York on May 14; they will give a concert in Carnegie Hall on May 18, and will leave for Chicago on May 19, where they are to arrive on May 20. Sunday afternoon, they will be taken by automobile through Chicago's parks and boulevards, <span class="page-break">\2</span>after which a luncheon will be served for the singers at the Bismarck Garden. On Sunday evening the great concert will take place in the Auditorium, and it is expected that the audience there will be very large. Not long ago, we were visited by the singers from Lund University, Sweden, and now we will have the opportunity of listening to singing by the Norwegian students in the same place, and thereby we will be able to make comparisons. In passing we may say that the visit of the Norwegian students is anticipated in Chicago as eagerly as was that of the students from Lund University. On Monday evening, May 22, a grand banquet will be given at the Sherman House for the singers, who on Tuesday will continue on their trip through the Northwest. We wish to mention that at the concert in the Auditorium, the price of tickets will be $1.50, $1.00, $.75, $50.</p>
