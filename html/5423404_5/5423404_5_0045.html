   <p>The rising tide of immigration is considered by many a direct consequence of the devastations of war in Europe. One can readily imagine that many immigrants want to start life anew in a land which was affected comparatively little by the war, and is far removed from the scenes of tragedy in the Old World.</p>
   <p>However, this theory does not explain why so many come into this country from Canada and Mexico, as well as from Spain, Holland, Sweden, the West Indies, Denmark, Japan, South America, and Switzerland. Last year, 450,000 immigrants from these countries landed in the United States.</p>
   <p>Italy headed the list with 95,145, Canada came second with 90,025, and Mexico third with 52,361. About one half of the immigrants come from the Western Hemisphere and from those countries that were neutral during the war. Most of the latter went through a period of war prosperity.</p>

   <p>It is clear that the great majority of immigrants do not come here to escape the ravages of war. They do not come in order to escape persecution in their homeland, or because of the frontier changes in Europe. They come for the same reasons for which immigrants have always come here. These reasons are either a desire to see the world and a craving for adventure, or, last but not least, the conviction that in the United States they can better themselves economically and live under altogether better conditions than they could ever hope to attain in their homeland.</p>
