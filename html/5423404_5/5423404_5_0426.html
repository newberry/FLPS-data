   <p>Dr. Joseph Sandahl, who was a well-known physician here in Chicago for many years, died last Monday after an illness of two weeks.</p>
   <p>He was a remarkable man, whose career was a striking demonstration of what a man, equipped with energy and inherent ability, may accomplish, even though his chances, to start with, are not very promising. The most notable feature in the life of this son of Sweden was not the fact that he was a mature man before he chose his real lifework, and acquired the necessary education, but rather that he succeeded in obtaining his professional training and at the same time provided for a large family. It was necessary for him to study at night, when other people are sound asleep. But Sandahl had within him the <span class="page-break">\2</span>strength of the old Dalecarlians; he made his way in spite of difficulties, and graduated from medical school in 1906, exactly on the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of his father. Since then, and up to the time of his death, he was a practicing physician here.</p>
   <p>Dr. Sandahl was a native of Dalarne (Dalecarlia), Sweden, and was born February 13, 1858. He was seventy-one years old at the time of his death. On his father's side the family, originally, came from Vastergotlan, and among his forefathers there were many clergymen. His father, Lars Sandahl, was for many years engaged in the service of the Evangelical Fatherland Foundation in Sweden, and, due to his unusual ability, was often invited to preach from the pulpit of state churches [Translator's note: The Church of Sweden is a state church and, ordinarily, only graduates in theology of one of the state universities or other recognized institutions are permitted to preach from its pulpit. Only in exceptional cases are laymen preachers <span class="page-break">\3</span>allowed to do so.] Some of Dr. Sandahl's brothers also served in the abovementioned Foundation.</p>
   <p>Sandahl was married twice. His first wife, who was Emelia Dretman before her marriage, was the mother of one son; she died some forty years ago. He later married Maria C. Anderson, and she and four children survive.</p>
   <p>Two of the children are doctors, namely, a son, Abel P. M. Sandahl, and a daughter, Mrs. Ruth Edwards, who is married to Dr. Gustav Edwards, the director of the Bible Institute and Academy of the Swedish Free Church of America.</p>
