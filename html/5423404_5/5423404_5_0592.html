   <p>Our countryman, Edwin A. Olson, has just been elected president of the Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company. He was formerly vice-president and head of the legal department. He succeeds N. A. Nelson, who is now chairman of the Board.</p>
   <p>Mr. Olson is so well known among Swedish-Americans that an introduction is really unnecessary. But for the benefit of those who may not know him, let it be said that he has been associated with this company since it was established, and that he is known as an exceptionally able businessman and jurist.</p>
   <p>He was born in McHenry County, and his father, Charles Olson, of Andover, died only a few years ago. His mother, Christina Hanson Olson, was one of the first members of the Bishop Hill colony. He is married, and lives at 3030 Sheridan Road.</p>
   <p>The Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company does business in the East as well as in the West and is licensed in fourteen States. Last year, its earnings were more than three million dollars.</p>
