   <p>The well-known Swedish architect and Good Templar, Sven Linderoth, died last Saturday in his home, 1432 Marquette Road. He is mourned by his wife, nee Johnson, one son, and three daughters.</p>
   <p>Linderoth was born in Skane, October 14, 1859. When he was a year and a half old, his parents moved to Eskilstuna, and in that city he received his early education.

Only three years after his arrival in this country, he was elected a member of the Illinois department of the American Institute of Architects.</p>
   <p>In 1891 he went through a serious illness which for a long time caused a cessation of his activities. Later he devoted himself to the production of various building materials, which up to that time had been imported, and, therefore, were quite expensive. After some time, he succeeded in developing a type of glazed stone which was just as good as that imported from England and much cheaper. The manufacturing of this product took up most of his time for a few years, and the demand for it increased steadily all over the country.</p>
   <p>In conjunction with this factory, he opened up a school for people who wanted</p>
