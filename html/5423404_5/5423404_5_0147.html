   <p>Editorial: The Swedish Tribune is issuing a strong warning in one of its editorials today against further immigration at present to America. The paper can't understand why the immigration still continues when America is still going through such a hard financial crisis as at present. An immigrant can in these times very easily become a "pauper" and go to the poorhouse.</p>
   <p>Immigrants will be sent back home if they arrive here with a working contract. If they do not have such a contract, which can give them a living, they will be sunk as soon as the money they brought with them is gone. Then they add to the great army of beggars, who were here before and whose support already exceeds the strength of the public and private charity organizations.</p>
   <p>One cannot blame the local authorities who are against such an increase of poor immigrants for sending them back home to their own country.</p>
