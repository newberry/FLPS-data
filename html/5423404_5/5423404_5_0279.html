   <p>The State authorities in Sweden do not seem to favor a proposed loan from the Swedish government to help finance the proposed new Swedish-American line, according to Swedish newspapers, recently received here from Sweden. The authorities seem to be of the opinion that the proposed enterprise rests on uncertain economical ground, therefore, they cannot support the application for a loan from the government.</p>
   <p>We regret very much that the opposition in Sweden officially is against the planned line, but our opinion voiced sometime ago in this paper concerning this business seems to be justified. We said that there must be some guarantee from the Swedish government assuring us of a sound economic foundation for this Swedish-American Line before we, in the United States would be willing to sign for shares in this new enterprise.</p>

   <p>It seems to us that the Swedish authorities are afraid to give their financial support because it would encourage the emigration. But this fear is not justified. The emigration from Sweden to America was much larger twenty years ago than it is now. The Swedish people will not emigrate now. Why? Because the conditions in America are not inviting just now. The conjunctures in the home country compared with those in the foreign country, which regulate the emigration nowadays, are not so good. A direct Swedish connection would, of course, be more convenient for the Swedish emigrants. But nothing should hinder the continuance of the business here just started to try to enroll interested countrymen as stockholders in the new line.</p>
   <p>The question now is: Will the Swedes, like the Danes, and the Norwegians, really provide a direct Swedish steamship line to America? In such a case,they can count on a certain participation from us here in the United States. But it cannot be expected that the Swedish-Americans show confidence and make sacrifices in a Swedish enterprise, if the Swedish government will not support it.</p>
