   <p>The representative of the Swedish-American Line in the United States, Mr. Henry Skantze, with temporary headquarters at the Royal Swedish Consulate, 108 South La Salle Street, Chicago, left yesterday to visit several places in the States of Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota, for the purpose of acquainting the public with the intended steamship line, and to invite them to sign up for shares in the new steamship company. Mr. Skantze will then proceed West and visit several places there. The public seems to be very much interested in the matter, wherever Mr. Skantze has made known his purposes to them.</p>
