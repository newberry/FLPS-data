   <p>P.S.Peterson, founder and owner of Rose Hill Nursery, Chicago, who always has been interested in the Swedes, both in America and"the old country", has been decorated by King Oscar with The Royal Order of Vasa. Peterson has bought some of the American furniture models and tools, which were exhibited at the World's Fair, and sent them home to Sweden. He wanted to give the Swedish mechanics and workers the opportunity to study the latest American inventions in these matters. This generous gift has now arrived at Stockholm and will be exhibited in one of the rooms in the Industrial Palace. The exhibition will be available to the public on January 16th.</p>
