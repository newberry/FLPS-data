   <p>Alderman Luther P. Fristedt of Ward 13 presented his resignation last week at the meeting of the City council. As reason for his action, he stated that his private affairs are claiming his time so completely that he cannot spare sufficient time and energy to take care of his duties properly as alderman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fristedt was elected to his position in Ward 13 three years ago, and during the period elapsed, has filled his position to the fullest satisfaction of his constituents, while at the same time the welfare of the city has been his constant objective. His record as alderman is without blemish.</p>
