   <p>The honor of being the first Swedish born person to be elected to Congress as a representative of an Illinois district fell to Fredrick J. Lundin. It was for this reason and distinction that a hundred or more friends arranged a banquet in his honor last Thursday. The banquet was held in the Swedish Glee Club rooms where sincere well wishes and good luck were given him. Alexander Johnson, of the Swedish Kuriren, was master of ceremonies. He is one of the honored guest's best friends, and it is doubtful if one more capable could have been secured. Among the speakers were city engineer John Ericson; jurist G. Bernhard Anderson; county commissioner C. R. Chindblioom; C. H. Crantz, Mr. Mc Kenna, and deputy sheriff Peters. All spoke concerning the honored guest, and the important office of trust which he must fill. Between speeches, the quartette of the Glee Club rendered several selections.</p>
   <p>Finally, the master of cermonies in a short talk, presented the honored guest with a silver plaque on which was the inscription: "Fredrick J. Lundin, the first Illinois Swede to be elected to Congress." Lundin gave a short speech of thanks for the remembrance.</p>
