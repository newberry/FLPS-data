   <p>Lagercrantz with Consul Lindgren made a visit to the mayor in the City Hall. The daily newspapers printed stories to the effect that it was miraculous that the city's highest workman should meet the Swedish diplomat with a silk office coat. That Mayor Busse was pleased at having the guests is needless to mention. Although the visit was of short duration, eighteen minutes to be exact.</p>
   <p>On Thursday he went to South Chicago with the Counselor. There Mr. Ringman had engaged an automobile for the use of the celebrated guest. Here Mr. Lagercrantz expressed his appreciation of being in "Little Sweden" which is the popular name for this Eastern part of the city. He explained that the Swedish people between 100th and 102nd Streets lived in much better circumstances then their relatives in the homeland.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lagercrantz owns a factory of considerable size, employing more than 4,000 men, so we can understand his interest comes direct from the heart. Friday he visited the noted painter Charles E. Hallberg in the Art Institute, and spoke very highly of this artist.</p>
