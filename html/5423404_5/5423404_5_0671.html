   <p>The Banquet for Charles Bostrom was arranged last Saturday at the Swedish Club in order to give the many friends of Mr. Bostrom a chance to express their satisfaction at his appointment as Building Commissioner for Chicago. More than 250 people gathered in the nicely decorated hall. Mayor Thompson and former Congresman Lundin were special guests. A well arranged program was presented creating increased enthusiasm as the evening wore on. It was clear that our mayor had gained in popularity among the Swedes since the time of his election.</p>
