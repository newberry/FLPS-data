   <p>Today we will present a young surveyor who doesn't make much noise about himself but who, nevertheless, has reached the top in his profession.</p>
   <p>Mr. Norlin was born in Sodermanland, Sweden, March 4, 1865. After receiving his education in Sweden, he came to Chicago in 1881, where he began as a common laborer. After some time he got a position with Greeley Carlson and Company, one of the larger surveying firms in Chicago. So well did he do his job that he remained with the firm for more than eight years. Mr. Norlin helped in the plans of the town of Pullman and many other places. In 1894 he went into business for himself, opening his own office at 711 Chicago Opera House Block.</p>
