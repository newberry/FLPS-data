   <p>The November 18th issue of the Saturday Evening Post contains an interesting proposal regarding the regulation of immigration, accompanied by editorial comment. The plan was originated by Roy L. Garis, of Vanderbilt University, and the Post finds it so advantageous and practical that it expresses surprise that nobody had thought of submitting it to the Congress a long time ago.</p>
   <p>Briefly, the purpose of the proposal is to bring about an increase in the more desirable immigrant stock, and a decrease in the less adaptable--and therefore less desirable--stock. It is based on the observation that, during the period 1870-1910, the relative proportion of nationalities in the total number of immigrants which entered this country underwent significant changes. What may be termed the "old type immigration" changed into a new type, entirely different in its composition. During the first ten years of this forty-year period, <span class="page-break">2</span>two million people came to this country from Western Europe, while somewhat less than two hundred thousand came from the Southern and Eastern parts of that continent. Three decades later, that is to say from 1901 to 1910, the number of immigrants coming from Western Europe remained about the same, while immigration from the countries to the South and South east had increased thirtyfold, or to about six million. It was this influx of foreign races at the turn of the century which made America aware of the fact that it really had an immigration problem on its hands, and one which could not readily be solved by the melting pot method, which hitherto had sufficed.</p>
   <p>The three-per-cent law has been valuable as a temporary measure, but even its stanchest supporters admit that it is not scientific, and does not take into account the quality of the immigrant stock. Even before the bill was passed, it was realized that a considerable number of those who would be admitted to the country according to its provisions were people that America did not really want or need, and that they, in all probability, would become a detriment to the country rather than an asset.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In order to bring about a change in the proportion of immigrants from the various countries, Garis recommends that the three-per-cent law be raised on the basis of census of 1890, instead of the one of 1910. In 1890, the population of this country was fairly homogeneous, and the majority of the immigrants who arrived here come of a stock that assimilated readily, the kind of stock from which the American nation originated, and which played the all-important role in the development of the country during the past hundred years. If this condition were maintained, we would have the same type of people here one hundred years from now that we had thirty years ago, and there could be no justified opposition to such a procedure.</p>
   <p>In its editorial comment, the Saturday Evening Post ranks the Scandinavians among the most desirable immigrants declaring that "such a law would be based on fairness and consideration to all concerned, and would, in addition, signify a deserved tribute to those past generations of immigrants to which this country is so greatly indebted. It would express our appreciation of the excellent qualities of the Scandinavian peoples, who have contributed so much <span class="page-break">4</span>to the development of the Northwest; of the Germans of the Carl Schurz type, of whom we received so many in the years preceding the Civil War; of the Scotch and Irish who, perhaps to a higher degree than anybody else, take to Americanism as a duck takes to water, and of certain other nationalities which have contributed markedly to sound national progress".</p>
