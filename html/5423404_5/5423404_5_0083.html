   <p>The Swedish author, P. G. Norberg, visited America last year, and upon his return to the homeland gave a lecture on the topic: "The Swedish-Americans and Our Relations with Them," in which he gave some good advice to those Swedes at home who are always criticizing America and the American way of life.</p>
   <p>Among other things he told about his visit to New Sweden, the oldest Swedish colony in America, and to some smaller communities of religious countrymen who had crossed the ocean, hoping to materialize their conception of "heaven on earth". In this lecture he made statements which were very much to the point and with which we are in complete accord.</p>

   <p>After having pointed out that Sweden has contributed substantially to the development of this young country--the Swedish-American population now amounts to some two million people--he goes on to say:</p>
   <p>"We are actually participating in the most gigantic undertaking the world has ever seen, and it behooves us to take a sincere interest in the magnificent struggle which is going on,on that continent, and watch it closely so that we may be prepared to benefit from the result. We are inclined to consider emigration an unmitigated evil, a punishment for our sins. This is entirely wrong. The only evil is that we are wasting our own man power.</p>
   <p>"For those who are out there it must be highly satisfying to point to their accomplishments and say:'We have done all this within one generation.'</p>
   <p>"What would we answer, if they asked us: 'Would it have been possible for us to do anything like this at home?' It is quite possible that conditions <span class="page-break">\3</span>in the United States may become less attractive in the future than they are now, but then the stream of immigration may turn to Canada.</p>
   <p>"It should be evident that the most effective inducement for our people to stay home is to make conditions here in Sweden so attractive that they would sooner live here than in any other country."</p>
   <p>The speaker told of the affection which the Swedish-Americans have for the old country, and how they cling to its culture and traditions; how they name their organizations "Oden," "Balder," "Svithiod," "Scandia," etc.; such names as these, and such expressions as "Mother Svea" have become empty phrases at home, while to the emigrated Swede they are almost sacred. At the same time that he is a good American, his Swedish inheritance has a secure place in his heart.</p>
   <p>Mr. Norberg declared that many Swedish authors have given superficial and misleading accounts of American conditions, based on short visits to the <span class="page-break">\4</span>country, and he expressed the hope that, in the future misunderstanding and ill feelings will be replaced with mutual respect and friendliness.</p>
   <p>He expressed the opinion that the desire for economic betterment is the chief reason why people leave their own country. He remarked, "The energetic and able Swedish-American owns his roomy, comfortable home, and has better things to eat than the eternal herring, soup, and potatoes.</p>
   <p>"He believes Sweden's sons and daughters would prefer to remain at home if better economic opportunities were provided for them there. He does not think that a mass return of emigrated Swedes will ever take place, but he does consider it quite likely that a great many Swedish-Americans would be interested in investing money in Swedish business and industrial undertakings if attractive propositions were offered.</p>
   <p>We admire the courage demonstrated by Mr. Norberg in thus siding with us <span class="page-break">\5</span>Swedish-Americans, and at the same time calling attention to certain imperfections at home. Let us hope that his manly and true words will bear fruit.</p>
