   <p>The United States Envoy in Stockholm, Mr. Ira Nelson Morris arrived here Saturday on a week's visit to his former home. Two weeks ago, he arrived from abroad, and has been in Washington, D. C. in conference with President Wilson, and others on diplomatic affairs.</p>
   <p>Sunday he delivered a speech in Orchestra Hall in connection with the great Swedish Loyalty Demonstration. Wednesday, he spoke in behalf of the Liberty Loan at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. McAdoo.</p>

   <p>Shortly after his arrival here, as soon as he was settled at the Blackstone Hotel, he was interviewed regarding the War, and conditions in Sweden. He said: "President Wilson's reply to the German Peace-proposal was a masterpiece of statemanship. It throws the question back to the Kaiser, and forces him to disclose his real motives. What appears to me to be the most important point now is to discover the real conditions in Germany, so the Allied Nations will know the stand the German people take to their Kaiser and government. Up to the present, it has not been possible to learn anything regarding the inner conditions in Germany. But this we must know before we go any further, and this is what the President now is seeking.</p>
   <p>We have heard a great deal about the lack of foods in Germany, and that the population is starving. We have also heard that economic conditions <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>would force peace upon Germany, but this is not so, at least, not according to my way of thinking.</p>
   <p>Economic conditions in Germany are not so bad as some are inclined to believe, and shortage of food does not stop the War. No doubt, Germany lacks certain essential foods, but this lack is not great enough in itself to end the War. It helps, of course. Everything we do helps. It is the united attack on Germany, which will decide the outcome of the War. The food blockade, war offensives, propaganda for democracy, and the gradual awakening in Germany to the fact that they are doomed to an inglorious defeat, all of these factors will help to win the War. No single factor can do it alone.</p>
   <p>Sweden is very friendly to America. Yes, I can say Sweden is 100 per cent neutral, particularly so, since we traded foodstuff and raw materials in return for 400,000 tons of freight room on Swedish "bottoms."</p>

   <p>The fundamental equality in this agreement has created much good-will in Sweden, and has shown good effects."</p>
