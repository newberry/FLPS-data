   <p>Dr. John A. Enander, editor of the Swedish newspaper Hemlandet, was last night decorated with the Swedish order "Litteris Et Artibus", which has been bestowed upon him by King Oscar of Sweden. The decoration was presented by Dr. L. G. Abrahamson, who had been designated by the king to bestow the emblem.</p>
   <p>Seventy-five members of the Swedish Business Men's Club assembled in the club-rooms, 171 Washington Street, to witness the presentation of the king's decoration.</p>
   <p>This informal gathering was presided over by Dr. M. Wahlstrom. After refreshments had been served the order was presented to Dr. Enander by Rev. L.G. Abrahamson, who delivered it in a brief but felicitous speech in the Swedish tongue. In receiving the decoration Dr. Enander spoke feelingly of his love for the land of his birth and his patriotic endeavor in the land of his adoption.</p>
   
   <p>Following the deliverance of the emblem short addresses were made by the following: Attorney Edwin A. Olson, "The President"; Attorney C. R. Chindbum, Governor Deneen"; Robert Lindbloom, "Chicago". Dr. Jacob Bonggrant, editor of the Swedish-American, read an original poem a propos of the occasion.</p>
   <p>The decoration received by Dr. Enander, who for thirty-five years has edited Hem landet, the oldest Swedish newspaper in America, is of heavy Roman gold.</p>
   <p>The medal is suspended by a blue ribbon and on the obverse side is the head of King Oscar in relief and on the reverse side the inscription, "Litteris Et Artibus" (literature and art), surrounded with the customary laurel crown.</p>
