   <p>Under the heading "Swedish Immigrants" we read in the Chicago Chronicle:</p>
   <p>"Swedish immigration to America is likely to decrease from now on rather than increase. The Swedish Government is taking measures to make it more and more desirable for potential emigrants to remain in that country.</p>
   <p>"The latest step in that direction is the passing of a homestead law which authorizes the establishment of a fund of ten million crowns, from which agricultural and industrial workers may borrow money at 3.6 per cent interest, to buy parcels of land. Every honest and industrious Swedish worker is entitled to borrow from this fund. It is a sound business proposition for the Government, and a fine opportunity for the many ambitious but poor workers who for years have been toiling for others for an insufficient remuneration.</p>
   <p>"In this case Sweden's gain is America's loss. The Swedes are counted <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>among our best immigrants, and they have particularly been a great boon to the Middle West and Northwest where so many of these strong, sober, and energetic people have settled. On our farms and in our factories they have proven their ability; in the fine arts, particularly in the realm of music, they have made outstanding contributions, and the future promises even more.</p>
   <p>"Sweden is to be congratulated on this promising start toward the solution of the very vital problem of providing for the underprivileged part of her population. America however, still has a hearty welcome to offer those Swedes who might still find opportunities somewhat limited in their homeland."</p>
   <p>We are glad to reprint the Chronicle's article, because it is so seldom we find such appreciation of our nationals expressed in an American newspaper.</p>
   <p>We realize fully that a considerable decline in emigration from Sweden will <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>be a serious blow to the Swedish-American press, indeed, it may amount to a "knockout" blow. The proposal for a ten million crown fund for aiding Swedish workers in purchasing land, which the Chronicle mentions, has not yet become law; it is still in the hands of a committee. But from the bottom of our hearts we wish that the final vote will decide in its favor. Mother Svea (Sweden) needs her sons more than Columbia does. They have rested on her bosom; they have been protected and loved by her with a greater love than Columbia, as a foster mother, has to offer. If they now are given an opportunity to own their cottage and plot of land, that motherly love shall be amply rewarded by the sons with deep and unlimited affection.</p>
