   <p>The Swedish Tourist Association is now trying to extend its activities to America. Its program in this country is similar to that which is being followed in Sweden, and consists of lectures, the showing of motion pictures, social get-togethers, etc. Swedish-American men and women are invited to join. Members receive free of charge the Association's beautiful and interesting yearbook, as well as pamphlets and other literature pertaining to its work. The annual membership fee is $2.25, and those who wish to join should write to Eric Scanze, 10907 Edbrooke Avenue, Chicago.</p>
   <p>This organization deserves the support of every Swedish-American.</p>
