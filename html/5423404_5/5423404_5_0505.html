   <p>We human beings learn from each other. People influence one another whether for good or for evil. And this holds true also of nations. Europeans have learned much from America, and will continue to learn. And we in this country receive ideas from the other side of the ocean. To be sure it may truly be said that we would be better off without some of the ideas we have been receiving of late; but it must be admitted that we can still learn a few things from the Old World. One of them is the practice, which is especially prevalent in our Swedish fatherland, of building colonies of workers' homes near industrial centers. In this country the Swedes have earned a reputation as builders, especially in and near large cities--like Chicago, where entire districts have been built up by Swedes.</p>
   
   <p>When the Western Electric Company here decided a few years ago to launch a large building program for the construction of homes for its employees--something similar to the Swedish workers' homes colonies, but on a larger scale than anything seen in that country--it was only logical that a Swede should be selected to play the most important role in the planning and execution of the project. The man chosen was Carl A. Carlson, the present head of the large building and real-estate firm which bears his name.</p>
   <p>Before we present a few biographical data on Mr. Carlson, we will tell our readers how he got his start in the building business. The following is an excerpt from an article on his career which appeared in an American trade journal.</p>
   <p>"Carl A. Carlson, who now leads a large organization which during the last ten years has broken all building records in Chicago, was an ordinary carpenter fifteen years ago. He came here from the East, alone and without any friends. Soon after his arrival, he went to work for a contractor who was just then putting up a house on the southwest side. However, before the house was completed the contractor gave up the struggle, and not only did Carlson lose his job, but he was also in danger of losing three hundred dollars which he had coming in wages. He did not accept defeat, however, but went to the man for whom the house was being built, and who had financed the contractor, and offered to complete the job on terms profitable to both of them. The man accepted his offer, and within a couple of months the building was ready for occupancy. It so happened that the owner was a man of importance in the business world, and he liked the manner in which Carlson handled the matter. He knew intimately some of the executives of the Western Electric Company, which was at that time making plans for building a large number of homes for employees on its extensive land holdings in Hawthorne. He introduced Carlson, who was subsequently put in charge of the project."</p>
   
   <p>The trade journal goes on to describe the rapid expansion of Carlson's building activities during the succeeding years. Our countryman has erected literally thousands of houses in the Cicero district, and transformed what was formerly wild prairie into block after block of modern, attractive homes. They are built to suit the needs and the pocketbooks of those who are to occupy them. Lately, Carlson has extended his activities to Berwyn and other suburbs, where last year he built between five and six hundred houses. Such large-scale building makes it possible for him to buy materials in large quantities, which in turn helps to keep his construction costs down.</p>
   <p>Carlson was born in Krogsered parish, Halland, Sweden, and came to this country at the age of sixteen. His mother, Mrs. Anna Carlson, who is now seventy-five years old, is a well-known member of Swedish societies, and has been very active in behalf of the Swedish sanitarium for consumptives in Denver, Colorado. Carlson also belongs to several organizations, and is a Free Mason and an Odd Fellow.</p>
