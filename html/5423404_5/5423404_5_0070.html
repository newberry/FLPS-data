   <p>In last week's issue of this newspaper we commented on the present exodus of workers from Sweden, a phenomenon which is also occupying the front pages at home and causing the authorities much worry. The National Society Against Emigration, which was organized some time ago, is now holding the spotlight and is being subjected to a regular bombardment of recommendations and advice. We quote from one newspaper:</p>
   <p>"The Society should encourage emigrated Swedes to return to the homeland. There are undoubtedly thousands of our nationals in America whose dearest wish is to go back to the old country; but many are ashamed to return with empty hands, and others do not possess even the price of a ticket. These people are doomed to an existence of toil and unhappiness in a strange land where the guiding principle seems to be: Everybody for himself and the devil take the hindmost. An effort should be made to get them home, even if we have to pay their fare and provide attractive living conditions for them. They <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>have been through the mill over there, and have not been pampered and spoiled as have our workers here in Sweden, who have not seen or learned much, and do not know what real hardship is. But they have been told that capital is labor's worst enemy, and they work according to the principle of doing as little as possible for the highest possible pay. To them, of course, Sweden is the cheapest and most miserable country in the world. We believe the returning Swedish-Americans would actually become missionaries for peace on the labor front and would oppose emigration."</p>
   <p>Another publication suggests that homes be provided only for those Swedish-Americans who have families, and a third one recommends that the Society should "by all means stop the shameless solicitation of funds for this or that purpose among our countrymen in the United States. No matter how willing they may be to make contributions, it finally becomes annoying and tiresome, and is bound to give the impression that Sweden is entirely destitute. The practice certainly does not act as an inducement for them to return home."</p>

   <p>We are printing these excerpts from the Swedish daily press, knowing that our readers are intelligent enough to draw their own conclusions. We see nothing in them that is likely to produce any enthusiasm for the mass return of Swedish-Americans which is now being advocated from certain quarters in the Old Country. The steady expansion of the employers' power at the expense of the producing classes will finally result in an unlimited domination by corporations and capitalists, and such a development will make anybody think twice before falling for high-sounding promises, which by the way, have been rather hazy so far.</p>
   <p>With a dictatorship of employers, what are the future prospects of Sweden? The question is easily answered. Those that have any sense, and are able to do so, will get out. The country itself and those that remain there are facing ruin.</p>
