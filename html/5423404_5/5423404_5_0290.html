   <p>A royal proposal has been sent to the Swedish Parliament, now assembled for its regular session in Stockholm, requesting the establishment of a salaried Swedish Consulate in Chicago and also that a sum of 23,500 Swedish kroner be allotted to the Secretary of the Foreign Department for that purpose.</p>
   <p>The Secretary, in a statement to the Parliament in regard to the necessity of establishing such a Consulate in Chicago, says that it is intended to be of great service both for the interests of business and also for the large Swedish population in Chicago. But the sum requested, reduced to dollars and cents, would only give the consul $5,000 a year, which is too meager for a man who also has the duty of representing the Swedish Government and the Swedish people at many occasions in such a great city as Chicago and, therefore, a little more than $900 for expenses is insufficient. The consul will, no doubt, also need a secretary and a stenographer.</p>

   <p>However, the question now is, if it is really absolutely necessary to establish such a consulate in Chicago and if a man from Sweden should be sent to occupy such a position? It would take a long time before he could become familiar with the conditions and circumstances here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The present Swedish consul Henry S. Henschen is a very successful representative of Sweden, its government, and its people here. He is very popular, interested in everything concerning the Swedes, and is doing everything in his power to serve them in every possible way. It is, therefore, unbelievable that the Swedish Government would intentionally rob itself of his faithful and successful service. The Swedish consul in New York has recommended that the royal proposal be accepted.</p>
