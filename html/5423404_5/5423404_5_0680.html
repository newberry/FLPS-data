   <p>John Richard Lindgren, one of the most noted Swedish-Americans in Chicago, former banker and Swedish vice-consul here, died April 29 in his home at 1144 Ashbury Street, Evanston, after an illness that lasted for almost five years.</p>
   <p>Lindgren was born in Chicago, February 20, 1855, a son of the sailor captain Charles Magnus Lindgren, who was one of the first Swedes here and a leader among his countrymen. It was decided early to prepare the boy for a business career. After having graduated from high school he began work as an insurance agent. At the age of twenty-four he went into the banking business with Helge Haugan, under the firm name of Haugan and Lindgren. The firm was successful from the very beginning, and within a few years the bank was <span class="page-break">\2</span>known as one of the most efficient and dependable in the city. Its business increased steadily, and in 1890 its deposits amounted to about one million dollars. Shortly afterward it was incorporated under the name of State Bank of Chicago, which name it still has today.</p>
   <p>Lindgren was the treasurer of the bank for many years, and as such he won many friends and acquaintances among Chicago's Swedes, who had full confidence in him. Because of his prominence in business circles here the Swedish Government appointed him vice-consul in 1892, and as a token of appreciation of his services over a long period of years, King Oscar II of Sweden made him a Knight of the Order of Vasa. Even American institutions recognized his ability and began to utilize it. Thus Northwestern University made him a member of its board of trustees.</p>
   <p>When he was in his prime, Lindgren was a member of many organizations, such as the Evanston Musical Club, the Apollo Musical Club of Chicago, and the Swedish-American Historical Society; he took an active part in their activities. He belonged to the Methodist Church, and as one of the founders of Betania the Methodists' home for the aged, he always took a deep interest in the welfare of this institution.</p>

   <p>About five years ago his health began to fail, and he withdrew almost entirely from business and public life. In 1898 he married Miss Ethel May Roe of Chicago, and she and a ten-year-old daughter survive.</p>
