   <p>High tribute was paid to Mrs. Othelia Myhrman, well known among Chicago's Swedes for more than half a century, when she observed her seventieth birthday on the ninth day of this month. A festive banquet was given in her honor at the Drake Hotel, at which City Treasurer Charles S. Peterson acted as master of ceremonies. Among the speakers who paid homage to the guest of honor were Congressman Carl R. Chindblom, Assistant Corporation Counsel Gotthard A. Dahlberg, Clark of the Superior Court M. S. Szymczak, Attorney George F. Anderson, who at one time was president of the Swedish Club, and District Attorney George E. Q. Johnson.</p>
   <p>The musical entertainment was rendered by Stephanie Lendi, the pianist, the Swedish-American Ladies' Quartet and the Chicago Women's Symphony Orchestra. Late in the evening members of the Swedish Glee Club also appeared and offered their felicitations by singing some of their most beautiful numbers.</p>
   <p>The "American Daughters of Sweden," of which Mrs. Myhrman is president, presented her with a bouquet of seventy roses. During the evening she received about seventy congratulatory telegrams, of which one came form Sweden.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Myhrman is a native of Finspong, Sweden, and came to America as a girl. Since her arrival here she has been active in many fields, even in politics.
