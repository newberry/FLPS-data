   <p>One may well call Tuesday, December 30, "Swedish Women's Day" for on that date Swedish women of Chicago, met to greet a representative of the women of Sweden, pay her homage, and send their greetings to the homeland. The women of Chicago responded enthusiastically in honoring professor Jenny Velander, of Skara, who now, for a month, has been visiting our city, The reason naturally lies with the charming woman herself, and in her lovable personality, but it may even be found in the many interests she represents, and which always will bring women together from various walks of life. Professor Velander is not only an able representative of the Swedish educational system, but has given time and energy to all of the feminine questions of the day; the work of <span class="page-break">2</span>public enlightenment, the temperance movement, the peace question, the animal anti-cruelty cause, and naturally, the question of suffrage for women, which has now won its greatest battles. The credit for the success of the Chicago reception at the Swedish Club is due primarily to Mrs. Emmy Ewald, Mrs. C. M. Hedman, Mrs. Ed. Linn, Mrs. C. W. Nelson and Mrs. J. P. Friedlund.</p>
   <p>At the appointed hour, about 350 women gathered in the spacious rooms of the Swedish Club, filling the large festival hall to capacity. The program was opened by Mrs. Emmy Ewald who acted as mistress of ceremonies. She called on Frida Haff to pronounce the opening prayer. The guest of honor was then welcomed, in ringing Swedish,by Mrs. F. Nordquist.</p>
   <p>The majority of speakers used the English language. It was in reality, to use an expression of one of the last speakers, an accounting before <span class="page-break">3</span>Mother Svea's envoy for what her children have accomplished in the New World. Thirteen societies sent their representatives to the festival, and they all accounted for the origin, growth, aims, and work of their respective groups. It was with the greatest feeling of pride that one listened to reports of how the Swedish women have built orphanages; how they extend the helping hand to the sick, and aged, and even in the mission field carry out a magnificent program of relief. The following women spoke: Mrs. Ivar Holmstrom for the auxiliary of the Swedish Club; Mrs. N.E. Nelson, for the Swedish society Linnea; Mrs. Esborn for the Chicago Ladies Denver Sanatorium Aid Association; Mrs. J.P. Friedlund for the Ladies Guild of the Svithoid Singing Club; Mrs. Carl Warner for the Bethany Home; Mrs. John E. Ericson for the Immanual Women's Home Association; Mrs. Palmer for De Gamlas Augustana Hem (Old Folks' Augustana Home); Mrs. C.M. Hedman for the Woman's Life Member Club of the Swedish Old Peoples' Home; Frida Haff for the Fredrika Bremer Union; Mrs. Swanson for the Susanna Wesley Home; Mrs. J. Christenson for the Augustana Nursery; Hilma Samuelson for the Swedish <span class="page-break">4</span>Orphan Home of Joilet, Illinois; Mrs. T. Peterson for the Woman's Home and Foreign Missionary Society.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ewald, who is the energetic leader of this society, and the representative of 25,000 members, pointed out in her address that branches of this society supported the Missions Tidningen, (Mission Paper), and its aims. She reviewed the past several years recalling Swedish contributions to American life, and ended with the statement that the Swedes have always shown real Americanism. Even an American woman, the well-known leader in the feminine cause, Catherine Waugh Mc Cullough, gave a lively talk.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Mc Cullough stated that the reports given for Mrs. Velander, were a confirmation of her own deductions, from observation of the activities of the Swedish women. Mrs. Mc Cullough told how she has watched the <span class="page-break">5</span>Swedish-American women carry on in the traditions of the old land, and she commended the truth and clarity of the entire reports, declaring they had represented the best in Americanism, love of native country, loyalty, compassion, religion, respect for law, love of culture and progress. But she pointed out that there are great defects in a social system which makes it necessary for such great work to be carried on through private initiative. It is her hope that when the American women receive their full suffrage, this country will be reformed so that orphanages, homes for young women, and homes for old people, no longer will be dependent upon public charity, and that all social injustice will be abolished.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Velander gave a heartfelt address in reply, wherein, she likened all these works of love, and the women who had accomplished them to warm sunshine streaming against her and almost blinding her. She said she knew that the homage which had been shown her was in great measure bestowed upon her sisters in Sweden. She promised to carry the greetings of the <span class="page-break">6</span>Swedish-American women of Chicago back to the Homeland. She said that if she has accomplished anything it is because she has done her utmost for the solution of popular questions, the causes for which the women of America and the women of Sweden have been fighting. She expressed the desire that there will always be an intimate collaboration between the women of both countries.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ewald then presented a keepsake to Mrs. Velander. Mrs. Jennie E. Peterson sang and Mrs. Hatherius rendered a piano solo.</p>
   <p>After the luncheon, a number of the women gathered in the club rooms where Mrs. Velander spoke on the peace question. She described the efforts that had been made in Sweden, even after the outbreak of the War, to promote peace, and the tireless work which Sweden's friends of peace are now doing to build a new world through education and the <span class="page-break">7</span>teaching of new ideals among the younger generation, and the promotion of harmony, brotherly love, and reverence for human life.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Velander departed for St. Louis January 2, and will resume her journey westward later.</p>
