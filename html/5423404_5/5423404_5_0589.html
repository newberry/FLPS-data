   <p>As reported in last week's issue, Alfred B. Slattengren has been made secretary of the Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company, which has its headquarters at 30 North La Salle Street.</p>
   <p>Slattengren was born and reared in the North Star State, and, like so many other of her sons, received his higher education at the Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota. The exact place of his birth is Center City, and the date March 21, 1871. His father and mother were among the first Swedish settlers in that area. Young Alfred attended school in Center City. After having completed two years at the Gustavus Adolphus College, he transferred to the University of Valparaiso, Indiana, from which he <span class="page-break">\2</span>graduated.</p>
   <p>Before Slattengren became associated with the Mutual Trust Life Insurance Company he had been county auditor of Chicago County, Minnesota, for sixteen years. He resigned that position to become district manager of the insurance company's branches in Minnesota and in North and South Dakota, a position which he held until 1920, when he was appointed field supervisor, with headquarters in Chicago. In 1921, he became cashier, and his most recent promotion took place January 26 of this year when he was made secretary.</p>
   <p>Slattengren is a big, powerful fellow, the real viking type, and he has inherited the quiet intelligence and upright character of the people from the far North, who some fifty years ago began to immigrate to Minnesota and lay the foundations for a new life. Everything Swedish is dear to him.</p>
   <p>His wife was Amanda Jonason, a daughter of pioneers of Center City. They <span class="page-break">\3</span>have two sons and a daughter, and they live in Riverside, Illinois.</p>
