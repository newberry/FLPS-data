   <p>Editorial: John Richard Lindgren, the newly appointed Swedish-Norwegian Vice Consul in Chicago, is so very well known among our countrymen that he hardly needs any further introduction. But we would like to tell those of our readers, who are living outside of Chicago that Lindgren is the son of the late Captain C.M. Lindgren, was born in Chicago, February 20, 1855, has attended the High School here, and is a prominent banker.</p>
