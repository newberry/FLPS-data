   <p>A Swedish Sloyd instructor, Mrs. Anna Petterson-Berg, whose activities until recently have been confined to public schools, was last week invited to exhibit her skill and her products at the University of Chicago. The exhibit was arranged by Mrs. Petterson-Berg in Ida Noyes Hall, University of Chicago. Articles exhibited, chiefly needle-work and embroideries, attracted great attention and enthusiasm. In fact, the interest shown was of such proportions that Mrs. Petterson-Berg was requested to prolong the exhibit one more week, and remain at the University and indefinite period of time to instruct women teachers and co-eds in the noble art of needlework.</p>
