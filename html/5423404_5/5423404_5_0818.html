   <p>One of the most prominent Swedish men, not only in Chicago but in the United States, passed away yesterday morning, July 26. The Grim Reaper has claimed our countryman, Consul Charles J. Sundell. Heart failure was the cause of his death. He was seventy years old.</p>
   <p>Sundell was born in Stockholm, Sweden, June 1, 1822. As a young man he traveled widely in Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. Upon his return to Sweden he established himself in business, but the wanderlust had taken possession of him and in 1849 he emigrated to America. In 1850 we find him in San Francisco, where he tried his luck as a gold miner. But his desire for adventure drove him on. By the way of the Sandwich and Friendship Islands he arrived at Sydney, Australia, in 1851, and shortly afterwards at Port Melbourne, where he met success as a prospector for gold. A longing for home made him return to Sweden, however, and late in the year of 1852 he made his re-appearance in the city of his birth. But he was not destined to remain there. He decided to return to America, and in February of 1853 he arrived at Chicago.</p>
   <p>His first job in Chicago was with the Michigan Central Railway. A short time later he started a match factory, but failed, whereupon he entered into partnership with Anders Larson in the manufacture of soft beverages. In 1858 he was appointed Vice-Consul for Sweden and Norway. This position he held <span class="page-break">2</span>Severe losses in land speculations forced him out of business, however, and by and by Sundell secured the position as Recording Clerk at the Chicago post office. This marks the turning point in the public life of Sundell.</p>
   <p>By nature Sundell was endowed with an alert mind for civic and political matters. In 1856 he had worked hard for the election of Fremont for President, and in 1860 he worked zealously for the election of Abraham Lincoln. After the election of this great man, Sundell was honored with the appointment as American consul at Stettin, Prussia, and in July 1861 he took up his duties at this important port on the Baltic coast. This position he held all during the trying times of the Danish-Prussian War and our own Civil War; and the archives of the State Department in Washington, D.C. bear eloquent testimonial and witness to the fact of his brilliance and ability as a Statesman and Diplomat.</p>
   <p>But still greater honors were in store for Consul Sundell. In 1867 he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the American Embassy at Bucharest, Roumania; but this work was not to his liking, and later that year he resigned and returned to Chicago, where he remained ever since. Here he has been engaged in various fields of business, but his real prominence here has grown out of his position as the General Western Agent of the famous Allan Line. From this position he resigned only last year.</p>

   <p>For the Swedish descendants of Chicago and America, Consul Sundell has worked hard and unselfishly. His work has been that of a pioneer. As early as 1854 he organized the first Scandinavian Society of the Western States, It was called "Skandinaviska Unionen i Chicago". In 1857 he proposed and was one of the organizers of Society Svea. In 1858, just five years after his arrival here, he became a naturalized American citizen. He was a speaker of note, and very rarely was his name missing on any list of speakers at a Swedish affair of any consequence. When the question of honoring our great countryman, Carl von Linne was proposed, Sundell was one of the most enthusiastic spokesmen for the idea. He was elected the first vice-president of the Linne Monument Society and it is largely due to his untiring work that the plans came into full realization. In later years he was appointed to serve as a member of the Chicago Board of Education.</p>
   <p>He was a real gentleman, enriched by experiences usually denied common mortals, and his life's work spurs us on with inspiration.</p>
   <p>The deceased is mourned by his widow and three adult children, one son and two daughters. The son is a lawyer, and resides in Washington, D.C.</p>
