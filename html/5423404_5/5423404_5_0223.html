   <p>King Gustavus V of Sweden will celebrate his seventieth birthday on June 16, and at the same time observe the twentieth anniversary of his accession to the Swedish throne. Next Saturday the 16th has been declared a national holiday all over Sweden.</p>
   <p>The king's birthday present from his people will consist of a sum of money to be used toward the erection and maintenance of a hospital and research clinic for cancerous diseases, to be named, King Gustavus Institute for Cancerous Diseases.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, as well as elsewhere in America, subscriptions for this worthy purpose were started among the Swedish people some time ago. Although somewhat late in the opinion of many. However, up to the 4th of this month $12,124.37 was collected and this amount is expected to be more than doubled, as the great majority of Swedish lodges and societies have not yet been heard from.</p>
