   <p>Mr. Frans Albin Lindstrand, the owner and publisher of Svenska Amerikaneren, was appointed by Mayor Harrison last Monday to the position of member of the Public Library board to succeed Mr. Arthur Meeker. We are very happy to have the chance to congratulate Mr. Lindstrand, and we congratulate ourselves and our Swedish people in Chicago on the appointment of a capable and influential compatriot to a position where we hope he may be able to effect an increase in the amount of Swedish literature to be acquired by the library. The number of Swedish books in our Public Library is very small at present. As far as we know, Mr. Lindstrand is the first Swede to be appointed a member of this board.</p>
