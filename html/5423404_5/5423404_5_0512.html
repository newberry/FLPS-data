   <p>From time to time this department has presented biographical data on countrymen who as contractors and builders have contributed much to the rapid expansion of Chicago during the last few years. The subject of this week's Foreground article has also been selected from that group. We are presenting a man who has been in the building business here for almost twenty-eight years. His name is Charles T. Green.</p>
   <p>Green was born in Vireda parish, Smaland, Sweden, August 21, 1860, and attended grade school in his home district. Later, he studied under a private tutor for three years, and then in Jonkoping for two more years. In 1881 he decided to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>emigrate, and he came to Chicago in the spring of that year. During his first few years here, he engaged in various kinds of work, until in 1896 he formed the contracting firm of Green and Carlson with offices at 133 West Washington Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. Green's standing among his collagues is indicated by the fact that he has served as president of the Carpenter Contractor's Association of Chicago, and has also been on the Board of Directors of that organization. He is an old member of the Swedish Club, of which he was a director for several years. He is also a Free Mason and an Odd Fellow.</p>
   <p>In 1902 he married Signe Carlson, of Motala. They live at 855 Massasoit Avenue, in Austin.</p>
