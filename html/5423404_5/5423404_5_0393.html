   <p>The well-known Swedish attorney, Alfred A. Norton, died suddenly last Sunday in the home of his friend, A. C. Johnson, 634 Lincoln Avenue, Highland Park, where he has been making his home for the last few months. He was getting ready to go downtown to his office and had gone to the garage to get his car. He was found there some time later, a victim of monoxide poisoning.</p>
   <p>Norton was one of the most highly esteemed Swedish lawyers in Chicago. He was born September 4, 1862, in a farm home in Varmland, Sweden, and came to America at the age of seventeen. After living in Iron Mountain, Michigan, for about three years Norton moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he entered the state university, and received his bachelor's degree. Later he was graduated from the law school. He worked his way through the university, and one may be sure that he did not reach his goal without undergoing hardships and sacrifice.</p>
   <p>After graduation he went to Spokane, Washington, but moved to Chicago in 1902. This city has been his home since. He opened a law office and earned a fine reputation as a jurist. Besides his extensive law practice he has been active in and made notable contributions to other fields. For a number of years he was secretary of the John Ericsson League of Illinois, and he served as its president for one year. For many years he was attorney for the Swedish Home Building Association, and at the time of his death he was an assistant attorney general. He was a high Free Mason and also belonged to the Odd Fellow and the Svithiod orders.</p>
   <p>Norton never married, but leaves behind a large circle of friends who loved his fine personality and noble character, and who now mourn his death.</p>
