   <p>A citizen, who is a tribute and an honor to the Swedish name and nationality, is P.S. Peterson, owner and operator of the famous PETERSON NURSERIES, at Rose Hill. On several occasions he has shown that America, where he has made his great wealth -- reputedly he is a millionaire -- has not made him forget the land of his birth and the little place where once stood his cradle - near Kristianstad, in the province of Scania, Sweden. The latest proof of his deeprocted love for the old home-land memories was evidenced by him some time ago, when he made a gift to the Swedish Geological Museum of an unusually fine and beautiful specimen of a saw-split and polished trunk of a tree from the petrified forest of Arizona. Besides being of great scientific significance, this specimen possesses considerable material value, as it is conservatively estimated to be worth $1,800. The petrified wood, or stone, has proved a highly appreciated addition to the collections of the Swedish Museum. The petrifying process - the transformation of wood into stone - has been brought about by Nature so wonderfully that not only the rings in the tree but also the minute cells of the fibre can be clearly discerned in the stone.</p>
