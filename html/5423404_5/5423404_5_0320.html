   <p>To Varmland, the beautiful, the wonderful land, Charles Bostrom, the progressive building contractor went last Sunday evening. Only thirteen years have passed since he came to America, but during those few years he has won his way to become one of the best honored and most progressive builders in the city, and yet he is barely thirty-three years old. Mr. Bostrom needs rest and recreation, and this he expects to find in Varmland, Sweden.....Svenska Nyheter wishes him every success on his trip.</p>
