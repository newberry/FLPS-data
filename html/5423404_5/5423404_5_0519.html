   <p>Like many other Scandinavian organizations, the Scandinavian League has enjoyed a rapid growth during the last year, especially in the Illinois district. And we have selected one of its leading men, real-estate broker Frithiof Burgeson, as the subject of the week's Foreground article. He is at the present time president of the district lodge. Illinois, No. 6.</p>
   <p>Burgeson was born in Gothenburg, Sweden, September 15, 1885, and is thus still a young man. His father was Frans Oscar Borjeson, a captain in the Swedish merchant marine, who died about ten years ago. His mother is still living in Norrkoping.</p>
   <p>Young Burgeson went through the public schools of his home town, and then took <span class="page-break">\2</span>a course in bookkeeping, after which he obtained a job as a traveling salesman for a Norrkoping firm. He made a name for himself on this job as the youngest traveling salesman in the country, being only about fifteen years old. He remained on the job for three years, and then decided to go to America. He came to Chicago in the spring of 1903, and has lived here ever since.</p>
   <p>Shortly after his arrival in the city, he began to work for one of the Swedish newspapers here. Later, he became the local agent of the firm Puhl, Webb &amp; Company, where he remained for five years. He then became a local salesman for the great grocery firm of Sprague, Warner &amp; Company, where he remained for ten years. At the end of this time, he entered into a partnership with some friends and established the A &amp; B Wholesale Grocery Company. About one year ago, he sold his interest in this firm, and, together with a countryman, Gust Wahlquist, established the real-estate firm of Wahlquist &amp; Burgeson, with offices at 5215 North Clark Street.</p>

   <p>Burgeson joined the Scandinavian League thirteen years ago, and was among the first members of the Standard lodge, No. 65, the oldest League lodge in this district. He has served in various capacities within this organization. In 1915, he was made district president, and served as such for two terms, during which time he was instrumental in organizing nine new local lodges, among them Viola and Chicago, the two largest of the Leagues' lodges in this locality. He is now chairman of the finance committee of the district lodge.</p>
   <p>Among other organizations to which Burgeson belongs may be mentioned the Viking lodge Yngve, No. 26, the lodge Community, No. 1005, A. F. and A. M., of which he is a charter member.</p>
   <p>In 1911 Burgeson married Rosa Maria Pearson, daughter of the late Fred Pearson, well-known newspaper man. She was, and still is, a popular singer, and is now a member of the well-known Northland Trio. They have two daughters, and live at 3739 North Hermitage Avenue.</p>
