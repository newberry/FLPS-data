   <p>The Swedish Tribune reprints an article from a Stockholm newspaper Vart Land," which writes:</p>
   <p>"Our countrymen in the New World are very generous to their relatives in the Old World, and they receive considerable amounts of money sent them from America, especially around Christmas time.</p>
   <p>Part of this money goes through Skane's Enskilda Bank, which forwards different amounts of money from 5 to 1,000 Swedish kronen all over Sweden.</p>
   <p>This bank has paid out about 58,500 Swedish kronen to 1,100 persons lately.</p>
   <p>The main part of the money sent from the United States to Sweden goes through the U.S. Post Office. The total sum of not less than 2,065, 133 Swedish kronen and 68 ore has been sent home to the Old Country to 26,850 persons <span class="page-break">2</span>during the past eleven months. If we include December the total sum would be 2,300,000 Swedish kronen for the year. Last year the sum was 1,302,872 kronen. These money gifts are welcomed and also needed because most of those who have received those gifts are poor people.</p>
