   <p>Sweden's New Envoy to Washington, Minister W. A. Ekenberg, was officially welcomed at the White House by President Wilson, last Tuesday.</p>
   <p>The press evidenced a keen interest in Minister Ekenberg, who delivered to the President a dispatch from King Gustaf of Sweden. This dispatch in substance deplored the intrigue of the German Imperial Government as evidenced by the United States. Sweden has further pledged itself to take a neutral position in all matters, directly or indirectly, connected with the World War. It is to be hoped that the personal representative of the Swedish Government will find Washington's Diplomatic arena not too difficult.</p>
