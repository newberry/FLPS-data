A hundred thousand Swedish servant girls could not fill the existing need. From Chicago to Denver, they are in demand every where, and perhaps just as much East of Chicago. Even in the small towns, they earn three dollars per week with room and board. That amounts to $43.20 Kroner per month. In the large cities, a good Swedish girl often earns from fifty to seventy five, yes one hundred kroner per month, after she becomes accustomed to American ways.</p>
   <p>Not in twenty years has there been such a demand for Swedish workers. Prosperity is the reason. Those who are underpaid and have poor opportunities should hurry to America, where things are as good as ever for a Swedish man or woman of the right sort.</p>
   <p>Welcome, brothers and sisters of the North.</p>

   <p>The Swede is industrious, therefore, he is well liked. Still, it is singular how the old rule about being industrious, brings with it happy results. In America the industry of out people has perhaps been their leading attribute. Why?</p>
   <p>Yes, and, before all, while work in and for itself is worthy of esteem, since a life of leisure is just the opposite. When we speak of work, we mean both physical and mental, and when we speak of leisure we mean the ordinary, courser, and the more elegant. An industrious experienced and able person is in the same degree to be esteemed.</p>
   <p>Think of Sweden with her great and varied resources. Sweden places small value on physical labor, on handiwork, on servants, on women, except the cultured and elegant. Oh, that this is true of the beloved land in the high North!</p>

   <p>That is why, largely, that the Swedish-American never really thrives in Sweden. He has become accustomed to America's great, honorable, friend-of-man, outlook in regard to work, the place of the individual, and to American rewards for work.</p>
   <p>In America we think highly of work, both physical and mental. May it always be so, since our nation's future depends to a great extent on just that.</p>
   <p>But America not only esteems work. America shows her need for work.</p>
   <p>Some parents believe their children are really clever. Let the children get this impression, also, then the harm doubled. Talent is thinly sown. The ordinary and best capabilities should by wise parents be defined as the ability to work harder and more assiduously than usual. This definition children and the young should early become acquainted with. Even for the young of our time, work is the sine qua non, which stands between them and progress and victory on the way of their choice. Keep that thought warm in their souls.</p>

   <p>Paderewski plays eight hours a day. If he did not, his concerts would soon become tiresome and worthless. Workers must keep pace with the times. Everything depends on work, hard work.</p>
   <p>Since,therefore, our lot seems to be the one of hard work, let us remember that we are in the great procession; that we are mindful of universal law; that we are like others. Long live work!</p>
