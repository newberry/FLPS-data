   <p>As the subject of this week's Foreground article, we have selected a doctor who, even though he is still a young man, has earned a fine reputation for competence in his profession. And who is, in addition, a very personable fellow, well liked by all who know him. He is Dr. Emil E. Torell, whose office is located at 5412 North Clark Street.</p>
   <p>Emil Ernest Torell was born in Oakland, Nebraska, August 25, 1882, the son of the noted Augustana pastor, John Torell, who recently passed away. Young Torell entered Luther College in Wahoo, Nebraska, in 1895. It may be mentioned here that his father was among the men who made that institution what it is today. Emil later transferred to Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, where he studied for four years, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1903. He then went to the medical school of Northwestern University, from which he graduated in 1907. The following two years he served as an interne in Augustana Hospital in this city. He then went to Escanaba, Michigan, where he became a member of the staff of the Cottage Hospital. He also was engaged as physician for the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad in that district. In 1911, Torell returned to Chicago, and began the general practice of medicine in the Swedish districts of Summerdale and Edgewater, where he has since remained.</p>
   <p>Dr. Torell belongs to several medical organizations, and is a member of the Ebenezer Congregation. He also takes an active part in the activities of Swedish societies, religious as well as otherwise. He is much in demand as a speaker. He makes friends easily, thanks to his own friendliness and winning personality.</p>
   
   <p>In 1908 he married Alice Lindberg, of Paxton, Illinois. They live at 1702 Carmen Avenue.</p>
