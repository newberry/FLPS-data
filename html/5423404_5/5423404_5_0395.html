   <p>Mrs. Josephine Princell, wife of the late Professor J. P. Princell, noted educator and preacher, became eighty-seven years old last Monday. On this occasion friends gave a party in her honor at the Cafe Idrott, on Clark Street.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Princell, whose maiden name was Lind, is a native of Norrbotten Sweden, and came to this country in 1873. She received a fine education in Sweden, and really came here for the purpose of studying the American school system. She wrote several articles about this system for leading Swedish newspapers and periodicals. After having visited here for a couple of years she decided to remain, and resigned her post as a Stockholm teacher. Shortly afterwards she married Reverend Princell and moved with him to New York and later to Knoxville, Illinois. From then on they always made their home in the Middle West. In the nineties she headed the Scandinavian department of the Women's Christian Temperance <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Union in this part of the country. At that time she was already well known as a religious writer, having contributed numerous articles to Chicago-Bladet, of which her husband was editor. Her writings also appeared in other publications. She is still associated with Chicago-Bladet as editor of its Sunday school department.</p>
   <p>We join with her many friends in wishing Mrs. Princell many more years of active usefulness.</p>
