   <p>Among the guests at present stopping at the Auditorium Hotel is John Bernstrem, president of Aktiebolaget Separator, Stockholm, Sweden, which manufactures the cream separators invented by our famous countryman, De Laval. This company owns two factories in the East, at which these separators are manufactured for American consumption. Mr. Bernstrom is here on business, and chiefly for the purpose of arranging details in connection with the company's representation in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.</p>
