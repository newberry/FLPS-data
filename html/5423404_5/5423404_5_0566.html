   <p>Professor Axel Mellander, director of the seminary department of North Park College, died last Monday, following a major operation some time ago.</p>
   <p>Mellander was born in Bronnestad, in Skane, Sweden, March 26, 1860. At the age of ten, he had to go to work to help support the family, but he was a studious fellow, and while still a boy became a teacher in a small country school. In 1876 he entered the teachers' seminary in Lund, and when he graduated, two years later, it was his plan to become a public school teacher. But, after a short time, he changed his mind and came to America. Here he entered Ansgar College in Knoxville, where Professor Princell was teaching at the time. Mellander studied there until some time in 1881, when he went to Lowell, Massachusetts to become pastor of the Mission congregation there.</p>

   <p>Later on he served other Swedish-American congregations in Boston,Providence, Rhode Island, Scandia, Pennsylvania, Frewsburg, New York, and North Easton, Massachusetts. In 1886 he made a trip to Norway, and upon his return to America became editor of Kristna Harolden (The Christian Herald) in Minneapolis, of which the present Veckobladet is the successor. Some time later he became pastor of the Mission church in Iron Mountain, Michigan, where he remained until he accepted the post as teacher at the Mission League's training school for teachers in Minneapolis. When this institution was moved to Chicago, Mellander came along, and from then on he has made his home here. More than a year ago, his health began to fail, and last spring he had to give up teaching.</p>
   <p>The professor was the author of several books, and was also, in his younger years, much in demand as a lecturer.</p>
