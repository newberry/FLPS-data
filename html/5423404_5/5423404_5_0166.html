   <p>AN EDITORIAL: The Swedish Tribune suggested today that the Swedish community in Chicago, which now numbers around 30,000,should build a home for Swedish immigrants. The German immigrants recently celebrated the Two hundredth anniversay of the German Pilgrims' arrival at Germantown, Pennsylvania. On this occasion the Germans in the United States decided to build a home in Chicago for German immigrants at a cost of $50,000. The editor of The Swedish Tribune, therefore, thought it would be wise for the Swedes to make preparations to erect such a home for their own immigrants.</p>
   <p>Such a building should contain hotel rooms, reading rooms and halls in which the various societies can hold their meetings, concerts, and leatures.</p>
