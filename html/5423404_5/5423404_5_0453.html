   <p>Among the many persons of Swedish birth or descent in this country, who have given large sums to our "Jubilee Fund," for which money is being solicited this week throughout the nation, is one of our foremost business leaders, Mr. Andrew Lanquist.</p>
   <p>Last week he handed the chairman of the soliciting committee a check for $10,000. This magnificent gift was not accompanied by any stipulations. It came from a warm heart and hand with an understanding of the "Jubilee's" great cultural value.</p>
   <p>This is not the first time that Mr. Lanquist has come to the assistance of a worthy cause, but it is the first time that he has permitted his name to be <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>mentioned in connection with a large donation.</p>
   <p>With this great gift from an individual, we have something to point to, and it is to be hoped that many of our better situated countrymen will follow Mr. Lanquist's example - for the sake of the "Jubilee."</p>
   <p>Andrew Lanquist is the leader in the great building industry, now so active in Chicago, and which has given the Swedes credit for the up-building of more than two thirds of this great city.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lanquist was born on the 26th of November, 1856, in Vastergotland. He came to the United States and Chicago in 1881. He has himself divulged a few episodes from his early Chicago life for a friend, which we here repeat:</p>
   <p>"When I arrived here with $30.00 in my pockets - I lent a stranded stranger $10.00 - I was walking on the North Side the day after my arrival here. At <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>home I had applied myself diligently to the study of English, so that I, although somewhat falteringly, was able to make myself quite well understood. During may walk I noticed the foundation for a building under construction, and decided to inquire about work. The boss asked me what I could do. 'Lay brick,' was my answer. 'Come back tomorrow morning ready to go to work,' was his reply. I went there and was put to work and was also told that my wages would be eleven cents per hour - just half of what a 'regular' bricklayer was paid at that time. I remained there till the building was completed.</p>
   <p>"My next job was in the same trade, working for a railroad out on a prairie. Here, I was promised twenty-five cents an hour (mainly due to the long distance). When my pay envelope arrived, I discovered that I had received more money than I thought I had coming. I mentioned it to the foreman. 'Most likely a mistake,' he said. 'Speak to the chief engineer when he comes,' he advised. This I did. 'No my friend, this is absolutely correct. You have earned what you have received.' And of course it goes without saying, I was glad. I mentioned this to the foreman, who exclaimed: 'So, it was correct! Well, then I can tell you that you receive the same pay as I - thirty-seven and one-half cents an hour.'</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Some time after this the chief engineer sent for me and asked if I understood blueprints. 'Very little,' I answered. But I received a bunch of documents to study for a few hours, so that he later could tell how much or little I was able to understand. After having studied these drawings for some time I was questioned and the result was in my favor. I was ordered to a place where the ground was being prepared for the erection of several buildings. He showed me how to use the level and said, 'Let your common sense do the talking and go to it; everything will be all right.' Whether I let my common sense talk, I do not know. But I made good progress. Then my eyes caught sight of a theodolite or transit, an instrument with which to measure horizontal and vertical angles. There I felt more at home, particularly after I had persuaded the engineer to lend me the instrument for a few hours' practice.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>"When the chief engineer came along, he was considerably surprised to see me handle the theodolite, which he thought no one but a 'highly educated' person could make use of. When I told him I was familiar with the instrument he was satisfied, expressed admiration for Sweden's schools and let me continue. In this manner I started my activities in Chicago."</p>
   <p>We might add that already in 1883 Andrew Lanquist was contracting on his own account and has been at it ever since - always out in front with a lot of projects under construction.</p>
   <p>In 1904 Andrew Lanquist became president of Lanquist and Illsley, a contracting firm known through the United States, and which has given many Swedish contractors a start and added honor to the Swedish name, particularly in the building trade in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Mr. Lanquist has time and again shown his magnanimity, which has not become general knowledge, although a little has seeped out now and then.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lanquist is also one of the largest stockholders in the State Bank of Chicago, and has for many years been one of its directors.</p>
