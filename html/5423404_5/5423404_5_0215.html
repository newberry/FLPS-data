   <p>Gustave Flack is supposed to have been the first Swede who settled in Chicago in 1845 or 1846. He established himself as a merchant at the Clark Street bridge, which was the only one in the city at that time. He was born in the northern part of Sweden called Helsingland.</p>
   <p>He went back home to Sweden two years later to visit relatives, but died on the journey.</p>
   <p>He aroused interest among the people through his letters from America to Helsingland, Sweden. The result of this correspondence was the immigration of Eric Janson and the followers of Bishop Hill.</p>
