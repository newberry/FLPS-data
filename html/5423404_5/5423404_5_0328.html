   <p>Concerning prospects for the crop this year in Norrland, the following information came from Sundsvall, Sweden, on July 22:</p>
   <p>The harvest of fodder has begun in Norrland. The crop on well-tilled soil appears to be average, elsewhere it appears to fall below the average. The prospects for grain and vegetables are poor. Unless the late summer and fall is very favorable it is feared that a new crop failure will ensue. Especially is the news from the northern districts very disturbing.</p>
