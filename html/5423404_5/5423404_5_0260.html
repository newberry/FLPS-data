   <p>For the purpose of honoring Consul Eric Einar Ekstrand, who has just been appointed to an important position with the Swedish Foreign Office, about one-hundred people - ladies and gentlemen - gathered Saturday evening at the Swedish Club, where a grand dinner was arranged.</p>
   <p>Among the invited honor guests we noticed Norway's and Denmark's consuls, the president of the Scandinavian-American Foundation, Professor W. P. Scofield, the prima donna Mme. Julia Claussen, etc. Mr. Charles S. Peterson, president of the Swedish Club, the evening's master of ceremonies, opened with a short speech explaining the purpose of the gathering and also lauded the guest of honor, Consul Eric Einar Ekstrand, both as a public man as well as a private person. The next speaker was the Swedish Vice Consul G. Bernhard Anderson, who deviated from the program to some extent, for instead of speaking on our people in Chicago, he paid homage to Consul Ekstrand, who, he said, in spite of his short stay here, has become one among us, as well <span class="page-break">\2</span>as one of us; he also pointed to the great interest he had taken in the different Swedish organizations and their work. In behalf of those present the speaker presented Consul Ekstrand with a beautiful gold watch as a memento from the Swedes in Chicago. With heartfelt words Consul Ekstrand thanked all for the gifts and for the good-will he had met everywhere in Chicago. The next speaker was the newly appointed consul in Chicago, Mr. S. T. Goes. In his speech he said he realized his new position would be a difficult one, as he had to fill the place of so popular a man as Consul Ekstrand. He expressed his best wishes for his predecessor's success in the new and responsible work he has been appointed to in Sweden. Mr. B. F. Falkenstierne, consul of Denmark, made a short speech, as did Norway's consul, Olaf Bernts, who spoke in Norwegian, and whose fitting words were received with great applause. In a few words, both humoristic and serious, Mr. John E. Ericsson took official farewell of Consul Ekstrand and extended a welcome to Consul Goes. The master of ceremonies then introduced Professor Scofield, who gave a fine lecture on the Scandinavian countries, their people, nature, etc. Mr. Henry S. Henschen spoke on the Swedish Club, which, he said, was not a branch for the preservation of Swedish traditions and language, but an American club with patriotic American citizens as members.</p>

   <p>By now it was very close to midnight, but none seemed inclined to break away; all waited to hear the evening's last speaker, Editor Alex J. Johnson, who gave a biographical sketch of Mr. Ekstrand's life and work, saying that of all the representatives the Swedish Foreign Office had sent to Chicago, Mr. Ekstrand was the one who best had understood his duties. The evening's main feature was Mr. Ekstrand's reply.</p>
   <p>He began his speech in English but ended it in the language of honor and heroes. He spoke of his pleasure at having received sommany proofs of sympathy and understanding, and also mentioned the great share the Swedes had given to American cultural life. An animated feeling was evident throughout the evening. As another example of Mr. Ekstrand's popularity among the Swedes, the Swedish Glee Club appeared of their own accord to pay respect to Mr. Ekstrand through their songs. The program concluded with orchestra music and a song by a young man, J. Edwin Johnson, dressed in United States Navy uniform.</p>
   <p>A few data regarding Consul Ekstrand might be of interest, as it was mentioned several times during the evening's speeches that he was expected to return to the United States some time in the future.</p>
