At this latter institution of learning he took his degree of Ph. D. magna cum laude and become a Fellow on its faculty. Shortly afterward he was called to accept the professor's chair in Semitic languages and ancient history at the Western Theological Seminary in Chicago. In 1910-11 he traveled extensively in the Old World, at this time, particularly enriching his education in Egyptology preparatory to the completion of some of his writings.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tofften is the author of the following standard works of learning: Researches in Assyrian and Babylonian Geography; Ancient Chronology; The Historic Exodus; Breasted's Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol.V; Researches in Biblical Archaelogy, in 3 volumes; Myths and the Bible; The Corner-stone, and The Church of our Fathers.
