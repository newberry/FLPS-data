   <p>Our countryman, Lawrence P. Lindelof, was elected National President of the Painters, Paperhangers and Decoraters' Union of America last week. For several years previously, Mr. Lindelef has held the position of secretary of the Union's Chicago council.</p>
   <p>The unions represented by Mr. Lindelof have a total membership of about 200,000. Mr. Lindelof has been one of the most ardent spokesman for the 5-day a week work schedule, which now is in effect for painters and allied trades.</p>
