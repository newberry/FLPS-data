   <p>A banquet was given last Thursday night in the club rooms of the Swedish Engineering Society, 503 Wrightwood Avenue, in honor of Peter Parke, chief engineer at the Pullman shops, who on this occasion received the insignia of the Order of Vasa, conferred upon him by King Gustaf V of Sweden.</p>
   <p>The Swedish consul in Chicago, Carl 0. DeDardel [sometimes given as C. O. von Dardel], represented the King. Among the guests were the most prominent members of the Engineering Society and the consular staff. For the first time, the Swedish engineers had the pleasure of witnessing one of their own members being honored in this way in their own club. Many Knights of Vasa and Knights of the North Star were present.</p>
   
   <p>The Society's president, John C. Gullborg, acted as master of ceremonies, and introduced the first speaker, Vice-consul G. B. Anderson, who reviewed Mr. Parke's outstanding contributions in the field of industry as well as his valuable, if less known, services to the Swedish consulate. The Vice-consul was followed by many leading members of the engineering profession who in flattering terms paid tribute to their distinguished colleague, the guest of honor. After a brief speech in which he thanked Mr. Parke for his services to Swedish-Americans and to Sweden, Consul De Dardel then conferred the order upon him in the name of the King of Sweden. Mr. Parke, who was deeply moved, expressed his gratitude for the honor bestowed upon him.</p>
   <p>A program of Swedish songs and music was given, and a genuinely Swedish spirit prevailed throughout the evening.</p>
