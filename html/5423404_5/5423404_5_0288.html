   <p>The Swedish-American Line which Wilhelm Lundstrom, the ship-owner from Gothenburg, Sweden, talked about when he was here in Chicago last spring and which he would like to see started and put into operation with Swedish and American funds, has not been mentioned in any of Sweden's greater newspapers until lately, when a Stockholm paper suggested that something should be done to push the matter forward. The editor of the paper did not like the idea of such an enterprise being financed with borrowed money. If the public could be interested to participate by buying bonds for such a low price as one hundred Swedish kronen a share it would not be hard to get the needed capital for the benefit of the new line.</p>
