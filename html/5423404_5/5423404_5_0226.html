   <p>The "Stockholm University Students' Chorus," which is due to arrive in New York from Sweden in a few days, will give its first concert in Chicago a week from Sunday, June 7th, at the Auditorium Theatre. This male chorus, of forty voices is said to be the finest in Europe,and it is a great honor and a rare treat, indeed, to welcome and listen to singers of such unusually high caliber. The conductor is Dr. Einar Ralph from the Swedish Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm, and its honorary conductor is John R. Ortengren, the "Grand Old Man" of choral singing and known by many old timers, since his Chicago sojourn, for his splendid pioneering work among the Swedish Singers here a generation ago.</p>
   <p>The second concert of the Student's chorus will be given in the large assembly hall, at the municipal Navy Pier, Thursday, June 25th, at 8 P.M.</p>
   <p>All in all about twenty-five concerts will be given by the Chorus in various Swedish centers of the United States. The singers plan to return to Sweden by the middle of July.</p>
