   <p>The well-known builder and contractor, Victor Tessing, president of the firm Tessing &amp; Peterson, suffered a stroke last Saturday as he was on his way to the firm's offices at 329 Plymouth Court. He was taken to a near-by hospital, where he passed away last Monday.</p>
   <p>Tessing was born in Slaka, Ostergotland, Sweden, September 15, 1864, and observed his sixtieth birthday last month, on which occasion he was heartily feted by his many friends. He attended the public school near his home and afterwards entered a private school. Later, he went to Stockholm, where he attended a technical school for three years, and obtained the training which fitted him for a career as a builder. When in 1890 he decided to go to America, he chose Chicago as the place which offered him the best <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>opportunities, and gradually he won a prominent place among Swedish contractors here.</p>
   <p>For many years he belonged to the Swedish Baptist organization, and was a member of the First Swedish Baptist Church here, in which he held many positions of trust. When the congregation built its new church, he was very helpful; his firm did the interior work. The Baptist organizations as a whole profited by his business experience, and he was made treasurer of the mission department.</p>
   <p>Tessing was a lover of song and music, and belonged to the Arion Male Chorus, which has often been heard at concerts and festivals. For many years he served as its president.</p>
   <p>In 1894 he married May Kallbom. She and four children survive.</p>
