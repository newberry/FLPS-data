   <p>The latest arrived newspapers from Sweden to Chicago tell us that a request has been presented to the Swedish Government to authorize the establishment of a new Swedish-American Line, of which much has been spoken in the press and for which Vilhelm R. Lundgren, a ship-owner recently took a round trip from Gothenburg, Sweden, to the United States, where he tried to interest our countrymen here in Chicago to subscribe for stocks in this new enterprise. He also opened negotiations for the formation of an American corporation to work together with the Swedish company. To start the line, he says, he needs thirteen million kornen, of which he thinks he can get about four millions from the Swedes in the United States, and six millions in Sweden. The balance, three millions, he thinks he can get from the Swedish shipowners' fund and from mail service between the two countries. Mr. Lundgren states that about half of the estimated sum, to be subscribed to by interested persons in Sweden, is already secured, and <span class="page-break">2</span>that he hopes to get the rest of it very soon. He hopes to build two 18,000-ton boats, provided the needed capital is secured before the end of this year. These boats could be ready for traffic between Gothenburg and New York in the beginning of 1915; one of the boats sailing every fourteenth day. Two boats could,-according to his further calculation,-be built two years later. Regular connection could then be arranged between Gothenburg and New York every week.</p>
   <p>We doubt very much that a greater part of the proposed sum, four millions could be raised among the Swedes in America "before the end of the year." Sweden will benefit from this new line, which will produce large sums from passenger tickets, which now go abroad. Sweden will furthermore get other advantages if the boats are built in Sweden. The Swedish shipbuilding-industry will gain considerably, and so will hundreds of persons in Sweden, who get their living as clerks, captains, seamen, and servants on the new boats. If Mr. Lundgren's calculations are correct, the benefit for Sweden, its industry, and individuals will be so great that the whole business ought to be <span class="page-break">3</span>financed with Swedish capital alone. We cannot see that there can be any direct material advantage for our countrymen to participate in the formation of this new company. Nevertheless, the plans Mr. Lundgren presented here in Chicago were met with great sympathy by our countrymen. Our love for Sweden and the Swedish name of which we always are so proud, will move us to greet this new Swedish enterprise with joy, and if this new line is put into action and managed in the right way, it will surely be supported in every possible way by our countrymen in America. Before there will be any real business in the matter transacted here among our countrymen, we have to be assured that the interest for this new line is really great in Sweden, and that Swedish Parliament and Government are absolutely behind this enterprise.</p>
