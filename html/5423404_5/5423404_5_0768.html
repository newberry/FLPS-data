   <p>"Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home," sang our distinguished compatriot, Steamship Commissioner Birger Lundberg, the other day, as he started on a trip to his beloved Smaland (Sweden) where his parents are waiting to welcome him. Whether nostalgia or business was the main reason for his departure for home, we do not know, but we do know Birger Lundberg will soon return, and when he does, we shall welcome him back as heartily as we now are wishing him a happy journey and many pleasant days with his parents and his childhood acquaintances. He left New York last Thursday.</p>
