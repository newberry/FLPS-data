   <p>There are about 200,000 Swedish immigrants in America and about 150,000 persons who were born in the United States of Swedish parents. There are Swedes in every state of the Union, trying to make their living as plain workmen, farmers, merchants, or,- gold diggers. Swedish immigrants are arriving daily, now more than ever in Chicago. Some of them stay here, but many continue their trip to Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Minnesota. This immigration is the result of "hard times" in Sweden at present.</p>
