   <p>At the International Grand Lodge Conference of the I.O.G.T., being held in Edinburgh, Scotland, the State of Illinois is represented by our well-known country-woman, Mrs. Otilia Myhrman, of Chicago. Just previous to her departure from Chicago a beautiful bouquet was given to her, as well as a beautiful gold watch as a token of appreciation of her energetic work in the cause of good-templarism.</p>
