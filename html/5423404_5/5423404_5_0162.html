   <p>I walked the other day with an old Swedish-American in one of the more prosperous Swedish colonies some one-hundred miles from Chicago. We were talking about the old and the new times. The man was old, but his memory was fresh. The old colonists do not forget anything - not that they always can keep with the times in this country. Who can expect these gray-haired men to keep abreast of the times which are rushing as if crazy? Anyway they are those who have given an impetus to the times. I mean that respectable and fast growing Swedish-American colonies owe these pioneers not a little thanks for the progress they have made. What more can one expect?</p>
   <p>The old colonist does not forget anything. Haven't you noticed how fully the past world lays before him? He has been here for thirty, perhaps forty years, but do not think that this time has dimmed the curtain picture of his native land. We young ones, who have been on the American stage for only ten or fifteen years don't care to recall the time when we were struggling in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>old country. America has absorbed our whole being. But ask the old man,who arrived with the first immigrants, and you will hear he has not forgotten one relative or friend in the old country.</p>
   <p>Well, my Cicerone belongs to the old veterans. He came here in 1850.</p>
   <p>"Do you see that house," he says, showing me a fine public building. "There stood a little shack when I came here. We lived there all of us, thirty persons. What did we do? Well, we did what we could. We sawed wood, we worked on the farms around here for twenty five cents a day and meals, but we were out of work for long periods. Were we disheartened? Oh, no. Our wives were brave. When we men had nothing to do, we stayed home and took care of the children. Then the women went out working in homes, which could afford to pay for laundry work or house work. We had to be satisfied, and be very careful with what little we had."</p>
   <p>It was now twilight, both for the old man and for nature. I saw a strong <span class="page-break">\3</span>electric light ahead of me, which came from a large factory. I asked the old man, "who is the owner of this factory?" "Well", he answered me," one of those boys who came over with us from Sweden made an invention and now they are working there day and night with 150 machines." Ah, I thought my countrymen have gone forward during these thirty years. They have made an important invention and built a large factory.</p>
   <p>I was informed later on during the evening that out of the small colony of thirty people a large settlement had grown up, and that there were now about 4,500 persons. Most of them had their own comfortable homes, half a dozen factories, giving work to hundreds of men, many churches, where thousands of worshipers assembled every Sunday, and that there are a dozen stores, selling different kinds of merchandise.... All are doing well.</p>
   <p>Time has been kind to this small city among these our countrymen, and so it is to all throughout America, where there is will power, courage, and willingness to do hard work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>There has been quite a beginning in every field of endeavor. There has been in some directions hardly any progress, but, nevertheless a little. Step by step we have moved onward until we are getting settled on the American soil.</p>
