   <p>The protest against Judge Harry Olson, which was published in last week's issue of all of the Swedish newspapers of Chicago, needs no explanation. In his first campaign speech, Judge Olson condemned the whole present city administration in Chicago. He did not, at any time, name Mayor Thompson, but he called the whole administration rotten, and he assured his readers that Chicago, in this regard, stood at the zero point.</p>
   <p>It is fairly clear that when the whole city administration is condemned, it will not only be its chief who is censured, but the destructive criticism will even reach other responsible representatives of the city. There are about a dozen executive officials within the administration, three of whom are of Swedish nativity. They had full right to feel themselves the object of the criticism, and to call out for the sympathy of their countrymen against the attack, when it was found to be unjust.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In a newspaper article in the Friday issue of the Chicago Daily News, Judge Olson seeks to excuse himself by saying that he has not blamed any one person. He also cited an utterance by a builder who praised Building Commissioner Charles Bostrom's execution of office. Any praise or defense for City Collector Charles Forsberg was not presented, and, thereafter, he permits himself to attack the activities of the writer, which in, and for itself, proves that the protest in question was fully warranted.</p>
   <p>In case Judge Olson cared to bring forth any example of lack of competence or attentiveness in my execution of the office which has been entrusted to me by Mayor Thompson, his attack upon me would have its place in a campaign such as Judge Olson has decided to carry out.</p>
   <p>I have never conversed with Mayor Thompson in regard to the visit Marshall Joffre of France is to make to Chicago. I have never, at a meeting at the Swedish Club, or any where else, opposed a patriotic expression of the Swedes in Chicago. What I opposed on the occasion mentioned was that the demonstration <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>on the Municipal Pier should include an apology or prayer on the part of the Swedes here for lack of loyalty to the land of their adoption, the United States. A protestation of this sort, I considered erroneous, and uncalled for. I expressed, further, the view that American citizens of Swedish birth, or descent, could not, naturally, be considered responsible for actions done by the representatives of the Kingdom of Sweden in Argentina, or in other places. Judge Olson probably did not "sit down" on me at the Swedish Club, during the meeting in question. He has, to the contrary, on all occasions, when we have found ourselves face to face, treated me with the utmost politeness, and even shown passivity for my expressed views, when they do not agree with his own.</p>
   <p>It is true that a Methodist minister, named Swenson, gave a blood-thirsty speech on the occasion mentioned, but the reception which followed, consisted only of peals of laughter, which, of course, may be interpreted in various ways. I, myself, was elected a member of the resolutions committee, and I received an opportunity thereby to subdue unjustified affronts against our old father-land, as well as undue apologies on the part of the Swedish-Americans. These <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>resolutions, as I have edited them, were read and accepted at the meeting on the Municipal Pier.</p>
   <p>Judge Olson maintains that I have become "stuck up", that is, I have shown arrogance over an order for which I have been named by the Swedish government. How does he know that? I have never by word or pen eulogized myself for having received the mark of the order. Judge Olson cannot feel my mood in this matter because we have not met since the time previous to the primary election in September, last year. At this time, he wished to ask my advice on the possibilty of a combination with Mayor Thompson's political organization. This was many months before the mark of the order was awarded me.</p>
   <p>This mark was a surprise to me, and I could not explain its award to me in any other way than by reason of a writing from the special commission of Sweden in Washington, which expressed its gratitude for my part in the achievement of a satisfactory trade agreement between the United States and Sweden.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Judge Olson further seeks, through insinuations, to let it be understood that there was something wrong in my choice of friendship for the former consul, E. E. Ekstrand, who had been recalled from Chicago. In respect to my acquaintance with Consul Ekstrand, his friendship was shown to all who came in touch with him, and finally took its expression in one of the finest farewell festivals which has been held at the Swedish Club. Consul Ekstrand was recalled to fill a higher post in the Swedish Foreign Department. He was named counsellor to the Legation of the Swedish Mission in Washington a few months later. This can hardly cast suspicion upon Consul Ekstrand for improper behaviour during his consulship in Chicago, as Judge Olson clearly would let it be understood.</p>
   <p>With the editing of the newspaper, "The Republican", I have never had anything in the least to do with it, although I willingly admit that I have always read it with great satisfaction, and even edification.</p>
   <p>The Daily News praises Judge Olson's surpassing satire when he applies the ghastly German citation, "spurlos versenkt" (Sunk without trace) to my <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>candidacy for a political office last fall. I was nominated for County Commissioner in the Republican primary, but fell through in the final election, a similar fate which descended upon nine of the ten Republicans who were nominated for this office. Only one succeeded in being elected.</p>
   <p>But what happened to Judge Olson four years ago when he was a candidate for mayor? He was spared the shame of a defeat in the final election for the simple reason that his own party comrades, Republicans, in the primary election did not wish to know of him as their candidate for mayor. "Spurlos versenkt"? Ah, No! But let us, for the sake of change, go over from the German to the English and apply a familiar saying, which, in translation, goes: "Coming events cast their shadows before them."</p>
   <p>I have been told that an answer to Judge Olson's attack on me in The Daily News would be of interest to the countrymen in Chicago. It is for this reason I have taken the liberty to take up their time with a personal communication. What Judge Olson says about me, personally, has, in the meantime, not the least <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>meaning for his mayoralty campaign. It is difficult for me to believe that it will do him any good, or increase his number of votes in the primary election. In the future, I will withhold my protest against his "wholesale" censure of the present city administration officials, which even included me, and which I herewith exhort him to rectify, if he can, or else stand out as an unconscionable "backbiter".</p>
