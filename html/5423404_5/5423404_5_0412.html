   <p>Alexander J. Johnson who for more than forty years was editor and publisher of Svenska Kuriren passed away last Saturday.</p>
   <p>In him the Swedish-American press lost one of its most noted figures, and a journalist, who, for a longer period than has been alloted to most of his colleagues, had the opportunity to observe Swedish-American as well as American conditions at close range, and who had the gift to describe and interpret them in a manner which was not only interesting but also indicated good judgement. [Translator's note: The rest of the article contains a biography of Mr. Johnson, identical with one which is already in the project files].</p>
