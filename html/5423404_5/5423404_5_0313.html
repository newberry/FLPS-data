   <p>Never was the participation in parliamentary elections as lively as at this time. At about 2 A.M., on September 30 the crowd in Gustaf Adolph's Square was so dense that only with the greatest difficulty could one press his way through. Here, in front of the strongly illumined announcement board of Stockholm's Tidningen, the people were massed, watching the election results as they came in.....Shortly before 3 A.M., it was known that the so-called Liberals had lost, and the Socialist party two steps in its onward march. Besides the re-election of its old leaders, the Socialists had gained two new members in the parliament, from Stockholm. This means that the delegation from Stockholm in the Swedish parliament will have a Socialist majority.</p>
