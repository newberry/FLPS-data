   <p>Gus Broberg, the well-known Swedish-American steamship line agent, was born October 20, 1858, in Nykoping, Sweden. The little village had few advantages to offer, so early in his life, at the age of 15 years, he went to sea. In the year 1879, he decided to become a land "crab," so he went to New York. There he dug ditches, and later worked at a life saving station in Buffalo. He came to Chicago in 1880. Here, he took a position as agent with a steamship agency, but because of a disagreement with his chief, he resigned this position and established a branch agency for himself in 1883. He married Miss Bertha Gloor in 1884, and is the father of a daughter, Bessie, now 15 years old.</p>
   <p>In 1899, he began publishing a paper called Humorist, which later he changed the name to the Swedish News. Two years ago, he sold the newspaper.</p>
   
   <p>Such have been the experiences and work in the life of Gus Broberg. He has been very successful and owns several buildings. He has always followed his own mind and lived frugally, thereby amassing great wealth. He still operates a business at 67 East Kinzie Street, where the Swedish flag waves, and he still sells tickets to homesick Swedish men and women.</p>
