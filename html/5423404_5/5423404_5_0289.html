   <p>Svenska Dagbladet, a prominent Swedish daily newspaper in Stockholm, has sent one of its representatives, P. G. Norberg to this country to represent this paper as a special correspondent, with Chicago as his headquarters. He will also work to further connections between Sweden and the Anglo-American world, especially the Swedish-Americans, through public addresses. "It is a known fact," says the paper in a recently printed official statement, "that the information which is spread in Sweden about America and American conditions, is more or less untrue and misleading. There also seems to be a wrong opinion in America concerning conditions in Sweden." Mr. Norberg will now try to correct these statements, and also try to put forth efforts to strengthen the tie between the Swedes on both sides of the Atlantic. We agree most heartily, if this important task can be done.</p>
