   <p>The well-known Swede, Fred Lundin, will represent the people in the Seventh Congressional District. Lundin has been active for many years in public life, and his background is of the best.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians have formed a number of "Lundin Clubs", which shows that Fred Lundin can expect, and will get, the support of all Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>Fred was born in Vester-Tollstad [West Tollstad], Sweden, May 18, 1868. He came to America and to Chicago in 1880. The new land was not very kind to the Lundins; Fred had to sell papers in order to help the family, and when this did not pay enough he would shine shoes in order to earn a little more. He went to evening school, studied hard, and as the years went by he learned English, and soon he could compete with the best of them.</p>

   <p>He went to work as a messenger boy for a large clothing company, and after a few years of hard work he became a partner in the company now known as Lundin and Company. In 1894 he served as county clerk. At this election he received 40,000 more votes than did the candidate for mayor. Fred will serve the people now, to the best of his ability; he is a son of the people, therefore we can depend on him.</p>
