   <p>p.1...The Swedish-Americans' most noted establishment of learning, Augustana College, at Rock Island, Illinois, on May 29th named our highly respected countryman, Judge Axel Chytraus of the Superior Court in this city, juris utriusque doctor, with the title, used in this country, L.L.D. During the years he has practiced law here and equally so after his election as judge, Mr. Chytraus has made himself an honored name, not only among his countrymen, but among the whole of our citizenry. Lawyers, and others who have had the opportunity to test his judicial powers all bear witness that he, as a judge, is impartial,of sharp, solid learning,and with a friendly manner toward all, with whom he comes into contact in his judicial capacity. He is well entitled to the distinction he has won, and Augustana College, which has honored him has shown that it knows how to value a countryman, who has raised himself to a noble and responsible post through diligent struggle and solid living.</p>

   <p>Judge Chytraus was born in Vermeland, Sweden, in 1859. Ten years later he came, with his father, a widower, to America. The father made his home in Chicago, where he worked, for the most part, as a bookkeeper until his death, 1887. The son received his earlier schooling chiefly in the public schools and in the night school at the Chicago Athenaeum. At the age of fourteen he became an errand boy for the law firm of Howe and Russell. It was not long before the youthful Chytraus showed his great propensity for legal studies, and as soon as he reached his maturity, he finished his examinations, and was admitted to legal practice in 1881.</p>
   <p>In 1885 he became a member of the firm of Blanke and Chytraus. When George T. Blanke in 1893 was elected judge of the Superior Court, Mr. Chytraus formed a partnership with the present State's Attorney, Charles S. Deneen. In 1898 Mr. Chytraus was elected a Cook County Judge. His present service period terminates in 1904, but there is no doubt about his re-election, if he himself should desire it. He has unquestionably had the largest practice among Swedish <span class="page-break">3</span>lawyers in Chicago and he would, beyond doubt, have greater success now than formerly should he again take up work as a lawyer.</p>
   <p>Judge Chytraus has been married to Laura Haugan, daughter of the well-known banker, Helge A. Haugan, since 1892. Their happy and elegant home is at 1932 Arlington Place, near Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>Among the Swedish people of Chicago, Judge Chytraus is naturally a well-known name. He has always been interested in that which concerns our nationality, and in word, as well as in deed, he has promoted his country-man's welfare; among Swedish republicans he has for many years been reputed one of their most clear-visioned and influential leaders.</p>
