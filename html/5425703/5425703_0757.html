   <p>Your Siege Organization should be particularly mindful of those things which will lead to the liberation of Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>I look upon this Organization as an element which is actually a blossom of our future happiness. I believe that the Siege Organization is the one that will supply the main springs of our future Ukrainian State apparatus, without which, the structure of our State cannot exist as such; nay, even the enlightened mass, without such ranks cannot constitute a worthwhile creative power. Siege organization appears to be this very foundation upon which expert builders can construct a charming palace that is beautiful to look at, be the observer near or far.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainians in Chicago and in the United States in general, particularly the <span class="page-break">2</span>Siege organization, has done much for Ukrainia. Both your material help and protests, history cannot and will not forget nor slight. Yet, from you, who are real Ukrainians, not only in name but also in deed, Ukrainia expects much more than that which you have just done, because in America no Polish blackjacks nor Russian detectives are threatening you for your cultural activities. There you are free to organize, free in many respects; therefore, far more is expected of you. "Your work should be more productive," thus call to you those from beyond the grave who fell gloriously for the cause of liberty; thus call to you the abundantly productive wheat fields of Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>Ukrainia wants you to help her at the approaching twelfth-hour decisive battle for freedom, and to all of us it will mean to mend or end, to live a victorious life, or go to a glorious death.</p>
   <p>Yes, in such a critical hour, Ukrainia demands you to join the ranks of her army. At that hour Ukrainia will need more well-educated people for various official <span class="page-break">3</span>positions in different branches and departments of her future State apparatus. I am sorry to say that in the past some of our men holding responsible positions were not trained enough for their special offices, and this was one of the main reasons why Ukrainia was defeated. Due to this frequent incompetency of officeholders, the shrewd enemies had a freer hand to enter the forbidden door which, when they once entered they left but ruins therein. Thus the things that were valiantly fought for by our boys, everything worthwhile acquired by the Ukrainians, was destroyed by the enemy.</p>
   <p>Therefore, organize for the time of liberation is again very near. Have the rank and file of well-educated men and youth in various branches of learning prepared and ready to answer the call of Ukrainia to fill successfully her administrative offices. Therefore be ready! At the opportune time let every one be on the alert, prepared and ready to fall in line and take the place where he is best fitted. Be ready to drive away the enemy, the occupier of our native land, and stand firmly on guard to prevent any hostile creature from poisoning our future peaceful inhabitants.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Remember, dear countrymen, should we fail to have enough intelligentsia of different ranks and in various fields of learning, we may find ourselves again as if in the midst of the raging ocean billows, and our boats and rafts filled with treasures may find themselves at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
   <p>Siege organization has but one aim to help create and prepare enough workers to fill properly official State positions of the future State apparatus. There, in the United States, you have the facilities to prepare those things, and this is all the more reason why you should not let any party differences cause any dissension among you.</p>
   <p>Your full co-operation will not only help Ukrainia become independent once more but will also help to place her on the same level with other cultured nations.</p>
   <p>There were both leaders and masses, but there was not enough creative power, especially in cities, which are the most sensitive parts of the nerves of the <span class="page-break">5</span>State, because cities are the brain of a nation or a country. Therefore, let us consider cities as our strongholds, well protected by suitable and well-trained officials. Then I am sure that no hostile viper with its venomous teeth can harm us.</p>
   <p>Therefore, all who love Ukrainia should join the Siege ranks and get prepared, for the eleventh hour is at hand!</p>
