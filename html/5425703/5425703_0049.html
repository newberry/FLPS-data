   <p>No country in Europe cares for its libraries as is done here in the United States. Besides, many individuals endow these libraries with large sums of money. The system in these libraries is the same in all and is taught to the librarian in special schools.</p>
   <p>Libraries here usually have three departments: the Reference Department, from which one cannot take out the books; the Circulation Department, and the Children's Department. The last named employs people who are specially prepared to work among children. In addition, the larger libraries have a fourth department--for newspapers and periodicals. The newspapers cannot be taken out, but the periodicals can. In the Reference Department there are special sections for law, medicine, etc.</p>
   <p>Almost every large library has separate collections of foreign books. The public libraries here have books in the Ukrainian language, but only the <span class="page-break">\2</span>large ones where Ukrainians saw to it that the library purchased them. Usually books in the foreign languages are there uselessly, because it is very seldom that anyone asks for them. The reason for this is that our people do not know that public libraries have Ukrainian literature and that if they demanded it, more would be purchased. The directors of these libraries say that they would employ workers who know foreign languages if the public wished to profit from these collections. Very seldom does anyone ask for these books because, for the past ten years, the few organs of our press occupied their time and space with bickerings and slander which turned the people to disputation instead of education.</p>
   <p>These libraries also have directories of all the important cities of the United States, not only the latest but the older ones as well. From these directories one can find all the addresses of friends and relatives of whom sight has been lost; addresses of night schools where many practical trades are taught free of charge; addresses and information pertaining to various factories and businesses where one might be able to secure a job or to study <span class="page-break">\3</span>a special trade.</p>
   <p>The libraries also have newspapers, both old and new, of other cities, filed in yearly volumes. Whenever a workingman wishes to move to another city where he does not have any friends, he can use these newspapers, and, by looking through the "Help Wanted" column, secure all the information he desires, which often a friend residing in that city could not supply. It frequently occurs that the workingman has forgotten the name of the ship on which he arrived, and the exact date of its arrival. This information is needed when applying for citizenship papers. In the main libraries one can find many volumes of old daily newspapers that publish the movements of all the ships at the time in question. One should not hesitate because he does not know how to look up what he wants in the library. That is why they have librarians there: to direct him and to show him where to find it and how to find it.</p>
   <p>Whoever might care to, may quickly be convinced that libraries here are <span class="page-break">\4</span>not only places where one can read comfortably and quietly, but are also places where one can obtain practical information which is very important to life and the future on this earth of the workingman and his children.</p>
   <p>That is why we say to our workingmen, "Utilize the long evenings of your young lives in a useful way! Go to the libraries, seek there and read Ukrainian books! Take your children to the public libraries so that they may become accustomed to the use of the sources of knowledge, which will be to their advantage.</p>
   <p>"Do not lose valuable time by listening to bolshevik agitators or to other critics, for they will not teach you anything. They often do not know anything in any sphere of knowledge. Loud speaking and chiding others do not produce knowledge."</p>
