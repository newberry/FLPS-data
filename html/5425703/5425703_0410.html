   <p>The Ukrainian college youth in Chicago established the Monomach, a Ukrainian student club.</p>
   <p>Its aim is to encourage the Ukrainian college students to join this club, as well as other fraternities and societies. By joining this student club, they can exchange ideas with other members; by joining other clubs and societies they can help their respective communities by influencing them with new, fresh, and useful ideas. The students should be like cement which unites firmly, and they should carry this spirit of union to communities at large; in them they should encourage the youth to get a higher education.</p>
   <p>We need well-educated and well-trained people in intellectual fields. The slogan of the student club is, action!</p>

   <p>The officers of the Club Monomach appeal to the Ukrainian youth not only in Chicago, but also in the entire United States, to establish similar clubs all over America and thus unite us directly or indirectly.</p>
   <p>Considering Chicago the possible future center of the Ukrainian students in the United States, we ask each and every Ukrainian student to write us his biography, particularly what he studies, in what college, what academic year as well as the circumstances or hardships under which he studies. In this way we shall be able to get a general review of favorable and otherwise conditions, which will assist us in organizing the Ukrainian-American student body into one solid unit.</p>
