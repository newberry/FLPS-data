   <p>The Administration of the Ukrainian Student Association in Germany turns to their brothers in America for material aid for the Ukrainian students organized into this association. The basis of its appeal is the difficult and distressing circumstances in which these Ukrainian students at institutions of higher learning find themselves--students driven from their own soil by their enemies. We are sure that our brief petition will find an echo in the hearts of our brothers who always express their sympathy in such circumstances by extending the hand of brotherly aid, thereby rescuing these students from starvation, and at the same time paving the way for them in the world of truth and learning, to the honor and glory of the Ukrainian people. We hope that our brothers from across the sea will not turn us down this time, and the Administration of the association extends to all sincere contributors its highest thanks.
