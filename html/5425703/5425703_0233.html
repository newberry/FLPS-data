   <p>During the early part of 1925, the Ukrainian group at Oakley and Rice Streets, organized a band composed of boys from ten to eighteen years of age. The name of the band is "The Ukrainian Scout Band of Chicago." The St. Nicholas Church Parish purchased the instruments, which cost nearly two thousand dollars. The idea of organizing a band came from Mr. Stephen Musiychuk and Mr. Simeon Kochy, both well-known as workers in the Ukrainian nationalist, as well as in the musical field. It was not easy to make this idea come to pass.</p>
   <p>With the arrival of Rev. Father F. Tarnawsky, everyone began to cooperate in this work. The band now has fifty members. Its director, John Barabash, director of music in the Harrison High School of Chicago, is known to everyone as the only Ukrainian to hold such a position in the field of music in America. The assistant director is Mr. Stephen Musiychuk; Mr. Simeon Kochy, a student of medicine who will shortly become one of our Ukrainian physicians, is business manager.</p>
   <p>The band made its first appearance on Apr. 5, 1925 while Bishop Bohachewsky was in Chicago. The large crowd greatly admired these young musicians, especially because they had studied only three months. The future of the Scout Band looks very promising. The Ukrainians of Chicago are proud to have people among them who know how to carry out enterprises like this. In the near future this band will be known not only in Chicago, but throughout the United States as well.</p>
