   <p>The Ukrainian Art Circle in cooperation with the Ukrainian Women's Benevolent Aid Society, will hold an art exhibit, on November 15-16. inclusive, of this year, in the Art Club's quarters, at 2406 W. Chicago Avenue. (Sitch Home).</p>
   <p>The exhibition will be a grand one, with the newest drawings, and objects of fine arts, including also valuable things from our war for liberation in 1918-1920.</p>
   <p>The materials come mostly from the private collection of Mr. Kochan in Joliet, Illinois. Together with all this, there will be the objects that Madam Kochan is bringing into Chicago from Europe in a day or so, for she is on her way home to America.</p>
   <p>Among the objects of the exhibition, there will be an alloted place for Miss O. Kulchitsky's newest art works, the achievement of her own hands, one of these being the personification of our armed forces, starting with the early days of our history and ending with the beginning of the "Sitch Military Athletic Organization" in the year 1918.</p>
   <p>We must state here, that the fine arts was a neglected field on part of our people. Because of the continuous wars, our people had to wage against their enemies, there was not much time to cultivate our own arts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>That is why we should praise those, that among us, have undertaken such a prominent task as the Art Exhibition.</p>
   <p>We should also rejoice because our younger generation and particularly the women, testify to the fact that they have the sence of beauty and the fondness for such fine things as our national art.</p>
   <p>Also our songs, that win first prize everywhere and our historical music (kobza) and dances, were given a proper place in our Art Exhibition at the Museum.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainian Art Circle in conjunction with the Women's Benevolent Aid Society--appeals to the Ukrainians of Chicago to visit the Art Exhibit on the 15th and 16th of this month.</p>
