   <p>During the month of September youth activity was again reopened by two organizations, the Red Cross Club and the RHO Chi Gamma Sorority, who on two separate occasions successively sponsored dances.</p>
   <p>In October, the lead for activities was undertaken by the Ukrainian American Catholic Youth, more widely known as Moloda Ukraina. On October 5th this organization conducted a special social to which club members and their guests were invited. The refreshments imparted to the eaters a delicious flavor; the games supplied hilarious amusement; and the social dancing proved to be a delightful recreation. On the 31st of October - on Hallowe'en night - the same club sponsored a costume dance to which participants came garbed in costumes, whereas those who arrived costumeless were given masks. The ballroom was a gay color of disguised dancers enwrapped by floating and bursting balloons and whirling confetti. The profit earned at the dance was designated to the St. Nicholas church for building use.</p>
   <p>Another club has been organized which is for junior and senior girls. The guidance of this club has been undertaken by the Basilian Sisters, and it is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>known as the "Sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary". At present the members are interested in fine handwork. They are learning to knit, tat and do Ukrainian embroidery. During the course of these weekly instructions and while the girls' fingers are engrossed in activity, interesting discussions and conversations are carried on.</p>
