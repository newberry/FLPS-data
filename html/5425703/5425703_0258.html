   <p>It seems only yesterday that the Ukrainian Youth came out for the first time; only yesterday since we, with confidence in the Ukrainian people, confidence in ourselves, confidence in good deeds, and with prayer on our lips, spread our wings and sent to flight the first issue of the official organ of Ukrainian Catholic Youth League. Yet, it is three years already, three years this month.</p>
   <p>Three years has this magazine been our friend and teacher, encouraging us, inspiring us, teaching us to love our own, our church, and country. All this time it has been anchoring brother to brother, brother to sister, parents to children, and children to parents. It has been enlightening us, the members of the Ukrainian second generation on this continent, about the faith and country of our fathers. It has been striving to show us the beauty of our faith, rite, and nationality, and the reasons for the subjugation of Ukrainia. It has been awakening in us a love for all that is Ukrainian, and instilling in us the determination to defend our own, be it church or country.</p>

   <p>Three years does not seem such a long time, and yet it is long enough to put any publication through a test. It is enough to throw the worthless into oblivion and to spur the valuable on the road of success.</p>
   <p>Our publication has withstood this test. It has not only passed the trial, and a severe one at that, but has established a name for itself, a name that may well be envied by many for what other youth publications in the English language can claim. For three years it has been published by the youth, for the youth! What other publication of this calibre can boast that it has not been financially dependent upon an organization of the older generation? None.</p>
   <p>Yet the Ukrainian Youth can. The youth felt a need for its own publication. With high hopes it established one, and now with satisfaction it may gaze at the result.</p>
   <p>Only three years old and yet this publication has been tested "with sword and fire." It has come out of this struggle successfully. In <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>spite of oppositions, it has never forsaken its ideals, but has firmly held its ground and fought for God and country.</p>
   <p>However, why should we compliment this faithful servant. Actions speak for themselves and readers of the Ukrainian Youth. If anyone does deserve compliments, it is the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League, the organization which mothers this child of ours. To this organization compliments are in order, compliments, not of words only but of deeds.</p>
   <p>Complimentary words are pleasant to the ear, and may even be necessary for moral support, but they are not sufficient. Show the League and the Ukrainian Youth your appreciation by enlarging the membership of the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League with the enrolment of your club, compliment it by gaining another subscriber for the Ukrainian Youth, or by renewing your own subscription if it has expired. Celebrate the third birthday of the Ukrainian Youth by sponsoring an affair for the press fund of the paper. Everywhere and at all times, by word and deed, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>spread the good name of this publication, and work hand in hand with the Ukrainian Youth and Ukrainian Catholic Youth League for the highest ideals possible, for God and country.</p>
