   <p>Now, as never before, we realize the vast importance of dealing with youth problems. We must be aware of the grave responsibility that is to be undertaken by those who are more conscientious for the good of our church and the Ukrainian people in providing the training that is so essential for future men and women. Unless the proper steps are taken to do the utmost for those who are in the ranks of boys and girls, we will never be assured of a bright future.</p>
   <p>My one great ambition is to offer the boys and girls of our diocese the opportunities of having a well planned system of training in character along the lines offered by an organization that is so well known to the active boy and girl - the Boy and Girl Scouts. It is with the consent of our good bishop that I am encouraged to do something for Catholic Scouting among the Ukrainians here in America. Since it has been demonstrated by tests made here in America that more than three out of every four boys want to be Scouts, I think that every effort should be made to help these boys understand real training in our duty to God, our Country and to ourselves. With the cooperation of all those interested in Scouting, we can accomplish much in a short time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Boy Scouts Headquarters have very kindly instructed me to work with the plans introduced by the Catholic Committee on Scouting and authorized me as a Special National Field Scout Commissioner to have contact with all those troops in Ukrainian Catholic parishes and to organize others and have them properly represented as one organized Catholic Ukrainian Scout Movement meriting an Ukrainian flag to be among those of other nationalities. Thus far we have some troops organized under local auspices but we must strive for recognition of Catholic and national significance.</p>
   <p>In order to make the first step, let everyone that is not yet a Scout consider whether he or she would like to take the following oath and benefit from the countless advantages of Scouting;</p>
   <p>On my honor I will do my best -</p>
   <p>1) To do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law.</p>
   <p>2) To help other people at all times.</p>
   <p>3) To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>If you really see the beauty of this oath and are interested, go to your pastor and ask him about the possibilities of organizing a local troop. I am sure that you will find great encouragement. In order to help the parish priests who have so many other things to occupy their time, I have the duty to help them by trying to solve the problems that are bound to arise. The local pastor is also your troop's spiritual advisor and the local troop is dependent upon him for advice. My work will be to help each and every group through cooperating with your pastor. I cannot act without his knowledge and help. So let's get started with something real for the boys and girls. The Ukrainian Catholic Youth League is going to offer every opportunity to help organize the Ukrainian Catholic Boy and Girl Scouts of America.</p>
   <p>NOTE: Please inform me of troops already organized in the diocese. I ask the pastors to kindly offer a helping hand for the sake of the good of our boys and girls.</p>
