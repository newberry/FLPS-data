   <p>In November of last year, at the Greek Catholic Church of St. Nicholas, in the large church hall, there was organized by M. Darkowicz, artist, an evening school of the Ukrainian Dance and ballet.</p>
   <p>The congregation of the church, has seen in the new school, an honest, national activity, and it undertook to keep up the school for many months.</p>
   <p>Over 100 children have attended the lessons, with which Mr. Darkowicz has given several concerts in the local church hall, and outside its walls.</p>
   <p>For the summer holiday months, the school has ceased its work.</p>
   <p>The dancers are getting new strength, and energy, in order that in the beginning of the fall, they may again eagerly continue the work already started.</p>
   <p>The whole course of the last period was continued under the direction and care of the artist alone. At the end of the course, the congregation has seen the importance of this school, and for the greater success of the work, has created the school committee.</p>

   <p>At the beginning of the school season, the committee undertook as its duty, to enlarge the local school, and to spread it in other sections of the city.</p>
   <p>The parents, who have not yet sent their children to this ballet school from the beginning, are asked to enroll them now, and send them to take lessons for their own, and the national benefit.</p>
   <p>The advanced pupils should take care, that their ability in this art, should not fail them, and that, at the near season of the school year, they may be rewarded by applause in the largest theatres in Chicago.</p>
