   <p>On March 1, 1922, the Central Headquarters of the Siege Organization, with its offices in Chicago, elected me as its chief executive. Herein I wish to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to all those Siege branches that voted in my favor as well as those who refrained from voting, possibly due to some good reason.</p>
   <p>In taking the required oath the central staff imposed on me this sacred duty: to do my full share in trying to spread and strengthen the Siege Organization.</p>
   <p>I took the oath to follow the Siege by-laws, and in the meantime I wish to remind you, Siege members, that you also took the very same oath.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Dear Siege members, the duty imposed on me by the executives of the Siege organization was also indirectly imposed by you. Yet, I cannot fulfill them without your generous help.</p>
   <p>In my opinion, my election to this office was possibly most opportune. However, my orders and your full cooperation must go hand-in-hand in order to reach the desired end.</p>
   <p>The Siege organization came to a stand still, as far as I can see, due to two principal causes: 1) Lack of discipline and cooperation; 2) unwelcome habits of breaking decrees or not touching them at all.</p>
   <p>I accepted the office as the head of the Siege Central Staff with this one aim in view: to do away with everything that would be an impediment to the organization. I am sure that with your wholehearted help we shall be able to accomplish those great things for which the organization was primarily established.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Siege by-laws paragraph 21, article VI, reads that the decisions of the chief executive (Otaman) with his assistants, in all things pertaining to the business of the organization, have full force and can be changed or annulled only by a general convention.</p>
   <p>According to this paragraph I, with the consent of the entire executive staff, am obliged to send out to all branches of the Siege organization the following orders:</p>
   <p>1) The district head officers' attention is called to the fact that up to April 29, 1922, all their members' dues accounts are to be straightened out. Paragraph 65, article IX, of the Siege by-laws is to be explained so that the contents of the paragraph refer only to single branches or to their individual members.</p>
   <p>2) Headquarters must recieve all the members' dues and contributions to the press fund one month ahead, that is on the day of the 29 of each <span class="page-break">4</span>preceding month. Dues of twenty cents per member each Siege branch office must collect and forward to the Central Headquarters on the time specified above.</p>
   <p>3) Let it be known to all members that not only membership dues, but also subscriptions for the Siege News are to be paid in advance. That is, everything must be paid up by April 29, according to the new ruling.</p>
   <p>4) Now, on March 29, the district head officers should see to it that an exact account is sent to the Central Headquarters so that extracts of their doings can be published in the Siege News. The main topic being their athletic activity. The central office must know where, and how many members take part in athletics, and what percentage do not.</p>
   <p>5) It is also commanded that the district heads see to it that each branch commander gives time, during every monthly meeting and before or after weekly athletic exercises, for discussion of questions of popular sciences, and thus help the members broaden their horizon of general knowledge.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>6) It is commanded that at no meeting or gathering of any kind, there be any dispute, quarrel, outright antipathy, or unnecessary offense directed against any political party or religious sect that may differ from ours.</p>
   <p>7) It is commanded that all district commanders and assistants keep in mind that all weekly athletic gatherings as well as all monthly Siege meetings should open and close with this command: "Company, attention!" While doing this the right hand should rest on the chest, thus they should remain silent for one minute. During this silence every one should think and strongly desire independence for Urkrainia. Then the national anthem should follow.</p>
   <p>8) We appeal to all district and branch officers to inform their members that by April 1, a new password will be sent out to all the officers, and they will communicate it down to every member of their branch or company.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>9) We appeal to all district and branch officers as well as all Siege members to see to it that at no time should anyone give out those passwords to anyone but Siege members. This is to prevent the possible presence of an enemy at any meeting, thus causing unnecessary disturbances.</p>
   <p>10) It is the duty of all district officers and assistants to see to it that their district councils are regularly conducted, and that the above commands and appeals are complied with by themselves and members. The officers have the right to punish, according to Siege by-laws, those of their members who do not fulfill their obligations.</p>
   <p>11) All orders and commands from the commander-in-chief are to be read immediately after the first command of attention, and as soon as all those present are accounted for. The United States Army discipline is to be followed as closely as possible.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>12) It is the duty of the officers at the head of districts to inform and notify their branch officers, and these, their subordinates and the rest of their Siege members, of anything that is to take place in their own branches and districts. In a similar way, all are to be informed of general doings of the whole Siege Organization.</p>
