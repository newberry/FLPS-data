   <p>The Ukrainian Youth League of North America is approaching another milestone, its Fourth Annual Congress, to be held in Philadelphia over the Labor Day week-end. The young Ukrainian Nationalists take this opportunity to extend to the youth gathered at the congress their sincerest greeting and hope that the congress will use its wisdom and foresight in a manner that will bring most good for the Ukrainian cause.</p>
   <p>The youth attending the Fourth Congress will have gained much in experience since last year. Perhaps a greater number has learned that youthful enthusiasm must be tempered by the wisdom and experience of the older generation. Perhaps a greater number will realize that not everything our fathers did was bad. Such realization will tend for better cooperation and greater progress. Youth and age must stand shoulder to shoulder because the holy cause of Ukraine's independence demands this.</p>
   <p>The youth will look into the future and decide what course to pursue. As the future can only be judged by the past, the youth must avoid the pitfalls of past mistakes. If the liberation of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian territories is our ultimate end, then let us proceed as did other nations that aspired to be free. The youth must bear in mind that those nations that are independent today had to have their Banderas, Lebeds, Danylyshyns, Bilases and Bassarabs.</p>
   <p>We have no right to believe ourselves to be the "chosen people of God." Nor have we the right to be indifferent to the struggles of our kinsmen across the sea. We, the youth, cannot wash our hands of the matter and say it is of no concern to us, lest we stand condemned in the eyes of the world as Pontius Pilate stands condemned by the christian world.</p>
