   <p>On Sunday, September 5, at 2:30 o'clock, in Eckhart Park Hall, Chicago Avenue and Noble Street, there will be a speech given to inform the Ukrainian youth who are planning to enroll in the day or night courses with the new school semester.</p>
   <p>Countrymen, the war is already ended, and now begins the reconstruction which is needed mostly by Ukrainia. All the nations are preparing for this work but alas! we Ukrainians will add nothing to our Fatherland. Shall it not be a shame for us when other nations will occupy the high positions all over the world and even in Ukrainia? Will we not be ashamed of ourselves when we return to Europe without any profession or trade?</p>
   <p>In order to meet the situation the Ukrainian Circle of Self-Education obligated itself by informing the Ukrainian youth of the technical, educational and business courses. We invite all Ukrainians to this meeting, both men and women who are interested in education.</p>
