   <p>In Chicago there are twenty-five evening high schools. One may study in these schools without any obligation whatsoever. Everything that is taught in the daily city high schools is being taught therein.</p>
   <p>Those who would like to obtain some more knowledge may enroll in these schools. On completing the five years of study one will receive a diploma of the same value as is given in the day schools.</p>
   <p>In these schools 52,493 pupils have enrolled from the age of 17 to 73 years.</p>
   <p>One can rest assured that among those thousands of graduates, there is probably not one Ukrainian and if there are some, then one could count them on one's fingers.</p>
   <p>That is why we are so much oppressed; why we struggle so much both here and there and continue to pull the yoke of hardships with us, because we do not appreciate the value of education and culture sufficiently enough.</p>
