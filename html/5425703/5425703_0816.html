   <p>Among the Ukrainian workmen in the South Side of Chicago the Polish agents started a movement, recruiting as great a number of Ukrainians as they possibly could for the purpose of inducing them to take out Polish passports at their consulate, and leave for the old country. To counteract the evil, we wish to explain to our people at this meeting what danger each one of them runs into.</p>
   <p>At that meeting of October 12, 1919, there were about 250 present, including men and women. It was opened by Mr. P. Kavatsiw. In a few words he explained to those that were gathered the purpose of the meeting, and asked them to nominate a candidate for chairman of the meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. N. Moranets was unanimously elected the chairman, and Mr. Yaroslaw Skrotsky, secretary.</p>
   <p>The former thanked those that were present for the election, and once more <span class="page-break">2</span>told them of the purpose of the meeting. He expressed a deep sympathy for the Ukrainian brothers and sisters badly maltreated by the Poles in the old country, and denounced those few who do not consider the Polish yoke and atrocities as an ulcer in the very heart of every Ukrainian, who are being extremely heavily taxed even to the last penny that is verily earned with the sweat of their brows.</p>
   <p>Further, he requested of all to break off every association with the Poles, our treacherous enemies, and never listen to their advice, for their aim is to injure and not to help us.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Didyk was the next speaker. In his fiery and emotional speech he picturesquely portrayed the unbearable living conditions of our brothers and sisters in our depressed fatherland. The Ukrainians over there are ready any minute to lay down their lives for the defense of our fatherland. Yet, we, instead of helping them in their honest efforts, go to any Polack, our cursed enemy to take advice from him on how to counteract their destructive activity. Now reason this out with me: "Could <span class="page-break">3</span>there be any greater crime a Ukrainian could commit than to go to the Polish consul, take out a passport there, and swear that he is ready every minute to join their legion, and thus go and murder the enemies of mother Poland? Murder his brothers and sisters, nay, even his very father and mother, should they still be living in the wilderness without a place to lay their heads.</p>
   <p>"Brother," continued Mr. Didyk, "your father and mother are living there in caves. Who has driven them in there but the Polish knout? Have you enough conscience to give away your money, earned with the sweat of your brow, to the Pole, and thus provide for him the means to procure a stronger knout with which he will drive your father and mother deeper into the cave, whence they shall never be able to see God's world, and themselves occupy their cozy homes, making themselves comfortable in their feather-quill beds?</p>
   <p>You send clothing and footwear through the Polish agents who, instead of sending them to your wife, children or parents, are distributing them among those Polish bums who stand with knouts at the entrance of the caves in <span class="page-break">4</span>which your most beloved dwell, lest perchance they may show their heads out of the cave, their unavoidable grave, and thus in the meantime other nations may notice the horrible Polish culture."</p>
   <p>Then the speaker was trying to inspire one and all to join the Siege ranks, and if need be to be ready to stand shoulder to shoulder, and with their own lives protect and defend the Ukrainian land against the Polish captivity.</p>
   <p>Once more he called all to unity and unanimity, and to know and understand the hostile work of the Polish agents against us. A thundering ovation was given him at the end of his speech.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kavatsiw was the next speaker. In his speech he pictured the life of the forefathers of Ukrainia, and compared it with the present captivity in which our Ukrainian brothers suffer under the Polish and Russian governments.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Now Mr. Yaroslaw Skrotsky read and explained to those present all sorts of information with reference to sending out money and parcels to the old country. This information was issued by the Ukrainian Exchange Bureau of Chicago, wherein those Ukrainians are employed who are well known for their merits and work in the national field.</p>
   <p>Lastly Mrs. Mary Bilyk spoke on behalf of the Ukrainian Red Cross. She moved all those present to tears, who contributed $86.30 for widows and orphans in the old country. She also invited those gathered for the following Sunday, Nov. 19, for a special meeting of the Ukrainian Red Cross.</p>
   <p>As before, so on November 19, there was a great number of men and women present. After hearing the speeches of Mrs. Mary Bilyk, Harry Kryvovyaz, and Yaroslaw Skrotsky, they understood better the object of the Ukrainian Red Cross, and without any encouragement on the part of the speakers, they contributed $22.55, which makes with the former collection $108.85.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The chairman thanked those present for listening attentively and for supporting the Ukrainian cause.</p>
   <p>The meeting ended with the national anthems, "Ukrainia is already arisen," and "We, Knights."</p>
   <p>All left the hall with a resolution to contribute materially to the cause and fight even to the giving up of one's life, if need be, until that time when the Ukraine shall be a free and independent state.</p>
   <p>Yaroslaw Skotsky</p>
   <p>Secretary of the Meeting.</p>
