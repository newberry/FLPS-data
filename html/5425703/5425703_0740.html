   <p>We, the undersigned, hereby call all the Ukrainians that served in the American army, whether or not they are connected with any legion in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>The purpose is to think over how to organize one powerful Ukrainian organization of military people.</p>
   <p>Today we live through such times in our national Ukrainian affairs that all the thinking Ukrainians should be duly organized, and especially those that are devoted to the service of the people.</p>
   <p>Scattered in all parts of Chicago, residing far from each other, the military Ukrainians, such as the legionaires and the civilians as well, should be all duly organized.</p>
   <p>No one knows how soon the bell may sound that Ukraine is liberated and made a free state.</p>
   
   <p>All understanding the value of this call are requested to write in care of the Ukrainia by addressing the envelope to the "Legionaire."</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>John Vorobetz</p>
   <p>John Sinuk</p>
   <p>Theodore Dutkanich</p>
   <p>John Dutkanich</p>
   <p>Leo Tiahnibyk</p>
