   <p>Out of a class of thirty-five students which commenced in December 1933, nearly 50% of the students have dropped out within two months, while the balance which is still with the air corps did not qualify due to non-attendance and poor showings in the studies. The following students which numbered 15 have done excellent work and are certainly well recommended for flight training. They are Steve Szczuiko, Chas. Dobra, Walter Shkaba, Russell Koshinsky, Mike Sachno, Julia Shpoiluck, Paul Bahry, Helen Seniw, Helen Fitza, Roman Ulane, Steve Wysochan and Ann Chujko.</p>
   <p>We have covered the following subject: Aereodynamics, engine theory, maps and map reading, navigation, meterology, instruments, inspection and maintenance, and air commerce regulations. The total class hours 144 hours. Once again I appeal to all Ukrainian people to cooperate with our organization and make it possible for us to give these students all the necessary flight training they need. Every Ukrainian should pay great attention to the development of aviation and should help to develop our aeronautical clubs to a larger scale if he wishes to see our mother Ukraine a great Ukrainian Empire among the leading power of the future.</p>
