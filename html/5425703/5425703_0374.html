   <p>The following regulation becomes obligatory, as soon as you read it in this issue of our Sitch newspaper: The district and branch secretaries must introduce a numerical system, and keep the copies of the correspondence sent out and received pertaining to the Sitch organization business in this manner. Carrying out of this order consists in this: every communication in writing sent out by a branch or district must have a consecutive number. This same number should be written out on the first copy, and in the secretary's recording book, with a short notation to whom the writing was sent out, and the nature of business. For instance: A letter (or post card), No... Re: The Organization Newspaper, or money, or uniforms, etc. To the office of the chief executive; or to the newspaper administration; or to the merchant, etc. In important matters, do not fail to make and keep a copy of such letter with the same number.</p>
   <p>Every written communication must have the place, date, and year, of mailing. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Also every communication received by the branch or district must have a register number, when it was received (month, day, year), giving it also a consecutive number of the mail received. All correspondence should be kept on file for at least five years; important correspondence should never be destroyed.</p>
   <p>Correspondence to the chief executive should be addressed thus:</p>
   <p>The Chief Executive</p>
   <p>2406 West Chicago Avenue</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>Every communication from the major of the Sitch district must have two signatures: that of the major, and of the district secretary. Also there should be two signatures accompanying each letter from every branch: a signature of the branch captain, and of his secretary. A communication of an official nature should be under seal.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>All private correspondence should not be mixed with official business. Otherwise, it will bring up a misunderstanding, and a possible complication that finally may hurt the organization.</p>
   <p>Every Sitch member has the right and privilege to write directly to the chief executive, only then, when his matter was not satisfactorily settled by his district major. Of course, every Sitch member should not take recourse to his respective district major, unless his matter did not get proper attention by the branch captain.</p>
   <p>District majors and branch captains should explain this to all their respective Sitch members, at their next branch and district meetings in order that this order of correspondence be preserved and not otherwise.</p>
   <p>The chief executive answers the complaints through the district authority, branch captain, or directly to the one who is complaining, if such tactics are required. The district majors should do likewise.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>In case of necessity, the branch secretaries should communicate with the district secretaries for more detailed explanations in the matter of official communications and correspondence.</p>
   <p>Chief Executive.</p>
