   <p>The resolutions passed at the Fifth Siege Convention for a reorganization of the Siege organization require a more thorough explanation, because, until the present time, we did not have such fundamental changes in any of our organizations. Therefore, our people will find it difficult to become accustomed to such great changes. For this reason it is necessary, especially at the beginning, to explain the changes in the by-laws at every meeting, until all Siege members in general become accustomed to them. These explanations repeated many times, will strengthen the organization.</p>
   <p>Ruling Body Strengthened</p>
   <p>The most important change has been in the status of the Chief Executive; it has been unanimously strengthened. Does that mean that now he has become an absolute dictator of the organization? This is not so, he has only become its first real executive, particularly where the interest of the organization requires it. Already at the Convention, in the matter regarding financial secretaries, the Chief Executive agreed to their election, and the only thing he reserved for himself was his approval of them. There is a twofold benefit out of it: 1) The organization will have confidence in the financial secretaries elected and approved by him; 2) In case of necessity, the Chief Executive will have the power to immediately stop any disorder or irregularity and order a new election of them or of any other officer.</p>
   <p>The By-Laws of the Organization</p>
   <p>The by-laws, which will be prepared and placed before all the members for referendum, will give the rules of the organization to which even the Chief Executive will have to submit. Every officer will also have to comply with the by-laws, because he is the head of his own branch or detail, and therefore responsible for his charges.</p>
   
   <p>The strengthened power of the Chief Executive refers particularly to matters of the organization. In matters of general public interest, the Chief Executive will act according to the decisions of the whole Executive Staff, including the District Majors.</p>
   <p>The Chief Executive and His Officers</p>
   <p>According to the opinion of the Chief Executive, the purpose of the by-laws is that its authority in the whole Organization is to be the same as that of the Chief Executive, as well as that of the District Officers. This means that the Chief Executive is first among the Knights of the Round Table. The only difference being that the Chief Executive's activity is much larger, for it includes the whole Organization, and therefore, his authority is much greater.</p>
   <p>The Chief Executive has the right and privilege, when making appointments, of also cancelling or taking them away, in case the appointed persons do not fulfill their duties. This is a universal order. An officer can keep his commission only as long as he fulfills his obligations in accordance with the by-laws of his organization.</p>
   
   <p>District, Circuit, and Company Officers</p>
   <p>From now on, the organization as a whole will be represented by the Chief Executive; every District, Circuit, and Company will be represented by its head, or officer, according to the by-laws of the organization--no laxity there.</p>
   <p>All misunderstandings in the Companies will be settled by their Captains, after he has heard both sides of the stories. In case there is a misunderstanding in the District, the District Major will take care of that. The Chief Executive is the highest authority, of course, in any case that might arise in the organization.</p>
   <p>Obey Well if You Want to Command Well</p>
   <p>Thus reorganized, Siege shall flourish and grow, because its officers will really deserve respect from all the people, and this will be so because they will strive to be upright and hard workers. Let us not worry, the people will always highly respect upright and active officers, and thereby the Siege organization will be strengthened in its prestige and in every other way. The officer, who will snow subordination and discipline to his superiors, will surely command subordination from his inferiors, and general respect from the people. This is the way it always was, is, and shall be throughout the world.</p>
   <p>Successful Beginning Alone is Insufficient:</p>
   <p>Successful End Will be the Crown of our Work</p>
   <p>All the members of the Siege organization have the opportunity to witness and take part in the pioneer reorganization and strengthening of the cause for liberation of our Nation. Therefore, every honorable member and every honorable man in general, will support our work in every way possible now that it has been reorganized. Tactful and prudent officers should always listen to the ideas and thoughts of the most highly respected members, and good members should always respect their superiors and officers, even though their ideas may differ, or not coincide with the opinion of the masses. Thus we shall be able to build a great and powerful organization, which in turn will become an example of unity and discipline for the whole Ukrainian Nation. And thus training the whole Ukrainian Nation we shall reach our highest aim, the Independent Ukrainian State, which will take care of all Ukrainians irrespective of their creed or party.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in agreeable broad-mindedness, let us all support our organization, which has a great aim. This, which for us is just a trial, for other nations is already a reality. This gave them their strength. Let us, therefore, one and all see to it that our trial also becomes a reality.</p>
