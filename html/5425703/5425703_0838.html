   <p>John Barabash, son of Eugenia and Gabriel Barabash, was born in the village of Zarudia, Ternopil County, Ukrainia. After finishing grammar school, he left Ukrainia for Hanover, Germany, where he had a good opportunity to hear different sorts of good music. There he received his first inspiration, and determined to give himself to the study of music.</p>
   <p>In December, 1912, he arrived in New York, and then went on to Chicago, where his two brothers, Martin and Thomas were living. Soon he joined the Chicago Ukrainian, under the name of Taras Shevchenko Band, and later on he played a trombone in the Chicago City Band. On the side, however, it was his ambition to reorganize and better the Ukrainian band. This he succeeded in doing, and made great progress with it.</p>
   <p>In 1917 he joined the American army, 131st Infantry. Later, as a first-class musician, he was transferred to the 44th regiment, and from there sent to the military band school. After finishing this he became a conductor of a military band and had thirty-five musicians to supervise. In a short time he made such a good showing with the band that he recieved high official praise, which was published in the Chicago Daily Tribune, and he became a candidate for first lieutenant at the time the Armistice was signed.</p>
   <p>Upon his return, he left the army and obtained a position as a player in three Chicago theatres.</p>
   <p>At this time he studied harmony of music at the Chicago Musical College, and attended Harrison High School, where he had obtained a position as conductor of the Harrison Technical High School Band. As conductor there he made wonderful progress. Besides all this work, he did everything possible to change Ukrainian amateurs into real musicians.</p>
   <p>One of his best qualities was that when he was appointed conductor of the army band, he attracted the attention of not only American admirers of music but also Ukrainians, and other nationalities, who all wondered at the skill and deftness of the talented young conductor. Everywhere in the city among musicians as well as lovers of music, one could hear admirers of John Barabash predict a great career for him.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainians of Chicago cherish high hopes for John Barabash; it is a commonly anticipated belief that he will become the best band conductor among the Ukrainians in the whole United States, and thus he will help to spread the fame of the glorious Ukrainian songs throughout America.</p>
   <p>[The prophesy of the people about him was correct, and the proof of it is that in about 1935 the Harrison Technical High School Band, under the leadership of Captain John Barabash won first prize in the United States.</p>
   <p>The secret of his success is strict discipline with himself and with his students, as well as untiring hard work coupled with determination and a strong will. Transl.]</p>
