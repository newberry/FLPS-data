   <p>We received your letter of March 10 with the donation and wish to thank you cordially for it.</p>
   <p>May we appeal to you again that you remember our Ukrainian Vernacular School in the Old Country?</p>
   <p>During these grave moments which our people have to live through, the important activity left to us is to organize Ukrainian Vernacular Schools everywhere possible on the Ukrainian occupied land. At present many Ukrainians do not as yet fully understand the actual weight and importance of such school activity and they thereby create obstacles. By and by they also will get accustomed, will fall in line and contribute monthly to the Vernacular School, for such is our lot under the enemy's occupation <span class="page-break">2</span>of this part of our country, i.e., Eastern Galicia, Cholm, Podolia, Volynia, Bukovinia. We wish to stress that a General Ukrainian Congress, regardless of parties, was called and it decided the following:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the Ukrainian Vernacular Schools are entirely cultural, non-partisan, and at the present time the most important institutions, they must and will be supported by all Ukrainians, regardless of their individual political concepts."</p>
   <p>The budget of these private Ukrainian Vernacular Schools is 6,000,000 Polish marks per month, but to have the schools conducted successfully it is necessary to have 15,000,000 Polish marks per month.</p>
   <p>We turn to you with this humble petition of ours, yes, to you, Ukrainian-American women. Forward with us to spontaneous activity, to spread the idea of the Ukrainian Vernacular Schools in the Old Country. Help our countrymen beyond the seas to tax themselves voluntarily one per cent on their monthly income.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>To facilitate this aim we are sending to you one hundred copies of the jubilee pamphlet of the Ukrainian Pedagogical Society, which copies, please distribute personally or by mail to well-known persons.</p>
   <p>In anticipation that you will comply with our appeal and become an active member of the Ukrainian Vernacular School, we in advance cordially thank you.</p>
   <p>Wishing you the very best of luck,</p>
   <p>Very respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Ukrainian Pedagogical Association,</p>
   <p>Department Vernal School</p>
