   <p>The newly organized U.H.O. Co. 3 will participate both in the Easter parade and the guarding of the holy sepulcher. The company which consists of 20 members, expects to have fourteen of them turned out in uniform for the holiday.</p>
   <p>One of the most important subjects that was brought up at a recent meeting was the modification of the uniform. The conclusion at which the members had arrived (if they did) was not known when this article went to press, but, I am sure that they have something in the order of a surprise in store for us. I am sure that their drilling of last year, for every member, although rusty, on account of the fact that their last drill was about six months ago, has made up his mind, that, during the few drill practices that are left before Easter, he will polish off the rust by strenuous work.</p>
