   <p>The district commander must see to it that either the secretary or, he himself, gives a thorough report of all the activities of the Siege branches, which should include the following items:</p>
   <p>1) The total number of members in the district; how many male, how many female.</p>
   <p>2) How often they hold drills, and how many attend these drills.</p>
   <p>3) Where the drills are held.</p>
   <p>4) If the local Siege branches are preparing for any Siege festival, play, concert, or dance, and if so, the time and place.</p>
   <p>5) If there are any enemies of the Siege movement, in the district; who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>they are, and in what way do they do this harm.</p>
   <p>6) If there are any members who harm the Siege movement, and if so, who they are.</p>
   <p>7) If all the members of the Siege read Sichovi Visty; give names of those who do not subscribe, and why.</p>
   <p>8) If the Siege has its own chorus, music, uniforms, library, equipment for gymnastics, and if not, why.</p>
   <p>Sending in such reports every month will enable the editors of the Siege organ to drive for a livelier Siege movement. All such reports should be in the editor's office not later then the twentieth of the month.</p>
