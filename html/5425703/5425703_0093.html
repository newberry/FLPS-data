   <p>The unemployment in the United States has been a burden on the poor people, among them many Ukrainians. A great deal of our people live through this taxing situation now.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, it is well known that the more energetic and capable people of our nationality hold offices in dignified enterprises and factories, positions such as foremen, bosses and managers.</p>
   <p>To such as these we turn with the following proposition--to let us know kindly when and where work could be found whereby we could place some of the unemployed Ukrainians, that ask us to help them.</p>
   <p>Please inform the "Ukrainia" when and where people are needed for work; let us know as soon as some help is required--by telephone--Brunswick 3937, and we shall at once send thither people that ask our aid.</p>
   <p>We shall thus do a good turn reciprocally and profitable for the good of our colony in our city.</p>
   <p>Please bear this in mind!</p>
