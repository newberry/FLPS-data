   <p>When we think upon important obligations that women have to fulfill and the influence that they have on the national life, we shall then see what a wife means to a husband, a mother to children, a housewife to a household.</p>
   <p>Can a husband expect enjoyment in life when in marriage - in this purest union of mutual associations - he sees only the misfortunes? What will happen to children who are the future generations of all nations, when the mother neglects them from the very beginning of their existence?</p>
   <p>Housewives destroy homes or build them. On them depends the question of the family's prosperity and health, or its misfortune and dissolution. A sensible woman builds the home while a foolish woman wrecks it with her own hands, says the national proverb.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Where a home has a decent, understanding housewife, the home is the abode of peace, of concord, and of love. When a woman abandons the great purpose with which she is charged by the very nature of her position; where she merely exists in the family, neglecting to develop her spiritual qualities, and living a worthless, useless life - in such a home the beauty of life is lost, and in its stead comes discord, hatred and misfortunes.</p>
   <p>Our women should take this under consideration. They should understand their obligations, and thus find the source of evil hiding in their families.</p>
   <p>What are we women to do here in America? Our life seethes with confusion. We settle in the slums and do not show ourselves in public life among the people. With this inactivity no cause, neither our own personal affairs, nor our national life, is of any interest to us.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We think that we are created only to look well while young, to dress well, to work hard for others. Sometimes we go to dances and eventually we get married. Then we grow old and die, leaving behind us no fond remembrances. This is the life of a servant, a slave, a purposeless creature, and unworthy serf. We must remember we are rational beings.</p>
   <p>It must not continue like this. We, the Ukrainian women, must learn to think independently, to gaze at the world with our own eyes, and interest ourselves with things of public and national importance. When we put this question to ourselves: "What are nations?" After a thorough consideration, we come to the conclusion that they are a union of families, which have a great deal in common. It is evident at once that every mother of a family has the greatest obligation to carry out. Obligations imposed upon women should not confine themselves only to one's own family by blood, but should spread themselves to <span class="page-break">\4</span>the families of one's native people. The existence of a nation requires work in community life with all its sons. Without work the nation fails.</p>
   <p>Yet all do not work with us. That is why the cause of women has laid the burden of this message upon us, of asking all the members of Ukrainian families, including women, to work for the national cause.</p>
   <p>Nature provided us with the heart and the courage to stand. With these qualities every husband is able to stand. When we, the women, devote ourselves. to the national cause we shall bring to the work all those men that still sleep shamelessly.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainian nation is carrying on an obstinate fight now for its existence. Beyond the ocean, in our native land, they all work harmoniously together for the independence of their fatherland. They call upon us to be ready to help them. As with other nations, so it <span class="page-break">\5</span>is with us. Women should be the very fire, the zeal, the warmth that adds willingness to the fighters in a war for a better lot.</p>
   <p>We are lucky that we have lived to see the long looked-for moment of the liberation of the Ukrainian nation and its soil. We are lucky and glad. But let us remember that our nation is ruined by war, that it needs creative strength for its existence which will make it stead-fast in attaining its aspirations. We shall stand for our native country in its great adventure. We shall return to the old country more enlightened than we left it. With due knowledge we will be in power to rear the future generations in a better way for our country. We will give to the fatherland strong and healthy sons both in spirit and in body, sons who will be able to defend our native country from its wicked enemies. There is no luck, there is no better lot in the world than that afforded by an education.</p>
   <p>Look for them, my sisters. You will find them in knowledge.</p>
