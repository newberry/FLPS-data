   <p>Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich received the following letter from the Headquarters of the American Red Cross in Washington, D.C.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>On May 19th, we received a telegram from you containing a resolution of the Mass Meeting of Americans of Ukrainian origin, held in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Our information in regard to Ukrainia has been rather unsatisfactory to date, owing to the fact that the present military situation does not make it possible for relief to be carried to that country for an organization such as the American Red Cross. However, as you probably know, the situation in Europe changes constantly. Here in Washington, we cannot hope to keep in touch with these shifting conditions, and consequently have organized a Commission for Europe which keeps in intimate touch with all European affairs and instigates relief work in various localities.</p>
   <p>As a result of your telegram, we have forwarded your resolution to our Commissioner for Europe, asking at the time that when possible he send us information in regard <span class="page-break">2</span>to what the Red Cross could do for Ukrainia. On receipt of an answer from him, I will be glad to get in touch with you.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>Philip L. Ross, Assistant to the Vice-Chairman.</p>
