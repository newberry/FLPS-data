   <p>According to the amended by-laws at the Pittsburg Convention, the members of the executive staff had the right to appoint a new chief executive in place of the one who had resigned. However, the executive staff did not do it, lest it look somewhat similar to dictatorship, but sent out ballots to all the Siege districts and branches so that they all had a chance to say whether or not Dr. Hrynevetsky would be the chief executive of the Siege Organization.</p>
   <p>The election came out as follows: The Branches: Passaic, N. J., No. 10; Chicago, Ill.: Nos. 12, 13, and 15; Youngstown, O., No. 36; Cleveland, O., No. 39; Lockwood, O., No. 40; and Gary, Ind., No. 41; all voted unanimously for Dr. Hrynevetsky as chief executive.</p>
   <p>The Branches: Philadelphis, Pa., Nos. 4, 7, 34, 43, 45 and in Frankford, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Pa., No. 25, voted to wait with the election until the next Siege Convention.</p>
   <p>The central staff guard, branch No. 6, Chicago, Ill., in the election joined the majority.</p>
   <p>The majority decided that Dr. Stephen K. Hrynevetsky be the chief executive of the Siege Organization in the United States, with its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, beginning March 1, 1922.</p>
   <p>Stephen Musiychuk, secretary.</p>
