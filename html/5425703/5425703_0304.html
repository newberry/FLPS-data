   <p>On June 9, for the first time in the world's musical history, and moreover in the history of Ukrainians, there will occur a most important and pleasant incident for us Ukrainians. On that date, the world's largest Ukrainian band, The Ukrainian Sitch Musical Society, will give its first concert on the radio, under the baton of John Barabash and sponsored by M. Zalizniak of Company 12 of Chicago. To enrich the program, there will be a violin solo by Miss Anna Motluk, an eleven-year-old artist and student of John Kobeliak, and a xylophone solo by Mr. F. Zelina. This concert will be an important one because, also our Ukrainian soprano, Mrs. Stephanie Tsymbalist, will sing some solos. She is known from her appearances in Detroit, Michigan, but is not known here. Thus, Americans and others will have an opportunity to hear our Ukrainian nightingale.</p>
   <p>This concert is not going to be an ordinary one; it will be a concert in which thousands, and even millions, of Americans and others will listen to the melodies of our native songs, both instrumental and vocal. People especially interested in music will listen to it. That is why we appeal to all Ukrainians, not only of Chicago and its suburbs, but also of all parts of the United States and Canada, to take an interest in this concert and to inform others about it. We especially appeal to those who have radios in their homes not to forget that on Saturday, June 9, 1923, between the hours of 10 and 11 P. M., they will be able to hear the first Ukrainian concert of the famous Sitch band and the soprano soloist, Mrs. Stephanie Tsymbalist, over the Drake Hotel radio station, W P A P.</p>
