   <p>Yearly elections have been a source of lively and competitive interest among youth organizations in Chicago. In early December the Ukrainian Red Cross Club called together all their members, re-elected their President, Kathryn Zuoinsky, and chose Jean Chuba to be their Vice-President; Jennie Lewtuch, Corresponding Secretary; Nettie Timetz, Financial Secretary, and Sophie Sweda, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>On January 10, 1936, another club held their annual elections--Moloda Ukraina. Unanimously, the members decided that their President, Walter Skorapad, be re-elected for another year of service. Then after well-mannered competition the following individuals succeeded to honorable positions: Katherine Panko, Vice-President; Ellen Hope Spikula, Secretary; Nicholas Lucia, Treasurer; Millie Kozak, Librarian; Genevieve Kocur was appointed by the newly-elected librarian to be assistant librarian; Peter Sweda, Substitute; Emily Oscil, Mike Kozak and George Onischuck, Auditors.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon of Sunday, January 12, 1936, still another club, Good-Will Society, conducted its annual elections. The President, Marie Lubas, and the Financial Secretary, Walter Skoropad, were unanimously re-elected. The newly-elected officers are: Mayme Gawaluch, Vice-President; Mildred Kozak, Recording Secretary, and Michael Kozak, Treasurer.</p>

   <p>Elections have not been the only interest of the youth clubs. In the afternoon of December 2, 1935, the Aviation School, which is sponsored by the Hetman Organization, sponsored a successful concert in Chopin High School Auditorium.</p>
   <p>Among the features of the program were two outstanding attractions--the note-worthy young Ukrainian violinist, whose artisically rendered performances have delighted discriminating audiences, Mr. Emil Tiahnybik, and the prize-winning Ukrainian Cossack Chorus, directed by Samuel Czuba.</p>
   <p>In February 6, 1936, the Red Cross Club sponsored a dance. On February 13, the Good-Will Society conducted a Valentine Dance. On Valentine evening, Moloda Ukraina enjoyed a social, during which business was a forgotten procedure.</p>
