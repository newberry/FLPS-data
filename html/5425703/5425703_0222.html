   <p>The 23rd day of August, 1930, will be inscribed not only in the history of the city of Chicago, but also in the history of Ukrainian Song on the American territory, as the day on which the "Ukrainian National Choir," under the direction of Mr. George Benetzky, received an acknowledgement- for the mystical accomplishment of song, first prize over all the other choirs, that took part in this contest.</p>
   <p>There were sixteen choirs in all. It is necessary to note, that the choirs which took part in the contest, were of the best that were preparing for this contest; for the contest being arranged by such a company as The Chicago Daily Tribune, one of the largest newspapers in the world. A common choir was not courageous enough to take part in it. Also, the outside choirs, that took part in the contest, were the choirs that got the first acknowledgement in their cities, and their states, and with those, the "Ukrainian Choir" took a chance in appearing for an exhibition of their talents.</p>
   <p>The contest of all the choirs started at 1:30 P.M., in the "Great Northern Theatre", at 26 West Jackson Boulevard, in the loop.</p>
   <p>The choirs were conposed of 100, 80, and 60 voices respectively. There were mixed <span class="page-break">\2</span>choirs of male and female voices, and our singers waited impatiently for their turn to come, in order to measure the beauty of the Ukrainian melody with the melodies of other people.</p>
   <p>There were Swedish, German, Russian, Negroes, and many other choirs that appeared there. The Poles, who were supposed to have taken part, did not come. There are about a half million Poles in Chicago, and they have eight choirs. It seems that they did not have enough courage.</p>
   <p>At 4 o'clock, the Ukrainian choir was called, being number thirteen on the roll. Proudly, in good order, and lively stepped on the stage, our singers of both sexes, in their wonderful Ukrainian costumes, forming a pretty semi-circle. The director, Mr. Benetzky, appearing in front, bowed to the public, gave sign to the Ukrainian choir, then, in the beginning, there was to be heard the soft humming of our "Shchedrick", and then, "Oy, na horonci."</p>
   <p>It requires one's being present, in order to understand what impression the Ukrainian melody made on the other choirs. When the Ukrainian choir finished its singing, there were voices heard in the English language, "you Ukrainians are beating all the other choirs by your melody, and your accomplishment". Even then, with some of our Ukrainians, there was hope that our choir would get the first place, <span class="page-break">\3</span>but the majority of the members of the choir, wanted to go home, not waiting for the result for they did not believe that they could, among those big and old choirs, obtain first place in the contest.</p>
   <p>At 5 o'clock in the afternoon, there appeared on the stage, the experts, the musical judges. They spoke of the practical ability of the choirs, their accomplishments, about their voices, and they said that all the choirs are of the first class, but, one of them has to win the first prize, for it is impossible for them all to get the first place.</p>
   <p>The singers of all the choirs, with great eagerness and not breathing, were waiting for the moment when their number, and name would be announced as Victor, over the rest of the choirs. At last, there appeared Mr. Nobel Cain, who was as an orderly during the contest, and pronounced number thirteen, that of the "Ukrainian National Choir," and according to the resolution of the judges, this "Ukrainian National Choir", has the first place among all the other choirs that took part in the contest, and that this choir should appear on the stage, for there, they will get all the information, regarding the appearance in the musical festival in the evening of the same day at "Soldiers Field."</p>
   <p>Right after this acknowledgement, all the other choirs made a great ovation in honor of our singers and their director.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The joy of our singers had no end. It was really worth while to be glad. Such events happen rarely in our lives.</p>
   <p>After getting the information, the "Ukrainian Choir," fully satisfied, went home, for again in the evening at 8 o'clock, it must appear in an honorable place in "Soldiers Field," (which contains over 100,000 seats) and only the Ukrainian Choir would sing over the radio, and for the audience, as the victor over all the other choirs.</p>
   <p>After supper, at the restaurant of Mr. Semeniuk, at 7:15 P.M., the Choir left for Soldiers Field," in order to be there by 8 o'clock. When they came to the place, there were thousands of automobiles, and buses, bringing over 10,000 people to see the music "Festival-Evening."</p>
   <p>Every Ukrainian heart rejoiced greatly at the notice that the Ukrainian song, for the first time would be presented in the presence of such a large gathering. (According to the American papers, there were over 150,000 listeners.)</p>
   <p>When the "Ukrainian Choir" appeared on the square, the public at this very moment greeted it with thundering applause, and the ushers led our singers to the place of honor, where an inscription in the English language was seen,- "This place is reserved for those who won the first prize."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>At 8 o'clock, "Soldiers Field" was already over-crowded, and the stream of people had not yet ceased, and it seemed as though the whole city of Chicago wanted to be present at this "Festival."</p>
   <p>The electrical reflectors in several different colors, lighted the square and threw the lights in different directions, so that the large masses of people could be easily seen... On the northern side of "Soldiers Field" were seated all the choirs, numbering 4,000 persons, that had to sing together at the end of the Festival, the "Hallelujah Chorus", from the Messiah, composition of Handel, directed by Mr. Nobel Cain, and in the middle, in a well lighted place, was seated the "Ukrainian National Choir", in Ukrainian costumes....</p>
   <p>The bugle band which consisted of over 1,300 players, opened the program of the "Festival."</p>
