   <p>While most of the city was observing Memorial Day Sunday, nearly 5,000 Chicagoans of Ukrainian descent celebrated their annual national day at Harms Park, 4200 N. Western Avenue.</p>
   <p>High mass, celebrated in the open air by the Rev. U. Kowalsky, pastor of St. Mary's Catholic Church, 4950 S. Paulina St., opened the program. Hundreds of families had arrived earlier for picnic breakfast in the grove.</p>
   <p>After the mass, dinner was served by the Daughters of the Ukraine and the Society of Olga Bessarab. The main course was the traditional "holupchy" - consisting of rice, cabbage leaves and served with mushrooms imported from the Ukraine.</p>
   <p>Folk dancing in native costumes was followed by choral selections of the Ukrainian national choir, under the direction of Alexander Yurchenko;</p>
