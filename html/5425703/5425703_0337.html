   <p>The Ukrainian District Committee of Chicago and its suburbs collected five hundred and fifty dollars for those Ukrainians who suffered from the flood in Galicia. Complying with the wishes of the contributors, they sent this sum there through the office of Bishop Bohachewsky of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned sum was raised by means of concerts, dances, plays, and many individual contributions. We hereby extend our hearty thanks to all the contributors, and further urge that, with the approaching Christmas holidays, we do not forget our poor countrymen in the old country.</p>
