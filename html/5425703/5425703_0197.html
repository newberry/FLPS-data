   <p>Welcome to you, genius of our mighty song! Welcome also to you, nightingales of the immortal melody of our dear Ukrainia!</p>
   <p>Welcome, dear countrymen, who from the far off large Ukrainia, are bringing to us that memory of murmuring groves, rustling of the wide fields of ripening rye and wheat, humming steppes, and splashing and bubbling of the mighty Dniepr and little rivulets that we have not heard for such a long time!</p>
   <p>May your mighty song sound and hum all over the world and tell all peoples and nations: Who we are, whose sons, and who our ancestors were.</p>
   <p>As long as the Ukrainian song rings in the ears of the whole world, Ukrainia lives and shall be free!</p>
   
   <p>The Ukrainian National Choir, under the leadership of its famous conductor, Alexander Koshets, will sing at Orchestra Hall, 220 S. Michigan Blvd., Chicago, on October 30, at 2 P.M. and 7 P.M.</p>
