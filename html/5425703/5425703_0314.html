   <p>To all Ukrainians in America and Canada!</p>
   <p>After the horrible ruins that were brought on by the World War, and the invasions of various "saviors," our Ukraine needs thousands of professional people and tradesmen. She also needs various equipment and machinery for her reconstruction.</p>
   <p>If she does not rebuild herself with the aid of her own children, she will have to ask for help from foreigners.</p>
   <p>Countrymen! Do we really have to depend upon foreign people and give them the opportunity of exploitation to enrich other people with our money on our soil?</p>
   <p>Remember that besides political independence people must also gain economic and industrial independence for themselves if they wish to live a true independent life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>In order to contribute to this cause we, as an organized corporation, opened the first Ukrainian machine shop in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Together with this factory there is an evening school for teaching the Ukrainian workingman the machinist, tool and diemaker's trade.</p>
   <p>The school accepts members of the company only. In order to become a member one has to have at least one fifty-dollar share. No one can have more than thirty shares in this company.</p>
   <p>The factory is in full swing and stands on solid business ground.</p>
   <p>Countrymen, profit by the good opportunity of helping the native country, and at the same time assure yourselves of a better fate!</p>
   <p>Hurry to acquire a trade knowledge, so as to return to the native country as a true profitable citizen.</p>

   <p>This company is incorporated for $30,000. We have machinery worth $15,000. We will use the money from the shares to build our own home and factory. Our company will build a factory in Ukrainia in the nearest future.</p>
   <p>Profit by the opportunity!</p>
