   <p>Through the channels of the Red Cross Committee in Great Ukrainia, now occupied by the Communists, the following proclamation was sent from Chicago to the whole Ukrainian Nation:</p>
   <p>"It is known all over the World that when the flower of the Red army perished in the jungles of Poland, the Communistic government of Leon Trotzky, under pressure from the Polish government, was supposed to recognize Ukranian independence.</p>
   <p>"And we all, tillers of the soil and laborers of the broken and starving Ukrainia, silenced, with peace at heart, awaited that sacred day, when <span class="page-break">2</span>the Russo-Jewish tramps and the Chinese barefooted vagrants would be cleared away from our unfortunate and blood-soaked land.</p>
   <p>"The time flies.</p>
   <p>"Where is this independence of ours? Where is our freedom? Where is the equality? Where is that peace? Where?</p>
   <p>"Nowhere!</p>
   <p>"Through cities and villages even to the present day, a pack of rabid, savage Communists are running wild. They pillage and plunder, castigate, burn and shoot down, and otherwise maltreat the peaceful peasants, throwing them into dungeons and prisons. In one way or another they are trying to get rid of the God-fearing inhabitants. These plundering tramps, want to leave nobody in their way while they are ruthlessly pillaging <span class="page-break">3</span>anything and everything in the Ukrainian land. The whole Soviet government consists only of robbers and bandits! We all, even our children, know this well!</p>
   <p>"But, did they depose Czar Nicholas II to give way to Leon Trotsky- Bronstein! Who is ruling us now?</p>
   <p>"Before the police ruled with clubs, and now Communism rules with its secret police.</p>
   <p>"Enough suffering! Enough crime perpetrated upon us! Are we defenseless children?</p>
   <p>"Even a child of four learns how to speak his mind.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Let us ask once more and for the last time, that so-called "government", how long will they drain and drink our Christian blood? How long will they continue to burn our villages and pillage our hard earned possessions? How long will our fields be filled with their Asiatic hordes?</p>
   <p>"Why does the Red army not go back to their homes and caves?</p>
   <p>"Why do they not try to save their own possessions from bandits similar to themselves? Is it not time for them to sober up and do something intelligent and honest?</p>
   <p>"Let us demand a quick and clear answer to the questions above! Let us demand from them a speedy clearance from Ukrainia of foreign bands, soldiers and Communism! Should they not listen to our demand this time, then we know what to do: let us all join the counter- <span class="page-break">5</span>revolutionary army! To arms! For freedom!</p>
   <p>"We have got rid of the Czar; we have driven out the pro-German hetman; we have annihilated the bandit Denikin and God will also help us to make away with hideous Communism.</p>
