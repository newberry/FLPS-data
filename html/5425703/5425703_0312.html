   <p>Since 1919 special Ukrainian correspondence courses have been offered both in Germany and Czecho-Slovakia. The courses are arranged to suit the needs of various demands, such as, high school, engineering, teaching, commercial, etc.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainian youth in Chicago and other parts of the United States are cordially invited to enroll in this correspondence school.</p>
   <p>Due to a great inflow of young students to our schools in Josefow, the teachers' group decided to establish a real gymnasium (high school), and teachers' course. In order to do this efficiently, various classical reference books are needed, as well as many textbooks, atlases, Ukrainian literature, etc.</p>
