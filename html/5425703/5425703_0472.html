   <p>Sons and Daughters of Ukrainia!</p>
   <p>The times in which our present generation lives are too dreadful for words to describe. Our enemies from time immemorial have resolved to enslave us forever, and therefore have begun to fight against us in a savage way. Both with sword and lies, they are wrecking the very foundation of our independence, the sacred rights of human legacy. The filthy dilapidated shoes of the enemies tread upon the innocent breasts of our mother, Ukrainia!</p>
   <p>Deadly agony befell our fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters. The Poles demoniacally torture us! Sighs and cries and bitter tears of our countrymen call upon us for liberating help. Their spirit, and the bloodshed <span class="page-break">\2</span>of our brothers by the raging enemy, call to heaven for vengence. Justice and liberty summon us all to unite into one Ukrainian body! The sun, the moon and the stars themselves, seem to be troubled day and night and as if looking and trying to gather and unite all the Ukrainians under one Siege banner. Even groves and forests, as if pricking their ears, are making an effort to catch the sound of the marching Siege!</p>
   <p>Ukrainian Youth, do you hear the command of the war general! "Attention! March! Fight! Shoot! Regain the glory of our forefathers! Demolish the walls of slavery! Regain freedom for your native land!"</p>
   <p>Where are we all? Are we deaf?</p>
   <p>Away with all partisanship, petty differences and personal disputes! Away with those who do not want unity!</p>
   <p>We all want unity, because we were once children of one motherland. Our <span class="page-break">\3</span>natives call upon us for help! We all must unite into one fighting body, into one Siege army unit! We all must surrender practically everything that we have for the fate and freedom of Ukrainia; we must sacrifice, not only money, but our very lives, if need be! For, who wants to moan under the Polish-Russian yoke? Who would not fight the worthless enemies? Who would be willing to bow to the universally known liars?</p>
   <p>My brother-knights, the viper is hissing, and we, as thinking people, already intuitively know what he wants!</p>
   <p>My brother-knights, Ukrainian blood is being shed, and is flowing the streets of our villages and cities.</p>
   <p>My Siege colleagues, Cossack children, the mother weeps for the father who was killed by Polish Jesuits!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In whom does not the heart yearn for sweet revenge?.. . .</p>
   <p>We are ready to sacrifice both our soul and body. To arms! then, for Ukrainia and her people!</p>
   <p>Join at once, and shoulder to shoulder let's fight!</p>
   <p>Join the Siege rank and file! Become disciplined sons of Ukrainia! And while going over to our native land, we shall sing after the poet Shevtchenko:</p>
   <p>The Pollak woman's pocket</p>
   <p>Is filled with ducats and dollars.</p>
   <p>Not after her money, do we cross the ocean,</p>
   <p>But to fight for independence of our brothers!</p>
