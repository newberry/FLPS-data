   <p>There is no better time than the present for uniting all the national elements, since the Ukrainian delegation came to America. If we all stand united for the same cause, namely, to win full rights for Ukrainia, then the delegation also will be in position to give the answer to the question, what the Ukrainians are fighting for all over the world. Our enemies tried to show our fight for liberation of Ukrainia as Bolshevistic. When we are all united then the horrible falsehoods of the enemies will come to light. It will prove that only a few dozen of Ukrainian people are Bolsheviks, are half-wits and are not fit to think for themselves. The Jewish and the Russian comrades think for them and the red guardians only parrot the phases which they learned from them.</p>
