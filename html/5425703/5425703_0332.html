   <p>Michael Shvets, proprietor of a large drugstore in the Ukrainian colony in Chicago, is now convalescing, and has begun to take charge of his business again.</p>
   <p>Alexander Harkavenko, one of the greatest Ukrainian wrestlers has been victorious over all Chicago wrestlers matched against him so far. Much credit is due him because he does not as yet know the technique of American wrestling. No one, no matter how strong, has been able to defeat him because of his extraordinary strength. It is humorous to see that in a short time he has become victorious even over the strongest wrestlers. Everybody foretells a brilliant future for him in his wrestling career.</p>
