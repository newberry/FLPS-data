   <p>As in other localities, so also in Chicago the American citizens of Ukrainian descent welcomed very sincerely and acted as generous hosts to the Ukrainian National Chorus.</p>
   <p>On Monday, October 8, at 8 A.M. the delegates from all Ukrainian societies, fraternities, etc., of Chicago were on hand at the La Salle Station, where the Chorus was to arrive. All the delegates, some of them in national costumes, welcomed the guests with flowers. Among them all the local Sitch District Number Two (Chicago) was best represented. Besides the delegates there was a great number of Ukrainian Chicagoans who came out personally to see and welcome the world-famous Chorus.</p>
   <p>The Chorus arrived at 9 A.M. and was instantly surrounded by newspaper reporters. After this ordeal the members formed a semicircle, and Dr. Myroslaw Siemens officially welcomed them in the name of the Ukrainian Chicagoans, and presented Mr. A. Koshets, their conductor, with a grand bouquet of flowers. Mr. N. Motlink uttered a few words of welcome to the Chorus on behalf of the local Ukrainian students.</p>
   <p>Mr. Koshets expressed in a few forceful words his appreciation of the welcome which they had accorded to him and to his Chorus. He ended with the exhortation:</p>
   <p>"Give full support to the National Chorus!"</p>
   <p>Immediately after this the delegates took the Chorus to the Auditorium Hotel for breakfast. This was followed by a tour through Chicago's principal streets, places, parks, and buildings of historic value.</p>
   <p>On this same day in the evening the Chorus gave a concert in Symphony Orchestra Hall. This journal has not space enough to describe--and furthermore no words could do it--all the feeling and the inspiration that filled the hearts of each and every one present at the concert. It may be of importance to some to know that the hall, containing 3,000 chairs, was filled almost exclusively by Ukrainians. The Ukrainians had anticipated the large attendance and had bought their tickets ahead of time. Many of other nationalities, who did not expect so enormous a crowd, were unable to secure tickets in advance and consequently were included among the thousand and more who had to be turned away. For this reason the announcement was made in the intermission that another concert would be given on November 5 in the Medinah Temple, in a much more spacious hall.</p>
   <p>The welcome committee, chosen from various societies, clubs, etc., provided handsome bouquets for Mr. Koshets and the soloists. There were also numerous bouquets from total strangers, as well as from many individual Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>After the concert a banquet was arranged at the Congress Hotel in honor of the Ukrainian National Chorus. At the banquet delegates were present from almost every society, club, fraternity, etc., and especially from the Chicago Sitch Organization District Number Two.</p>
   <p>At the banquet speech followed speech in honor of Mr. A. Koshets and his famous Chorus.</p>
   <p>We must not omit to mention that the banquet was honored with the presence of the Ukrainian Metropolitan Archbishop Count Andrey Sheptytsky.</p>
   <p>The speakers were as follows: Dr. M. Siminovich, Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky, chief executive of the Sitch Organization, who fearlessly and openly spoke his mind as to the difficult agreement between the Ukrainian National Chorus and their impresario Mr. Rabinoff, Dr. Volodimir Siminovich, Dr. S. Yanovich, the Reverend W. Stetsiuk, Metropolitan Archbishop Count Andrey Sheptytsky, S. Museychook, M. Skatchuk, H. Skehar, T. Levtiich, the Reverend L. Van, the Reverend T. Hundiak, P. Novodvorsky, S. Kochy, R. Smook, T. Sawchuk, and others. To all these speeches Professor A. Koshets replied, revealing himself not only a genius of song but also a master of eloquence. The banquet was finished with the Ukrainian hymn sung with subdued voices, "Ukrainia Still Lives".</p>
   <p>Special thanks are due to Roman Smook, our young attorney, who worked the hardest to make the welcome for the Chorus a success.</p>
   <p>The Chorus remained in Chicago a whole week, and therefore Ukrainian Chicagoans had a better chance to talk to its members individually and to learn many things from our native nightingales about conditions in the old country.</p>
   <p>On Tuesday the Chorus had a reception and a supper at the residence of the Reverend W. Stetsiuk, where Metropolitan Archbishop Count Sheptytsky resided during his stay in Chicago. The latter now had a chance to become better acquainted with the conductor, Professor Alexander Koshets, and his Chorus.</p>
   <p>Here the singers were more at liberty to express and to enjoy themselves. They sang a few church and national songs which will long remain in the memory of the venerable old Archbishop and the rest who were present.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Wasyl Stetsiuk verily is an exceptionally generous person and a sincere performer of his duties; he never spares himself nor his money for a good cause. He displayed these excellent traits of character particularly at the funeral of the late Perehowsky, in the illness of Archbishop Sheptytsky, and in the reception of the Chorus at his residence. Three cheers for him for that!</p>
   <p>On Friday, November 3, the Ukrainian Orthodox people prepared a welcome supper for the Chorus at 1944 West Erie Street, Chicago. Various speakers had a chance to express themselves at this banquet, but they all unanimously had words of cordial welcome and sincere gratitude for Professor Koshets and the entire Chorus. Mr. Koshets thanked the speakers for their warm words of appreciation as well as for the presents received. Here he described more at length the Ukrainian National Chorus and its traveling mission all over the world. The Chorus did its part and sang a few songs, which pleased those who were present better than anything else would have done.</p>
   <p>During the banquet John Barabash's well-known orchestra played.</p>
   <p>On Sunday Professor Koshets and his assistant Professor Harry Tuchapsky attended mass in St. Nicholas' Church, at the corner of Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street. Dr. Joseph Nazaruk, special representative from Ukrainia, was also present.</p>
   <p>On this same Sunday in the afternoon Professor Koshets was invited to a big meeting called by Dr. Joseph Nazaruk. Requested to speak by the latter as well as by the whole meeting committee, Professor Koshets made an exceptional impression upon the audience with his talk. He showed himself a master of eloquence.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the meeting the Ukrainians went to hear the Ukrainian National Chorus at the Medinah Temple. Since the Ukrainians had attended the mass meeting in the afternoon, not many of them were present at the concert; nevertheless the spacious hall was filled almost to capacity by the American public.</p>
   <p>The program of the concert was a novelty even to those who had regularly attended all the concerts of the Chorus, and the public was much pleased, since these numbers and the presentation of them were something entirely new to the audience. Miss Nina Koshets sang some of the solos, such as "Oh, Mother," and "Tra la la!" May I add that this hall is twice as large as that used for the other concert?</p>
   <p>It is next to impossible to describe every singer of the Chorus individually or every number separately. Let our hearts be the judges of what an impression these songs made on the audience. Self-praise gets no one anywhere; therefore let me cite what some of the local American newspapers had to say about the Chorus:</p>
   <p>"Hail and sincere thanks to you, great Conductor A. Koshets, and to your Chorus! You seem to us like your native nightingales."</p>
   <p>"Hail to you! By singing about the freedom of Ukrainia, you are strengthening her aims and endeavors."</p>
   <p>"We salute you for your divinely melodious way of telling us who you are and what your ancestry is."</p>
   <p>Sing, therefore, for us and for others! Sing of the famous Sitch of the past and of their dauntless heroes, who with their breasts for bulwarks defended not only Ukrainia but also the whole Western civilization against the savage hordes of Turks and Tartars and other migrating Asiatic tribes for centuries. Tell the world through the medium of song what Ukrainia is: that she is one of the richest countries in the world; that her Cossacks have done far more than their share in the preservation of Western civilization and culture for many centuries. Through the medium of our song make the world recognize the immortal fame and glory of the Ukrainian Cossacks, saviors of European culture.</p>
