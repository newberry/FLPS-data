The following subjects will be offered: Bookkeeping, Commercial Law, Mathematics, Salesmanship, General History and History of Ukrainia, General Geography and Geography of Ukrainia, Ukrainian Grammar and Literature, Commercial Correspondence, English and German Languages.</p>
   <p>Besides, this professional education is necessary for those who want to start out a business for themselves on their return to the native land.</p>
   <p>The college will try to give a general education. Moreover, there will be given lectures of general interest from various branches of knowledge <span class="page-break">\2</span>to fill out the gaps where the complete subject cannot be taken up due to lack of sufficient time on the part of the student.</p>
   <p>Two nights a week a school will be conducted for the illiterate, who will be allowed also to hear the lectures on other subjects as special students.</p>
   <p>Registration closes with Nov. 17. There will be three lecturers. The college is under the direction of Mr. Michael Ivanowsky, from whom all the necessary information can be obtained every evening during the week days.</p>
