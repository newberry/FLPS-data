   <p>A bright spot for the Ukrainian immigrant in America is a large, clean Ukrainian factory in one of the largest cities, Chicago. The factory occupies a beautiful large building filled with various machines and other stock. It employs a good number of Ukrainian people. It is a joy to work in this factory. There they manufacture beautiful lamp phonographs, articles a workingman or even a millionaire would not be ashamed to have in his home. This phonograph gives out a bright light and produces beautiful music and song that cannot be surpassed by the best phonographs or gramophones even at a cost of a thousand dollars. The inventor of this lovely instrument is Mr. Peter R. Gonsky. His invention has no equal in all the musical world. This benefactor, who has with his own effort given an impetus to dare and to do to our communities in America and Canada, teaches us that not by speaking, nor by rambling politics, shall we be strong and renowned, but by commerce, trade, manufacturing, and business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter R. Gonsky, the head of this dignified business, has become wealthy by putting his time, and no doubt many sleepless nights, into this business.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>He has not ceased to be a Ukrainian; not has he for a moment lost sight of the national cause, nor his native Ukrainian people.</p>
   <p>He is now with us and he will remain with us both in times of prosperity and of want. Mr. Peter R. Gonsky has already given proof of this, not once, but a number of times by contributing liberal sums of money to the national cause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter R. Gonsky is a bright living example for us, showing us that we should engage in commerce, manufacturing and business if we want to gain power for ourselves and our native country.</p>
   <p>Let anyone of our readers who thinks that this is an exaggeration take a little time off and ride over to the factory. He will be convinced that we have not written a thousandth part of what the human eye can see there.</p>
   <p>We give the address of the Ukrainian factory in another place of this issue.</p>

   <p>This factory is our glory, due to the endeavor of Mr. Peter R. Gonsky. It now brings a big income to the Ukrainian company. Congratulations to Mr. Peter R. Gonsky.</p>
