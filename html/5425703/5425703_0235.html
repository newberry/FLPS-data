   <p>The Ukrainian national songs have great significance, because of their close tie with the life of the nation whom they most faithfully bring out in its true light. It is a perfect mirror of the Ukrainian nation, so to speak. In beautiful songs people sing out their troubles, such as, a mother over the baby in the cradle; the sincere love of youth; the sufferings of a jilted lover; the homesickness of a recently married woman; the sorrow of father and mother as they miss their recently married daughter, whose future is uncertain; the tragedy of a wife who is being chided by her unsympathetic husband, or the abuses perpetrated upon her by her vicious mother-in-law; the poor widow moistening her scanty field with tears; the weeping of an orphan on the grave of her mother; the entire human life from birth to death with all its troubles and jolly moments are reflected almost perfectly, in those popular songs of <span class="page-break">\2</span>ours. And because the life of our peasant is rather bitter, with comparatively few moments of happiness, nay our whole nation, from its very childhood, does not enjoy a better fate; this is why our popular songs have such a pathetic feeling; they bring to the soul some mysterious pensiveness over human fate.</p>
   <p>At times girls and mothers mournfully sing the pathetic songs of farewell partings with young lovers; of a young cossack or soldier who went to war and did not return. Often soldiers express longing in their songs to return to their native homes when they are under rigorous discipline while serving in the army.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainian popular songs not only bring out life of the present day, but some of them go way back into antiquity, into those days of yore, when our ancestors were still pagans, and were recognizing the forces of mother nature and heavenly bodies, such as, the sun, the moon, the stars, and lightning.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>These are all clearly brought out in our popular Christmas carols; Little Christmas songs of praise; grand Spring and Easter songs, as well as the unique songs on the eve of St. John the Baptiste.</p>
   <p>There are many songs in which the people sing about the war expeditions into distant countries from which they brought home trophies and spoils; the people sing about the old princes and counts; about the invasions by the Tartars and Turks; about wars of our Ukrainian cossacks against the Poles and Russians; about the serfdom; about the draft to military service. All these songs picture to us the past life of our nation, painting it with lively colors. All these songs tell us who we are. Whose sons we are; who our fathers were, for whom and to what are we chained.</p>
   <p>Thereby we see that the national songs are not merely a useless past time of the present age. In songs our nation has narrated about its present and past <span class="page-break">\4</span>life; about everything that makes it happy and everything that ails it. Through songs the nation has confessed all its joys and troubles; songs have opened the very soul of the nation.</p>
   <p>As looking in a mirror a man sees a reflection of his exterior self, so in the songs he see his spiritual reflection, or as the saying goes: "Judge the nation by its songs."</p>
   <p>Learned men, like Maksymovych, Metlynsky, Kulish, Chubinsky, Drahomanow, Holovatsky, and others, have composed tens of thousands of Ukrainian popular songs, and we find them now in printed volumes. These works prove that the Ukrainians have possibly the richest collection of folksongs of any European nation. Furthermore, the Ukrainian people sing many songs that have not been recorded anywhere up to the present time.</p>
   <p>In sorting out such a great mass of Ukrainian folksongs, there is occasionally, <span class="page-break">\5</span>a possibility of misclassifying some of them and thus accidentally rendering those more prosaic. Let us present at least a superficial glimpse at this enormous treasure of our national and popular songs. Let us divide the entire group into the following five divisions:</p>
   <p>1) Ritual and religious: Christmas Carols, Little Christmas Well-wishing Carols, Spring and Easter songs, songs on the Eve of St. John the Baptist Feast, and Harvest songs.</p>
   <p>2) Historical and political: Those songs of Ukrainian cossacks, knights, recruits, and serfdom.</p>
   <p>3) Romantic, individual, and folksongs.</p>
   <p>4) Songs of the wanderers, and tragic ballads, such as, a wife being killed by her husband who was induced by his mother to do so, etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>5) The songs most intense in meaning are possibly the historical and political. This category includes not only songs of persons and happenings of historical significance, as for example that of Hetman Bohdan Chmelnytsky, the nation liberated from serfdom, etc., but also all songs which reflect social, religious, community, and family changes of views.</p>
