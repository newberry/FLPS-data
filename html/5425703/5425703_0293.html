   <p>A group of some eight active members of the Ukrainian-American Catholic youth organization, Young Ukraine, conceived the idea of publishing a weekly for our Ukrainian youth in Chicago. The idea was brought to the attention of the assistant editor of Sitch, and he consented to become a sponsor for this group in their undertaking.</p>
   <p>The weekly will be called Young Ukraine and will be 9 x 15 inches with four pages. Young Ukraine will be devoted to the promotion of a wider understanding and friendship among our various clubs, and will publish the news about the social and sporting events in our city.</p>
   <p>The staff of this weekly comprises Mike Kaniuga, editor; James Evankoe, associate editor; and Joe Maryniak, manager. There are also some five reporters on the staff.</p>
   
   <p>We hope our young publishers will be successful in their venture and we wish them the best of luck!</p>
