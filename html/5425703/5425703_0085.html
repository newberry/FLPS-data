   <p>Let us take note of ourselves. Let us learn to appreciate group work. Let us learn to work together, so that we may be noticed by everyone. One person alone cannot accomplish much, for every task requires a collection of strength. We do not know how to work in groups, and therefore lack the strength to accomplish anything useful. The Americans work only with gathered strength, a fact which explains why they make such great progress.</p>
   <p>Business is the vital force of a people. A businessman does not work for himself alone, but improves the position of everyone. We do not, as a group, appreciate the value of the merchant and the businessman. We envy a person when he undertakes some kind of businessman. We look on a businessman or manufacturer as a sponger, who is trying to avoid physical work. Instead of using all our energy to support him, we hate him and say, "Look! He wants to live without effort."</p>
   
   <p>We forget that business requires more trouble and care than factory work. In the factory the worker puts in his hours, returns home untroubled, and sleeps peacefully with no worry about anything. Altogether different is the position of a business man. He is not free from worry day or night, but must ponder over how to make ends meet in his business, especially now during the depression.</p>
   <p>The people who start businesses in our communities have usually worked hard before they became businessmen, and have learned to value money. A businessman is a servant to the community, and deserves its support. In successful communities, where business flourishes, businessmen are held in high esteem. When in need of some help, no matter what it may be, where do we go if not to our businessmen? Therefore, we should help our businessmen all we can, so that they may help us.</p>
   <p>We have a society of business and professional men in Chicago. Under the present management it has been lethargic. It should wake up, it should arrange more meetings and lectures on business. It is worth while to gather and talk over business matters; all the members will profit, and the organization will take its rightful place in our community.</p>
   <p>We must show a little more interest in business activities if we wish to be recognized and respected by the community at large. We should take these matters under consideration at our meetings.</p>
   <p>With these things in mind, our paper, as a start, has gathered and listed the addresses of all our most valuable business and professional men, so that the community at large, and our own people in particular, may realize the business strength of our society.</p>
