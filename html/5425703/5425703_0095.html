   <p>How does social economy appear in theory and in practice? Social or national economy is the study of the aspects and conduct of the domestic life of a nation, or of all nations. This study describes these facts, explains them, and arranges them systematically. On the basis of all this, thinking people come to many important theoretical and practical conclusions that serve the economic and political life of all the people of a nation and country. These results also have great meaning for the domestic life of many individual families, as we shall see later on from practical examples. There are many interpretations of social economy, because it is clear that the capitalist interests himself in this study from one point of view, while the workingman will interest himself in it from another. Actually they are all concerned with this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>study because it binds them together; but every class, and every person in every class, looks at the problems in it from different angles and from different points of view.</p>
   <p>Social economy is a great subject resting on two basic principles of capitalistic theory: personal liberty, and private ownership of property. The first principle implies that it is forbidden to put anyone to work by force; the second means that every person is forbidden to take that which does not belong to him. That is how it appears in theory, but in practice both principles appear differently. Although it is forbidden to force anybody to do a particular kind of work, people are often forced to do menial tasks because of poverty, which means that other work is not available to them as it is to those people who are prosperous. This shows that the second principle also exists for the poorer people only to a limited extent, because frequently a person who does not enjoy personal liberty must, for the sake of the money he will receive, offer his work where he did not wish to give it.</p>

   <p>Workingmen of all nations of the world endure somewhat similar living and working conditions. Only similar, but not identical, because the labor of people who do not live in their own country is done under circumstances far worse than that of those people who live in their own country. The workingman of the suppressed nation is fettered with a double chain: the economic conditions in which he lives, and authority of the country which suppresses his nation. Therefore, such people need twice as much education in order that they might profit a little from the means of modern living which social economy offers them.</p>
   <p>What sort of an outlook is this? Present-day social economy offers the two principles which we have previously considered, and it also has attached to it two more concepts without which it could not exist or else would be altogether different. What are these concepts? They are division of labor, and co-operation. We shall explain the second of these in our "practical social economy column" which will deal with <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>matters related to national domestic life.</p>
   <p>First we must give you the meaning of "co-operation". Co-operation is the bond of the workingman to his work, and at the same time to his domestic life. What else does it mean? It means that the workingman is united to the factory or shop where he is employed, united to the country in which he resides. By what means is he thus united? By contracts, by laws or regulations, by custom, by taxes, by organizations, by costs of living, and by many other strings which for the most part he does not realize exist.</p>
   <p>In the study of economy, unity is called freedom, but in practice it turns out differently. There are two kinds of causes that change this unity to one without freedom. One of these causes can be changed for the better rather quickly, which means that the workingman will at once receive more freedom of contract when he is able to understand it. What are they? The economic position of the country in which he is <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>living, and its working conditions. That is what we want to do in our work. It is important that this be done for the Ukrainian workingman. What does this work rest on? On a simple but very important foundation: true information about the living conditions and the working conditions in the various cities within the boundaries of Northern America (United States and Canada), including both general and particular trades.</p>
   <p>The trains are now crowded with men who are seeking work. Many people are coming to the United States from Canada because of the economic crisis there, many Ukrainians among them. It may continue like this for some time yet before the crisis is over. All of this requires that the entire Ukrainian press, both here and in Canada, turn its full attention upon the economic situation instead of always writing about politics. We want to initiate this needed change, by writing about the domestic needs of one of the largest cities of the world, Chicago. I have written these facts on the basis of stories told me by the Ukrainian <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>workingmen who attended the banquet given in my honor by Company Fifteen of the Sitch Organization. I will write further about the tailors' trade of this city, in which over three hundred Ukrainian people earn their livelihood. I shall write about this trade and about other trades and professions with the following motive: that every Ukrainian workingman came here from his fatherland as a homeless immigrant. Many of them came here, struggling at first--perhaps even hungry for a while--but they had to have some clothing on their backs. That is why we will describe the tailors' trade first. And at the behest of the Sitch Centre, we shall give you a thorough view of the living conditions in this city.</p>
