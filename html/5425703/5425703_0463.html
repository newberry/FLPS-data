   <p>In view of the fact that there arose a big misunderstanding among the chief executives of the Siege Organization that threatens to break up the whole organization, the district Siege committee of Chicago and suburbs, together with Mr. Peter Didyk, who is chief organizer for the organization, Mr. Bohdan Skrotsky, chief financial secretary, and Mr. Nicholas Moronetz, chief treasurer, called on Mar. 28th a general meeting of the nine branches that exist here. There in the general discussions they came to the following conclusion:</p>
   <p>The executive committee should be together in one locality, that is to say, not coming from Chicago, but from the recording head secretary, Mr. Peter Zadoretsky in New York. This move was written in a letter to Mr. Nicholas Moranetz, on Feb. 14, 1920. There he states that the executive committee should be either in New York or Chicago. If the executive committee is in Chicago, he states he will gladly give up his post for the good of the organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Further, according to the correspondence written by Mr. Zadoretsky, the chief executive, the three other members on the committee saw fit to call a general district meeting, in order to consult the whole Siege organization in this important case.</p>
   <p>At the general meeting, after a short discussion, all the members agreed upon that for the good of the organization the executive committee must be in one locality.</p>
   <p>Right there we stopped to consider whether or not we would be able to take all the Siege work to Chicago if a majority of its members would approve of it. We considered our strength and saw that we have nine branches with about eight hundred members. We said, we can pick out a good editorial committee for the Seige News, which has to publish the newspaper on time without any cost. We do not think it expedient that every member of the executive committee should be from Chicago, but only the majority of it, so that the work would go faster.</p>
   <p>We did not intend to take over the jurisdiction of the commander-in-chief, <span class="page-break">3</span>Mr. Boyko, nor that of the centurion nor the assistant centurions; we only wanted to keep the working people mostly for the good of the Siege Organization.</p>
   <p>As a result of this discussion we notified the head commander, Mr. Boyke, asking him to notify all the Siege members in the United States, so that they would vote as to where the executive offices of the Siege Organization are to be transfered.</p>
   <p>In return, Mr. Boyko resolved the matter in this way. Not waiting for the results of the voting, he ordered the chief treasurer to send all the books, and figures, and all the work of the head secretary to him before Mar. 30th. All this was done under false pretenses. He himself complains, and he himself does the judging - absolutely by himself. We shall state here the false movements of the head commander.</p>
   <p>First: He says that the by-laws were issued too late. The answer to it is like this. A few months for preparing and printing the by-laws is not too <span class="page-break">4</span>long, and we know it for a fact that no organization is able to do this faster. We must add that the by-laws were being prepared for five months, and laid in New York a whole month, through the negligence of the committee.</p>
   <p>Second: The same thing applies to the publishing of the Siege guide. Let the members look to how many rubrics there are in it, let them understand that this is altogether a new thing. Those that undertook the making of the by-laws and the Siege guide likely did not expect any criticism, but only an acknowledgement for their fast and true work.</p>
   <p>Third: As to the treasurer, the head commander accuses Mr. Moranetz, that he did not want to send money for the Siege News. Every Siege member must remember that Mr. Boyko made a motion at the Siege convention that there should be two seperate treasuries: one for the Siege organization, and the other for the Siege News. That is why the chief treasurer did not see fit, without first consulting all the members, to give the money from the main treasury to the treasury of the Siege News. The executive committee does not have the least idea as to how much money came in for the Siege News nor what was given out. We know that Mr. Zadosetsky and Mr. Bentoniak figured <span class="page-break">5</span>out that one issue would cost $80. Yet, at the convention on Jan. 18, 1920, we found out that besides the subscribers, over $300 of the Christmas Carol money was given for the Siege News. A few hundred dollars was supposed to come from subscriptions. All this money did not cover two issues of the Siege News. Mr. Moranety borrowed $50 from the treasury, and again there is not enough, everyone is "squawking" because the treasurer does not want to give out any more money.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the extraordinary convention, which Mr. Boyko called in January, really ruined the treasury of the organization, whereby there is hardly enough to pay for the by-laws and the guide. We, Siege members, now wish for a thorough statement of the administration of the Siege News in order to find out, where and when that large sum of money was expended.</p>
   <p>The editors of the Ukraina are sorely disappointed that the head commander judges this newspaper rashly.</p>
   <p>Fourth: It was also decided that we must also stand in defense of this independent newspaper Ukraina, which always sympathizes with us, backs us and <span class="page-break">6</span>and will further back up the Siege movement.</p>
   <p>Ukraina never belittled the Siege News, but only turned our attention to the fact that the editors allowed a disloyal article concerning the national rights of the Ukrainian Republic to be published.</p>
   <p>We, Siege members, at the same time must be loyal to Ukrainia and its national government until death. Ukraina pointed out from the start that the editors of the Siege News made a mistake and that mistake will surely be criticized by the Siege members.</p>
   <p>This is the way it happened:- Today there is no blot on the Siege Organization, no disloyal accusations, due to the watchfullness of the newspaper Ukraina.</p>
   <p>Taking all this into consideration, we came to this conclusion, that the accusations of the head commander are not in any way proven.</p>
   <p>We move for the good of the Organization, that the head commander announce a Siege convention not later than sometime in April, 1920, somewhere between <span class="page-break">7</span>Chicago and New York, and we think the most suitable place would be the city of Cleveland, in which there is a strong branch of the Siege Organization.</p>
   <p>It is better to lose a few hundred dollars than to lose this important Siege movement in America-- economy in this respect would be out of place. We, Siege members, who wish to make the greatest contribution for our Fatherland, do not fear to pitch in a dollar or two for the good of the national cause.</p>
   <p>We expect that all the Siege members will back us up in this important case, from which will result not only the good of the Siege Organization, but the good of the national cause in America. We cannot remedy any matter through w writing alone. We must stand at the convention, and put up the proposition as clearly as possible, so that everyone will see what is needed for the good of the Siege movement and our nation.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to see divisions and scattering of the Siege, but a spreading of the Siege spirit far and wide from ocean to ocean and beyond.</p>
   <p>It is not the will of any individual to lead the Siege Organization, but the will of all the Siege members, and the executives' work is only to carry out <span class="page-break">8</span>the will of all the members. No one is permitted to break the national will.</p>
   <p>We do not want anything but the truth, peace and sociable cooperation of all the Siege members.</p>
   <p>We think that all the misunderstandings will come out for the best, especially at the Siege convention.</p>
