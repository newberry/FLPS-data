   <p>The convention of the Siege organization officers took place on Sunday, August 25, 1918, at 1 P.M., at the Ukrainian National Hall, 217-219 East 6th Street, New York, N. Y.</p>
   <p>Peter Zadoretsky opened the meeting with a short speech. John Boyko, from Bridgeport, was elected Siege organization officer in the United States; Korese, chairman of the meeting; and Alexander Hyssa, his secretary.</p>
   <p>W. Serbay, an officer of the organization, made a motion which was seconded, and the meeting decided that it be called an annual meeting. Carried.</p>

   <p>Then they took count of those present. Besides the officers, there were many guests, especially Siege members of New York. Reading of the minutes was followed by ardent discussion. Finally, they came to the conclusion that the officers of the Siege Organization did everything possible for the good of the organization in the United States, for which they were complimented.</p>
   <p>They also discussed the results of the Siege festival which took place on July 14, 1918. After a lively discussion, the matter was settled and it was proved that the Siege Organization did not have anything to do with the affair which took place between M. Sitchynsky and I. Dobryansky, and that the Siege Organization, and particularly the New York Branch which took charge of that festival, did not know anything about Mr. Hundiak's distributing rudely satirical handbills against Mr. Sitchynsky, or that the latter wanted to speak at the Siege festival. Consequently, all the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>gossip written in the National Will are without foundation.</p>
   <p>Then followed the business of the Siege News, and after a long discussion it was resolved, (1) that the Siege organ, the Siege News, continue, as at present, to be published once a month; (2) that the Siege newspaper shall not infringe upon any Ukrainian political party nor any of the benevolent societies; (3) that the Siege newspaper must take an impartial stand; (4) that the Siege newspaper's purpose is to propagate spiritual and physical culture among the Ukrainian people in America; (5) that the Siege newspaper has no right to insert and publish any propaganda whereby the Ukrainian people as a whole may be misled.</p>
   <p>Simultaneously it was resolved that the Siege News shall publish free of charge any advertisement of the branches of the Siege organization.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Further, it was resolved that it is the duty of every branch of the Ukrainian Siege Organization to contribute ten dollars to the press fund; and further, that it is the duty of every Siege member of both sexes to read the Siege News and to get new subscribers. As a result, they elected an editorial committee, as follows: M. Diachyshyn, Editor; V. Vintoniak, treasurer; A. Hyssa, secretary.</p>
   <p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, they resolved that the General Siege Convention should take place on Labor Day, 1919, in the City of New York.</p>
   <p>Basil Serbay was elected head organizer of the Siege branches in the United States of America.</p>
   <p>The meeting having finished its outlined program, John Boyko called upon those present to contribute freely to the press fund, to which they answered with generous contributions.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The meeting ended with the Siege hymn "Yonder on the mountain, the Siege is marching."</p>
   <p>Alexander Hyssa, secretary</p>
