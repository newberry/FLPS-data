   <p>On May 30 the United States officially celebrated the so-called Memorial Day, to honor its national heroes who sacrificed their lives for their fatherland. The whole American nation paid tribute to the war heroes with parades and services.</p>
   <p>The second division of the Sitch organization in the United States, in conjunction with the Chicago Ukrainian group, celebrated this day at the grave of the Unknown Soldier at the St. Nicholas Church Cemetery, thereby combining the all-American holiday with the Ukrainian reminiscence of our Sitch riflemen who gave their lives as an offering for the freedom of the Ukrainian fatherland.</p>
   <p>Over one hundred armed Sitch men and a few score Ukrainian women from the <span class="page-break">2</span>Ukrainian Red Cross participated in this holiday.</p>
