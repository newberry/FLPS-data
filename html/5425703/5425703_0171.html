   <p>Mr. George Benetsky comes from an old Ukrainian family dating back as far as hetmanism. He is a professional opera singer, a lyric tenor. He studied music in Kiev and other places, and after serving in the army during the war, he began in 1920 to sing in operas and concerts. He was engaged by the King's Opera in Serbia, and traveled through South America with the Alexander Koshetz Chorus as a soloist. In 1923 he came to the United States, and sang with great success the tenor roles in various opera companies, among them the International, the American, and the Ukrainian National Theater in New York. On the Ukrainian stage he sang about twenty-five different parts and portrayed such characters as "Andrey" in "Kateryna"; "Zaporoztsi" (Zaporozians); "Peter" in "Natalka"; "Leo" in "Utoplenoy" (Drowning); "Hrytz" (Harry) in "Oy Ne Hody Hrytziu" (Oh! Do Not Come, Harry): "Ilko" (Elias) in "Chornomortziah" (Black Sea Coast), and many others. At the same time, George Benetsky was the organizer of a vocal mixed quartet which appeared with symphony orchestras at large symphonic concerts and in the best <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>American theaters. This quartet gave over three hundred concerts. In New York, in 1927, George Benetsky became the director of a chorus, and was widely acclaimed. Upon coming to Chicago in 1928, he was asked to become musical director of the Chicago Ukrainian Chorus, which was to be the nucleus of the "All-American" chorus for the Chicago World's Fair. Last year, the Chorus appeared successfully in many concerts and over the radio, and for the first time in Chicago they presented the Ukrainian opera "Kateryna," which was arranged and produced by George Benetsky last spring.</p>
   <p>On August 23, this chorus entered the Contest of Choruses which was sponsored by Chicago's largest newspaper, The Chicago Daily Tribune. At this contest the Ukrainian Chorus, under the baton of George Benetsky, was proclaimed the first chorus of Chicagoland, and was the only one to be invited to sing at the festival (for 150,000 listeners). The Chorus received the first (and only) prize: a large gold medal for each singer, and a gold medal and a valuable director's baton for George Benetsky.</p>
