   <p>June! Month of graduation and commencement! Graduation from the accustomed routine to the commencement of new life. This month is customarily dedicated to the graduation from an institute of education or learning. Probably you are one of these graduates, or most assuredly a friend or an acquaintance of yours is experiencing this exciting ceremony which is due to every human being. It may be from elementary school, junior and senior high schools, college, university, technical or training establishments that you are departing. You may be graduating from the elementary grades and will commence to decide your future vocation in high school; you may be finishing high school to further develop your character, mind, and body in a higher institute in order that you may fulfill your calling to the best of your abilities; or having covered the educational field you are turning your back upon schooling that you may start the greatest of many events, that of earning your own livelihood by means of your own skills, training and ideas. You are leaving an old familiar path, leaving old joys and sorrows, old hopes and disillusionments, old methods and mistakes; and with expectancy entrusting yourselves to a course which is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>unfamiliar.</p>
   <p>All in all you are graduating in order to commence.</p>
   <p>This month also ought to be a month of graduation and commencement for every Ukrainian boy and girl. It is time that we cast aside our intolerances toward each other; time that we refrain from entangling ourselves in petty antagonisms against groups that are not of us; time that we help and cooperate with those that are capable of leading - we, a leaderless people. Be tolerant toward others! We always hear this, many of us stress it, but very few practice that virtue. With us it is always necessary to unjustly criticize and wreck the person or group whose opinions are not similar to ours. It is absolutely impervious that we knock down the groups or organizations that are striving to do faithful work even if they may have objects parallel to our own. We ask <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for cooperation, yet we never have any to spare for others; not even charity. We forget that organizations are a means of strength and unity: two powers which Ukrainians need and lack. We are constantly bewailing the fact that we possess no capable leaders; yet we never fail to ruin their reputations and even lives by freely and thoughtlessly and enviously slandering them.</p>
   <p>It does seem strange and even ridiculous that we who most need tolerance, broad-mindedness, cooperation and leaders, mock and destroy these necessities. And stranger yet, we realize that these are necessities but do not strive to sincerely obtain them.</p>
   <p>Let us, then, during this month of graduation and commencement experience graduation and commencement for ourselves. Let us graduate from harmful habit and influences and commence acquiring desirable characteristics and outlooks.</p>
