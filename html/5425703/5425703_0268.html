   <p>The Ukrainian publishing company that publishes the Ukraina is under the direction of new officers. Its officers are the following:</p>
   <p>Michael Yaworsky, President: He is a Ukrainian contractor and builder in Chicago. This can be a security that Ukraina will be put on a solid foundation and will not quiver as it did up to this time.</p>
   <p>Andrew Bulka, Treasurer: He is one of our most prosperous businessmen. He is capable of making something practically out of nothing, although he never attended any university. He can turn a dollar out into the world and within a short time it will return to him with five others attached to it. He is the owner of the tailor shop "Bulka Bros." There they have a two-story building filled with sewing machines and tailors.</p>
   
   <p>John Bulka, Director: He is a brother of Andrew Bulka and belongs to the Bulka Brothers' firm. He is unusually energetic and of a good business nature like his brother. If he together with his brother was able to organize a tailor business worth $100,000, then Ukraina under his observation will soon become a daily instead of a weekly newspaper.</p>
   <p>Paul Sevitsky, Director: Is very well known in our Chicago colony. A man of a higher knowledge, former railroad official and commissioner from Europe, and a successful businessman in America. From the first day he arrived in America he did not go to any factory to work, but went to business, and now he owns a very nice property. He is an expert in organic chemistry which gave him the opportunity to discover various medicines for ailing people. Thus hundreds of thousands were being helped by him. Among his many discoveries is the good "Bulgarian Wine," made from many healing herbs. Mr. Paul Sevitsky's own firm is the best promise for a future success.</p>
   <p>John Rygus, Director: Widely known in the Chicago Ukrainian colony as an honest person and of a good patriotic spirit. He is the manager of the Ukrainian phonograph factory. He is an obstinate person where truth is concerned. Since he did so much for the progress of the Ukrainian factory in which Peter Gonsky is president, we are sure that he will not spare himself and will try his utmost in helping to uplift Ukraina to its highest peak.</p>
   <p>Simon Domanchuk, Secretary: Is an accomplished first class tailor. He is a young man who belongs to many of our best youth organizations in Chicago. He is of good health and character. In him rests that good creative power which is needed for the future development of the Ukrainian publishing company. He is not married as yet, so we envy some of our Chicago beauties who will be the lucky one to win the heart of the secretary of the Ukrainian Publishing Company.</p>
