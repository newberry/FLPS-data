   <p>Some time last year, in October, to be more exact, a movement was started throughout the United States to educate at least part of the Ukrainian Youth in the science of aeronautics. Racial pride, perhaps, was the cause of this movement, precipitated no doubt, by the epic flight of the Italian air force; and then again, a trained body of fliers would be an untold military advantage should the occasion ever arise for their need.</p>
   <p>Throughout the different cities, notably Chicago and Detroit, students gathered under competent instructors. With eager enthusiasm they met, desiring to be among the first to have their name inscribed as the pioneers in Ukrainian aviation. The Detroit branch or Corps II, we hear, is progressing satisfactorily and Chicago is very nearly finished with the first part of the movement.</p>
   <p>The actual formation in Chicago of Corps I was made under the head of Captain Charkow who holds a limited commercial pilot's license, thus qualifying him for this position. With Colonel Shapoval who was then head of the Siege Organization, they gathered twenty-five students to form the nuclei of this school.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The place chosen for the instruction of the students was the printing shop of the Siege newspaper. Here, every Monday and Thursday evening between the hours of eight and ten, week in and week out, these pupils met to be initiated into the art of flying. No practical shopwork was given. The idea was to leave the student learn the theoretical side of the science and then, later, to send them to a school where actual training was to be given. Approximately 170 hours of study we necessary to cover such subjects as Aerodynamics, Engine Theory and Aerial Navigation. Tests were given at various intervals and a subject was concluded with a final examination. It has taken longer to finish this part of the course than was expected but that has been compensated for by the fact that each subject was thoroughly explained and more of it presented than is necessary for an ordinary pilot to know. During this time enrollment dropped considerably and the ones left can well be called the "cream of the crop". Further training in the military line will be given these boys and girls. Each student is to become an officer upon the final completion of the course and he will be trained to command. (A course in etiquette is also in the offing, a very wise idea, and instruction in the art of conversation and entertainment is seriously being <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>considered). In order to bring the whole matter to a final conclusion it is only necessary for the older members of the organization to get together, to cease their bickering, and to send these youths to a practical school where actual flying can be taught. The strife in their ranks, or is it inertia, has resulted in very little being done, if anything at all. Rumor has it that some time back the Siege did make an agreement with the Curtiss Wright Corporation to send a number of students to their school at reduced rates. But nothing has come of it. The lack of money is a serious matter. It seems that no effort is being made to obtain any so far.</p>
   <p>In Detroit, however, there is more initiative. They have built a training plane, the Ukraine, which is to be christened on the nineteenth of August. This event will make history, for it is the first of its kind, and in the future Ukrainian avaiation will be more than a myth. That a vast city like Chicago should permit a smaller one to forge ahead of it in such a task is humiliating, but if by any chance Detroit should also have the honor of a student obtaining the first flying license in the organization then will our chagrin be complete, and low should hang our heads. Still, the cheering thought remains that at least our efforts have been successful as a whole and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>soon many more will tread in the footsteps of the leader, just as the Ukraine is forerunner of many to come. Incidentally, weather conditions permitting, Captain Charkow will make an exhibition parachute jump probably on the maiden flight of the Ukraine.</p>
   <p>The purpose, I repeat, of this movement has been two-fold. The first was to show the world that Ukrainians are not backward in one of the world's greatest undertaking. The second, the practical one, is not so honorable. If by any chance the much heralded conflict should come into being then will the value of this movement be seen. I, for one, hope that nothing of the sort will occur, but if the world should go mad and another holocaust be loosed, then we must take advantage and strike while the iron is hot. There are principles that must be defended and the principle of liberty is the greatest, yes, sufficiently great that millions of lives should be sacrificed for its existence. To release Ukraine from its despoilers and to give back its age old heritage of freedom, must be the final goal of every true Ukrainian.</p>
