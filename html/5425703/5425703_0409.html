   <p>Dr. Luke Myshuga, delegate of the Western (Galician) Ukrainian National Republic, stopped off in Chicago on September 20, on his way back home from Canada. To welcome such a dear guest and to hear the latest news from him of our native land Ukrainia, the attendance of the Ukrainian Chicagoans was altogether too small as compared with the great number of our people who live in this city.</p>
   <p>At the end of the speech given by Dr. Myshuga, he was given a check for $1,000, which is the first contribution of the Chicago Ukrainians to this fund of Instant Relief for the Native Land.</p>
