   <p>We know the fact exists that Ukraine is a country made up of almost 45,000,000 people. We, likewise, know that the Ukrainian ethnographical territory is divided among four of Europe's shrewed, super-active political countries: Russia, Poland, Chechoslovakia, and Roumania. We also should remember that in the event of a sudden spread and bursting of an everlastingly burning flame, that is, a realization of our ideals--a free and united Ukraine--we ukrainians must be prepared in one united mass, in order not to repeat our past grave and unexplained errors, for the greedy eyes of other dominant powers are always upon the Ukrainian land.</p>
   <p>"In union there is strength;" "united we stand, divided we fall."</p>
   <p>Bearing these two well known slogans in mind, let us unite to spread this burning flame, to destroy all tyrany, despotism and persecution found on ukrainian soil. With the one and only objective. "Freedom for all Ukrainian Nationalism," we can spread this flame and have remarkable results <span class="page-break">\2</span>in every part of Ukraine.</p>
   <p>We American-born young Ukrainians, with the knowledge and understanding of freedom, can readily see that our moral and material support is most valuable for the cause. By concentrating on and creating a united moral stand for the Ukrainian cause, we would have a great asset, which in due time would materialize into a reality-the liberation of Ukraine.</p>
   <p>In the realization of our ideal-a free and united Ukraine, we young Ukrainians should remember that (1) Ukraine is divided among four powers: And (2) the Ukrainian people are constantly under pressure of Russification and Polonization, being either converted to the enemies' point of view and religion, compelled to adhere to the principles of Russia or Poland, or else cruelly treated for remaining "Ukrainians".</p>
   <p>Recalling bits of Ukrainian history, we meet up with incidents which prove that history repeats itself. During the year 1638, Bogdan Khmelitzky and the Cossacks started a march upon Poland to regain their homeland from the Polish despots. On this march Khmelnitzky conquered town after town, city <span class="page-break">\3</span>after city, until he reached a territory which he knew was definitely Ukrainian. Here he was astonished to find that under the influence of the Polish despots, the Ukrainian people were fighting against his own Cossacks. Not wanting to harm his own people, he decided to investigate the cause of this change. Khmelnitzky thus sent out his most reliable men to penetrate the Polish lines and find why his people were fighting against him, these men having instructions to spread propaganda so that the Polanized Ukrainians would join his ranks.</p>
   <p>Upon making inquiries, these men found that Ukrainian religion was first of all tampered with. The Ukrainian people were forced to attend the Roman Catholic Church, and all Orthodox teachings were abolished. Besides, the Ukrainians were forced to speak Polish only. Gradually, Khmelnitzky's men spread a burning flame which reached the hearts of these Polonized Ukrainians. They explained to them that they were at heart Ukrainians, and not Poles. And that they should join Khmelnitzky to free their homeland. It was apparent that due to the severe oppression of the Polish lords, after patiently waiting for years for the liberation of Ukraine, these Ukrainian peasants slowly forgot their true identity and gradually were intermarrying <span class="page-break">\4</span>with the Poles. Nevertheless, a flame was lit in the hearts of the Ukrainian people. They deserted the Polish ranks, joined Khmelnitzky and fought with him until Ukraine again became independent.</p>
   <p>Let us young Ukrainian-Americans strive to achieve a similar result. Let us go out into the world, meet the people who speak the language of the Ukrainian people, find out where they originally came from and see if their section belongs to any part of the Ukrainian ethnographical territory, and prove to them that they are Ukrainians and nothing else. Let us learn to know our Ukrainian geographical map and analize and study the various sections of Ukraine...then we shall know that there are actually 45,000,000 Ukrainians who can be united into one indivisible nation.</p>
   <p>Unite and go out to spread this burning flame, so that others may also catch its spirit, until with a realization of our ideals the flame throws these words across the horizon of the world--"A free and united Ukraine!"</p>
