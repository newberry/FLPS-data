   <p>Under the auspices of the Ukrainian-American Citizens' Club and Sitch District Number Two, both of Chicago, a great mass meeting took place on the fifth instant, to which our beloved fighter for the independence of the Ukraine, Dr. Joseph Nazaruk, had been invited.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the meeting was Dr. W. M. Siminovich; vice-chairmen, I. Kotsovsky, I. Datskiw, and M. Ostsislavsky.</p>
   <p>Those appointed to take the collection were M. Pollack, M. Yavorsky, and W. Muzyka.</p>
   <p>The meeting was to be opened at 2:30, and half an hour before the time set Schoenhoffen Hall was filled, and the audience was eagerly waiting to see the beloved guest.</p>
   
   <p>Sharply at the appointed hour the meeting was opened by Dr. Myroslaw Siminovich, who made a short speech in these words:</p>
   <p>"Enough of disputes; enough of indifference! We need action, lively action! To-day we have the honor of welcoming our esteemed guest, a Ukrainian soldier and a statesman, Dr. Joseph Nazaruk (thunderous applause), who will tell us in brief how our affairs stand in the Ukraine, and what we must do to go hand in hand with those across the ocean who are fighting for the Ukraine's freedom."</p>
   <p>The chairman introduced another no less esteemed guest, Mr. Alexander Koshets, conductor of the Ukrainian National Chorus, who was also present at the meeting. The entire audience enthusiastically greeted the master chorus-leader with three cheers.</p>
   <p>The Reverend W. Stetsiuk was the first speaker called upon by the chairman. Like another Chrysostom, he is one of the hardest local national workers. He greeted the Chicago Ukrainian colony with these words:</p>
   <p>"This is our group! These are pearls; these are sincere earnest hard workers, who always and everywhere support the Ukrainian cause. They bought $11,000 worth of the Ukrainian victory bonds. They always support the Ukrainian Government, with Dr. E. Petrushevich as its President!"</p>
   <p>The Reverend Mr. Stetsiuk in his speech encouraged those present to promote the work in the national field, and he sincerely thanked Dr. Joseph Nazaruk as well as Mr. A. Koshets for their visit among the Ukrainians in Chicago. He finished his speech with these words:</p>
   <p>"Western Ukraine (Galicia) is on fire. Let it burn! Let it burn to the point where all the Poles shall be consumed, and from the ruins shall rise the golden freedom of the Ukraine!"</p>
   
   <p>The next speaker on the program was Mr. A. Koshets, who in his short speech outlined his activity with the Ukrainian National Chorus. He remarked that even though his work is not of a political nature, it is propagandistic for the freedom of the Ukraine. Song awakens and will continue to awaken all the national life and will tell to strangers and to other nations who we are, and whose sons we are, said he. He finished with the words:</p>
   <p>"I only wish that your voices could resound as mightily as the Ukrainian songs [themselves] resound with one general and great cry of desire: Freedom, freedom for the Ukraine!"</p>
   <p>Now followed the speech of Dr. Joseph Nazaruk:</p>
   <p>"At the recommendation of the Government of the Western Ukrainian (Galician) Republic, I have the honor to thank you, dear countrymen, for this, that you, in this critical moment of the fight for Ukrainian independence, have helped our Government. It is due to your co-operation that today our cause is already placed on the daily schedule!"</p>
   <p>He went on to give a sketch of the fight for Ukrainian independence by the Sitch soldiers, speaking so clearly and intelligibly that up to the present no Ukrainian Chicagoan has ever given to the public so vivid a history of our struggle. In his one-hour speech he practically hypnotized the audience so that they seemed ready to listen to his excellent discourse for a whole day. His words were so dynamic, eloquent, and true to life because he not only described something that he has seen but something for which he has fought, something which he has lived through, something for which he has shed his blood--Ukrainian independence.</p>
   <p>He gave the clear facts as to why the Western Ukrainian Government and its army did not unite with Petlura, why did they not unite with the communists, and why the Western Ukrainian army found itself under Denikin.</p>
   
   <p>"Neither the Ukrainian army nor the Ukrainian Government in Galicia can be blamed for it. This Government as well as the whole Ukrainian nation has before it the single ideal and aim of one united great Ukraine.</p>
   <p>"There, where Kiev stands, there our Western Ukrainian Government has its eyes fixed. There we want to have our central Government. This, and no other, is our aim! The ideal of every nation is to be united in one integral state, but occasionally, as in our case, circumstances do not permit it!</p>
   <p>"If it be decreed that Western Ukraine and Great Ukraine are one, then, since Petlura agreed to cede Galicia to Poland, we should be apt to lose it, but as the matter stands, it is more advantageous for us. For our Western Ukrainian Government utterly rejected Petlura's move, and Poland today does not have as yet any claim upon Galicia.</p>
   <p>"Why do we conduct all our political business outside the Ukraine? Because the enemies, who have occupied our country would not permit us to do anything of the sort on our own soil. Again, no country has won its independence since the world war except outside its own boundaries, i. e., abroad.</p>
   <p>"The argument that our Government is not authoritative is false! "Our Government in Western Ukraine is legal, lawful, and authoritative, because it was established while we were shedding our blood for Ukrainian independence. Those who think that by tearing down our Government they are favoring the Ukraine surely are making a mistake. They are injuring the Ukraine and thereby helping Poland.</p>
   <p>"A fight is in the air! A fight is going on! Poland cannot stand such a fight any longer. She is failing before our very eyes. She will collapse.</p>
   <p>"The time will come when the Ukrainian soldiers will be stationed in Warsaw and Cracow, even as now their soldiery is stationed on our Ukrainian soil!</p>
   
   <p>"There is no nation to be found that is not against Poland, and our fight will cause the Polish state to perish!</p>
   <p>"Our slogan is: Do not tear down the Ukrainian Government! By forming one front we help the Ukrainian Government. Our unanimous stand against Poland will drive her, our enemy, relentlessly away from our soil!</p>
   <p>"In the United States we already have the United Insurance to which all our organizations belong, including the Sitch organization with its headquarters in Chicago. Those five letters in the word 'Sitch' are our much-prized slogan! This is the organization which all should join. Such an organization as Sitch should shine above all other organizations because its existence is the most opportune at the present time. All should understand that it is the duty of the Sitch to help the fighters beyond the seas. It is the duty of the Sitch organization to give help to our waiting army there!</p>
   
   <p>"In the name of the Western Ukrainian Government, in the name of its parliament, in the name of you all, brothers and sisters here beyond the seas, I appeal to you most ardently to help our fight in Galicia against Poland!</p>
   <p>"Do not throw stones at the Western Ukrainian Government, which has no stain upon its name but is honorable and economical and in every respect faithfully performs its duty. Our Government is built upon charred ruins, and in this same condition it still exists! Our good fortune was [then] knocking at our door and continues to knock! There is still time for us to achieve this good fortune; therefore help to support your Government!"</p>
   <p>Thus finishing his speech, he thanked the Chicago colony for its work on behalf of its nation. Thundering and long-continued ovations followed as the reward of the grandiloquent speech of Dr. Nazaruk from the enthusiastic, inspired, and uplifted audience.</p>
   
   <p>There were a few Reds in the hall, but they sat quietly, knowing that this mass meeting was under the auspices of the Sitch organization. One of the Reds merely ventured to propound a few questions written out on paper, silly questions, of course, which Dr. Nazaruk answered briefly, and for which Comrade Red received a loud "Boo!"</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky, chief executive of the Sitch organization. This generous, determined Cossack pays no attention to impediments but goes wherever Ukrainians live with the slogans: "To action!" and "Join the Sitch!" He has not only showed us his generosity in words; he has also proved by his actions that he has the Ukrainian cause deeply at heart. He appealed to the audience for the so-called "Immediate Fund." After his terse speech his listeners began to approach the desks of the secretaries of the meeting with their contributions to the fund.</p>
   <p>During this time the elderly Dr. W. Siminovich, in his feeling style, appealed to all to unite in action and in contributing for the national needs. He was quite interesting, for although he is old in years, he is still young in spirit and eager to work and to fight for the freedom of the Ukraine.</p>
   <p>Next was Nicholas Thatchuk, the son of flowery Bukovina. His speech also was full of feeling. He surely practices what he preaches, for he is a staunch member of Sitch. For this he deserves recognition.</p>
   <p>Then Joseph Kotsovsky spoke. He, as a good patriot, sacrifices everything possible for the national cause; in particular, money is of no consequence to him when it is a question of doing something for the national cause. He won the approval of all by his speech, and everybody enjoyed it because he explained himself in plain language. He is of the practical type and believes more in deeds than in useless, empty phrases.</p>
   <p>The money collected was sent directly to Dr. S. Stotsky. For the "Immediate Fund" $668.75 was contributed. A list of the contributors will be published in the next issues of the Sitch News.</p>
   <p>A few months ago Dr. Luke Myshuga received from Chicago a check for $1,000 signed by Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky. Up to the present the contributions to cover the check have amounted to $721.25. Therefore $278.75 was added to this sum from the collection that was made at this mass meeting; an additional $390 was set aside as an installment on another $1,000 to be sent to the Ukrainian Government.</p>
   <p>In Dr. L. Myshuga's stay in Chicago, at the confidential meeting of the few leaders of Chicago, $73 more was contributed, which was also sent to the "Immediate Fund."</p>
   <p>In short, the Chicago Ukrainian colony has contributed to the "Immediate Fund" up to the present time $1,462.</p>
   <p>Telegrams of protest were sent to Bonar Law, premier of England, to the League of Nations in Switzerland, and to the American Secretary of State, Mr. Hughes. </p>
   <p>The mass meeting was concluded with the Ukrainian national anthem. The whole audience was highly inspired.</p>
