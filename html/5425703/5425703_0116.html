   <p>Preparation. Meeting place. Order. Parade, Public Meeting place. American Press.</p>
   <p>After a long and exciting discussion, finally a day was appointed for the Ukrainian manifestation. Two long, depressing, unbearable days, preceded the 30th day of May. On the outside was a continuous heavy rain. The horizon was covered with leaden clouds. A heavy oppressive fog began to spread from the lake on all sides. If only for a moment the blue sky would brighten, but no, everything remained as if it were concreted.</p>
   <p>Nature appeared obstinate and as if bent on aggravating the hope for a successful Ukrainian manifestation. Everyone was prepared for a bitter disappointment.</p>
   <p>The 30th of May also came cloudy, all swaddled with clouds. About ten o'clock that morning, the clouds became thin and the fog began to disappear. The sun began to shine in the sky.</p>
   <p>From all sides of the city and suburbs the societies accompanied by music, American and Ukrainian banners, began to move into the appointed places.</p>
   <p>Even though there were two meeting places, both were intended for the same cause.</p>
   <p>At one o'clock the signal was given at Oakley Boulevard to march on. The national march was played and all the lodges moved by fours along Chicago Avenue.</p>
   <p>At Hoyne Avenue the independent societies, already waiting in disciplined order, began to fall into one strong, unbroken phalanx. They began to flow into one big family just as the waters of the Dnieper-Slavuta flow quietly into the great depths of the Ukrainian Black Sea. A yielding peace and dignity began to show themselves on the cheeks of the people marching and in the eyes of the multitudes an unextinguished fire appeared in a stubborn determination, as if they were answering to their brothers, over the sea, asking for help in the midst of the fire and blood.</p>
   <p>The parade alone was a huge one. One had to wait for half an hour until the thirty societies that numbered nearly five thousand people passed.</p>
   <p>In the front rode men on two horses, and after them followed men bearing thirty or more flags, the flags being mostly American. Only four Ukrainian azure and gold flags were in the parade, belonging to a society which had the true national tendency. We felt the lack of our national colors.</p>
   <p>After the flags, our women followed proudly in Ukrainian costumes. This is our glory, our hope, boosting our national costumes everywhere.</p>
   <p>After the women came a decorated wagon, carrying a troop of girls in Red Cross uniforms, and among them the "Svoboda," (Liberty) and "Ukrainia" with chains on their hands, an allegoric picture of our fatherland that in a hard and bloody way gained its liberty and lost it abruptly.</p>
   <p>After this wagon there came in different formations, lodges of male societies, clubs and the sitch. After them came five allegorical emblems representing the United States, France, England, Italy and Belgium. These assured the world that the only rescue for Ukrainia is in being united with the Allies.</p>
   <p>After them followed long ranks of our men, both old and young, preceded by orchestras that played the national marches and hymns almost without stopping. Every society carried a banner with an inscription invoking the Allies and Germans to "Let live the true democracy!" Let live the liberty!" "Down with the Kaiser and his regime!" and many such others.</p>
   <p>The thorough, dignified, saintly feeling, the sound of the national melodies and hymns; the display of American and Ukrainian colors under the blissful sun, all this added power and charm to the national manifestation.</p>
   <p>Thousands of people looked on from the buildings, through windows and from balconies.</p>
   <p>The parade came to Pulaski Park. The big hall was filled with three thousand people. Half remained in the park courtyard.</p>
   <p>Public Meeting. In the hall everyone was very calm. The band played the American national anthem. Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich greets the assembled with the words, "Glory! Glory! Glory!" He speaks with youthful zest about the significance of this moment and protests against the breach of Germany's agreement with Ukrainia at Brest-Litovsk. In sharp words he begs the gathering to protest against the violence of Germany toward Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>The second speaker on the platform was Father Nicholas Hutynsky. He spoke with great enthusiasm, pointing to the gains of the French and American revolution, pointing out that our future lies in the lot of truly democratic states of the world and in the loyalty of the Ukrainians to the United States.</p>
   <p>The third speaker was Dr. Stephen Hryniewiecky, whom the public greeted with great applause.</p>
   <p>He spoke in a dignified manner and with well chosen words, joining his address in thought to those of the previous speakers, assuring us that notwithstanding all the adverse powers, our nation remains still in its harmonious strength, in its national consciousness and solidarity.</p>
   <p>Every speech was alternated with singing by the choruses of M. Sysenko, Boyan and Bandurysk. They impressed the listeners with beautiful native and foreign songs. All the choruses sang wonderfully, feeling the importance of the time and place. Above all the Boyan chorus was at its zenith under the capable direction of Madam Hryniewiecky, with its strength, fairness and symphony.</p>
   <p>Then followed speakers from other Slavic nationalities according to the program. Mr. I. Smolinsky greeted the Ukrainian assembly from the Poles. He wished freedom to the Ukrainians, Poles and all the Slavic peoples.</p>
   <p>The greatest enthusiasm was shown when the American congressman, Mr. McCormick, appeared. With a strong voice he won the souls of the listeners very effectively. He spoke on the meaning of today's war, pointing out the facts about the Allies, saying that in the United States is found the only bulwark of real democracy, and the mainstay of the Allies' strength. This in the end will put down the brutal German militarism. He bade the Ukrainians join the Allies.</p>
   <p>After him followed Mr. Stepina, who spoke for the Czechs, pointing out that Austria and Germany are the greatest enemies of all the Slavs.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Biankini, for the Croatians, wished for the Ukrainians their freedom, stating that the future hope of the Slavs lies in the federation of all the Slavs.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Palandech spoke for the Serbs. He said that the Serbs and the Montenegrins sacrificed their lives in the World War for their liberty and that of all the Slavs.</p>
   <p>Mr. I. Zuzek spoke for the Slovenes and assured the Ukrainians of the sympathy and the attachment of the Slovenian people to the Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>Father H. Pakalnis, on the part of the Lithuanians, shortly related the history of the union of Ukrainia with Lithuania, and talked on the Polish nobility as the mutual enemy of both Lithuania and Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>Among other Ukrainian speakers that deserve credit are Mr. P. Ikach, who spoke for the Ukrainian Federation of the Socialist Party in America. He protested against Germany's abolishing the Ukrainian Central Rada (council) and against the self-styled hetman Skoropadsky.</p>
   <p>Then followed Father H.Homitsky who fervently pointed out the progress of the struggle for the national liberty of the Ukrainians in Austria and begged them to join all the other Slavic nations against Germany and Austria.</p>
   <p>Every speaker was greeted with great applause, and everyone went home filled with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>After the meeting followed a reception in the Hotel La Salle, in which practically all the speakers took part.</p>
   <p>On the following morning news of the Ukrainian manifestation appeared in almost all the local American newspapers.</p>
   <p>The fullest account appeared in the Daily News, the Tribune, and the Morning Herald.</p>
   <p>Yet these news articles were all very short in spite of the fact that there were two American correspondents at the gathering who were given ample and exhaustive information. The article printed in the above mentioned newspapers were beneficial mostly to the Slavonic League, whose existence we do not even know, let alone how this league favors the Ukrainian cause. In them, likewise, were registered personal ambitions of some of our leaders, who are infected with the mania for greatness, and who want to obtain the biggest credit and glory for themselves. They would surely take all the credit to themselves if they could, for planning this manifestation, especially those that probably did not use any effort at all. It would be well if the leaders who are better informed about this Slavonic League would convey to us what positions they hold in the above mentioned League.</p>
   <p>In the end we can proudly state that the Ukrainian colony in Chicago acquired great moral benefit from this manifestation.</p>
   <p>The people saw for themselves how strength is created when they unite solidly in the national cause.</p>
   <p>We expected, however, that the arrangers of the manifestation would know how to interest American political circles in the Ukrainian cause on a broader scale. In this direction the manifestation brought little or absolutely no gain! For this great failure on the part of those who arranged the Ukrainian manifestation there awaits a reckoning before our people, who underwent so much trouble and who made such heavy expenditures.</p>
