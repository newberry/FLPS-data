   <p>The Chicago district Siege organization announces that it will hold two grand picnics, the first on June 19 and the second on July 4, 1921.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we ask all the Ukrainian societies, associations, and sodalities, in Greater Chicago, to refrain from having any doings on the above mentioned days. Thanks.</p>
