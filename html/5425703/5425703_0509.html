   <p>[This applies to Chicago, the Sitch Center since 1920]</p>
   <p>Thanks to the Interim Sitch Committee, the first Sitch convention was called on November 11, 1916, in New York City, and from almost everywhere in the United States, delegates from Ukrainian organizations and associations rallied to establish the Ukrainian Sitch Organization in the United States.</p>
   <p>According to Sitch custom, the convention at that time elected the following Sitch officers: Head Commander, M. Rybak, Philadelphia, Pa.; Circuit Commander, V. Serbey, Allentown, Pa.; Assistant Circuit Commander, P. Zadoretsky, New York City; Secretaries, L. Stachursky, Jersey City, N. J.; V. Koval, Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
   <p>These officers were entrusted with leading the Sitch organization, and they publicly declared upon their honor that they would rather die than stray from or become lax in, the duties placed upon them. From the zeal and sincere determination of that sparkling youth, one could easily conclude that there was no power in the world which could stop them from their work in the Sitch field.</p>
   <p>With gladness and satisfaction, the delegates parted with full persuasion and firm faith that in the near future the Sitch bugle would blow, the strawberry-colored banner would be hoisted, hatchet and canes would flash, and simultaneously with this, our youth would wake up from their slumber to a better life, which will start its ant-like work in the Sitch field all over America.</p>
   <p>It has been almost two years since the Sitch organization was established. Just a few swore to be faithful to the Sitch cause. Yet, outside all the impediments on the part of our own and foreigners (for it is a known fact that Sitch organization does not appeal to everybody), the Sitch movement in America did not perish, but on the contrary, recently proved to be greater than ever.</p>
   <p>Up to the present time, the following independent Sitch athletic branches joined the main Sitch organization:</p>
   <p>No. 1. Sitch of B. Chmelnylsky, New York, N. Y.</p>
   <p>No. 2. Sitch of P. Doroshenko, Allentown, Pa.</p>
   <p>No. 3. Sitch of I. Mazepa, Jersey City, N. J.</p>
   <p>No. 4. Sitch of P. Polubotok, Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
   <p>No. 5. Sitch of P. Sahaydachny, Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
   <p>No. 6. Sitch of M. Pavlyk, Bayonne, N. J.</p>
   <p>No. 7. Sitch of M. Zaliznyak, Brooklyn. N. Y.</p>
   <p>No. 8. Sitch of Ivan Franko, Berwick, Pa.</p>
   <p>No. 9. Sitch of I. Samiylovich, Manchester, N. H.</p>
   <p>No. 10. Sitch of F. Sevchenko, Cohoes, N. Y.</p>
   <p>No. 11. Sitch of M. Drahomaniw, Ansonia, Pa.</p>
   <p>No. 12. Sitch of P. Mohyla, McIntyre, Pa.</p>
   <p>No. 13. Sitch of B. Chmelnytzky, Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>No. 14. Sitch of I. Gonta, New Britain, Conn.</p>
   <p>The Sitch officers entertain high hopes that with the publishing of the Sitch News, the first issue of which you now read, the Sitch movement will not only come back to life, but will be bettered and spread wherever the last spark of love for the native fatherland, Ukrainia, is not as yet extinguished. They further believe that the Sitch branches will support our work with all their might. It is on you that the future of our periodical depends, which will bring to your home a sincerely warm Sitch greeting.</p>
