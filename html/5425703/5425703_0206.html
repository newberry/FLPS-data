   <p>The Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago. (p. 88)</p>
   <p>The story of the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago is the story of one of the greatest capella choruses in America. Since its organization in 1928, this chorus has marched forward and is an inspiration to all those who find obstacles only an incentive to their removal, - a chorus of men and women who find their courage renewed by song, and who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>face the future unflinchingly, refusing to admit there is such a thing as the impossible.</p>
   <p>For taking the initiative in organizing the chorus, Mrs. Alice Howard, an American of keen artistic sense, is to be highly credited. Knowing that Ukrainians excel in the field of song, she herself appealed to Ukrainian-Americans of Chicago and met a hearty response in the persons of George Benetzky, a great conductor, thirty talented singers, and a benevolent patron, Mr. Conrad Sawiak. Its march started December 28, 1930, in full native costume in gay color and proud triumph in the first official concert appearance at the Civic Theatre. Presenting a comprehensive program of selected folk material from Ukraine with the purest harmony of their capella voices, it at once enchanted a large audience. Since this official introduction of the music world, every succeeding appearance of the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago added to its capabilities and marked a new step in choral achievement.</p>

   <p>In events of major importance such as the Chicagoland Music Festival, given by 35 newspapers with the Chicago Daily Tribune leading, it had participated, taking twice the first prize in the mixed choral contests for five states, at the 1930 and 1931 fetes respectively. No other chorus in America ever repeated a like tremendous victory. Leading American music critics, hearing the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago, wrote that its successes were not at all surprising.</p>
   <p>In its musical tours in Chicagoland, the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago was called a "hit" and praised very highly. In the great Carnival of Nations Finals of 1931 and 1932, respectively, the Chicago Daily News featured the chorus especially.</p>
   <p>Upon invitation of the Civic Music Association, the chorus sang at the Civic Auditorium in La Porte, Ind., and at the High School Auditorium in Sheboygan, Wis. Both of these concerts were very successful.</p>

   <p>The Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago gave a concert last year at the Studebaker Theatre, for which it was highly praised; also its appearance at the Century of Progress Exposition won the admiration of everyone of Ukrainian art.</p>
   <p>In addition to its concert appearances, the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago, upon invitation of the National Broadcasting Company, presented numerous most delightful programs over the air.</p>
   <p>The genius of the choral director, George Benetzky, the virtuosity of his choral group, the wealth of song contributed by the Ukrainian peasant, are items of comment by music critics.</p>
   <p>Representing standards highly professional, the Ukrainian Chorus of Chicago during the past six years established itself in community choral singing and as one of the finest choruses helped usher in a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>new dawn in music, especially in Chicago. Absorbed into our standardizing American life, it has both delighted and acquainted American music lovers with something that is new in song, both in technique and in theme.</p>
   <p>Some of the remarks being quoted by our music critics:</p>
   <p>"There is nothing but praise to write, nothing but pleasant memories to treasure of the Ukrainian chorus and its remarkably talented director, George Benetzky. The Ukrainians delight the ear as well as the eye. The ear is charmed by the quality of their united and harmonious tone and caressed by the pitch perfection of this a capella singing - the eye enjoys the picturesqueness and warm coloring of the costumes."</p>
   <p>Herman Devries, Chicago Evening American, Jan. 23, 1933.</p>
   <p>"In its balance and discipline, as in its tone quality, it is one of <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the best choruses to be heard in America. And it sings under the leadership of a capella and imaginative conductor, George Benetzky."</p>
   <p>Eugene Stinson, Chicago Daily News, Jan. 23, 1933.</p>
   <p>"Ukrainian Chorus is uncommonly skilled in the art of song. Whether their voices are in full strength or whether they go into the peculiar buzzing hum which is one of their effects, they are always musical, with many devices of expressive contrast, but always with the main line of the composition in mind."</p>
   <p>Edward Moore, Chicago Daily Tribune, Jan. 23, 1933.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Benetzky literally "played on the chorus" as on a magnificent organ."</p>
