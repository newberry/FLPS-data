   <p>The angel of death that visits Chicago did not forget to pay a visit to a Ukrainian family.</p>
   <p>On October 4, at 7 A.M., this unmerciful angel of death came unexpectedly to the home of our beloved Father Osyp Kuzma and took his immaculate soul to eternity, leaving a remembrance after his frightful visit: to his dearest wife, to all his co-nationalists, friends and acquaintances, to members of the Ukrainian National Church of the Blessed Trinity on Erie near Robey Street, to friends by calling, the Ukrainian National priests and to all the Ukrainian National Churches of America, as well as to our dear Ukrainia of which the deceased was a true son and an honorable and a loyal worker.</p>
   <p>The late Father Osyp was born on the 16th of November, 1889, in Zolochiv, Ukrainian Galicia, under an old black peasant roof.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The parents of the deceased were Daniel and Catherine, who though being poor, decided to give everything they had in order that their son Osyp might receive a higher education. So, on completing the fourth grade in the national school, his parents sent Osyp to a gymnasium school, where the deceased was an outstanding student almost every year. It was thus until he reached seventh grade. Being a student in the seventh grade, the late Father Osyp very well understood the maltreatment of the Ukrainian people by the Poles, which he witnessed with his own eyes and then he began to help them morally. On every occasion he went to the neighboring villages, to the libraries, where he gave lectures, encouraging the youth to work among themselves. At times the late Father Osyp traveled with Ukrainin lectures, mostly before elections, and agitated in favor of the Ukrainian candidates for the senate. To add to the misfortune, evil was threatening. Surprising news began to seep through the school officials against Father Osyp; accusing him of being a "haydamak," (robber). Following this news began the investigations <span class="page-break">3</span>of the Polish professors and even of our own; and hence a command to cease his activity. Having an inborn love for liberty and truth, the future Father Osyp, with his parents' consent, gave up his gymnasium studies, and bade farewell to his native home and his dearest countrymen, departing for the world beyond the wide sea, America, where he knew, was liberty, in which the deceased expected to find internal contentment.</p>
   <p>A poor man is always poor, says our watchword. This proverb particularly concerned the late Father Osyp. On coming to America, Father Osyp found himself abandoned, like a boat on the wild sea. No family nor friends nor acquaintances. In time he became acquainted with some of our intelligent people. Mostly the priests turned from the deceased without much faith, saying that he was an exile, loving none not even himself.</p>
   <p>So "keep away from him, people!"</p>
   <p>He was refused by his own.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Yet other people who recognized the usefulness of Father Osyp interested themselves in him and tried to give him some work wherever possible.</p>
   <p>After learning the English language a little, the late Father Osyp enrolled in a business college at Wilkes Barre, Pa., striving one way or another to add to his knowledge, thus making his meager livelihood.</p>
   <p>In 1915 Father Osyp came to Milwaukee, Wis., where he got a job in a store. In the evenings he began to attend Marquette University.</p>
   <p>Through the good will of influential persons, the late Father Osyp began teaching in the Hanover Street public school and, besides this, he taught in the preparatory class for the citizens' papers. The deceased worked hard, without complaining against the bitter lot, being modest in self praise of his work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>He only desired that his work should benefit others and only others, and that at the same time it should bring to him some livelihood. But he is a Ukrainian, he must work for the Ukrainian people, for the honest community.</p>
   <p>With fire in his soul he devoted himself to studying the occupations and positions of our people in America in every walk of life. Their Father Osyp studied the situation of the Ukrainians in America, and noticed a new trend, this being the movement for the national church.</p>
   <p>When he became a priest, Father Osyp (Joseph) was the happiest person in the world. "I could draw the whole world to my heart now, together with my friends and enemies," he said after he was ordained. "Granted health and strength, I believe that I will be able to do most everything for my dear Ukrainia and her children. I do not fear the enemies. They are not frightful to me, because I believe in the victory of light <span class="page-break">6</span>over darkness. I believe in triumph of the blessed truth over the cursed lie. I believe in the resurrection of the Ukrainian people from their dark tomb, into which the enemies gradually pushed our people, i. e., into spiritual darkness, ignorance and the national unconsciousness sown among them for centuries, which helped and even today helps to torture our dear Ukrainia."</p>
   <p>This is the thought the closed lips of Father Osyp utters today, while in his eyes one could see the fire burning for the love and willingness of his young life to become an offering on the altar of our dear Ukrainia and of all her oppressed Ukrainian people.</p>
   <p>As a priest, Father Osyp (Joseph) believed he could do a great deal of good for his people here in America. Within a few months Father Osyp made acquaintance with the most influential Americans, who honored and valued him even though he was young. Father Osyp was the first Ukrainian in Chicago who really knew how to interest Americans in the Ukrainians, before whom he oftentimes spoke in the English language. Father Osyp <span class="page-break">7</span>would announce the Ukrainian name wherever he could, and would represent our people as the nicest in the world. He worked the best he could and as a reward for his work in the national cause, he gathered sneers and reproaches from jealous enemies and blind fanatics, who today rejoice at the opportunity of his death, unappreciative to the late Father Osyp's true patriotism and work in the Ukrainian National Church field.</p>
   <p>Rejoice, Oh enemies! but know you that the dirt you throw at Father Osyp does not fall on him, but on yourselves. There will come the time when you will become conscious of yourselves and become ashamed of yourselves.</p>
   <p>And you, dear friend, brother and Father Osyp, may you rest in peace. May this free American soil that you loved so much as first after dear Ukrainia, be as light as a feather, and a remembrance unto you. May his memory among the Ukrainian people live from year to year evermore.</p>
