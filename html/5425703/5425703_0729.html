   <p>It has been fitting upon many occasions to celebrate the momentary independence which was gained for Ukraine. We are not to celebrate the honor and glory of this independence gained; rather, to mourn the honor and glory that was lost by the inability of leaders to control what they had gained.in the fatherland of our people.</p>
   <p>We shall remember that Ukraine did at one time possess full independence. The question arises: what took place since? The answer is short but plain, straightforward but true: We do not possess the love towards our fellow men which is necessary to hold us together, and Unity is the one thing which is lacking.</p>
   <p>The immortal American, President Lincoln, once stated: "A house divided against itself cannot stand." That is exactly the case or the status of the Ukrainian people, division in politics, division in state and division in religion; division in every nook and corner of the country.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>How do you expect that country to live through all the terror and cruelty of such division?</p>
   <p>Then, what was the cause of the division? There is no general rule governing the causes, but a simple abstract of the principle of blind leadership. And by blind leadership, I mean the first speaking fool with any half-education, who cares to come before some group of people. It has become a habit of the Ukrainian people and of Ukrainian descendants to follow the crowd; but in most cases the smaller crowd with the most foolish appearing leader.</p>
   <p>Let us consider the case of the Ukrainian people here in the United States. We have Greek Catholics who are members of the one true faith of our Father, and which, I believe, was the first religion of the great Ukrainian country. But what has become of the case of late years? There came about a schism which separated the Ukrainian people into the first great division. Next came the Baptists, another division took place; and the Ukrainians have joined all sorts of protesting religions going into <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>classes of beliefs to which a Ukrainian person should never stop, although his spirit and soul have long since been sacrificed at the altar of the falsely called ecclesiastical freedom, or the freedom of religion.</p>
   <p>Unity, as I have already stated, is the thing which is lacking. Someone will ask: "What is unity?" Unity, therefore, is that quality of reason which enables people to think alike, to plan alike, and to act alike and together.</p>
   <p>Another question arises in the mind: Why bring religion into consideration of the subject? A reply readily forms itself, since religion is the basic control on the morality of a people. Fear of fellow man, and fear of God, will prevent any person from creating wrong.</p>
   <p>When religion is absent there remains nothing which can be of moral utility to a man flattered by egotism, and urged by evil desire to snatch everything possible, which might be even of little or not use to him, but which may be of use to his fellow man.</p>

   <p>The Ukrainian people have had tragic experiences. It is time to take note of this experience, and to make the best of it. We have also learned through experience that unfit and untrained leadership has caused the condition which now exists in that southeastern European country, Ukraine. So why not renew our course and go about matters in the proper way.</p>
   <p>On the European unrest of the present day, there shall present itself an opportunity; and to seize that opportunity will be the duty of men capable of such a deed. Among the unrest and war cry of Europe there will arise the opportunity to free that rich and fertile country which our fathers are proud to call "Fatherland."</p>
   <p>But to seize that opportunity and to free that fatherland will be the duty of men who shall have the courage, physical and moral, to act at the proper time. Most men have the physical strength and energy; but many do not possess the moral subsidence of energy which is most urgently necessary.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Many of you shall ask: What is this moral support of which you speak?</p>
   <p>The great English writer, poet laureate of England, Alfred Lord Tennyson, once wrote: "Pray! For more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of." Prayer is a mighty weapon, mightier than sword and fire, and through prayer shall be attained the independence which was lost through foolery and egotism. It is up to you people, especially the younger people, to awaken to the fact that there still is an Almighty God, Who is capable of subduing the whole world. And the Almighty God Himself once said: "Ask and it shall be given to you."</p>
   <p>So do not fail to ask. Ask for unity, for power! And in asking, unite and be prepared to act. Secure for yourselves the unity in the Greek Catholic Religion, the religion of our forefathers. Secure for yourselves the ability to lead and to act towards a peaceful, free, and happy life. Secure for yourselves the blessings which are necessary toward well being.</p>

   <p>Who knows, but that amongst you is listed a future leader of the Ukrainian people. Who knows, but that amongst you is one whose name shall be remembered and revered through the ages for deeds splendid and heroic. Who knows, but that amongst you is a future general, a promoter of liberty and freedom in lands yet unfree, in states yet forlorn.</p>
   <p>You are Americans, and by every right of reason, by every judgment of intellect, you must be loyal to America. America today is doing more for the poor people of the world than is all the rest of the world put together.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to fight and kill in order to secure independence for the fatherland, but powerful leadership, direct statesmanship, and honest generalship can do more today by speaking than can the armies of the universe by fighting.</p>
   <p>In order to have that power, that directness, that honesty, and that <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>ability, you must prepare yourselves. You must study, develop, and instruct yourselves in the principles of unity, unity in state, unity in religion and unity at all times, for divided we fall, and only united we stand for liberty and for freedom to all.</p>
