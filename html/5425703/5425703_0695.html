   <p>Brilliant in the scholastic field, popular in various branches of student activity, Stephen W. Mamchur, B.A., M.A., holds a unique record of having won four fellowships and one scholarship, and of having been an outstanding leader in extracurricular activities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mamchur's high school record in Bedford Road Collegiate, Saskatoon, Sask Canada, was crowned with his winning the Senior Gold Medal in History and the Literary Society Prize in Boys Oratory.</p>
   <p>In May, 1931, Mr. Mamchur, having specialized in history and Political Science, received the B.A. degree with honors from the University of Saskatchewan. He then spent a year of graduate work at the same University--this time specializing in Education--and received distinction in his work. In September, 1932, having been awarded a two year fellowship by the Social Research Council of Mc. Gill University, Montreal, he embarked on the study of Sociology, and in 1934 <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was awarded the M. A. degree. He next won a fellowship at the Institute of Human Relations of Yale University, and entered Yale in October 1934 to continue his studies in Sociology. Last May he obtained a renewal of his fellowship for next year, and in addition was awarded a scholarship. The following year, then, Mr. Mamchur will continue his Ph. D. studies in Yale.</p>
   <p>Notable as have been his academic achievements, no less note-worthy have been his general activities in the social and intellectual life of the three universities through which he has thus far passed. His offices in Students Societies have included: The presidency of the Historical Association of the U. of S.; the managing editorship of the Sheaf of the U of S.; the secretaryship of the Newman Club of the U. of S. for 3 successive years; the presidency of sociological society of Mc. Gill U. etc. At the respective universities which he has attended he has been one of the foremost debators and public speakers.</p>
   <p>It is most natural; then that the Ukrainian Catholic Youth League was proud to have the good fortune of having Mr. S. W. Mamchur for the speaker at its Second Congress. Mr. Mamchur's address, printed below, proved to be a most scholarly one, intriguing, vitalizing and interesting from every point of view. No wonder <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>then, that many delegates have asked for copies of this address on the same day it was delivered.</p>
   <p>It is our hope, that the readers of "Ukrainian Youth" will read this address very carefully, and that we will be favored by their comments on it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chairman, Reverend Fathers, Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>I have chosen to speak on the "Orientation of the Ukrainian-American Student," and as I go on, I shall make clear with what particular phases of this general topic I shall deal. In order, however, that you may understand why I make the suggestions which I shall make later on in my talk, I find it necessary to describe very briefly what I regard to be the REALITY of the situation of the Ukrainians in America. And this description of what I call the reality of the situation of the Ukrainians in America is, in greater or lesser degree, similar to that of any other nationality which has migrated to America. In other words, let me sketch what the essence of the general immigrant situation is.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>It needs no explanation to grasp the fact that an immigrant is one who has moved from one cultural milieu to another. That is, when one moves, he moves not as a simple physical skeleton, he moves as a personality; as an individual who has a certain language, a certain religion, certain occupational abilities, skills and attitudes, certain political experiences, certain manners and usages in connection with marriage and family life and that goes to make up living. In other words, the immigrant comes with a culture (based on his historical experience) which, though it may not be vastly different from that somewhat-hard-to-define American Culture is it yet different from the latter in some degree. It is for that reason that the immgrant-in order to live as a human-being-i.e. to express himself according to his culture--establishes various institutions, "Societies" the church, the press, the mutual benefit organizations, the dramatic and literary clubs, choral groups, and the organizations which aim primarily at helping those of his nationality abroad. Now these series of institutions constitute, by and large, the "world" in which the immigrant in America lives. It could not be otherwise; true, he works usually in American institutions, and has other commercial contacts with the latter; when children grow up they are important American-culture carriers into the home, and thus also contribute somewhat to the change of the culture of the parents. But essentially the immigrant participates <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>little in the American world; his distinct culture, coupled with the fact that he comes with an occupational background which sets him upon his arrival here in the lowest occupational class in the country--that of unskilled labor not only serves to keep him apart from the American world, but actually makes Ukrainian society of tremendous value to him. This immigrant society, at first constituted to admit the individuals's culture expression, later serves in turn to actually preserve his old world culture--his national identity. Hence, by and large, though the culture of the immigrant changes, the degree of change is small; he is essentially a Ukrainian and as such he dies.</p>
   <p>But the situation is very different with his descendants, those born in America, a certain amount of Ukrainian culture is transmited to them through the homes and through familiar participation in the immigrant society; but the primary fact that from the age of six or so they attend American educational institutions, coupled with all that that signifies,--means that the attitudes and values of the children--their culture--will be very different from that of their parents;--they become progressively less Ukrainian, and simultaneusly more American. Some <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>may become completely identified with American culture. But whether or not that happens in the second generation,--it is inevitable in later generations; one may remember his national ancestry but that is all. His interests have become the interests of those about him; and their culture is--American.</p>
   <p>This process is not peculiar to Ukrainians; it is a fundamental social law; it represents what happens to any nationality (not race, e.g. Japanese--for this introduces complicating factors of physical features, e.g. color) in the situation of the immigrant. To put it briefly: Assimilation is inevitable whether we like it or not; it cannot be stemmed though it may be delayed. And it is largely with the situation which delays it that I shall deal.</p>
   <p>To return to my original statement, then, if we are realists--if we look squarely at the fact in the situation, whether or not they please us or others--we shall have to admit that the Ukrainian cultural carryover in America, with its attendant institutions and organizations, though an essential, and in most ways a beneficial, process--is, at the same time, merely a transition-al one--one of temporary duration--unless, of course, immigration is renewed.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>It is, then, to this reality situation of the inevitability of assimilation that the second generation of Ukrainians in America those born here--have to orient themselves. This orientation has two sides: First, that which refers more particularly to the Ukrainian aspect; and, secondly, that which refers to the American Social Situation. The two are interlinked, but for purposes of exposition, I shall treat them arbitrarily as if they were distinct.</p>
   <p>But, let me say, that I treat of the problem as it confronts particularly the student, and, I am not thinking, except in certain individual cases, of those of the first generation. And by "student", I do not mean necesserily one who is at least a graduate of some university. Whoever has a live interest in life, whoever seeks knowledge, whoever attempts to unravel the so called "secrets" of the physical and the social world, is a student, a scholar in the true sense of the word. There is a world of difference between mere schooling and education; the fact that you are here is, I would say, in itself testimony that you are all students in the very best sense of the word-whether or not you may exhibit <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>diplomas and the like. So in a sense, what I say, refers to all those present here.</p>
   <p>Well, then, what is to be your attitude towards what I may term the "Ukrainian question"? This Ukrainian question is a sort of a double-edged sword; one with one face towards the Ukrainians in America, the other, referring to the lot of Ukrainians abroad. I shall deal with each of these aspects in order.</p>
   <p>How many times have you, as a student in high school or university had to listen to some grave person indict you somewhat as follows; "Why don't you speak Ukrainian more often or more fluently, and accurately? Why don't you develop yourself in written Ukrainian? Why don't you know more about Ukraine's culture, her glorious past, her achievements and disaster? Why don't you know more Ukrainian history, literature, art?...Why don't you tell the world you're Ukrainian, boast about it, and never miss an opportunity to emphasize your national ancecestry? Why don't you read more Ukrainian newspapers? Why don't you belong to a Ukrainian dramatic society? Choral group? literary club? Young people's club? Why don't you attend Ukrainian functions more often...</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Why, in the world, don't you 'stick' with Ukrainians,..and so on, and so on, the monologue continues; irrelevant examples from other nationalities are cited and sure enough the bewildered Ukrainian-American thinks he or she has committed the unpardonable sin, has been sort of snivelling knave, a renegade to some sort of a "sacred" ideal that should have been all but apotheosized!</p>
   <p>Now let us "dissect" this indictment against Ukrainian-Americans, particularly students, and see how much sound sense it contains. The policy, by implication, advocated therein, I shall call, the Isolationist Policy--for certainly, if followed literally, its effect would be to isolate Ukrainian-American from contact with other Americans, from those of a different national background than Ukrainian, from those, in fact, with whom we live--and with whom we should naturally associate at least as much as with Ukrainians. Now, remember, to be sure, I am all for us having a better command of Ukrainian; an acquaintance with several languages is certainly a mark of a scholar. Then, again, the fact that most of our parents are fluent in only their native language menas that we need to, and shall, pick up at least a working knowledge of Ukrainian....I am also all for us knowing more about the culture and tradition of our nationality--of <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>course, that too, is a mark of a scholar...I do, again, recognize that there is no necessity for being apologetic about our national ancestry. I do, further, recognize a moderate participation in Ukrainian Societies. After all, we belong to families--and, if for no other reason than that, we should participate in these organizations, for they are the only ones in which our parents, by and large, can participate; our partial participation in them tends, then, towards the stability of the family. I also recognize the superb and almost incalculable self-expression in such forms of art as music, folk-song, drama, dance, handicrafts, etc. I recognize their educative, their amusement and recreational values, and their function of preservation of the beauty--the resplendent tradition of Ukrainian folk culture...Oh yes, full well I realize how much poorer we would be, how much poorer America would be, without the preservation of those artistic forms of Ukrainian culture, which are not only a balm to the weary Ukrainian soul, but are a dessert (as it were) which has a universal appeal, which is not confined to Ukrainian tastes--which is, in a word, a universal language, so beautiful, and in many cases, incomparable, peerless! Oh yes--I thrill at the colorful Ukrainian costumes; at the melody and pathos of the song--the song which strikes a note in human hearts which, I dare say, no other national song can. Oh yes, the opportunities to recite, to act in dramas, to sing--which are afforded to Ukrainian- <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>American children by these Ukrainian societies-are of incalculable value to the children. They give them a means and a mode of self-expression, of artistic individual development. And again, full well, I realize the purely amusement and recreational value of some of those organizations. In our impersonalized city-life these societies provide a need which might, otherwise, find our young people on street corners, in taverns, with gangs---and what not. This much, then, I recognize--and more, as far as it pertains to those who are not strictly students.</p>
   <p>But, the indictment against us--which I have termed "the isolationist policy"--cannot be taken too seriously--to the letter. As far as the student is concerned, it is a matter of practicable policy. Here he is in America, born here, and here he shall live--and fare well or fare worse. The fundamental in controvertible fact simply is that if we are going to achieve those posts in the economic and social life of this country--those posts to which our abilities entitle us--we must, of necessity, identify ourselves with Americans. Does that necessitate any unusual rational policy? No--it means simply following the "natural" course. To the student, it means that his associations will have to be largely not exclusively, with those who share his interests; i. e. largely, with other students irrespective of their nationality. I said, to the student it is a matter of <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>practicable policy. And it is. If he were, for example, to take the isolationist seriously, he would be spending the time which he should spend at his studies (in order to excel), or at his special interests, or in social contact with students in his field--he would be spending this time, I say, in rehearsal for, and presentations of, Ukrainian plays, concerts, dances, studies, on committee and executive work, etc., etc. Time, after all, is limited; and two jobs cannot be done well at the same time. Attention to studies must come first-and this necessitates a mild boycott, perhaps temporary, of everything else. Secondly, we hear so much sheer undiluted "bunk" about the prejudice of Americans towards Ukrainians. I have looked for this all my life and I have not found it, except in the vaporings of unadjusted fanatics. True enough, there is a certain antipathy because of competition and strangeness; but remember, when the American knows us he regards us on our merits--without regard to our national ancestry. And it is up to us--by mixing--to get to know the American, and simultaneously, he will get to know us. In other words, a policy of contact--not isolation--is the one which will guarantee to us that place in the American social order to which our abilities entitle us. As far as the student is concerned, the policy of isolation can only relegate him to the lowest economic strata from which, by difficult degrees, our parents had to rise.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>Let me emphasize this point by a sketch example from Canada. There is one school of thought among Ukrainians there which is isolationist in the extreme. The group in control is interested, (as a matter of fact, for its own existence) in Ukrainian students living in the so-called Ukrainian Institutes. These institutes isolate the Ukrainian student almost completely from all but the most ephemeral kind of contacts with Canadians; and they indoctrinate the students with a vicious isolationist philosophy. The consequence is that the Ukrainian student, after he has been at the Institute anywhere from 1 to 8 years, he comes out an absolute stranger to Canadians. He is a species of "true" Ukrainian, I'll admit, but he is totally unfit to take his place among Canadians. Unaccepted there, he turns back to Ukrainians, becomes a virtual parasite, is embittered against Canadians, and finds it expedient to continue propagandizing the isolationist policy of the Institutes. And so the cycle of isolationism goes merrily on.</p>
   <p>Let us never forget that those who advocate, explicitly or implicitly, a literal following of the isolationist policy (which I briefly set forth a while ago in that monologue), are not personally disinterested. Some may advocate it because of a deep sentimental attachment to the old world--only natural in the immigrant.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>Others advocate it because they live off the organizations which they beg us to support and participate in. But whatever the motives are, the simple fact is, that they neither understand nor appreciate the problem of the Ukrainian--American. We have to take our choice between isolationism, and consequent relagation to bring hewers of wood and drawers of water for Americans; and, the policy of contact in the widest sense, and consequent successful economic and social adjustment. There are no other alternatives. Fanatic Ukrainians we may be--and remain a sort of a caste in this country; or, realists we may be--and take our place in American social structure after the fashion of our abilities. The choice is yours.</p>
   <p>Now--as to our orientation towards the problem of Ukrainian independence abroad. We hear, you know, under the guise of this, a lot of unadulterated non-sense, and it would take me beyond the scope of my address to detail this subject. The central facts, however, as they appear to us are simply these. History illuminates us sufficiently to make us feel absolutely certain that so long as the general world social organization is what it is, no sizeable cultural group such as that of the Ukrainians, can develop, can express itself as human in the fullest sense of the word, so long as it is under the domination of a state (or states) ruled <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>by a different nationality. In other words, the logic and the facts for Ukrainian independence for a Ukrainian state based on Ukrainian culture, we accept from the outset. Here is a mass of humanity, consisting of some forty five million souls who, under foreign subjection have been, and are still being, reduced to a condition worse than that of serfdom. I need not elaborate on this.</p>
   <p>On purely humanitarian grounds, then, I would, to the limit of my ability and circumstances, help in the struggle of this group for freedom. But we have an additional reason for being interested in the fate of these people: We are their descendants, our very fathers and mothers have experienced some of the bitter taste of servility to foreign masters. Their fate, then, is of very close personal emotional concern to us. If we do not help them, who else will, I would say then, that we should be interested in, and should be ardent supporters of, the struggle for Ukrainian independence abroad, and should contribute to it in our distinct ways--in whatever way we are best equipped to do so.</p>
   <p>But our attitude to the world Ukrainian situation cannot stop here--i. e. with the mere support of any or every organization or party which allegedly seeks this <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>independence of Ukraine. And here I am advocating nothing; I am merely asking you to study the so-called programs and policies of the varied Ukrainian organizations here which have a reference to the old world situation. And do not be "dupes,"--pardon the expression--do not swallow without masticating what you hear from the platform and in the press. Study the propaganda and the educational aspect of these organizations. Why this, Simply because, though these organizations have one thing in common--desire for Ukrainian independence, i. e. the desire for the establishment of Ukrainian state, they do differ, and at times radically, as to the means whereby this independence is to be achieved; and secondly of (sic) the social order which we are to have after having achieved independence. Now--remember--these two latter aspects of the situation are (as) important as the first; but it here where there is almost illimitable scope for divergent policies. Those at the helm of these organizations in America know this very well; They know that it is easy to unite Ukrainians on the question of the desire for Ukrainian independence, but they also know that it is not as easy to secure the undivided support of Ukrainians for a particular mode of achieving this independence, or for a particular social organization which we shall presumably have after we have established our state. And so--for their own success--some of these organizations "soft-pedal" these two aspects in their propaganda; the <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>consequence is that we are apt to get the notion that the only important aspect about the situation is whether or not we want Ukrainian independence....you should study this for yourself, because, as I have said, these organizations, despite their ignoring of these aspects in their propaganda, do have a fairly specific philosophy as to how the Ukrainian state is to be achieved, and what form it will take. And these matters are important! Granting the desire for Ukrainian independence, can we continue to hope and pray for some miracle to occur through the tangled nets of European diplomacy, or must we rely, first and foremost, on revolutionary techniques, I am not solving the question for you--I am merely posing it! And secondly, whichever method we adopt to support, the price our people will pay will be no small price--no mean sacrifice of lives, of property, and of culture. It is well to reflect, then, that what we do achieve will be worth the price--to phrase it crudely--for we might have merely an exchange of masters with no essentially significant change in individual human liberation. To put it concretely--without stateing my view--do we want the armageddon of fascism? Do we want half-baked parliamentary republicanism with capitalists as the boys chuckling behind their grim visage?, do we want some nonentity as a <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>monarch whose sole concern shall be to keep his crown, do we want some temblance of socialism, or do we want undiluted socialism? All these--and other, possibilities--are implicitly or explicitly, in the program of the parties which beckon our support. And all I say is, that the differences do matter--and you, as students, should acquaint yourselves with the facts, and not be ensnared into supporting something which in your senses you would never dream of supporting...so much for your orientation, as students, to the double-edged Ukrainian problem.</p>
   <p>Now, as to the more specifically American orientation. If you continue to be students, according to my definition, whether or not you are being "schooled," you will find--if you have not yet--that this is a very anomalous (if not "crazy") sort of a world. You will see our so-called democracy fanatically attached to so-called education; at the same time you will see each year thousands of graduates of high school and college discovering that not only a good part of the education which was supposed to enlighten them, has been absolutely "mum" --silent--on some of the greatest personal and social problems they shall have to face; but also that this "education", which was supposed to be a sort of an entree into this <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>job or that, leaves them facing blind alleys... you will see young people wrecked through inability to get a job, and consequently inability to get married, etc... you will see the country teeming with hoboes who can secure no attachment anywhere... you will see our divorce mills going full blast--and many families being that but in name (sic)...you will witness anticrime campaingns, antivice crusades, and temperance battles...you will see our rate of mental illnesses rising year by year; you may even brand this a neurotic nation...you will see all sort of "social agencies," annual "mobilizations for human needs." You will find sort of respectable men and women--largely financiers--supporting these social services--which, by the way, is fairly logical, since it is through their hold on our economic system that these very human problems are created...you will see--yes--witness strikes and walk--outs; "the big bosses" will not recognize the demands of labor; labor strikes, and the city or state suffers a hundredfold the difference of the wage dispute in question. You will see three quarters of our population in wretched misery, barely existing. You will witness the anomaly of a government drive for acreage reduction; you will see cotton plowed under or tomatoes dumped in the ocean because, they say, "there is no one to buy these things"--yet the <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>larger proportion of our population is without reasonable necessities of life. You will see, on the one side, million dollar heiresses cavorting with princes and counts, and on the other, you will see a poor mother with half a dozen children trying to live on six dollars a week. Honest, sincere attempts at partial reform will be met by "grass rooters" euphemistically sounding the death--knell of the fetish constitution. And if you look beyond the national horizon you will see every nation spending the major portion of its annual budget in preparation for carnal warfare...you will hear talk of free speech, free press--yet you will find that if you suggest honest critisism of anything in our order you will have real difficulty in finding a newspaper in the country which would publish it...you will continue to hear lip-service to ideals; love, justice, charity, brotherhood--all a mockery--for we pay but lip-service to these; doing but this, yet we delude ourselves that we have the reality of these ideals. And so on--and so on, one could go without end enumerating or "castigating" the social problems that beset us. The fact is that all is not well with this world. And try as we may, we cannot convince ourselves that these things are due to some visitation of divine wrath--although that may be the ultimate explanation--or to anything a magical nature. The social problems that beset us have a social origin;</p>
   <a name="p21" class="page-break">21</a>
   <p>They can be studied much as physical disease is studied, and are equally--on their level--"curable."</p>
   <p>Let me emphasize this point. The scientific method came to be applied seriously to the study of the physical phenomena of the universe some centuries ago. We had, as a consequence the evolution of the sciences of physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and their allies--and through these science and their application, various inventions were made, various "problems" of the physical universe were "settled"--as it were. But there is evidently no limit to man's ingenuity, to his ability to invent, and, at the same time, there appears to be no limit to the necessity for invention. For example, the biological sciences have unraveled the process of various diseases, but much yet remains in the field of the unknown. And so these scientists continue their investigations. As a partial consequence of the varied inventions made as a result of the finding of the physical sciences, the so-called "industrial revolution" was ushered in; it added to the social problems. But the outstanding fact is that scientific method in the physical realm has given us a tremendously wide control over physical nature. In the realm of human relations; i. e. society--the relations of humans to one another--we are still largely helpless. We witness delinquency, marital discord, crime, mental illnesses, poverty in the midst of plenty, periodic depressions, and all the catastrophic <a name="p22" class="page-break">22</a>effects associated with these, we witness human slaughter on a world-wide scale--and we seem to be able to do little about all these social plagues of humanity. Now, if we are ever to secure the control in the social realm which we have been able to secure in the physical realm we must study society as we study germs, atoms, molecules, friction, light, mechanics, etc. This is admitted; I need not re-emphasize it. But there has been a long lag in the scientific study of society; until about the end of the last century men, sat in cosy armchair and philosophized about society. This has changed in a revolutionary manner. Students of society today no longer build beautiful deductive systems about society; they have applied the inductive method of the physical science to its study. And the results so far have been as encouraging as can be expected. Science works by slow degrees; but already the social scientists have a good deal of authoritative scientific formulations some light on our economic problems, on problems of personality, on our political organization, etc. And this is one of the paths we must follow if we are not to be engulfed by the armageddon of revolution or obliteration by war--if we are to forstall the annual toll of human wreckage which an archaic system takes today.</p>
   <p>You as students, then cannot put much stock in the vaporing of politicians; most of <a name="p23" class="page-break">23</a>them are--if I may use an anology--"hired donkeys" who must bray and act as their master--usually the industrialist who contributes to their campaign funds--bids them. They are no more free--though they may think otherwise--than is the bird in a cage. And so their platitudes about the constitution, about liberty, individualism, etc., are but a smoke screen to hide the facts. And you must get at the facts, not assume that they can be "manufactured" for you, and served on a silver platter, as it were, by those who are supposed to be our political leaders. In a word--study society, in an unbiassed manner; if you have academic ambition, I might suggest that you turn to the field of social sciences for that is where the greatest discoveries are yet to be made, where the greatest contribution is possible. Understand the society you live in. Let the varied problems that beset us, which cannot escape your eyes, and which often have a personal reference to you yourselves. Let them be to you a stimulus to study. For it is only by understanding the society in which you live, that you can become intelligent co-operators in its reconstruction. You have the advantage of some schooling, of some leisure--you can, therefore, study; the unskilled laborer whose life centers around the factory must need look to you for guidance; whether you will it or not, yours is the leadership role; whether you lead well or ill depends on how true you are to the ideal of the student.</p>
   <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>
   <p>Hold that banner high--for it is indispensable for a peaceful progressive adjustment of various social forms to the fundamental technological and economic changes which occur from time to time. An apathetic, lackadaisical attitude will only find you swept unknowingly into the maelstrom of worse ills than those besetting the American society today.</p>
