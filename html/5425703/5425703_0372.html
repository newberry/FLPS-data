   <p>A Ukrainian druggist Mr. Michael Shvets, who has influence in the sport's world, decided to present wrestling matches every other week at the Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street Hall. The best local wrestlers will take part.</p>
   <p>The net proceeds of the first match, which will take place about March 7 or 8, next year, between Captain George Zapisetsky and Mr. Stanley Sbyshko, will go to both the St. Nicholas Church and the Siege Organization.</p>
   <p>Of all the following matches half of the proceeds, as assigned by Mr. Shvets, will be designated for the above purposes but with one reservation, namely, that both the parish and the Siege Organization have control over the ticket box and the necessary expenses, lest later there be any criticism and possibility of having more expenses than income.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is Mr. Michael Shvets's wish and desire that the Chief Executive Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky representing the Siege Organization, and another delegate representing the parish be present at every meeting before each wrestling match is to take place.</p>
