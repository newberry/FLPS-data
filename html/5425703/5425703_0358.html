   <p>On May 25, our women called a private meeting for the purpose of sending a telegram to President Woodrow Wilson protesting against ceding Ukrainian land to Poland.</p>
   <p>Miss Barbara Kurey was elected chairman of this meeting, and Mrs. T. Moruschak secretary. The chairman asked Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich to outline the present situation in Europe.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich's speech was published in the American press. Among other things he said that the Ukrainian cause is to be determined in the near future by the Peace Conference. The speaker had received a cablegram from the members of the Ukrainian delegation in Paris, requesting that as many protests as possible be sent at once to President Wilson and Colonel House, American peace delegates, against uniting the smallest part of the Ukrainian territories <span class="page-break">2</span>to any other State.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vladimir Siemenovich outlined how the Poles, French, Czecho-Slovaks, Roumanians with might and main insist that the Ukrainian territories be scattered and divided. The Poles claim all of Galicia, a large part of Volynia, all of Holmschyna, Pidlyashe, and Policye. The Roumanians claim the Ukrainian parts, namely, Bukuvinia and Bessarabia.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, the Bureau of Information in Washington published a new map of Europe on the basis of the boundaries mapped out by the Peace Conference. Ukrainia is not mentioned on this map at all. The Ukrainian territories are added to Poland, Russia, and Roumania. At this critical moment, the speaker called upon all Ukrainians in America to protest to the delegates in Paris against this perpetrated harm to our nation. To answer the call of the President and America, the Ukrainian women willingly sent their husbands and sons to join the ranks of the American Army; to shed their <span class="page-break">3</span>blood, to even give their lives for the American ideals and its freedom and independence; for the rebirth of all the powerless, subjected nations, and thereby for the rebirth and liberty of Ukrainia. The women should mention this in their telegram to President Wilson. In conclusion, the speaker wrote out and read the resolutions, which were unanimously adopted by the group. The chairman then appealed for contributions for the telegram to Paris. The sum of $27.70 was readily collected.</p>
   <p>The telegram sent to President Wilson read as follows:</p>
   <p>"To President Woodrow Wilson: "The 'Ukrainian Women's Alliance of America', place in your hands their urgent protest against ceding any of the Ukrainian territories to any other state.</p>
   <p>"In answer to the call of America, we, women of Ukrainian descent, willingly sent our husbands and sons to join the ranks of the American Army; to shed <span class="page-break">4</span>their blood, and to even give their lives for the American ideals and its freedom and independence; for the rebirth of all the powerless, subjected nations and, consequently, for the rebirth and liberty of Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>"We are most grateful for all you have done for the Ukrainian cause. We trust that you will not allow forty million Ukrainians to be ceded and subjected to other States.</p>
   <p>"For the Ukrainian Women's Alliance:</p>
   <p>Stephania Tzumbalist, president; M. Pidhayna, secretary; Barbara Kurey, chairman of the meeting; T. Maruschak, secretary of the meeting."</p>
   <p>We wish to add that by the example set by these women the following fraternities will also send their protests to President Wilson:</p>
   <p>The Society of Michael Hrushewsky, Branch #6, together with the Society <span class="page-break">5</span>of Ivan Franko, Branch #4.</p>
   <p>The Brotherhood of St. Demetrius, and the Dramatic and Singing Club.</p>
   <p>"Banduryst."</p>
