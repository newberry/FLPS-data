   <p>The annual meeting of Siege Branch No. 15 took place on July 15.</p>
   <p>There has never been a more harmoniously conducted meeting in the history of the Chicago Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>After singing the national anthem the meeting was opened by captain S. Boniakivsky. Then followed the roll call, acceptance of new members and collecting the monthly dues. An account of the last picnic which was very successful, was read. The proceeds from this amounted to $265.78.</p>
   <p>Upon the motion of R. Boyko, the meeting granted fifty dollars for orphans in the old country. They also decided to buy a number of badges from Mr. Boyko for company use.</p>
   
   <p>Luke Stachursky was elected chairman to conduct this meeting. The former Captain S. Boniakivsky thanked the company for their vote of confidence and took a seat among the other members. The temporary chairman selected Mr. Petriw and A. Dzivakovsky to act as secretaries of the meeting.</p>
   <p>The captain mentioned above was the first one to be called on to give account of his work. Due to the fact that he held the position for a comparatively short time, the report of his activities was very brief. The second lieutenant stated that he should have done more, but for one reason or other, he did not work very hard.</p>
   <p>From the reading of minutes and accounts it was learned that the company has $538.20 in its treasury and it has 110 members.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary announced that his accounts coincide with the accounts of the cashier Mr. Murin.</p>
   <p>Yet, it showed that some of the officers were quite negligent in performing the duties they took upon themselves a year ago.</p>
   <p>Michael Soltys, librarian, gave one of the best accounts with reference to his post. Mr. Soltys told the meeting that the Chicago Public Library has decided to contribute 150 volumes to the Siege Library. This was in a great measure due to the steady, systematic work of Mr. Soltys.</p>
   <p>The chairman asked all members present to stand up to show their appreciation of the work of the former officers.</p>
   <p>Immediately, the election of the new members followed. The results of the election were as follows:</p>
   
   <p>M. Ostsislavsky, capitan; E. Michalsky, second-lieutenant; S. Muryn, financial secretary; M. Dzyganovsky, recording secretary; N. Tymush, cashier; P. Demchyna and Mr. Matseleyko, under officers; L. Stachursky, M. Hussir, Mr. Goralchuk, and J. Yavorsky, first-lieutenants; Max Fedinsky, bugler; Mr. Vishniovsky, guard; Michael Soltys, librarian; N. Hul and Mr. Petriw, comptrollers.</p>
   <p>After the election of the officers, upon motions that were seconded, the meeting made the following decisions:</p>
   <p>1) Every member should do everything in his power to attend the Siege drills every Saturday.</p>
   <p>2) The present captain of this company should assist the company in Gary, to get on its feet, i.e., to better itself in all respects.</p>
   
   <p>3) Ten Siege members should be detailed as helpers on the day of a district picnic.</p>
   <p>4) Our company should take charge of the dance number on the program at the Exposition of Progress.</p>
   <p>5) The company assigned twenty-five dollars for the press fund.</p>
   <p>At this time they collected $15.50 to pay the fee of the ballet master who rehearsed the Chicago Ukrainian dancers, so that the Ukrainians could show before other nationalities the full splendor of our national dances.</p>
   <p>The newly elected officers were then sworn in, as well as two new members who were formerly accepted. Finally, the chief executive, Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky adjourned the meeting with a few sincere, ardent words, and gave out a new password to those present.</p>
   <p>A. Dzivakovsky.</p>
