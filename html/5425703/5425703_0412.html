   <p>Ukrainians from every nook of America write articles to newspapers telling the world about their local activities, relations with their homeland, etc. In short, everyday we are learning about some of their worthwhile activities from many parts of this country.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, as elsewhere, our people are also earnest workers in many branches of various activities, including national. Yet, curious enough, the newspapers do not mention anything about Chicago at all. In view of this fact, I was determined to write something about the Ukrainian concert <span class="page-break">\2</span>which took place in Chicago, wherein the local Siege was host to the famous Ukrainian Choirs; therefore, in a measure the Chicago Ukrainians directly and indirectly contributed to the entertainment of different nationalities of Chicago, who were present at the concert. Here everybody had an opportunity to enjoy the real beauty of Ukrainian melodies and dances.</p>
   <p>Chicago, both this year and last year, presented a small exhibition, Pageant of Progress Exposition. Of course, at this exposition practically all nationalities and all kinds of products were represented. The exposition this year was quite favorable to the Ukrainians, and the Chicago Ukrainians were certain to take advantage of it.</p>
   <p>The exposition opened on July 29, with a grand pageant of numerous musical bands and demonstrations of all sorts of products. Our Chicago Siege band, <span class="page-break">\3</span>composed of forty players, with its conductor John Barabash, was one of those numerous bands. "Ukrainian Band," both in Ukrainian and English, was inscribed on its large drum. They made such a good appearance, that they surely must have attracted the attention of the crowd of a million people standing packed on both sides of the streets, because as our band passed there were ceaseless ovations and cheers from the crowd. This was one of the first grand and successful appearances of our Siege Band which will have a lasting impression on a million inhabitants of Chicago. This was an appearance which informed the American public that there are Ukrainians living in Chicago. In a great measure we have John Barabash, our young Siege Band conductor to thank for all this.</p>
   <p>The exposition, as mentioned above began on July 29, and was to end August 13. The Ukrainians were invited to give their concert on the last day. No one ever dreamed of such an opportunity. One week had already passed and <span class="page-break">\4</span>no one knew anything about it; naturally, no one was interested any further, to any considerable extent, with the exposition. But as the second week commenced, the incredible good news was received from the Exposition Committee that the Chicago Ukrainians had been selected to give the Grand Finale Concert on the last day of the Exposition.</p>
   <p>Within a few hours the Ukrainian Concert Committee got together, discussed the matter, and decided on concert numbers.</p>
   <p>The leading members of this Committee were the following: John Barabash, conductor of the Ukrainian Siege Band; Rev. Wasyl Stetsiuk, conductor of the Siege male choir; Professor T. Choptiak, conductor of the Lysenko choir; R. I. Smook; and Mr. Aschenko, instructor of the Unrainian national dances.</p>
   <p>From that time on the tireless work began. Both choirs rehearsed most <span class="page-break">\5</span>diligently, and the girls also wanted to profit by the opportunity so they were glad to learn Ukrainian group dances. All rehearsals and preparations for the concert took place at the Church Hall, at Oakley and Rice St. The culminating point of all those rehearsals of the band, choirs, etc., was reached on the day of the concert.</p>
   <p>The concert was announced in all the American newspapers in Chicago. And curious enough, the Poles were very much surprised. They wondered why the Ukrainians were chosen, and most likely they sent their spies to the concert.</p>
   <p>Critics, reporters of foreign newspapers, as well as many Ukrainians were present at the concert.</p>
   <p>William Hale Thompson, Mayor of Chicago, and one of the members of the <span class="page-break">\6</span>Exposition Committee, because of the lack of seats in the hall were obliged to listen to the concert over the radio.</p>
   <p>Now I wish to lay aside the description of the audience and the concert hall, and will start first, so to speak, with a slight criticism of the musical numbers.</p>
   <p>The first number was the overture "Lustspiel" by Keller Bello. The parting of the curtain disclosed a beautiful tableau of a Ukrainian Siege band wearing blue uniforms.</p>
   <p>R. Smook, the prompter, introduced the Ukrainian Band and its conductor John Barabash, and announced the first number of the program. They were given a real welcome by a lengthy ovation.</p>
   <p>As the conductor raised his baton such silence prevailed that the drop of a pin could have been heard. The beautiful "Lustspiel" was played with <span class="page-break">\7</span>minute precision.</p>
   <p>Everyone, who has ever heard the piece and understands music, discovered that the men in the Ukrainian Band, not only play skillfully, but also with their whole hearts and souls.</p>
   <p>The second part of the first number was the serenade "The Cupid Charms." The third part, "Collection of Ukrainian Melodies," by John Barabash, was excellently played by the band.</p>
   <p>The second number was a song, the "Bandoora," by H. Davidovsky. Another beautiful tableau was then presented, composed of members of M. Lyssenko's mixed choir.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Then followed the choir of T. Choptiak. Both choirs had to sing encores. Miss Mary Vinyarsky deserves honorable mention because of her very charming soprano voice.</p>
   <p>Third number: "Wedding of the Winds," music by J. T. Hall. Also "Ukrainian Bazaar Songs," by John Barabash.</p>
   <p>After a short intermission the Ukrainian Band appeared again. The audience was so pleased with the band that it seemed that it could not want anything better, yet this band is comprised mostly of persons from the laboring class.</p>
   <p>In the last part of the third number the Ukrainian Band played Ukrainian compositions exclusively. This deviation from American music was a real treat to the audience. The band was called back over and over; the enthusiastic audience hardly knew when to stop its ovations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>The fourth number: "Vetchernitsi" (Evening Entertainment), music by R. T. Nischinsky. The very appearance of the self-confident M. Lyssenko's mixed choir was a certain guarantee that this number would be a success. This it was, although in minor details there was still room for improvement. But if the fact that the choirs also consist of the working class is taken into consideration, then one is bound to marvel at how it was possible for these amateurs to render their numbers as well as they did.</p>
   <p>Another attraction was the young ladies in Ukrainian national costumes. Several of the girls were so immaculately dressed that they looked like a real tableau. Miss Olga Motsio was one of them. It looked as if those girls had come from Ukrainia to entertain the audience here, and to show American women how beautifully they dress in Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>The fifth number: Mr. and Mrs. Aschenko presented a short dialogue and <span class="page-break">\10</span>excerpts from songs. It was not bad, but it seems that it would have been much better if it had been omitted entirely.</p>
   <p>The sixth number: The popular song "Palley," musical master-piece of T. Vorobkevich. When the curtain was drawn, the public witnessed a slightly different treat, a male choir. This was a Siege choir and its conductor Rev. Wasyl Stetsiuk, a sincere, zealous hard worker. The choir, under his direction was being swayed with the rapidity of lightning, yet so smoothly and so harmoniously. The American public has never seen a better choir, a choir so well-disciplined and with such seriousness in their hearts for the work at hand. This number, of all the choir numbers, was the most successful. This choir was a living testimonial of the hard work of Rev. W. Stetsiuk. All we have to say, with reference to this Siege male choir, is to hope that they will continue to attend their rehearsals in the future under their very able conductor Rev. W. Stetsiuk.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>The seventh number: Solo and group dances were preceded by a song by a group of girls. The dances were another covetous treat for the audience. Boys and girls poured on the stage from the right and left sides formed couples, ranks, and files. With very skillful musicians the ballets came out exceptionally well.</p>
   <p>The group was followed by solo dances. This was something positively new for the audience. The following took part in it: Mr. Aschenko, instructor and manager of the dancing of the program; Stephen Musiychuk, true cossack and sincere worker in the Siege Organization; M. Tokarevich; D. Zabolotsky; Luke Stachursky. They all performed their parts very well, yet Mr. Aschenko, as could be expected, superseded them all. He is a superb ballet master and acrobatic dancer, and naturally, he would be master of the situation.</p>
   <p>Of all the girls who danced exceptionally well, several of them deserve <span class="page-break">\12</span>special press attention. Among those were the following: A. Voos, O. Motsio, Mrs. M. Musiychuk, Catherine Kosovich, Mary Vinyarsky, S. Koptynsky, and Kryvetsky.</p>
   <p>The eighth number: The overture "Superbe," by Dalbey, was played by the band as well as their preceding pieces.</p>
   <p>For the grand finale the Ukrainian Band played the American and Ukrainian national anthems.</p>
   <p>We are sure that this concert will never be forgotten by the American audience and still more so by the Ukrainians who were present.</p>
   <p>Two days have passed since the grand fete, after which, very desirable results have followed. The secretary of the Exposition sent an official letter to our Ukrainian Concert Committee in which, among other things, <span class="page-break">\13</span>he stated that the Concert given by the Ukrainians was the most sensational event of the whole Exposition. The letter was signed by Mayor William Hale Thompson and his secretary.</p>
   <p>The day after this letter was received, special delegates sent by the Exposition executives, came to the Ukrainian Concert Committee and asked them to repeat the concert once more. However, they declined the offer due to some important reason that intervened.</p>
   <p>It seems that it is useless to comment any further on the fact that the Chicago Ukrainians did more by that one concert, than they could by many protests against their political enemies.</p>
   <p>And now, for the grand success of this concert, we should give thanks to John Barbabash, conductor of the Ukrainian Band, and to the chairman of the Ukrainian Concert Committee.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>Our next obligation is to Rev. Wasyl Stetsiuk, Prof. T. Choptiak, and ballet master Aschenko and his wife. They all co-operated very well.</p>
   <p>We should also thank the subordinates who answered the call of their conductors with such enthusiasm. Thanks for their sincerely impersonal interest in the concert's success.</p>
   <p>Would to God that we continue to be as successful in the future.</p>
   <p>Andreyko.</p>
