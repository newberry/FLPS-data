   <p>Sunday, Nov. 16, the Ukrainians in Chicago and vicinity had an unusual honor, to welcome among themselves the representatives of the Ukrainian National Republic, namely, Julian Bachynsky, head of the Ukrainian extraordinary diplomatic mission to the United States, and Mr. Kozakivich, his secretary.</p>
   <p>The greeting of the dear guests took place in the national hall at Oakley Blvd. and Rice St., during the extraordinary meeting of the Ukrainian delegates of all the Ukrainian societies in Chicago and vicinity, witnessed by an audience of several hundred people.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vladimir Siminovich was chairman of the meeting; M. Ftomin and H. Kisil were secretaries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>At 2 P. M. Dr. Julian Bachynsky and his secretary, Mr. Kozakivich, appeared at the meeting, being welcomed by a thundering ovation of those present.</p>
   <p>In the name of the meeting and the whole Ukrainian colony in the city of Chicago and vicinity, Dr. Siminovich cordially greeted the legation of the Ukrainian Republic. To this Dr. Bachynsky answered with a speech to the meeting that was actually flowing from the heart.</p>
   <p>Having explained to the meeting that the main object of the arrival of Ukrainian diplomatic mission to America was to gain recognition of the Ukrainian Independent Republic by the United States Government, Dr. Bachynsky pointed out the manner and the way whereby the Ukrainian immigration in the United States has the possibility and the duty to help the Ukrainian state mission to attain their main object.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"The Ukrainian immigration in America," said Dr. Bachynsky, "is almost in its entirety of a working class character, which is a deciding factor in its organizations, struggling for a decent living wages. This characteristic of our immigrants in America, once farmers and laborers in the old country, who are earning their daily bread with their hands, is the reason why the Ukrainian immigration on this side of the ocean with such enthusiasm greeted the Ukrainian National Republic in the Ukrainian native land; an independent state of the Ukrainian farmers and laborers in particular.</p>
   <p>"This almost uniform characteristic of the Ukrainian immigration in America shows that all its groups are in their very essence alike, not antagonistic, and as such should go in one direction, especially in the affairs wherein the welfare and the future of the Ukrainian nation, of the Ukrainian democratic state and its independence is concerned. The leaders of the several independent groups ought to bear this well in mind.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"The Ukrainian State mission," continued Dr. Bachynsky, "does not meddle nor does it intend to interfere with the interior affairs of each group among the Ukrainian immigration.</p>
   <p>"The mission treats all the groups alike as individuals working for the general welfare of the Ukrainian cause, and suggests only, and wishes from its very heart that the scale of activity of every group be raised to the utmost of its capacity in order to help the native nation and land to realize its wishes, sincerity and zeal, with which the Ukrainian immigrant is enthused for the common cause of ours.</p>
   <p>"As in Ukrainia, all the loyal sons of hers, regardless of their political tendency, joined one common front to defend and safeguard the liberty and freedom of Ukrainia, so also it is the duty of the Ukrainian immigration on this side of the ocean, unanimously to stand together and with its power second the motion and thus support our brothers in the native land.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"Contention and ambition of the individual groups can find its expression only in the field of zealous activity for the good of the nation."</p>
   <p>Further, the speaker suggested the ways by which the beyond-the-sea immigration can assist Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>In the first place this is a matter of a political activity and propaganda of the Ukrainian immigrants in favor of the independence of the Ukrainian National Republic.</p>
   <p>Starting with shops and factories where the Ukrainian workingman meets the Americans, and going up to the highest legislative and executive bodies of the American Federal institutions, the Ukrainian immigrants have the opportunity of carrying on a propaganda in favor of our most justified Ukrainian cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The American citizens, the American public opinion, the decisive American legislative, and other official bodies must be informed in every possible way by the Ukrainian immigration in America about the just struggle of the Ukrainian nation for its freedom and state independence, and thus help the free and independent Ukrainia to earn the approval and acknowledgment of the greatest republic in the world, the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Every judicious activity on the part of the Ukrainian immigration aimed in that direction will aid our endeavor considerably.</p>
   <p>This work of the Ukrainian immigration in America, in many instances, already has taken up in that direction an organized form of activity with the assistance of the Ukrainian press and the information bureaus.</p>
   <p>It is understood, however, that the activity of the official Ukrainian mission in the United States has entirely to travel by independent roads.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The second great duty of our beyond-the-sea immigration is to help materially the pillaged and destroyed native country during the World War, and especially that part of the country which suffered the most, namely, Eastern Galicia.</p>
   <p>In this field this immigration can and ought to help very much the native country.</p>
   <p>Contributions and the sending out to the old country of suits of clothes, linen, shoes, and other materials, and funds by the Ukrainian immigrants in America will alleviate the horrible misery among the relatives in our native country.</p>
   <p>The whole Ukrainian (Eastern) Galicia groans not only from starvation and cold, but also from the dreadful epidemic diseases.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>For the money collected in America it will be possible to organize medical help and hospital assistance; to buy medicine for the sick and bread for the hungry.</p>
   <p>A material help on the part of the beyond-the-sea emigration to the native land is at the present time of the most vital importance.</p>
   <p>Therefore, with greatest joy the speaker did welcome the thought of establishing a Ukrainian Relief Committee among the immigrants of ours to help the native land. This had been proposed already and unanimously decided upon by the delegates of all the Ukrainian organizations in America that met in New York to make this a reality as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The aim of the activity of the Ukrainian Relief Committee is of an immense importance and of common interest to all the Ukrainian immigrants. Therefore, the proposed work of the Committee ought to reconcile to themselves <span class="page-break">9</span>the Ukrainian totality both in the United States and Canada. Only with united energy and effort of all the United States citizens of Ukrainian descent, who are the only source of help for our suffering brothers, the old country can receive such material help as is necessary at the present extraordinary critical moment to eliminate the heretofore unheard of suffering as much as possible.</p>
   <p>The third point of Dr. Bachysky's speech was about preparing the emigrants to serve the native country as useful Ukrainian citizens in the event they go back there.</p>
   <p>Many emigrants in America and Canada with time will return to the native land. Ukrainia entertains high hopes of her sons living abroad. Ukrainia will welcome them with sincere, open arms as experienced and well prepared builders of the new Ukrainian Republic and of the independent Ukranian national life.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>The sons of Ukrainia, who because of the long period of war, though many of them wounded, in great sufferings and scarcity, lifted up the risen Ukrainia and defended her freedom and independence, but they are too much exhausted to undertake the creative and reconstructive work by themselves. They need our help, our fresh unused energy. This supply of new energy will come from our beyond-the-sea emigration.</p>
   <p>For the Ukrainian emigrants abroad, in the first place the youth, awaits a great task in the independent Ukrainia. They are to continue the life in freedom through channels of creative work.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Ukrainian youth abroad, of both sexes, ought to prepare itself here accordingly for that one great task.</p>
   <p>Should they return to Ukrainia, they ought to be armed with sincerity, enlightenment, and stand as fearless defenders of the Ukrainian liberty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">11</span>
   <p>They ought to return with the greatest possible resources of human skill and professional knowledge.</p>
   <p>Thus, in the old country, they will become leaders and teachers of their brothers, who lived all their lives in their native land, in those things which they had a chance to learn in the wide world.</p>
   <p>Therefore, an organization of the Ukrainian youth among the beyond-the-sea emigration, whose concrete object is love of and attachment to the independent Ukrainia, to work for intellectual uplifting and professional learning of the members, is exactly the best sign that the Ukrainian immigrants of the United States and Canada understand well their future duty toward their own nation and their native land.</p>
   <p>The speaker sincerely welcomes the Siege brotherhood in the United States <span class="page-break">12</span>who inscribed on its banner an uplifting, yet true, slogan "in union and learning lies the strength of the nation."</p>
   <p>Under this slogan the sons of Ukrainia are shedding their blood for the freedom of Ukrainia. Under this slogan the Siege brothers from beyond-the-sea in an opportune time, will stand shoulder to shoulder to active work for common good.</p>
   <p>A storm of a long-lasting ovation was the reward of the envoy, Julian Bachynsky, for his speech.</p>
   <p>With the speech of Dr. Bachynsky ended the official appearance of the Ukrainian mission before the Ukrainian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Then followed a discussion of the delegates of the associations in the presence of the envoys of the mission.</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>The following took part in the discussions: H. Kysil, Novodvorsky, Dr. Siminovich, Moranets, Kryvovyaz, Rev. N. Strutynsky, Didyk, Boychuk, Dr. Hrynevetsky.</p>
   <p>The discussion was carried mainly on the ways of organizing a speedy material help to the native country.</p>
   <p>As a consequence the meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding of all the central organizations, whose delegates took part in the common conference in New York, under the leadership of the head of the Ukrainian diplomatic mission, to introduce and establish as soon as possible a Relief Committee for the purpose of helping the native country on the basis that had been decided upon by the delegates of the Ukrainian organizations at the New York conference.</p>
   <span class="page-break">14</span>
   <p>It was delegated also to the Ukrainian Red Cross in Chicago, as a local branch of the future Relief Committee, to start out its activity in Chicago and vicinity as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The treasurer of the Chicago Committee is Dr. Siminovich who, simultaneously with the activity in Chicago and vicinity, undertook to organize another Relief Committee in Canada, where he is invited by the Canadian Ukrainian organizations and will leave for Canada in the nearest future.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the meeting they started the relief collection, which will be carried out systematically within all the societies, and at every opportune time till the end of the relief collection campaign.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bachynsky, the envoy, made a good start by contributing $100 to the relief fund.</p>
   <span class="page-break">15</span>
   <p>The collection among the Oakley group was postponed till the next Sunday, due to the fact that the meeting was coming to a close.</p>
   <p>To begin with $340.30 was collected on the very first day.</p>
   <p>Dr. V. Siminovich, in the name of all the Ukrainians present, thanked the envoys of the Ukrainian mission for their coming to Chicago. The meeting ended with the national anthem, "Already Ukrainia has risen."</p>
