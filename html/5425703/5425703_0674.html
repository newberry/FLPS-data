   <p>Young Ukraine is preparing a special Mother's Day concert for May 13. This organization is very active, and is taking over the social and national work which, up to this time, has been done by the older generation. Its members are already presenting Ukrainian dramas without help from the older folk. This year they also honored our greatest poet, Taras Shevchenko, on the one hundred and twentieth anniversary of his birth. Now they are preparing to pay tribute to the Ukrainian mother. We would not be one bit surprised if they on their own initiative were to pay due tribute to the Ukrainian war heroes on November 1. [Editor's note: Ukrainia declared its independence on November 1, 1917.]</p>
   <p>The concert on May 13 will be very well chosen, and will be worth hearing and seeing. Young Ukraine, their local. Chicago youth weekly, is doing well; its second issue, which was out yesterday, is better, finer, and spicier than the first issue. It is certainly worth the two cents it costs.</p>
