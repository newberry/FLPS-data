   <p>On August 23 of this year, the Chicago Daily Tribune sponsored a singing contest in which the Ukrainian Chorus under the leadership of Mr. George Benetsky took part. None of the singers nor the leader ever dreamed of winning first prize with their chorus which has a mere thirty-two members.</p>
   <p>We will describe the sequence of the whole contest and all the other points of this unforgettable moment in some future issue. Today, we only want to give our readers the news about the unheard-of influence and wide-spread fame of our name not only in Chicago and the state of Illinois, but in the whole United States as well. The writer of this note was in Marinette, Wisconsin, where on Sunday, two days after the contest, the only subject of conversation was the victory of Ukrainian music over American music.</p>
