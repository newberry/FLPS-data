   <p>Attention of Chief Executive Dr. S. K. Hrynevetsky in Chicago</p>
   <p>Dear Doctor:</p>
   <p>In your letter of August 8, we learn that a Siege Organization was established in the United States, and you have inquired of us as to the necessity of it and its ultimate end. I think that every Ukrainian, myself included, sympathizes with the fate of our people who are fighting for their independence, and therefore, jointly with the Ukrainian nation. I can give you just this one answer that we accept with sincerest joy, the good tidings of your having established this organization. It is not only remarkable from the national point of view that our people still continue to cultivate the Siege ideals for an independence of Ukrainia, but also that they are ready to give up their lives to fight for it to the finish. It is our duty to see to <span class="page-break">2</span>it that each and everyone of us belongs to this organization, especially at this moment when our brothers and sisters across the ocean are suffering so bitterly under the yoke of the enemy. It is in the interest of our fight for independence that one and all should join the organization.</p>
   <p>This organization, more than any other, can awaken and strengthen our hopes; arouse in us national sentiment, power, and right and thereby help our motherland. Through such an organization as Siege, we become invincible in fighting for what belongs to Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>Then only will the world notice that winning independence truly requires the whole nation, and practically everybody should be soldiers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Then will the world see our strength, our discipline, and order.</p>
   <p>Only with an organization of Ukrainians, both in the native land and abroad, can our capable nation lead itself to a better destiny without any outside foreign interference which our people should never suffer.</p>
   <p>Only then our voice will not be lost in the desert; only then even our enemies will respect us.</p>
   <p>Only then our nation will be able to conquer everything, whatever the will of a powerful, well-organized, great nation wants. The nation can win its freedom and independence only then, when every individual will answer the call to join the Siege organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>No nation has ever won its freedom merely with diplomats and the endeavors of a scanty group of politicians, without the simultaneously determined support of the whole nation.</p>
   <p>The Ukrainian nation in Eastern Galicia understood it, and therefore, thanks to its already established organizations now has a chance to give much proof that they do not want and will not allow themselves, for any length of time, to suffer under a foreign yoke.</p>
   <p>But even in the United States the organization is not carried out to its utmost by the very fact that it does not include the whole group of our people so that there would not be a single Ukrainian left outside the organization. This present occupation of the <span class="page-break">5</span>Western part of Ukrainia by Poland, causes impediments and even impossibilities in the direction of freedom, to continue the work in that part of the country. All the more that the organizations of our people in America, country of freedom in which our brother emigrants can do so much, since they have greater freedom to organize than they ever had in Galicia while under Austria. The Siege Organization in the United States, strong as it is, is as yet in its very inception. The consolation, however, is that it is growing stronger and stronger. In it, I notice people who work with considerable sacrifice, great political understanding and their main ideal is to work for the complete success of the organization. They understand its vehement value and therefore are trying to put it into practice. For now, during this intensely opportune time <span class="page-break">6</span>such an organization when well organized may render a great help to the native land. The country needs your help, and the most significant help will be given only then, when it comes from the collective will of the whole emigration; this is possible and most effective only through the means of such an organization as this.</p>
   <p>Irishmen, Germans and Czechs, etc., had such organizations among them a long time ago. With the exception of the Ukrainian insurance companies, we, up to the present time, do not have a single organization which would include all the political parties and faiths under one slogan: For the freedom of the Ukrainian nation.</p>
   <p>It is useless to mention what an important part, in fighting for the freedom of their nation, and in the building of their State, the Czech <span class="page-break">7</span>Eagles played and are still playing in political life.</p>
   <p>We could have done better in the past. We should have been as alert as they were. Yet, it is never too late to mend, and it should be mended as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Therefore, I accept this news with joy that an organization already exists which stands above the political parties, in the form of The Ukrainian Siege Organization in the United States.</p>
   <p>This will uplift in spirit and give further inspiration and strength to the fighters for freedom in the native land, when they can see that behind them stands another skirmish line of fighters.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>I am convinced that all the Ukrainians in America of both sexes will understand the Siege Organization as a national necessity and will take it as one of their first duties to become one of its members as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>Congratulations to you initiators. To you, highly esteemed doctor, who has done so much and is still continuing to do everything in your power for the organization, thereby doing your full share to help the Ukrainian nation in its hard struggle for liberation from the yoke of slavery, to you especially goes true and sincere thanks and congratulations for all your special efforts in this direction.</p>
   <p>Vienna, Oct. 28, 1922</p>
   <p>Dr. Eugene Petrushevich, President of Western Ukrainia.</p>
