   <p>Vienna, Austria, December 24, 1920. Greetings: I have just received a copy of Sichovi Visty of August last, wherein I notice that during the meeting of June 27, the Sitch members of Chicago praised me and my work very highly by standing up and singing the song, "What Kind of Wind", in my honor. Many thanks to P. Novodvorsky, Chicago district colonel, and Stephen Musiychuk, district secretary, for their initiative in the matter.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately this news did not reach me until half a year later, but it has moved me greatly. I have worked for our cause all my life, and especially during the World War, yet how much have I suffered even from my own countryman? Therefore, this kind of acknowledgment on the part of my Chicago oversea brothers, is real manna for my greatly depressed soul.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>On this account, I am, my dear brothers, herewith expressing my cordial thanks for your appreciation of my work. At this moment I wish to add that it makes me very happy to see you, beyond all expectations, as stalwart Sitch members as you were in your native land. I know you are furthering the Sitch activity in the same direction and spirit as it once flourished in the Eastern Ukraine.</p>
   <p>I am building high hopes on your excellent Sitch organization, for I am sure that it will be a blessing to America, and that it will have a considerable bearing upon our national regeneration in the homeland.</p>
   <p>True enough, our land, at the present time, is flooded with enemy regiments, and our people are groaning under the feet of the Poles; therefore, all the greater responsibility lies upon us as emigrants. We must do what our brothers and sisters in the native land cannot. It is our duty to give them both material and moral help, so that all may survive this critical period.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It is the duty of all of us who are now living abroad to prepare all those things which are necessary for our Sitch activity, so that, should we return home, we will be prepared and supplied with ammunition.</p>
   <p>Toward the end of February, 1919, I established a main Sitch Committee in Vinnitsa, in Great Ukraine, and at the end of April a similar committee in the Carpathian Ukraine (formerly under Hungary).</p>
   <p>There is an excellent opportunity for you, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, in the coming year, 1921, to make yourselves known to the entire civilized world. Next year, a great convention of athletic societies and associations of the laboring class will take place in Prague. It is the so-called "Athletic Olympiad," a festival to which all the working-class athletic organizations of the whole world are invited. This Olympiad will be under the auspices of the United Workingmen's Gymnastic League, Prague, II, Navlickova, 5 B, whose <span class="page-break">\4</span>honorary head is Masaryk himself, president of the Czechoslovak Republic. The Czechoslovak government, through Mr. Benes, its minister of foreign affairs, has officially invited the whole world to take part in this festival.</p>
   <p>As a sacred duty you should do everything in your power to see that your Sitch organization in Chicago, as well as all the other Sitch organizations in other countries all over the world, is well represented at this festival, since it is classed also as a workingmen's athletic organization. You, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, should help, by your active participation in this festival, to let the whole world hear about you and thus be reminded that the Ukrainian nation lives, and together with working-men's athletic organizations of other nationalities fights for the betterment of humanity.</p>
   <p>It is evident that our Ukrainian brigades in Czechoslovakia will not lag behind. We are sure that they, especially those from the Carpathian Ukraine <span class="page-break">\5</span>(autonomous state in Czechoslovakia), will be very well represented on this occasion.</p>
   <p>You also, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, must help us to show the world that Ukrainia lives and is struggling in every field for her existence and betterment. Therefore, it is desirable that your Chicago Sitch, as well as the American Sitch in general, take part in this athletic festival. It is self-evident that you are unable to send out a large group, but you can send a small detachment, including especially those members who have had something to do with Europe in the past. The Ukrainian flag carried beside the splendid American starry flag at the festival, will help us to gain friends among the Czechs as well as among other nations, and particularly among the American-born delegates, some of whom do not as yet know much about us Ukrainians, and about our Sitch organization in America.</p>
   <p>Thanking you, Ukrainian-Chicagoans, members of the Sitch organization, from <span class="page-break">\6</span>the bottom of my heart for your friendly acknowledgment of my work, may I take this opportunity to command the attention of the whole worthy Sitch organization in the United States of America, and cry out with a thundering voice so that my brothers and sisters beyond the sea may hear the words:</p>
   <p>"The great mother of the Ukrainian Cossacks still lives!"</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Dr. Kyrilo Trilovsky, general head of the United Sitch Organizations in Eastern Ukraine; the speaker of the Central Sitch Committee in Great Ukraine; head of the Committee for Carpathian Ukraine.</p>
