   <p>Last Saturday Sept. 29, 1934 at the Century of Progress Miss Marie Lubas, "Miss Ukraine 1933", was one of the twenty seven girls picked out of some three hundred and some contestants for the title of Miss Century of Progress. She is representing the Ukrainian Nationality in the race.</p>
   <p>One of these twenty seven girls shall be picked as Miss Century of Progress, and the picking shall not be by a judge but by popular vote. The limited time for voting is between Sept. 30 and Oct. 8, inclusive. Therefore if you are at the Fair don't forget to ask for a ballot as you walk in and cast, a vote for Marie Lubas, because I'm sure if you all do that the Miss Century of Progress will be a Ukrainian girl....</p>
