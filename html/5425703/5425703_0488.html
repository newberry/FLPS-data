   <p>It is a sacred obligation to every conscious Ukrainian at this time, during the fight for our people and independence, the freedom and independence of the Ukrainian people to organize into one honest and responsible national organization that will use all the strength of the Ukrainian immigration for service to its native country.</p>
   <p>Our whole people and our native country are demanding from all of us the immigrants this service and help.</p>
   <p>The Federation of Ukrainians is our earnest, honest national organization on American soil which will in the best and the approved way lead all the Ukrainian immigrants to fulfill their duties to the native land. So let us all join the ranks of the Federation of Ukrainians!</p>
   <p>Sign up, men and women, boys and girls. Fill the ranks of the Federation of Ukrainians. Give proof that there is not one Ukrainian soul among <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>you which at this moment of need and great demand of the Ukrainian nation will not come in a large group to the service and aid of Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>Every Ukrainian society, every brotherhood, every sisterhood, every organization, every Ukrainian corporation or enterprise ought to join also the Federation of Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>All our people in the United States have to go under the Ukrainian national banner and thus create one strong, undivided front, like the war front that our fathers and mothers, our brothers and sisters made among themselves, in our native country, defending the freedom of the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian soil before the foreign invasion.</p>
   <p>The banner of the Federation of Ukrainians is the same as the banner under which gathers the mass of the Ukrainian working people in Ukrainia.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>In joining the Federation of Ukrainians you declare and obligate yourselves that you will, with all your strength and means, work together and help, so that the Ukrainian people may be free and independent.</p>
   <p>That there may be an independent national Ukrainian republic on Ukrainian soil;</p>
   <p>That the people may have their rights in the Ukrainian republic;</p>
   <p>That the fields may be divided among the masses of the villagers;</p>
   <p>That there may be no exhaustive work and no abuse of the workers;</p>
   <p>That women may be assured of the same rights that the men have;</p>
   <p>That in the world democracy, right and truth may reign.</p>
   <p>Associating and working under the banner of the Federation of Ukrainians, you shall help not only the Ukrainian people and their country, but the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>mass of working people, as well as yourself and the entire humanity.</p>
   <p>To put over some big plan, power is needed. Power can be created only through organization.</p>
   <p>So, Ukrainian brothers and sisters, organize yourselves in the Federation of Ukrainians. There should be no place left wherever the Ukrainians live that a branch of the Federation of Ukrainians could not be organized. Through thorough and broad organizing work the Ukrainian immigration in America will succeed in putting over a big deed.</p>
   <p>The yearly dues to the Federation is one dollar. The yearly subscription of Ukrainia, issued in Chicago, is $1.50</p>
   <p>The Federation newspaper will always have accurate news about the work of the Federation, and pointers as to what every member should do at all times for the common national cause.</p>
