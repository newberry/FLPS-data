   <p>The theme assigned to me is a problem to which there is no mathematical approach, and therefore no exact deduction as to its solution is possible. On the other hand, if Newton had been lying on the other side of the tree he might not have become the Newton that he did.</p>
   <p>To study the possible approaches to this problem of the Ukrainian Youth we ought to have a fair picture of the Ukrainian immigration.</p>
   <p>First of all, we generally like to compare our immigration with that of other nationalities and criticize accordingly. This is especially true with the American-born generation. The comparison is erroneous in that we are not comparing similarities. The fact that our immigration is practically the youngest that came to this continent does not allow comparison with such immigrations as the Irish and German which occured much earlier. Whereas the others through various generations have been ingraining themselves in this country, the Ukrainians have come to see the first American-born generation entering the threshold of maturity. Whereas the others came at a time when the country was undeveloped, the Ukrainians came at the time when industry was reaching its peak of production; and that itself was to some extent a calamity.</p>
   <p>Kid ourselves as much as we will about equal opportunities, we cannot help but realize that the "first come, first served" rule applies to life as well as it does to movie seats. The older the immigration the larger percentage of those immigrants that create is a well-to-do class with its appendages of social, economic and political influences. The fact that the older immigrations came at a time when this nation welcomed them only improved, or rather had real opportunities thrust upon them, whereas the arrival of the Ukrainians at the time of industrial broadest development enticed them into the factory and its affiliates and thus stunned their natural development which would have come had they settled on the soil. This is the fundamental difference between the Ukrainian settlers of Canada and the Ukrainian industrial workers of the U.S.A.; the Canadian was transferred from soil to soil which he knew and loved and the American was transferred from the soil to the factory and mine which were strange to him and where he got lost. The new surroundings and conditions owed him and in the hum of industrial life and activity the immigrant was charmed and set to wondering. He began to question himself about how soon he'll be able to save $500, $1000, $5,000, etc., and go back to the old country, buy lots of land, and be a first-class "hospodar" . As the years rolled by he kept on wondering, and the children kept on wondering.</p>
   <p>Now that children are wondering away the fathers are beginning to take notice of their children's presence, and their interest is aroused. What is the trouble? It is not that the fathers were not patriotic, in their sense. They always seemed to respond to different appeals to support the Ukrainian cause. The simple trouble is that the appeals were always one sided. The constant calls were for material help to the other side. One thing was forgotten and that was the true aim of the Ukrainian cause: Perpetuation. Even the free Ukraine would not be of any great mutual benefit if that freedom was to be short-lived. We have had a taste of that. We are striving for a lasting freedom of a nation and consequently should prepare a lasting army of its supporters who may have to wage a lasting battle to the finish. We need perpetuating generations of nationally conscious Ukrainians. Unfortunately all that was take for granted as far as the immigration went.</p>
   
   <p>True enough, the older generation has built some fine institutions; but now that the time is approaching when the fathers will pass away, the problem of these institutions looms up to the front--are the young folks ready for it? To say the least, the problem that the fathers are facing is not a simple one.</p>
   <p>In dealing with the children we must first consider the parents who have their greatest influence over them. These folks may be divided into two types. There is the indifferent parent and we may be certain that the children of such are practically bound to be the same. Then we have the second type and that is the serious or trying type that deserves all the consideration. According to the old country tradition, the father's word should be "law" whether it is logical or not. Not knowing much about American life, the parents expect the child to obey. The child on the other hand, confronted with a strange request made without an explanation, rebels and refuses to obey. Whatever may follow one may be sure that the child will be constantly on guard and suspecting that all "old country" notions must be just as ridiculous. Very often this first encounter is the cause of a lasting and an irreparable breach. The above cites the stern father.</p>
   
   <p>Now we have another type of a parent whose inferiority complex results in a similar breach between parent and child and that is the "dividing parent." How often have we heard, "It must be so because Johnny said so." Whether Johnny knows that he is alive or not is another question but because he finished elementary school and possibly is floating through high school, the mother sees in him the incarnation of all wisdom, even though her plain common sense must have told her more than once that his requests were unreasonable. But then this is America; everything is different. Results: parents always wrong, parents looked down upon as ignorant, all the Ukrainians judged in the same light, and the Ukrainian cause is given the same consideration.</p>
   <p>Coming to the topic of the young folks themselves, we must divide them into two groups, also. (Please bear in mind that throughout I'm speaking in generalities; there are exceptions to all rules). In the first group belong the grown ups. If these are not nationally conscious they are lost." You can't teach an old dog new tricks." In exceptional cases you might arouse interest but hardly a fever or devotion to a cause--not even money can do that. That takes up to the second group which consists of youth's growing up. Their life is a detached life; detached because the elders have been constantly detaching them from their own circle. This alienation process has been worked in different ways. I have mentioned the stern father and the divining mother. I must mention the foolish laughter of the elders at the children who in all earnest endeavor to learn, mispronounce Ukrainian words. Then we have the unnecessary long church hours which turns away so many boys and girls, and that is quite an important factor because our churches are our oldest institutions here, they are our oldest gathering places, social centers. While the fathers live they may be able to force the children to attend church, but what is going to happen to the churches later? The other alienating influence are our plays, entertainments and lack of inducements.</p>
   <p>Naturally the question of "what is there to be done" comes in its logical sequence. The answer, is short, is: teach the elders and induce the young. About the first part of the advice a lot has been written by various contributors to our Ukrainian papers but like all enterprising novelties, it must be sold--sold by constant advertising. The elders must be taught how to respect their own nationality,--their own customs and their own institutions,--but respect intelligently. Just as an example let's take the Christmas holiday, observed by us by the Julian calendar. It is a usual question which the children ask:</p>
   
   <p>"Why must our Christmas be so late?" I know that a lot of our people are abolishing our Christmas time on their own initiative or on their children's advice, and the natural result, as far as the children are concerned, is another defeat for the parents and their "old country notions." Now a logical answer would: "Our Christmas time has been kept since Christ was born, and the other was introduced only a few hundred years ago; so which deserves more consideration?" (After all as far as calendars go, if we were to use the right date, neither of the established dates would be right).</p>
   <p>Intelligent respect for our own is of great importance in the upbringing of our children. Intelligent respect to our own tongue will eliminate a lot of that alienating effect. Just emagine: a young girl or boy is trying her or his best to get the tongue around a certain syllable but fails--the parents, and perhaps some present friends, burst out with a roar of laughter. A big joke (considering that the elders who have lived here ten, fifteen, and twenty years have not even tried to learn the pronounciation of their adopted language, yet expect the youngster to learn their strange tongue in a fraction of that time without any guidance--while other people have to pay hundreds of dollars to learn the same.</p>
   
   <p>It is not that those elders mean any harm,--for from it. They certainly did not know any better and through their ignorance build, up the very wall which they want to eradicate.</p>
   <p>Help the youngsters. True enough, the mispronouncement is funny at times but then erase the effect of the laughter by an explanation of why it is funny and correct and accent or what not, and both the child and advisor will benefit by it. The youngster will remember the mistake because of the mirth it produced and the elder will gain the respect of the child because of the source of knowledge that the elder will appear to represent. On the other hand, if there is no reason to laugh, then for goodness sake, don't. The greatest satisfaction that I have had was to hear on similar occasions some bright youngster pop up the question, "Why do you laugh? What's so funny about it?" In some cases the question had a sobering effect.</p>
   <p>We must induce young folks to respect and cherish our ideals. The form of inducement may be classed as local and national.</p>
   <p>If we consider the smaller town as a locality we are faced with a small Ukrainian colony and unless it is a farming section, it is a compact colony where the members are in close touch with each other. Having one meeting place it becomes their social center, where all entertainments are held and where the children get their only information about their father's homeland. Unfortunately, the information gained by the youngsters is not of the homeland out of the environments in which they live, of the conditions which influence the elders the most. The children are allowed to watch the card playing and drinking and drinkfilled stage performances which stagnate even to this day. Result: the children form an opinion in their plastic age and the opinion is: the old country is the same so why bother about it. Keep the children away from the private bar and its profits. Choose your plays as carefully as you would choose a guardian over your children, and having chosen them try in a cooperative manner to persuade the young folks to participate in those clean plays. A few monetary prizes for the young participants of the understanding performances will serve a special inducements. Forget the profit; think of the mutual gain.</p>
   <p>In larger cities the conditions have improved to some extent. There is some concentration of intellectual forces which naturally take a lead. But on the other hand, the diverging forces in the large city colonies are much greater. Therefore it is necessary to center on the national form of inducement which has more influence in the large cities and which through that influence involves the smaller colonies as well.</p>
   
   <p>The Ukrainians must have, by all means, their own native schools of quality. So far, with the exception of some Canadian institutions, I have not heard of permanently established quality schools. It is that lasting curse among us which must be fought at all costs. Profit! Something for nothing! False profit!. And soon we will be reaping the lost gain. There should be no one in a colony as important as the teacher in our native schools--I mean qualified teachers who may be entrusted with the molding of young characters. Let us forget about the one-in-all combination: teacher--deacon, janitor and general abuse mongrel. Stop wasting your pennies. One good man could cover three to five colonies with the minimum cost to the individual group and with the maximum benefit to all concerned. A central guiding institution is needed to coordinate this work and I hope that the recent movement in that direction will materialize.</p>
   <p>We must awaken the pride of the young folks in our own institutions. In this respect, forgetting some of the faults in his endeavors, there can be no doubt that V. Avramenko's dancing organizations have blazed a trail of great significance. The organizing ability of the man should be capitalized to every extent in this new school movement.</p>
   
   <p>Considering all the phases of our life in this country, we find one thing lacking, and lacking sorely. No matter how, the most important thing, in order to get the young person's attention, is to appeal to his or her feeling. We can do so by mouth or written word. The first means is out of question physically. That leaves us the possibilities of the written word, further, to appeal through writing, the person must be well acquainted with the medium of expression, and naturally to an American born Ukrainian the English word is the most effective medium of expression or transmission of thought.</p>
   <p>Herein we are sorely in need of Ukrainian literature in the English language. We need to encourage young people to specialize in literature, and through substantial renumerations we must induce them to write. The large central institutions are in the best position to undertake this move. It must be a continuous annual subsidy or fund; otherwise the power of inducement would be nullified. What rich sources of Ukrainian historic material and what possibilities of parallelization with the history of this continent!</p>
   <p>We are living through a period of Ukraine's greatest upheaval. Ukraine is transformed into land of martyrs. This fact should be utilized by the Ukrainian papers. Where life is at stake, no means should be spared to impress the young of the bestiality of the killer. The impression is lasting and is taken to heart. If we are to develop fighting supporters of a mutual cause, we must present in a true light the reason for our battle. To this end, more material should be printed in English, for the general dissemination of the news.</p>
   <p>In conclusion I must say that a lot of the suggestions cannot be followed out as long as we have party frictions and go to the extent of letting party prejudice come before a mutual aim. We must admit that the older generation will finish its existence in the same attitude, but the coming generation has none of these obstacles to handicap its progress.</p>
   <p>There must be a full recognition of this fact and all nationalistic groups must meet and formulate a common line of endeavor in tackling this "wondering" problem which might be neglected too long. Regardless of the party, we have one aim and must train our children to see it in the same light and work hand in hand for the same cause. If we don't there will be no one else to do it; so, since it must be done sooner or later, why not try to do it now? And it is up to the Ukrainian professional men, especially those in the ranks of the younger generation, to lend their shoulders to this problem in which they are bound to play the main guiding part.</p>
