   <p>We are now starting a drive after which we hope to have every Ukrainian boy and girl a member of some Ukrainian club.</p>
   <p>If it is a social club that you wish to join, our suggestion is to sign up with the U. A. C. Y. (Ukrainian American Catholic Youth). The dues are 15 cents a month and no initiation fee is required.</p>
   <p>For fellows who are athletically inclined and love a military organization there is no club better than the U. H. O. Co. 3 (United Hetman Organizations Company 3). Their athletic branch known as the Elks has been quite effective as a strong Ukrainian baseball team. They hold their meetings every Tuesday in their club, while on Saturday they drill. The only requirements that are necessary for anyone who wishes to join is that he be over 15 years of age. Those who do not like drilling but would rather stick to seamanship can join the newly organized sea scouts.</p>

   <p>The girls that are interested in sports can become members of the Zippers Athletic Club, and those who wish can join the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Starting next week we shall have officers of one of the above mentioned clubs tell us of his or her club. They will give the history and the charter of the club, and also the requirements (if any) of a new member.</p>
