   <p>To Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky By Rev. Kuryllo, a Chicago Priest</p>
   <p>"He will remember every sacrifice of thine And thus everything shall be well with thee"</p>
   <p>You, our Ukrainian Moses, with all heroic brilliancy, were, as if standing before our eyes, even here beyond the seas.</p>
   <p>From the Russian North, thousands of miles away from us in America, we hear the sounds of cracked banduras on which the fingers of once fighting bandurists, who have been blinded by bursting shrapnel, seem to be playing a mournful melody about you, Prince of the church, prisoner of war and in <span class="page-break">\2</span>fetters. Our grandfathers, just on the verge of that terrible evening, when the worst war in history commenced with thundering cannonading, whispered stories to their grandchildren about you, our great Prince of the Church, undaunted hero. Your glorious deeds will pass on and be written in golden letters on the pages of our history as a perpetual legacy for all the generations to come. Our whole nation has dressed you in a resplendent aureolic miter, because of your countless noble deeds and sufferings for us. Generations after generations to come will sing heroic songs in your honor, loyal Prince, the very best son of Ukrainia.</p>
   <p>You are being blessed over there by our fathers, mothers and children; you are likewise blessed by us here in America!</p>
   <p>"God will grant you your heart's desires,</p>
   <p>And all your plans will be fulfilled."</p>
   <p>You were praying for that particular grace to be granted unto you, and God will grant it not only for you, but also for all your people, because you <span class="page-break">\3</span>fearlessly stood before the Pharaoh's army unyeilding and unterrified, your faith unshaken. You were the only one then (during the capture of the remnants of the Ukrainian land by the Russians) who dared to preach the word of God on Faith, Hope and Charity, during those days of horror and doubt; during the hour of national bitter suffering and disorder. At the time when you were most needed, the Russian gendarmes, fully armed, tore you away from us, taking you to Siberia as a captive.</p>
   <p>May your footprints left on those roads, bless them and that Siberian country and may from them spring up the flower of brotherly love, and the Gospel of our churches be preached in that far country. Bless us and our enemies.</p>
   <p>"God will grant you everything whatsoever you may ask Him...."</p>
   <p>When you returned from war imprisonment, you were ready for new horrors, seeing <span class="page-break">\4</span>houses demolished, plundered manors, charred churches, in a word, everything looked like one big uncovered grave. Human beings, your people, looked like skeletons and could hardly plod along their weary way, being hungry and in rags. You, big-hearted Father, Shepherd and Prince, you were the first laborer of restoration of your people.</p>
   <p>We rejoice over the fact that you have crossed the ocean now to visit us here in Chicago, as well as all over the United States in general. What a grand visit it is!</p>
   <p>We know that you have brought us a blessing from our land which has been trampled upon by the enemies and the hoofs of their horses and torn asunder by cannon balls while it was saturated with tears and blood.</p>
   <p>May God bless you, and you, in turn bless us!</p>
   <p>"God from His Heaven on high will hear him....."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Are we not part of your people, your Lordship? Therefore, bless us also as you have blessed the people, in the native land, who came out to welcome you on your return from Russia, where you were held as a war prisoner. You have blessed your people, the lame and the old; the ruined native land with its cities and villages pillaged and plundered and with terrorized mothers and shamefully treated sisters roaming about. How sincerely and in what a holy manner you have blessed them one and all.</p>
   <p>Even although thousands of miles away the people's voice of gratitude and prayers for your generous benediction penetrated our ears.</p>
   <p>It is the custom in the Ukrainian home to make guests feel at home. "Guest at home, God at home" is the Ukrainian saying. Yet you are not only a guest, but you are also a father of us all. Bread and salt awaits you here in every home. Bless this food, the product of our hands. Tell us what we have to do next. Millions of Ukrainians over there are listening and obeying you - we are joining them in asking your guidance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Behind the scene of the treat with bread and salt (a Ukrainian treat for distinguished guests) at the table, thousands of faithful to Christ and your children are awaiting you.</p>
   <p>We did not forget for a moment the resolutions which we brought over here with us, and we are determined to fulfill them.</p>
   <p>Your Lordship, bless those tendencies and resolutions of ours.</p>
   <p>"Our Salvation rests in the Power of His right hand."</p>
   <p>Yes, while a prisoner of war, together with the psalmist you prayed for our glory, for siege regiments who were and are standing on guard fully armed in difficult positions; who through their utmost sacrifices are forging a colossal hammer with which to split the door that bars the way to freedom.</p>
   <p>You have come back to us from captivity and thereby our hearts are filled <span class="page-break">\7</span>with new thanksgiving. No wonder that even the Ukrainian Blue and Yellow flags are tipped down by our army in your presence, thus honoring you as their spiritual Commander of the Siege army.</p>
   <p>The Siege army soldiers in Ukrainia fell in love with you, and out of that love they are weaving a mantle, far more beautiful than one of silk, for you with four crocheted designs: for Faith, Church, Ukrainia, and Siege, all of which you have commanded and blessed.</p>
   <p>And here in Chicago and America, the Siege rank and file is awaiting your visit.</p>
   <p>The warm heart of Siege does not know deceit; in a simple way, thousands of voices call forth in concert: "Welcome Ukrainian Prince, who prostrated himself on the graves of the cities of Chmelnitsky (Ukrainia) and at the tombs of our forefathers in Kiev, and with your word inspired millions in the United Ukrainia."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Our banners bow before you and await your benediction.....</p>
   <p>Bless them!</p>
