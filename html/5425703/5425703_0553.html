   <p>Concerning Reinforcement of the Siege Organization</p>
   <p>The Convention thinks that it is necessary to make some fundamental changes in order to reinforce the organization. One of the changes will be that the Chief Executive must appoint all the officers, with the exception of those whom he thinks ought to be elected by their respective District or Branch. In case of the death or the resignation of the Chief Executive, his assistant will take full charge of the Office. And in case the latter can not continue in the Office, he has the right to appoint an Interim Chief Executive, until the next referendum. The manner in which the Chief Executive is to be elected will depend upon the latest amended by-laws. This amendment is done according to the leading thoughts of the speech on the by-laws, at every Siege <span class="page-break">2</span>Convention, and according to the five articles in the Siege Organ, under the title: "Let us Build a Strong Siege." The Chief Executive is to hold the Office for three years. All the other officers are his subordinates, and they are either directly appointed, or approved by him. After the three years are over, he must call a convention, at which the delegates will either re-elect the old, or elect a new Chief Executive. The Convention must appraise and approve, or otherwise, the work of the Officers in power for the past three years.</p>
   <p>The Chief Executive once elected for three years, can be deposed only by a referendum, that is, by a general voting of every Siege member, and when two-thirds of all the Branches and within each Branch, two-thirds of the votes are against the Chief Executive, he is deposed. Should the Chief Executive be reluctant to arrange for such a referendum, upon a demand of two-thirds of the Branches, the assistant to the Chief Executive has the right to arrange for the referendum.</p>
   <p>N. B. After a conference of the lecturer with the Chief Executive, the former made a motion only to elect financial secretaries. Mr. Stephen <span class="page-break">3</span>Muryn of Chicago was elected the General Financial Secretary. The election of the local secretaries was left to the Districts and Branches respectively. Other officers must be left entirely for the approval of the Chief Executive, after such names are presented or submitted by the respective Districts or Branches. Until further notice by the Chief Executive, the present officers hold their respective positions.</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>Organizational Affairs</p>
   <p>The Siege Convention considers only those people as enlightened, who steadily belong to one or more of the Ukrainian organizations, and who steadily carry some burden for the sake of their Ukrainian Nation in their state. All others are merely ethnographical material, who are either Little Russians, or Little Poles, who through their inertness, in case of fight, cannot be depended upon; but on the contrary, through their indifference they help the occupiers to hold the Ukrainian country and nation in bondage.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Therefore, the Convention calls upon all Ukrainians to join the Ukrainian National Organizations and thoroughly fulfill the duties of the organizations, and at the same time train their children to do so.</p>
   <p>The Convention considers the Siege as the only organization which can unite all the Ukrainians, regardless of creed or political party, on the whole earth: in Europe, the United States, Canada, Brazil, and other parts of America as well as in Asia, and elsewhere. Therefore, the Convention appeals to all Ukrainians, in whatever part of the world they may be, to form clubs, groups, within the Siege organization, in every locality wherever there are ten or more Ukrainians to be found, and to see to it that they get in direct contact with the Siege Headquarters in Chicago, if they are in America, or with other Headquarters, if they are in any other part of the world.</p>
   <p>III</p>
   <p>State Affairs</p>
   <p>The Siege Convention is positively and firmly for the Independent</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Ukrainian State, since the whole Ukrainian Country is at present occupied by foreign governments. (A nation can be considered as unoccupied only when its land has definite boundaries, independent of any foreign country; when it has its own Supreme Government with its army, treasury, and its offices filled by its own people.) Therefore, because the Ukrainian nation is lacking all this on its own soil, it is in a state of war with all its occupiers. Although at the present moment the Ukrainian Nation is conquered, no lawful representative of the Ukrainian land and country has signed a peace treaty with its occupiers.</p>
   <p>The Convention finds it necessary to create a Ukrainian State Center, outside its own country, where it can be free to establish the necessary Ukrainian institutions, organizations, and newspapers. Such a center should not have a committee, but one person; because wherever a committee rules, it usually leads only to deterioration of the national ideals. Committees should be created only as advisory bodies, which can take care of certain branches of general business.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Individual members of those Committees should be responsible to the Chief Executive, who should have the right to accept their resignations, and appoint or approve new members, upon the request of the Ukrainian organizations in that particular country.</p>
   <p>The entire Ukrainian Nation should finance this Center, especially the American immigrants, with a regular National State tax collected monthly by all Ukrainian organizations.</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>Unification</p>
   <p>The Siege Convention recognizes the necessity of a united National State front in America and also ways and means that lead to this unity. In regard to this unification, the Convention admits that the general endeavors to attain it are so excellent that the Convention can add nothing for its betterment, except congratulations.</p>
   <p>With reference to the National tax collected by the Siege Branches, the</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Convention gives a free hand to every Branch whether they have to send it through their respective Siege District Office, or whether each Branch must send it separately and directly to the Headquarters in Chicago. Each District has the right to direct and instruct its own Branches as to what they have to do and how they must do it in this particular case.</p>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>Tax</p>
   <p>The Siege Convention considers it the duty of every Siege member to pay the National State tax regularly as had been established, to help the Old Country which is weltering in blood and suffering, and which is in dire need of the help for widows and orphans, for disabled invalids, as well as for the Ukrainian vernacular schools so terribly persecuted by the occupiers.</p>
   <p>VI</p>
   <p>Religious and Church Affairs</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The Convention considers religious and church quarrels among the Ukrainians, as well as every kind of disturbance against the churches, as throwing a bone of discontentment, and thus distracting the attention of the people from the organized struggle for its State independence. Therefore, every kind of a quarrel against churches or between churches are to be considered nothing else but a ruinous activity, which will only benefit the enemies of the Ukrainian Nation. Every nation, whose lands are occupied by its enemies, must preserve harmony among its people, otherwise a fight is impossible, and all its dissensions among its people are instigated all the more by its enemies, who thus profit by the internal quarrels of the nation.</p>
   <p>VII</p>
   <p>Press</p>
   <p>The Convention considers the press the chief medium of promulgation, propaganda, and firm establishment of the ideals of the organization. Therefore, the Convention has decided that from now on every Siege <span class="page-break">9</span>member must be a subscriber of the Siege organ. The nearest referendum must abolish subscribing to the paper and limit the monthly dues so that they will take care of the upkeep of the Siege Organization as well as the publication of its organ. The Convention approved of the work of the present editor, and also approved of his continuing in this position.</p>
   <p>VIII</p>
   <p>The next Siege Convention is to be held three years from now in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>IX</p>
   <p>The Convention annuls all decrees prior to the by-laws of this Convention that are not in accord with its final decisions.</p>
