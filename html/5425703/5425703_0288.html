   <p>In the month of October 1935, an enthusiastic, determined group of Young Ukrainian Nationalists members met for the purpose of publishing a journal for the Chicago Youth, under the auspices of the Y.U.N. branches of Chicago. They planted a seed which grew into the Trident News, a monthly magazine of which the first issue went into circulation on November 1st. Everywhere it was received with open arms, and the enthusiasm of the Y.U.N. members knew no bounds. But little did they, or even the staff, headed by Editor Michael Senchuk and Business Manager John Sawchyn, speculate or guess, or even dream, that some day it would develop into the official organ of the Young Ukrainian Nationalists of America. Needless to say, that day has arrived. The seed which was planted as the Trident News has now grown into a young, sturdy oak. The Trident, and its roots will soon spread to all parts of the globe. It will be up to the youth, and to our elders, to see to it that the roots are well fed and supplied with wholesome nourishment; while it will be the duty of the staff to make certain that the results are worthwhile and that beautiful flowers blossom forth <span class="page-break">\2</span>to cheer and enhearten the youth.</p>
   <p>We, the young Ukrainian Nationalists, present this first issue of The Trident to the Ukrainian Youth of America. It is our firm conviction that the American Ukrainian Youth have been awaiting that the arrival of a publication such as this; and we further believe that it will, in due time, unite the majority of the youth, so that they will shout in unison--"Long Live Ukraine".</p>
   <p>It would be worthwhile to reiterate the purpose of this magazine as expressed in the memorable first issue of the Trident News:</p>
   <p>"1. To aquaint the youth with the ideals of Ukrainian Nationalism, and to create of this youth a strong force, one that will effectively aid the Ukrainian nation to free itself of foreign tyranny and set up its own free and independent state of Ukraine, by organizing our youth into the ranks of Y.U.N.</p>
   <p>"2. To give the youth the necessary background of their heritage by presenting to them articles on Ukrainian History, Literature and folk lore, and to influence our youth to attend Ukrainian schools, sing in Ukrainian choruses, take <span class="page-break">\3</span>part in Ukrainian theatricals, read Ukrainian Newspapers and books, and in general, manifest a greater interest in American-Ukrain-ian life.</p>
   <p>"3. To conduct and intensify Ukrainian propaganda among other peoples, by encouraging the youth to participate in civic affairs in such a manner as to make the American public conscious of the fact that there exists in their community a Ukrainian people, that these people have a culture as high as their own, and that these people are trying to aid their appressed countrymen in Europe to regain their freedom".</p>
   <p>If this publication can arouse the youth and cause them to cling to their priceless heritage, their mother tongue, one good purpose will have been achieved. But we cannot stop there!</p>
   <p>If this publication, further, can cause the youth to realize that in unity there is strength, and can foster a lasting interest in the youth in the welfare of <span class="page-break">\4</span>their nation, so as to bring the youth closer together, as of one happy family, as of one indivisible nation, a higher purpose will have been attained. Finally, if this publication can stimulate the active interest of the youth in the Ukrainian cause--the liberation of Ukraine--then our supreme purpose will be accomplished.</p>
   <p>Let us, then consider briefly the intended policies of this magazine.</p>
   <p>It should be apparent to everyone that a publication such as this cannot long continue in popularity unless it has variety and sparkling life, so that the subscriber's interest will never lag, and unless it avoids being too controversial in regard to other organizations and publications. No further assurances are necessary that this magazine will retain the interest of its readers. This first issue is but a sample of its possibilities. On the other hand, it must be remembered that while at no time will unfair or cowardly attacks be made herein on any organization or its publication, yet where it shall be deemed necessary to pry open the unseeing eyes of the dormant or blind youth, the truth will be presented--not to satisfy any urge on our part to be maliciously trouble-some <span class="page-break">\5</span>or provocative, but rather to prevent the youth from falling into pitfalls and errors which have in the past prevented our people from uniting as one nation to free Ukraine. We do not say that we will strive to avoid controversy, but we can say that we will avoid entering useless, harmful controversies and discussions. With this last word, we say, "Do pobachenya," and "Slava Ukraine!"</p>
