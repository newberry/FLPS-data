   <p>Some people still think that this War is just a very interesting picnic, and that it can be won when they vow several times a day that they will remain loyal to the flag. If they will wear, so they think, a few modish articles displayed in the show windows, as red, white, blue ribbons, they will have done everything necessary to smash kaiserism. Fashion adjusts itself very quickly to certain conditions. Pins, buttons, etc., are made to fit the time of War.</p>
   <p>The habit of wearing patriotic apparel is not costly. Young men, who would begin to shiver in the neighborhood of a recruiting station, like to buy collars with red, white, and blue printed on them. A similar pattern is used for ladies' slippers; stockings with a miniature Star Spangled Banner woven in are much in vogue.....</p>
   <p>Among the many exhibits of that sort of patriotic fervor, there are such as military uniforms for ladies. But this is not the latest. There is a camp at Lake Geneva where there are some soldiers, but the majority are women in uniforms that resemble those of Uncle Sam's regular soldiers; only they are better cut, more nifty than those of the doughboys. The women hold target practice. They will not of course, go to War. Their help will not be needed even for home defense. This kind of play is, however, much more comfortable than honest work done in the service of the Red Cross.</p>
