   <p>The campaign for the Fourth Liberty Loan was started last Saturday morning with the pealing of church bells and the sounding of sirens. Six billions of dollars is the lowest figure determined by the Government. The quota for Chicago, or rather for Cook County, is 252 millions, and for the Seventh Federal district (with seat in Chicago) the quota is 870 millions, or 141/2 per cent of the total loan.</p>
   <p>This is the biggest demand ever made from any people at any time, and the exertion of all our powers will be necessary to satisfy it, but the people are not asked to make any sacrifice. There is no hardship in lending the money even when viewed from the business or financial standpoint.</p>
   <p>These bonds will bear 41/4 per cent interest, and are offered in denominations of $50, $100, etc. They may be paid in installments on a 10% deposit. This gives a chance to those without ready money but prospects for a job. He who buys this way is acting upon the impulse of good business sense.</p>
   <p>The workingman's wage and the businessman's profit are here for the necessities of daily life, and also for the purpose of saving, which lends a firm basis to the future.....When a man asks himself where to deposit his savings he considers the element of security first, and then the profit his investment will yield.</p>
   <p>There is no investment in the United States or, in fact, in the whole world, more safe than the bonds offered by our Government. All of the United States, with their immense resources, back up these bonds, which would become worthless only in the unthinkable case that money had lost its value.</p>
   <p>Your money, if not invested, will be nonproductive, dead. War bonds bear the highest interest consistent with their high degree of safety. Government bonds have, up to recent times, yielded two or two and one half per cent. They did not appear on the market, because banks needed them for the stabilizing of their credit system. Banks, which have so often deceived their clients, offer only three per cent on loans.</p>
   <p>No one, except a fool or a German who publicly identifies himself as such, or is one in secret, will hesitate to buy as many bonds as his resources permit.</p>
   <p>The reason for buying bonds advanced above is based on business sense. Its foundation is purely egoistic impulse urging to buy as many bonds as possible. There are, however, other reasons, more weighty and important, which counsel every good American to bring his savings to Uncle Sam quickly. American patriotism and humane sentiment are of prime importance.</p>
   <p>Individual patriotism is not valued by the number of dollars spent on bonds. One man may subscribe for one million, another for only fifty dollars. Still the latter may be classified as a better patriot than the former. The former bought from a surplus of money, while the poorer man had to see how to make both ends meet in order to produce the price of the bond. The rich man did not have to sacrifice like the poor. Thus, patriotism is measured by sacrifice.</p>
   <p>He who has to think hard how to get the money for bonds--to give up pleasure and comfort--skimp on his clothing--miss a performance in a show--economize in his food--he is the better patriot.</p>
   <p>The time for idle talk has passed. The time for action, has come. We have met many people who breathed patriotism. They either bragged about their own patriotic sentiment or cast doubt on that of their neighbors. Now they can show their true colors, and demonstrate how much interest they have in victory for the homeland and the whole world.</p>
   <p>Talk costs nothing, but it does not help win the war. To win victory requires fighting, work, and money. Those who are on the battle front, or who are waiting in camps to be sent there, could not fight if we at home did not work and contribute by giving everything that we call our own to supply what they need--food, ammunition, clothing--and if we did not give lavishly.</p>
   
   <p>The Germans are being beaten right and left. We may well claim that this is, to a great extent, due to the help by America. Our soldiers are performing feats that set the world agog. President Wilson, Secretary of War Baker, and General Pershing command the admiration of the whole world. It is up to us now to join their ranks properly, and fill them by subscribing to bonds "till it hurts". We should indeed make every effort to help oversubscribe the quota.</p>
   <p>If we subscribe for ten billions instead of six--that will mean one of the heaviest defeats for the Kaiser and his cohorts. How they would rejoice if the progress of our Liberty bond campaign were impeded, and the issue became stagnant! It would fill them with new courage, hope, and strength. We must not allow this to come to pass. We have to prove by oversubscriptions that we shall not give in, and are united as long as one man is able to keep up, and even only one single dollar is at our disposal.</p>
   <p>If every American is to lay everything on the altar of the fatherland to help it to win victory, then we Czechoslovaks feel doubly under obligation to do the same. Any sacrifice on our part is made, not only for our new homeland, but for the old motherland as well, that motherland which is about to begin a new, happy and free existence. Buy bonds!</p>
