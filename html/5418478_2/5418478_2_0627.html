   <p>Congressman [A. J.] Sabath has earned the gratitude of Czechs and Slovaks by his activities in Congress. He has ingratiated himself into the favor of all decent people who uphold justice and the principles for which the United States is fighting, and which, above all, must fire us Czechoslovaks with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>A measure which he recently proposed in the House has passed that body, and will no doubt be approved in the Senate also. It will reopen the doors of America to those of our boys who have taken out their first papers only, but who are now fighting in either the American, the English, the French, or our Czechoslovak Army. This is, of course, only right; yet even justice has often to go a long way before it wins recognition.</p>
