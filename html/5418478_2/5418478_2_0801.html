   <p>We earnestly urge our readers to purchase Liberty bonds wherever and whenever financial conditions permit. We are engaged in a war that asks us to send not only the flower of our youth into battle against a relentless enemy who uses every means to attain his goal, i.e., the domination over the whole world; but the war also asks us to stake all our worldly possessions on the issue of victory.</p>
   <p>Our army must be supplied with everything useful and necessary, such as ammunition and clothing. It must also be kept trim and strong in order to be capable of overwhelming the enemy.</p>
   <p>It is also our duty to help the Allied armies which are exhaused after a three year struggle. If we do not help them, they may be compelled to conclude a peace incompatible with honor, and leave America to fight for herself.</p>
   
   <p>He who would refuse the money for bonds now might have to pay regular contributions to the Kaiser plus an enormous war indemnity.</p>
   <p>Every one of us, whether rich or poor, has one interest--that of defeating the Germans decisively and arriving at a peace that would once and for all do away with the danger of German militarism and Prussian autocracy. Those insignificant individuals who are receiving higher wages here than are paid anywhere in the world would lose every advantage if the Kaiser should be the victor. For the Germans think primarily of gaining control of the world's business so that they can flood the markets with their merchandise; they want to force the goods of the English, French, and Americans from the market; they want to render any competition impossible.</p>
   <p>A German victory would reduce the American workman to dire poverty. It would deprive him of his means of livelihood, and those workers who might remain would have to work for starvation wages.</p>
   <p>The farmer of the United States, whose life is envied by farmers all over the world, would sink to a low level along with the entire United States. If the workers had to take a pittance of a wage, they would be unable to pay a decent price for the victuals supplied by the farmers, who would find themselves in a worse condition than they were twenty-five years ago.</p>
   <p>Prosperous merchants, manufacturers, well-paid professionals, and other people of means should gather all their liquid assets and turn them over to the Government by the purchase of Liberty bonds to help assure victory, for defeat would spell disaster for them. While these people now enjoy wealth and comfort, they would soon become destitute and sink to the level of the poorest proletarian, and even further to the condition of the most miserable among the wretched.</p>
   <p>People should also consider that the United States simply must have the money and must acquire it by means of bonds or taxation. Many millions of persons do not have to pay taxes; however, this would change the moment Uncle Sam was unable to borrow money from his own citizens. Everybody would then have to pay high direct and indirect taxes. Prices would soar until we would hardly be able to keep from starving. If we lend money to the Government, it will not have to resort to high taxation.</p>
   <p>We Czechs have been offered prosperity and the opportunity to arrive at a dignified station in life by our new homeland. We come from a nation whose independence is one of the aims which the United States is pursuing in this war. Therefore we should be particularly willing to sacrifice, and perform our patriotic duties in every way; and one of these is to buy Liberty bonds. If the Teutons win the war, the Czech nation will be doomed, condemned to annihilation. On the other hand, a victory for the United States and the Allies will bring liberty to the Czech nation; victory will give it prosperity and will guarantee its independence for all time. Every memory of our early years, our devotion to the dear old motherland should urge us to buy bonds and thus help to bring victory over the Germans.</p>
   <p>The immigrant citizen is accorded the same rights and the same advantages as those which the Constitution and the laws of the United States secured for the native citizen. Now it is up to the immigrant citizen to prove that he is willing to meet the requirements and fulfill the duties which this portentous time of war imposes upon him. The immigrant is now the cynosure of all the American people. The results of their observations will govern the future attitude of America toward him. Let us Czechs endeavor to render America's judgment of our behavior a most favorable one. We shall then be in a position to point proudly to this record when the time comes to repulse the attacks by the know-nothings, of whom there is no dearth at any time.</p>
   <p>Subscribing to bonds cannot even be considered a sacrifice. It merely means the safest and most reasonable investment of money. Some of our fellow countrymen eye this time with suspicion. They fear unstability and the loss of their savings. We are receiving inquiries about the safest way to invest money, whether it should be put in private or Postal Savings banks. We recommend the purchase of Liberty bonds, for they offer the greatest security, just the same as the Postal Savings banks. The war bonds are backed by the entire American nation with its immense wealth, and they bear four per cent interest, while the private banks offer three and the Postal Savings bank only two per cent.</p>
   <p>In decadent old Austria, four and five per cent interest was paid, but a general state bankruptcy was already expected before the war. Yet people invested their savings in state properties; they reasoned that in case of failure, they would save at least something, while in a private bank they would lose everything. There is absolutely no possibility of a bankruptcy of the United States Government or of her failure to pay. Our government might as well borrow ten or twenty times as much money as it has now, for it will always be able to offer collateral. The United States is the richest country in the world; the Treasury holds fully two thirds of the gold that circulates over the globe. The whole world would have to declare itself bankrupt before any such emergency could arise in the United States. In case of a world bankruptcy, Germany and Austria would be drawn into the whirlpool and would thus be unable to continue the war.</p>
   <p>We Czechs have assumed the proper attitude from the very beginning of the war in discerning instantly that a defeat of the Teutons is to the interest of the United States and the whole world in general. We saw instantly that the entrance of the United States into the war assured a victory for the Allies. We have to continue reiterating our attitude not by words only, but by deeds as well, thus helping toward ultimate victory. For this reason, every Czech in America must produce visible proof of ownership of a Liberty bond. America may and must demand that every citizen submit evidence in the form of a Liberty bond that he is a good American patriot. He who does not prove his attitude by fighting in the Army or Navy must attest to his patriotic feeling by buying a bond. We feel certain that there is not a single Czech in America who would not offer this evidence if his circumstances permitted him to do so-- be it even in the smallest possible measure.</p>
