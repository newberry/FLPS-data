   <p>Congress is becoming convinced gradually that one of the most important things to do now is to pass a measure curbing the activities of food speculators. The steps taken by the government up to the present are insufficient. One senator proposes a law which should declare such profiteering unlawful. An abundance of foodstuffs is said to be in the country, yet our Chicago speculators carry on their dishonest trade. Nothing will stop them if some are not put behind the bars.</p>
   <p>Conscription of our young men has been passed by Congress. It is high time now to conscript foodstuffs also. The government ought to take over the management of the large food producing concerns, especially the stock yards. If this is not done, the danger of a food shortage may become a reality. Jailing the profiteering leeches might produce the desired results.</p>
