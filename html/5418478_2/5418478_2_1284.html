   <p>It was just a year ago that the war began to take on its full ferocity. During that year, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, other hundreds of thousands were crippled and maimed, millions of families were plunged into the deepest sorrow and pain, and the whole of Europe was made to feel, here to a greater, there to a lesser degree, the consequences of the mad conflict. And there is not as yet the slightest indication that the war will be finished in the near future. Some predict that it will last another year, some believe it will take another two full years before it is ended. Nobody can imagine what Europe would look like if the mass murder, mass destruction, and mass devastation should continue in the present degree for another two years. One thing, however, appears to be certain: The general misery in Europe will be so great, the financial, industrial, and economic conditions will be in such a state of ruin, that it will take at least fifty <span class="page-break">\2</span>years before the European nations recuperate.</p>
   <p>Of course, not very much is known about actual conditions in the warring countries. Their governments are taking good care to conceal the truth in order that their enemies may not be in a position to take advantage of their weaknesses. In Germany and in Austria-Hungary this concealment goes so far that even the inhabitants of these two empires do not know the actual state of affairs. Newspapers are permitted to publish nothing but what is furnished to them by the government, or what is passed by the army censorship. No rules apply to the financial transactions which are being made at the present time; paper money is being issued in unlimited quantities. These governments may be able to get away with it for a short while, perhaps for the duration of the war, but after the war the results of such action will become clearly apparent and there will be a terrible reckoning. The defeated countries, unable to straighten out their finances by the enemy's gold, and obliged to surrender their own gold--what there is of it--to the victors, will be in such a state of financial bankruptcy that its consequences will <span class="page-break">\3</span>bring about as much misery, distress, and despair as the war itself.</p>
   <p>The year just passed was favorable to Germany and her allies, but their enemies do not even dream of considering their own cause as lost. Russia, England, France, Italy, Serbia, Belgium--all these countries have faith in their own final victory and are ready to continue bleeding and sacrificing in order to achieve it. The common people of all countries no doubt wish most fervently for an early peace, but the ruling classes do not permit an expression of such a wish. The military, diplomatic, and financial circles are the ones who decide the question of peace and war in the present social system, and they have been, so far, after the first year of the war, avoiding the word "peace" most carefully.</p>
   <p>By what, eventually, will peace be brought about? Some people believe that peace will not come until one side is completely ruined, has no more soldiers, or no more money to buy the necessities of war. Is this conviction correct?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Allies--that is, Russia, France, England, and Italy--have so far put over twelve million men in the field, of whom some million and a half have been killed. The wounded were about four million six hundred thousand, but many of these have recovered and gone back into the field. Germany and her Allies, including Turkey, have succeeded, through their splendid organization for military ends, in setting up an army which is almost as strong, and the losses on that side will be comparable to the size of that army. But Austria and Germany have already drafted every man able to serve, while Russia has still a multitude of men able to serve, and a new army of men will become of age there every year, and that makes Russian resources of the human material of war quite inexhaustible. If Great Britain should resort to the introduction of general military duty, she could enlarge the Allies' army by millions of men. But we should have a long wait for peace if it should not come until all men in Austria and Germany are killed off.</p>
   <p>Also, it seems impossible that a great, decisive battle, such as the battle of Leipzig, or Waterloo, would put an end to this war. An event of that kind <span class="page-break">\5</span>would probably have an effect similar to that of the battle of Gettysburg in the Civil War: It decided its outcome, but the war itself went on for a long time after that battle.</p>
   <p>It is possible that there will be other developments than new machine guns and long-range cannon. The working classes are getting restless. In England, where they are not fettered by laws and the authorities, the working classes are giving the government a great deal of trouble. Strikes in mines and factories are endangering the army in its very foundations. There is restlessness also among the German workingmen, but its extent is unknown because the military censorship supresses any news about it. Thousands of workingmen in Northern France and Belgium are now forced to work for Germany. But to what extent can Germany rely upon the quality of armaments manufactured by slaves, who in fact are, in one sense of the word, the prisoners of war in countries occupied by Germany?</p>
   <p>For nothing else in the world would the nations spend so much money as they <span class="page-break">\6</span>are spending now for war. That money would pay for the construction of railways, ships, telegraphs, telephones; it would provide every city with a public library, art galleries, city theaters; streetcars could transport the people free of charge; public swimming pools, hospitals, parks, schools, and universities would be as plentiful as shrapnel in Flanders, where the Germans have been using it for the destruction of old landmarks of history and recognized works of art.</p>
   <p>Mr. Asquith has made the statement that the war is costing Great Britain $15,000,000 a day. A certain German statistician has figured out that the total expense of all nations engaged in this war amounts to $42,250,000 a day, or, roundly, $15,500,000,000 a year. War loans are subscribed with increasing difficulty, and the day is coming when it will become impossible to float them. Have the financiers the power to stop this war, to stop the destruction of values, which were created during a long period of peace?</p>
   <p>But in spite of the fact that the war in Europe is so terrible, so murderous, <span class="page-break">\7</span>economically so suicidal, there is continuous propaganda in the United States for a more thorough preparedness for war. In a manner similar to that used by the Kaiser when he was assuring the Reichstag that peace would be maintained if he got more money for armaments, our politicians are preaching to us that the United States must get ready for war in order to prevent it. These men do not heed the example of Europe, do not see that our geographic position is such as to make every country think twice before attacking us, and they completely disregard the fact that the United States is absolutely not interested in the conquest of new territories.</p>
   <p>The militarism which has brought about such terrible results in Europe during one year's war, and whose effects will be still more terrible in the year that is coming, must not get hold of this country. Any attempt of that kind should be opposed, particularly by our working classes.</p>
