   <p>We are addressing ourselves to all those who have a tender heart. Women, all of you, come and help! You can feel with a feminine heart what our heroes have to endure in the trenches for our downtrodden old homeland, the memory of which cannot be obliterated. We are convinced that there are many among you who can help mitigate the soldiers' sufferings. If our boys can face death, it would be a sad state of affairs if women were afraid of a little exertion. Women's hands, be they ever so weak, can accomplish much good.</p>
   <p>Do not be tardy! Increase the membership of the Vcelky (Little Bees), that organization of diligent women. On this occasion We wish to express our gratitude to all donors for the lovely gifts sent in to date. We implore those who cannot donate their services to make some monetary contribution.
