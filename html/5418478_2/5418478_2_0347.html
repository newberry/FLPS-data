   <p>The neutrality of the officials of the city of Chicago and the members of our City Council in matters concerning the sinking of the "Lusitania" is an interesting example of what length our politicians are willing to go in order to make sure that they do not antagonize their German constituents. Their carefulness and caution is something to be marveled at. The Council has adopted a resolution of condolence expressing sorrow over the death of American citizens, but the perpetrators of this unparalleled crime are not mentioned at all, and the word "German" must have disappeared from the dictionary when this marvelous expression of the opinion of our city fathers was being formulated.</p>
   <p>Not only our aldermen, but other officers, politicians, and public employees are feeling terribly embarrassed. It is real fun to listen to their brilliant statements. Everyone of them, of course, admits that the loss of so many lives is a horrible misfortune, but, "er--ur-umph--you know, it is so difficult to--ur-umph--well, you will see, the President will do the right thing about it--why of course--yes, goodbye--" That is about what the leading officials and other prominent leaders of Chicago's civic life say and think about the matter, and the common fellow can take his choice as to what he wants to see in such expressions. The principal consideration, of course, is not to make the German voters the least bit angry.</p>
