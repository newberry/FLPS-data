   <p>On a beautiful site, on Kedzie Avenue and 24th Street, there stands a stately building which is to serve as a public bath for the "Czech California" district. Much persuasion and patience was expended by Mr. Otto Kerner, alderman of the Twelfth Ward, in the effort to have the city council appropriate the money for this building. Now that those efforts and that patience have been rewarded, the building stands there, glorious in its solitude, but performing no service for the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Alderman Otto Kerner and Jos. I. Novak, have repeatedly urged the city council to order that the building be put in operation as a public bath without furthur waste of time. They point to useless investment of capital and to the growing discontent of our people.</p>
   <p>Our Aldermen were told that the city must economize during these times, and that Health Commissioner Robertson demands certain changes, improvements, etc., <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to be made before the opening of this public institution. Briefly, nothing had been done, and nothing would have been done had not Messrs. Anton J. Cermak and Jos. J. Salat, chairman and secretary respectively, of the Czech Bureau, 3342 West 26th Street, taken energetic steps to expedite matters. These two gentlemen started out by putting tremendous pressure on the city fathers, enlisting, of course, the aid of our two aldermen of the Twelfth Ward. We take great pleasure in stating that Mr. August W. Miller [clerk of the Superior Court of Cook County?] joined in their efforts.</p>
   <p>The following reasons why the bath should be opened are being advanced: first, because of the absolute necessity of sanitary measures in a densely populated district; secondly, and obviously of still more importance, for the sake of our boys enlisted in the United States Army. There is a large detachment of soldiers in the neighboring community of Hawthorne. Many of these men come to the "Czech California" district where they congregate in barbershops, anxious for a bath, but unable to enjoy one. What a comfort <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for them if our "California" neighborhood could offer the much desired accomodation! There are also many soldiers from Carter Harrison High School (National Guard) who would rejoice over the opening of a bathhouse in our district.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen who urge the opening of the bathhouse think it advisable to establish certain visiting hours for the soldiers.</p>
