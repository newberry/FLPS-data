   <p>Mr. Frank J. Petru, a well-known, fearless defender of Bohemian people's rights on the School Board of Cicero, decided, in consequence of pressure put on him by many of his friends and the Bohemian societies, to campaign for the office of the president of this important body, the School Board, again this year. He was a candidate for the same office last year, and for that reason the School Board expelled him from their midst, but later, by a court order, they were forced to reappoint him again. Mr. Frank J. Petru's term, as a member of this School Board, will expire in the month of April this year, and thus following the wishes of many of our countrymen, he will seek the office of the president of the School Board of Cicero.</p>
