   <p>We started a collection recently for the creation of a fund from which tobacco will be provided for our soldiers abroad. Letters from them show that smoking material is hard to obtain.</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Cervenka, clerk of the Probate Court, after receiving some of the letters, offered his personal services for the drive. He collected $176.50, $50 of which he himself donated toward the fund.</p>
