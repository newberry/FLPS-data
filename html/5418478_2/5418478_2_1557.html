   <p>Appeal to the Bohemian-Slovak Falcons in Chicago. Taking in consideration that our adopted country is involved in a war with Spain in the liberation of Cuba, we consider it the duty of Bohemian Falcons to offer their services to the country. All Falcon Organizations of Chicago have held a meeting and resolved to hold one every week at 8 P.M., Thursdays. Special training will be in the hall of Pilsen Falcons. This training will be conducted under English command to prepare the Falcons to be ready in case of need.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all detachment chiefs to execute this resolution at once.</p>
   <p>Signed by the Presidium:</p>
   <p>John Svehla</p>
