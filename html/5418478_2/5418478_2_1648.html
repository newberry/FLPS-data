   <p>Last week we had an opportunity to touch briefly upon a very curious sore spot in our emotional make-up by pointing to a novelty introduced in Chicago this year: The Apple Day for--Horses! At that time we printed only a short item, since there was not enough time for a more thorough consideration of that phenomenon and the preparation of an analytical article on this latest example of emotional exhibitionism.</p>
   <p>Today it is our purpose to deal at some length with Chicago's humaneness and Chicago's charity, and right at the start we do not hesitate to state that they are pervaded with a great deal of morbidness and perversity. The contemplation of daily life shows that, in general, we are far from humane, and that our--perhaps subconscious--realization of that fact on occasions leads to manifestations of grossly exaggerated and distorted forms of humaneness which naturally provoke public merriment and are subject to an abundance of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of more or less funny jokes.</p>
   <p>To meet with misguided forms of humaneness is by no means a rare experience. This kind of charity can be found at all watering troughs for horses where fine ladies, members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, brave rather inclement weather, and hold huge baskets filled with halved apples, which they feed to horses. This frequently turns into forced feeding, which proves that the apples, which were to be a highly welcome, refreshing delicacy for the horses, are not even gratefully received. But the ladies, their minds definitely made up, stuff the horses with them just the same.</p>
   <p>We have no quarrel with the Society. It has a most commendable purpose well-expressed in its name. The existence of the Society tends to prove that we know that an animal, and particularly a horse, is also entitled to kind treatment and gratitude for services rendered to man, a gratitude that would find a poor expression in a lacing with a whip or even a beating with its handle--an occurrence which, alas, we have not too rarely witnessed.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>In cases of that kind, severe intervention by the Society's members against a heartless, merciless offender is most advisable and proper. However, any manifestation of excessive, overdone humaneness toward animals should be discouraged. If there is an excess of emotional urge to do good, it should be directed toward human beings themselves, where it is badly needed and will be fully appreciated. This fact should be borne in mind particularly by women, who, according to a long-established opinion enjoy a much higher emotional development than men. But even such an intensity of feeling as women presumably possess should, like everything else in the world, have its limits. It seems to us that the feeding of apples to horses is a gross overstepping of even rather liberal limits, an overstepping by which humaneness draws its own caricature, and instead of maintaining suitable dignity it becomes rediculous.</p>
   <p>A donkey is known to be most contented when he finds a bunch of juicy thistles. He enjoys thistles more than anything else, because they are most suited to his taste. Man may offer him other plants, even the finest vegetables, but the donkey will not find them as tasty as thistles, and may even refuse them <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>altogether. A horse, again, likes his hay and oats best. Why, then, feed him apples, since he does not care for them and since they are of much greater value to man, especially a poor man, and most particularly to children? We known a large number of poor families in whose homes apples do not appear on the table even once a year, families which would be grateful to anybody for such a delicacy. In streets and alley where peddlers ply their trade, you can daily see children asking them for a little handout and thanking the peddler when he gives them, or rather throws them, a rotten apple. And our ladies distributed many barrels of apples among horses last week. These were fine, healthy apples, too, a pleasure to look at. Had poor children been close enough to witness this distribution, they would surely have envied the horses....</p>
   <p>But even if it was for dumb animals, all that these ladies did was to give vent to an urge which, at least once in a while, penetrates the surface and finds its expression in performing a humane duty. It was not, however, so much for the sake of the animals, as for the sake of newspaper publicity. Such ladies love to see their illustrious names shine in the press on various occasions, but preferably in connection with humaneness and charity. Then <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>people everywhere talk about them reverently and with recognition, and that is worth something. Also, these women feel flattered. But such a lady might not feel so flattered if, while she was all dressed up and feeding apples to horses, an investigator visited her home and upon her return, voiced his candid opinion about her. He would probably have a great deal to say. He might even say that he found that lady's home in disorder, not so very clean, and dilapidated. He might even say that he found her children neglected; that he found them showing too plainly the effects of their mother's charitable, humanitarian, and feminist activities. Because of her catering to horses and other such things, she has no time left to devote to her home and children, that is to those who have the first claim--a much more sacred claim to her attention than horses. Because of cases like this, we see no humaneness, no charitableness in the activities of such women, but rather, husterical emotionalism and perversion.....</p>
   <p>But life shows many more such perversions. There are American charitable organizations disposing of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The money goes kerflooey (sic), and the poor for whom it had been collected get scarcely twenty-five per cent of it, while the rest goes to various officers and <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>employees for whom, in fact, such societies are being organized. Such officers, though frequently well-to-do, do not mind getting rich on money destined for the poor, because their work is not prompted by charity or humaneness, but by selfishness and greed. For the poor, who indirectly swell their [the officers'] bank accounts, they have no genuine and sincere sympathy....</p>
