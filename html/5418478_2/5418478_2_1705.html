   <p>One of our latest Czechoslovak organizations of Chicago came into existence silently and inconspicuously. It is the Jednota Ceskoslovenskych Inzenyru v Americe (Union of Czechoslovak Engineers of America), about which we had occasion to write in one of our previous issues. Originally the Jednota limited its activity to Chicago and its vicinity, but thanks to our daily press, it is now receiving applications for membership from all the large cities of the United States and even from Asia.</p>
   <p>During the past month the Jednota had a visitor from the Philippine Islands in the person of Mr. J. Schneider, a [Czechoslovak] chemical engineer of Manila, in which city Mr. Schneider helped to establish, with the aid of Swiss capital, a huge chemical factory. Schneider has now been recalled to his home country where he is to teach at the Ceska Vysoka Skola <span class="page-break">\2</span>Obchodni (Bohemian High Academy of Commerce), his specialty being the knowledge of goods and materials. The experience which he gained during his stay abroad, particularly in Chicago, will be utilized by him in the education of the young Czechoslovak students of commerce...During his stay in Chicago, Mr. Schneider devoted his time to the study of some of the world-famous plants which are located in our city and which add to the prestige of this city.</p>
   <p>The Jednota conceived the idea of aiding the old homeland by giving it the benefit of the experience gained by Czechoslovak engineers abroad, and now it devotes all its time and energy to this aim. It is understandable that not everybody has a good comprehension of, or sympathy for, a project so new and requiring many sacrifices. So much more commendable, therefore, is the action of our Dr. Jaroslav Smetanka, who immediately perceived and appreciated the importance of this organization, and when a year ago, the Jednota, then a mere handful, had not a penny of capital, he gave permission <span class="page-break">\3</span>to its members to meet in the offices of the Czechoslovak consulate every Friday night, thus insuring the life of that society in its very beginning. Since that time the consulate has been in constant touch with the Jednota, facilitating an interchange of technological intelligence [between the old homeland and the new]. That this interchange is actual is borne out by the fact that two of the Chicago members have already been sent to Czechoslovakia. The first one of these was Mr. jaroslav Franek, and an architect; the second, Mr. Karel Teplan, an engineer. The latter is now on his return journey to Chicago. Thanks to the unselfish efforts of the members of this technical organization, aid is being given to the industries of Czechoslovakia and to her economic independence.....All requests for information concerning technical questions should be addressed to: Jednota Cesko-slovenskych Inzenyru v Americe, 108 South La Salle Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
