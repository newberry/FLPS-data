   <p>We have a habit of picturing Chicago as a Sodom and Gomorrah a place where everything is of the worst. Our people believe that now where else on earth do they have streets in such disorder, or such careless and corrupt officials, and nowhere else is the police force so inefficient, and scoundrels so numerous and bold. If the people in other cities were as candid and critical of their local government as we are, we would learn, that in many respects they are worse off than we. In the "Cream City," charming Milwaukee, the grand jury has just indicted sixty-five county commissioners and city officials, past and present. That such corruption reigned in Milwaukee, the world was oblivicus because Milwaukeeans do not boast about or publicize their shortcomings.</p>
