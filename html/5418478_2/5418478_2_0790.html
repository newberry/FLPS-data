   <p>To the Czech volunteers in the Canadian army somewhere in France:</p>
   <p>Brothers! We felt deeply moved when we read how you have shed your blood for our beloved red and white flag. There was a mass meeting of Czechs and Slovaks in Chicago in the hall of Sokol Havlicek Tyrs yesterday, October 14. Two distinguished guests spoke: Dr. Milan Rastislav Stefanik, vice-president of the Czechoslovak National Council, and Count De Montal, colonel in the aviation corps of the French army. Everyone present rose to honor the memory of Anton Nedelka, a member of the Sokol societies who gave his life for the cause of liberty and fought as a volunteer in France. One hundred men stepped upon the stage, offering themselves for service in the newly created Czechoslovak army to fight for the independence of Czechoslovak lands. You may have heard the glad news that the Government of the United States has given permission to Czechoslovaks in America to unite into an independent <span class="page-break">\2</span>Czechoslovak army which is to go to France and fight under the command of their own officers. Before long we shall join and embrace you. We shall see you again!</p>
