   <p>Although the news concerning German peace overtures to Russia is not official, it has all the earmarks of actuality. Persons of high standing in the Danish court, through whom these overtures are thought to have been made, are denying any knowledge of the affair, but that, after all, is easy to understand. The Danish king, who presumably was the mediator, has certainly done everything to insure secrecy of action. The categorical rejection of these overtures by Russia is the only answer that could be expected. In the first place, none of the European states could expect that a separated. peace with Germany would be permanent, and in the second place, Russia's situation is by no means desperate enough to cause its acceptance of terms which the Kaiser would impose. This, despite the undeniable failures of the Russian army during these last few weeks from the Dunajec retreat to the fall of Warsaw.</p>
   <p>Germany, under the rule of the arrogant descendants of the robber knights of Hohenzollern, has conducted itself in such a manner, since the beginning of the  <span class="page-break">\2</span>war, that none of the Allies must even dare think of a separate peace with the Teutons. To do so would be to deliver Europe into the hands of these savage aggressors, with results such as are demonstrated clearly in Belgium. There are only two possible outcomes of this war: Either Europe will be under the heel of the Hohenzollerns, or else it must destroy them. There is no middle course. A peace under conditions which were proposed by the Kaiser would make him the supreme ruler of the whole continent and, what is more, it would last only until the Teuton pirates were seized by a new desire for conquest and started new aggression. No country in Europe, after what has happened to Belgium, could trust the Kaiser's promises. Since the German Government ventured to disregard the solemn agreement guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality, there is no reason to believe that it would honor any treaty, subsequently concluded. There is absolutely no doubt that, in its desire to control world markets, it would, on the first opportunity, decide to take Holland or some other desirable country.</p>
   <p>But Russia has additional reasons to reject Germany's flirtations. The <span class="page-break">\3</span>principal reason is its determination to make a final and definite accounting with her "dear neighbor," which has always played an ominous role in her foreign and domestic affairs. During her war against Japan, Russia had not suffered losses and failures that were half as great as it has in this war, yet a revolution started shaking the foundations of that colossal country. But now we see that all the misfortunes of the war have only served to fortify the determination of Russia to bring this war to a victorious conclusion. The reason for this is the fact that this is a truly national war. The Russian people feel that this is a deadly battle with its worst enemy. A proclamation credited to General Michnevic, chief of staff of the Russian armies, expresses the attitude and the hopes of Russia:</p>
   <p>"If the Germans choose, they can keep on advancing until the time when Russia will have the material she is now lacking. They will have to fight for every inch of ground that they take, but the Russian army will not be induced to engage in a decisive battle as long as its equipment is not complete. In the meantime they will be leaving the railways farther and farther behind, and will <span class="page-break">\4</span>be obliged to transport every pound of the food they require through devastated lands where, even in times of complete peace and prosperity, there are very few roads, and these are worse than any others in Europe. The only question about which there might have been some doubt was whether or not the Russian spirit was hardy enough to bear all the necessary sacrifices. But all doubts in this respect have been removed. Time is on Russia's side."</p>
   <p>Equally significant was the pronouncement of an important citizen of Moscow in the assembly of the national defense committee. He said that the Russians will retreat, if necessary, even to the Ural Mountains, but they will keep on fighting to the last man.</p>
   <p>The question now being asked throughout Europe is, how far will the Germans desire, and be able, to advance into Russia's interior? It is quite evident today that the Russian army has pulled itself out of the trap prepared by the combined German-Austrian forces, and that it is retreating in complete order, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of its foes in artillery and ammunition, which they <span class="page-break">\5</span>are using most effectively. The apparent danger from the Buelow army in Kuronia seems also to have been averted, at least for the time being, and Riga is breathing easier. Kovno keeps up its resistance and hampers the German advance to Dvinsk and Vilna. The terrain in these parts is extremely difficult to traverse, and makes a rapid advance impossible. The Grand Duke Nicholas no doubt is relying on this circumstance. Innumerable little lakes, rivers, and marshes make the transportation of heavy artillery very hazardous. Infantry and cavalry are only able to advance very slowly.</p>
   <p>The advance of Mackensen's army from Lublin to Brest-Litovsk is also kept in check by strong Russian forces. There is, however, a danger point near Lubartov where, according to Vienna reports--which, by the way, are not very reliable--the Slavic front was broken for twenty-two miles. However, here the Russians are protected by a considerable force which evacuated Ivangorod a little farther southwest, and is now retreating in a northerly direction.</p>
   <p>Another report has the Gallwitz army only ten miles from the Warsaw-St. Petersburg <span class="page-break">\6</span>railway. This force is engaging the Russians on the river Bug near Wyszkow. It is likely, however, that this railway has already served an important purpose by having transported the main body of the Russian army to the secondary defense line; hence the occupation of that railway would be no catastrophe for the Russians. It will take at least a week before the situation in the East will be clarified; but apparently Russia is over the worst part of it, and Berlin's jubilations may have been premature when it saw in the fall of Warsaw hopes for an early peace.</p>
   <p>The Kaiser's pronouncement that the war will end victoriously for Germany, in October has not much probability of fulfillment. The Berlin press is already preparing the public for that disappointment. It is interesting to note that the German newspapers came to that conclusion exactly one day after the absolute refusal of Russia to accept peace overtures had been reported. All in all, the Kaiser's peace proposals are the best indication that Germany does not view the situation so optimistically as she would like to have the world believe, and as her successes on the battle fields seem to warrant.</p>
