   <p>Some of our Czech aid societies and brotherhoods have introduced a system that will give even the poor an opportunity to buy a Liberty bond. The societies will sell Liberty bonds on the installment plan with payments as low as one dollar per week. Of course, no one can fairly expect to receive the bond before it is paid up, and therefore it will begin to bear interest when it is paid in full.</p>
