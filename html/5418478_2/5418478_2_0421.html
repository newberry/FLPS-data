   <p>"Fellow countrymen, brothers:</p>
   <p>"The Government of the United States is issuing Liberty bonds. It is the duty of Czechs and Slovaks to support the Liberty Loan with utmost endeavor.</p>
   <p>"The United States and President Wilson have treated our nation nobly. They recognized our efforts to win liberty and independence. We shall reciprocate by gratitude. And, doubly grateful, we can and must accept the democratic principles, for ending the war and a permanent peace, so fortunately promulgated by President Wilson. The better Americans, the better Czechs and Slovaks you will be!</p>
   <p>"Washington, August 1918.</p>
