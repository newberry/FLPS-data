   <p>Chicago opened its campaign for the floating of the Fourth Liberty Loan yesterday. Even the first hours indicated that the populace is fully conscious of its duty and will fulfill it...judging by the initial sales, it is estimated that about forty millions' worth of bonds were sold in Chicago.....</p>
   <p>Hectic activity characterized the campaign substations in the Czechoslovak districts. Long before the sirens began to sound, announcing the start of the drive, all the campaign offices in the settlement were crowded with people who offered their services as workers. The rush reached a climax in the main Czechoslovak campaign office at 3342 West 26th Street, where Mr. Anton J. Cermak, Alderman Joseph I. Novak, and Mr. Louis Solar were receiving applications for campaign work, and directing workers to their places. Mr. Cermak, at the same time, was receiving reports from the various substations. Many of these messages were highly gratifying. One, for instance, coming from Alderman Joseph O. Kostner of the Thirty-fourth Ward, expressed pleasant surprise and much satisfaction for the intelligent views our Czechoslovak fellow countrymen have of the meaning of the Liberty Loan, and their response to the call of duty. The campaign station for that district is located in the recruiting office for the 83rd district, at West 26th Street and Ridgeway Avenue. It had a full quota of volunteer campaign workers who were busy collecting subscriptions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph A. Brabec, head of the Czechoslovak organization of the Tenth Ward, was next to call Mr. Cermak about the throngs in and around his campaign office at 1428 West 18th Place.</p>
   <p>The office of the Fourth Ward is located at 555 West 31st Street. Its head is Mr. J. Chap. He reported that his station had been busy from early morning. Mr. Joseph Ringl, head of the Czechoslovak Bureau, 4564 North Crawford Avenue, was greatly pleased with the beginning of the drive. He, however, voiced a complaint about large concerns which are compelling workers to buy bonds through their own channels. Bonds bought at those sources by Czechoslovaks will not be credited to them. By buying bonds from outsiders we are fulfilling our duty just as well, true enough. We should, however, keep in mind that we are Czechoslovaks, and must, as such, seek to win recognition for our patriotic zeal everywhere and under any conditions.</p>
   <p>Be mindful, therefore, to write the word "Czechoslovak" on every bond you buy through outside agencies. Write that word yourself, and in case you are not allowed to do so, then simply do not buy the bond. We doubt, however, that anybody would try to prevent you from writing your nationality upon the bond.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak campaign office for the Twenty-ninth Ward, conducted by Mr. Felix B. Janovsky, is located at 1824 West 47th Street and a very good start is reported on the first campaign day.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Frank W. Jedlicka, head of the Fifteenth Ward office, 916 North Western Avenue, feels confident of success in his district.</p>
   <p>A large tribune was erected in front of the main campaign office, 3342 West 26th Street. A band played and speakers addressed the crowds. Mr. Cermak sent out several hundred young men and women to various banks and business houses, where they will have stands to sell bonds.</p>
   <p>It will interest our readers to learn that our Catholic communities are vigorously pushing sales. Reports have been received from the Reverend Bozenek, chaplain of Saint Ludmila Church. An office has been opened in the parish at the home of Mr. Stach, at 2419 South Albany Avenue. Special credit is given to Miss Otilia Pechousek, who delivered subscriptions for $1,500 worth of bonds to the priest at an early hour.</p>
   <p>Let us mention that the platform in front of the main campaign office was erected, and dismounted after the ceremonies, by several volunteer workers, and that other expenses were defrayed by businessmen of the neighborhood.</p>
