   <p>While we Czechs welcome the entrance of the United States into the war against Austria - Hungary, our brothers, the Slovaks, rejoice at the good tidings just as much as we. This is evident from an address delivered by Mr. Jamarik at a mass demonstration held recently in the Pilsen Brewery Park.</p>
   <p>The American people know of the raving Teutons and of their murderous deeds. They learn of them daily through the press. Yet the American public has been very tolerant toward the Magyars. There are still too many people here who consider them to be "a chivalrous nation". People who are acquainted with the rotten conditions in Austria - Hungary must have felt their stomachs turn at hearing with what exaggerated politeness and even fawning the Hungarian magnate Count Apponyi was received during his visit to the United States. "The Bloody Count" was hailed as the incarnate angel of peace and an exalted <span class="page-break">2</span>protagonist of democracy.</p>
   <p>By their actions, the interpreters of public opinion and "spokesmen of the people" gave a glaring exhibition of their limited knowledge. Certainly, if there is in Europe a nation that is devoid of all humane feeling and that has perpetrated hideous crimes, then the Magyars are to be mentioned first. Their country is the realm of hell-fire. The revolution in 1848 threw into their lap much more than was rightfully theirs. Selfishness was victorious that time and the Magyars knew how to take advantage of those conditions. They did it in their own cunning and subtle manner. The nation that craves freedom only in order to be able only to subjugate and to oppress other nations and that accomplishes this by every means, no matter how bloody, must be called selfish.</p>
   <p>All that Americans know of the Magyars dates back to the year 1848, the year of their revolution. Everything that concerns the true character of these Huns is proverbially "all Greek" to Americans. We hope that more may <span class="page-break">3</span>be learned of these people now that war has been declared. The people of the United States have to be informed, in order to learn that the Magyars are to blame for all that was pernicious in the dual monarchy in the first place. They worked together with the Germans and were the strongest pillar of the houses of Hapsburg and Hohenzollern. If the Americans could gain an insight into the pages of terror and misery that the Slovaks had to endure under the Magyar yoke, they would regard that "chivalrous nation" differently. They would arrive at the conclusion that the Germans are wronged when they are described as human beasts whose misdeeds cannot be outdone by any other nation.</p>
   <p>Information of this kind should be furnished by Czechs, Slovaks, and all Slavs in general, and it should comprise even the most minute details. The time to do this is more propitious now than it ever will be again.</p>
