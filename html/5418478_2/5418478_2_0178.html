   <p>Most interesting to us is who will be the candidates in the Czech wards. In the Tenth Ward, the incumbent Alderman Frank J. Vavrícek is again seeking the nomination and is supported by the Sullivan faction. The Harrison faction has three candidates. They are James McNichols, our countryman Charles Michal, and Charles Byrnes. In the Eleventh Ward there are thus far only two candidates in the field, and both are adherents of Mayor Harrison, former Alderman Peter L. Hoffman, and Mr. Frank Brewersdorf. In the Twelfth Ward, on the Democratic ticket, there is only one candidate, the incumbent Alderman Anton J. Cermák, whereas the Republicans have two candidates: Albert Kríha, supported by Governor Deneen's faction; Joseph Capek, candidate of the Lorimer organization and of the Lincoln Protective League. In the Twentieth Ward, formerly the Ninth, opposing each other, are the incumbent Alderman Henry L. Fick and our countryman Hugo L. Pitte; the latter is the Harrison candidate. As yet the Republican candidate has not appeared.</p>
   
   <p>In the Thirty-fourth Ward, a fierce struggle for the Democratic nomination is taking place. Almost all of the candidates are Czechs. Mr. John Toman, who is employed by the Public Library, is the candidate of the Harrison faction; Karel Rada is supported by former State Senator Cyril R. Jandus and is considered a candidate of the Sullivan faction; Alderman Ryan, an adherent of the same group, is supporting Mr. Joseph Kacena. Also campaigning are Karel Vesely and Winfiel Held, both of whom are said to belong to the Sullivanites.</p>
