   <p>It is imperative that large numbers of us join the Red Cross in order to support that humanitarian institution which has done a great deal for us. We owe it gratitude for, from the beginning of the World War, it has saved the lives of thousands of our fellow-countrymen who fought on European battlefields. It has also taken care of the delivery of packages to our wounded soldiers. The Red Cross has accomplished admirable work in the medical field especially in combating the typhoid epidemic in the soldiers' camps in Serbia. It helped the wounded, the sick and the starving in prison camps. Special mention must be made of the care with which money affairs were handled.</p>
   <p>The Red Cross is making preparations to extend its activities. Like any <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>other benevolent group, it needs a great deal of money for its work. Without money no activity is possible. It is absolutely necessary that we become members; one or two dollars will not impoverish anyone.</p>
   <p>Our boys have enlisted for service, not only in Uncle Sam's, but also in the Canadian armies. Membership in the Red Cross does not exact from us service at the front, but it will ask our financial assistance whenever it is needed. In earlier wars women played the role of the bereaved. Today, however, when women compete with men in commerce, industry, and education, it is her duty to participate also with the men who have had to remain at home. Women can be employed in factories manufacturing war supplies, in kitchens, and in offices doing the clerical work necessary for the carrying-on of the war .....</p>
   <p>The Red Cross is now organizing classes for men and women where instruction <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is given in the required work. In the Czech branch, which has been founded by women members of the Sokol gymnastic societies and by zealous workers of other Czech organizations, there will be taught besides somatology, physiology, dietetics, food preparation, sanitation and hygiene. One of the main subjects of course, will be the handling of hospital materials. There will be booklets, issued by the Red Cross headquarters, for supplementary instruction; these will be bought by the Czech branch out of its own funds.</p>
   <p>The Czech Red Cross schools are located in the headquarters of the Sokol Chicago and Havlicek Tyrs Sokol gymnastic societies. Students must be at least sixteen years of age. The lectures will be held on Wednesday and Friday evenings. Doctors A. Mueller and L. Fisher are in charge. Additional courses will be opened in Town of Lake or in Cicero if there is sufficient demand for them. A minimum of twenty students will form one class. Examinations will be held under the supervision of an inspector <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>from the Red Cross headquarters, and medals will be awarded to honor students. Instruction is given in both the English and Czech languages.</p>
   <p>We cannot imagine a nobler task for women to help alleviate the sufferings of those who are today combating mankind's worst enemy, militarism and the Kaiser's lust for expansion. There is only one way to annihilate this hydra, and that is through struggle against it. That this may be accomplished with the minimum of suffering, the Red Cross, which cares for our soldiers at the front, should receive our wholehearted support.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. Rudíš Jičinský.</p>
