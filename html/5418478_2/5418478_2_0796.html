   <p>The executive committee of the Czech division for the increase of Liberty bond sales held its meeting in the hall of Sokol Chicago, 24th Street and South Kedzie Avenue, last Monday. Mr. Anton J. Cermak presided. In spite of the rainy weather, the attendance was large. The reports of the individual workers and teams were highly encouraging and demonstrated the feverish zeal with which the workers went about their task. It is expected that final accounts will show that the amount expended by Chicago Czechs will exceed one million dollars for the Second Liberty Loan, the same amount as for the First Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>These two million dollars demonstrate that the Czechs stand in first place among other nationalities of Chicago.</p>
   <p>[A list of firms, organizations and individuals who bought bonds follows.]</p>
