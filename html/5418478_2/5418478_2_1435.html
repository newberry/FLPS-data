   <p>No matter what you say, the European war is proving most beneficial for America. America has been taking notice of Europe in order to catch up on her knowledge of the Continent, knowledge that was being sadly neglected, and also on her knowledge of each of Europe's several countries. Up to the outbreak of the war, this knowledge was very meager, not only in the case of the "man on the street" but also among the educated classes....That this is the case may be proved by many a funny story our university professors could tell....</p>
