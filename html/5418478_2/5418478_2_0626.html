   <p>The pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery Park was the scene of the annual Czech saloonkeepers ball last night. This is an occasion known among us for its congenial atmosphere. The visitors enjoyed the entertainment without allowing themselves to be in the least disturbed by the threatening danger of prohibition.</p>
   <p>Mr. William K. Pflaum solicited purchases of war-savings stamps, and was successful in selling five hundred dollars worth. County Judge Thomas Scully and Mr. Souhrada, a saloonkeeper from Racine Avenue, gave his collection a strong boost by buying a hundred dollars' worth of stamps each. Mr. Pflaum is a member of our committee for the advancement of stamp sales.</p>
