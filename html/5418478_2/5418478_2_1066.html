   <p>The military committee of the Bohemian National Alliance and the Sokol community in America, as well as the representatives of Czech-American volunteers, have begun their activities with great success, namely; the permission for Czech and Slovaks to enlist in one and the same regiment if they enlist in Chicago. Military authorities are now being requested to permit the enlistment of the Czech volunteers from all over the United States into one regiment.</p>
   <p>Brethren! In a time when the United States is entering a War for the freedom of the small nations, the Czecho-Slovaks must demonstrate that they are brought up in the very principles upon which the United States is founded, and that they are willing to make sacrifices necessary to <span class="page-break">2</span>uphold the great ideals of democracy.</p>
   <p>Our peoples have been hardened in a century long struggle against the overwhelming numbers of an enemy to whom they could resist by their pertinacity and unflinching courage only. This is our opportunity. The sacrifices in blood and material goods which thousands of our men will make are sure to bring results: The liberation of our people.</p>
   <p>"Now or never" is the slogan of our determined youth, who are about to enlist in the Czecho-Slovak regiment.</p>
   <p>"Now or never" is the slogan of all of us, regardless of party, class or creed, to make sure that in a short time the first Czecho-Slovak regiment be formed in Chicago.</p>
   <p>All the societies, associations, and clubs are urged to work diligently, <span class="page-break">3</span>taking the names of all men willing to enlist. Our committee on recruiting will gladly give all information desired.</p>
   <p>Signed: The military committee of the Bohemian National Alliance, and of the Sokol community in America.</p>
