   <p>Almost every member of the Beseda (Club) Friƒç who is not bound to serve in Uncle Sam's Army or Navy will join the French Army in order to help in the conquest of that murderer, the German. This is an example of the purest and most sacrificing patriotism. If these members joined the United States Army, they would not be sure that they would meet the Teuton face to face, for some military units will have to remain in this country. If, on the other hand, they join the Czech Army in France, they will have a chance to fight and to die for what is most sacred to every Czech heart and for what our new homeland is fighting. The Beseda Fric has accomplished very much in these times for the Czech people, Czech soldiers, and Czech prisoners. This club is now crowning its work in the most splendid manner. Oh, how we wish that there were more such sturdy lads among Chicago Czechs to enlist for France, since they are not bound to serve in Uncle Sam's Army! We wish that there were hundreds and thousands of them!</p>
