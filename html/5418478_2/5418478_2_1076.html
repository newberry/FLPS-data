   <p>What a great difference between Theodore Roosevelt and William J. Bryan! Roosevelt demanded right in the beginning of the War that America join the Allies and he is now making efforts to gain permission to recruit a division. Bryan, on the other hand, with the patience of a lamb, did everything to prevent the participation of America in the War. He is trying to make good now and to contribute one lonely drop by offering himself to the Army where, he says, he would enlist as a recruit.</p>
