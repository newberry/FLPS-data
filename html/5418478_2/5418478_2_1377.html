   <p>It is with the keenest interest that we await the action President Wilson will take to express the sentiment of the whole American nation over the terrible crime the Germans have committed by sinking the "Lusitania". We trust that the President will show the Teutons that our republic knows its rights and that it is prepared to defend them by any and all means. Mr. Wilson is a statesman of considerable repute, a man of keen intellect, a great patriot, and a genuine humanitarian. All this gives us the assurance that he will find the proper way of defending not only the United States, but the whole civilized world against the depredations of the madmen who started this war, and have turned it into an uninterrupted series of crimes against everything that the rest of humanity considers right and just.</p>
