   <p>In a time when the inalienable rights of this new homeland of ours are jeopardized, there appears on the horizon the duty to defend the liberty of this country. We are calling on all members of the Sokol community to rally around the American flag, as it behooves model citizens to be ready for any sacrifice for the good of this great republic. The Sokols are to stand for the principles of humanity and equal rights as promulgated firmly and clearly by President Wilson.</p>
   <p>We Czechs feel the great responsibility resting upon our government, which has made every effort to secure peace, but in case of war, we will fully grasp the importance of the duties towards this country.</p>
   <p>We stand united behind our President, and we offer him our strong arms in the fight for the principles of this country, which are identical with <span class="page-break">\2</span>those of the small nations subjugated now. The Czech nation has spilled rivers of blood already in the interest of humanity and its liberty. Czech Sokols are fighting in the ranks of the English, French, and Russian legions. We Czechs have renounced allegiance to the government which oppresses our nation, and have become proud citizens of this great free republic to which we feel bound by the sacred bonds of obligation as to the mighty protector of the small nations.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, urge all members of the Sokol organization to make an appearance at our stations to be recruited into the "Sokol Legion" which is being organized in every corner of the United States. (List of cities where the first stations are located is given.)</p>
   <p>The Sokol organizations have been founded as a nucleus for a future Czech national army, and so our people have become accustomed to look to them with genuine pride. The people see their salvation in the national spirit <span class="page-break">\3</span>instilled into the Sokols.</p>
   <p>We are confident that our fellow-countrymen will not fail us, and shall prove that they are willing to sacrifice their whole being for the welfare of our new homeland, which is the most beautiful, the most valiant, and the holiest of all others.</p>
