   <p>The citizens of the Town of Lake have an example of how our streets and other public property are utilized. Alderman Carey, who is one of the most renowned "foxes" in the city council, is the proprietor of the brickyard on Robey Street. So that he could more easily transport clay, he arranged for his colleague, Hart, to introduce an ordinance by which permission was granted to lay rails on Robey Street south to 47th Street. No one knew, that anything of the kind had happened until the rails were being hurriedly laid. The owners of homes on Robey Street and in the neighborhood protested against such damage to the value of their property. They wrote a resolution quickly and sent a delegation, which went from one honorable gentleman to another, but it was all in vain. They had no other recourse except to go to the courts. This is what the Bohemians and Polish in the Town of Lake get for sticking with the ward political crowd. If they joined together and agreed on some candidate from their midst, it would be impossible for anything of the kind to happen as is happening with Robey Street and with the interests of the people settled there.</p>
