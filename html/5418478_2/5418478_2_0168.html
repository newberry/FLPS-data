   <p>The election held in Cicero, Illinois, last Saturday, brought gratifying results to our people--three Czechs were elected to the School Board. They are John F. Slapak, president; [Frank] J. Petru and F. J. Blaha.</p>
   <p>Mr. Slapak has held this office for several years; his re-election proves that he has conducted the affairs of the Board in a satisfactory manner. Mr. Petru, who is a prosperous businessman, was elected to the School Board for three years. Mr. Blaha has been a member of the Board for several years. Czech voters played an important part in this election.</p>
