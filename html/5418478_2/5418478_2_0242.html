   <p>Yesterday the judicial committee which investigated the charges preferred by William N. Gemmill, Judge of the Municipal Court, against chief bailiff Anton J. Cermak submitted its final report to the plenary meeting of the associate judges. The findings of the committee completely justified Mr. Cermak's conduct of his office, and termed Judge Gemmill's accusations groundless vilifications. The judges unanimously adopted the report. Judge Gemmill was absent. Harry Olson, Chief Justice of the Municipal Court, who presided over this meeting, called for another plenary meeting in which Judge Gemmill is expected to appear so that the votes of all the judges may be recorded.</p>
   <p>Judge Goodnow, who read the report, stated that 138 witnesses had been heard and 100 items of evidence submitted to the judicial investigating committee. In no instance could the charges made by Judge Gemmill be substantiated. The sensational accusations were found not to contain a trace of truth.</p>
