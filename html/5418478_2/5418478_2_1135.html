   <p>More than two years ago a tiny group of patriotic Czechs met in Cleveland, and here, in deadly fear for the fate of the old homeland, raised their voices in an appeal to the American fellow-countrymen of their own kind. It was a clarion call of blood and love, of brotherhood and <span class="page-break">\2</span>conscience, which reverberated from East to West. It was an outcry filled with pain, which bore the anxious and urgent message: "Children! Help the native land!"</p>
   <p>The echo of the call took root in thousands of souls of the loyal Czech people. Their undying love and undaunted courage led them resolutely over obstacles and antagonism. Toil and trouble built up our strength, and gave power to our ranks. Doubts about the value of our work and our efforts dispersed like vapors before the rising sun.</p>
   <p>And when the rays of the sun really broke through the bloody mist over the East, when we heard the solemn message from nations to nations, that message which resounded through the world, which over-came the peals of the cannons and superimposed itself over the horrible wounds of the battlefields, our sore eyes saw, and we learned, that by <span class="page-break">\3</span>the will of the Allied powers, liberty shall be won for the Czecho-Slovak people also. How many eyes were filled with tears, how many hearts throbbed with the emotion of purest joy?</p>
   <p>We stand for the second time, today, before the forum of Czech-America, and in its name, and with its whole heart, we rally shoulder to shoulder, fully conscious of these fateful times, behind our President. He has lifted the principles of humanitarianism and the rights of the small nations upon his shield of sacred law and honest dealing among the nations. The Czech people turn to him as to its President, grateful for his message to the civilized world, firmly determined to support him, even when he raises his sword for the defense of human principles and civilization for which Europe is bleeding.</p>
   <p>We acknowledge with sincere gratitude the moral and financial support <span class="page-break">\4</span>given to us. We call to you: "Brethren! We have covered only half the stony road that leads to our great goal. Be men, and persevere in your work! A man will not quit the post to which he was assigned. By sheer necessity, he is bound to endure the stress. And you are men indeed. A Czech does not, and shall not, desert his own nation. We appeal to you, our friends, our associations, to you workingmen, our brethren: It was your callous hands that laid down the hard earned penny upon the altar of the fatherland. Even the poorest man had his heart in the right spot in the darkest hour of his native land - and he did his bit. We do not have to ask him any more, for we know that he will do the duty he has taken upon his weary shoulders."</p>
   <p>The work done up to now was mainly of a financial nature. From now on, however, it will be necessary to make our purposes known to the broader masses and speak, so to say, "to the heart of the Republic." It is incumbent upon every individual, as well as upon organizations, <span class="page-break">\5</span>to make America acquainted with the salient points of our efforts.</p>
   <p>Do not waver in the struggle. Fight on to exhaustion, and we will be heading towards a better future of our nation. Let the slogan of our dear leader, Thomas G. Masaryk, be our slogan: "Forward for persistent fruitful work for the liberty of the nation!"</p>
   <p>Czech people! Mayest thou be true to thyself, strong and healthy!</p>
