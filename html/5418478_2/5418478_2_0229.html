   <p>Our great ladies' organizations, recognizing the importance of today's registration of voters and the November election, ask their members not to fail to register today. They fully endorse the candidacy of Alderman Anton J. Cermak. As we have previously announced the endorsement was made by the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union). Today we were informed that the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) likewise endorsed the candidacy of Mr. Cermak. A resolution of the Sisterhood mentions the fact that the president of the County Board of Commissioners is in charge of the Cook County Hospital, the Oak Forest Infirmary and Old People's Home, the County Agent's office from which indigent families are cared for, and the mothers' pension. Should Mr. Cermak be elected to this highly important office, it would certainly be profitable to all. For this reason all members of the Sesterska Jednota are advised to have their votes registered today in order to vote on November 7.</p>
