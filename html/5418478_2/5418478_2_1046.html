   <p>The proclamation of War has brought about changed conditions. Among these is a threatening dearth of field produce. The importance of intensive culture of wheat by the farmers and of vegetables by truck gardeners is growing paramount. It is admitted throughout the country that the situation is not to be trifled with if the United States is not to find itself in dire need of foodstuffs during the next winter. There is insufficient help on the farms, and the authorities are doing all within their power to induce workers to leave town for the rural districts.</p>
   <p>High school students in our city will be urged to hire themselves out into the farm districts surrounding Chicago for the summer season. Credit will be given to them for a certain time missed in the school. Many lots are offered to the pupils, who may select those that are located nearest to their homes.</p>
