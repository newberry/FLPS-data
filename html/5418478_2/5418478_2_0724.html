   <p>Any man with an ounce of reason would doubt that there are still some people to be found who are Czechs--for they know only the Czech language--yet think that their homeland was not the kingdom of Bohemia, but the monarchy of Austria. Their souls, full of the slave spirit, have not freed themselves of the shackles, though they have been enjoying American liberty for many years. These Czechs are giving proof of this even now, at the time of the declaration of war against Austria.</p>
   <p>Those people are molesting us with anonymous letters in which they claim that war against Austria is tantamount to war against our own Czech people. Their browbeaten minds are not capable of taking a loftier stand. There is no way of helping that sort of people; they are hopeless cases.</p>
