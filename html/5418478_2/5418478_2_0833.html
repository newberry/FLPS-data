   <p>Let us not forget our boys in the training camps. Let us write to them as often as possible. Nothing can give them more joy than word from home. The letters should contain news that will cheer them up. Send them good news only, even if you must force yourself to do so.</p>
   <p>Our old proverb, "Military life is a gay life," may be true to a certain extent; yet it is necessary to keep our boys in as pleasant a mood as possible.</p>
