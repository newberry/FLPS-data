   <p>To be a politican is with every citizen who understands politics a serious business. It creates respect, dignity and character; in general it makes the man.</p>
   <p>It is flattering and pleasant to sit among the leaders in political meetings, to be able to speak before others, to be welcomed with eagerness and expectation, to be the leader of the thought of those other non-political dullards or indifferent citizens, to whom there can be occasionally made when elections require it, nice speeches, in which the opposition is roundly berated and the favored candidates greatly praised, and some trumps played to flatter the poor foolish people, several thrusts can be made against the powerful and the wealthy, so it will appear we are in a free country and no one will make anything of it, thus we have a politician and that which he does is called politics, yes high politics. What are the purposes and principles of this kind of politics? Not one of these politicians asks or cares about that. He is simply a politician, he works for some candidate of his party. Does he receive any pay? No, he even helps pay the expenses of the election in the expectation of some other kind of reward or favor. From force of habit he <span class="page-break">2</span>will berate the opposition party according to what he has learned from his party literature and no more. To inquire further as to the principles of such politics, what they lead to, and whether they are for the benefit of the people; does not enter such a politician's mind.</p>
   <p>Let us examine a little more closely these politicians and their brand of politics. We shall learn how much despised is the citizen, who blindly goes along with his party, from force of habit, who allows himself to be threatened by the politicians as though his redemption depended upon that particular party. Just what is this American system of politics, either Republican or Democratic, other than the defense and upholding of the interests of the ruling classes, the capitalistic groups and their methods for the oppression of all who are dependent on them? We have in the United States a ruling class and a laboring class. The politics of both the major political parties tends only to preserve and protect the interests of the oppressive ruling classes. Nowhere, not even in Congress or the various State Legislatures nor in the City Councils is anything done by which the interests of the laboring classes would be protected. It seems as though this class, has no rights, needs no consideration, has no needs and no desires.- <span class="page-break">3</span>even so a just government should strive to benefit and satisfy the majority of its citizens. Both of the national parties make use of shameful hypocrisy for the accomplishment of their aims, namely, that all their laws and efforts pretend always to be for the protection of freedom and rights of the masses but ordinarily all their laws for the preservation of this freedom prove to be the opposite thereof, and if by any chance this law should happen to be good then they disregard it and let it become a dead letter. Therefore the people again have nothing by which they may benefit. That is politics and to that end the politicians labor. Both the political parties of the country set up platforms made up of the old worn out empty phrases, absolutely meaningless, promising nothing, in fact accomplishing nothing. They decorate them with nice flattering rhetoric for their own party and abuse and reproach for the other party. Then they add a promise of good times to come as soon as the party and its candidates are elected. This then is called politics. The politician who knows how to picture it, knows how to be non-committal, knows how to <span class="page-break">4</span>pass out a great deal of nonsense, both national and political, is then in a position to be among the leaders and may seek some office to repay him for the many years of loyal service he gave to his party. The citizens then accept these same platforms as though they were some kind of valuable jewels, entitled to respect and veneration like some holy writ; they dont realize that by means of these smooth artifices they are led by these same political leaders, to vote for them, thereby helping them to attain some office which they have probably sought for years. This is politics as played by politicians. It is politics, to endeavor to hold an independent people in spiritual dependence and submission to the high political leaders. All of which, called humbug in America, is the privilege of politicians.</p>
   <p>What are the politics of the laboring class against these conditions? Their politics are not primarily to seek personal profit and benefit or election to some office, but to endeavor first of all to bring about that equality and justice for all who are now being ground down by oppression under the present system. Labors politics must refrain from all political humbug and underhandedness and must endeavor <span class="page-break">5</span>toward, education and enlightenment, the emancipation from subjection, the spiritual awakening of independent thought on political matters in order to recognize the causes of unrest and dissatisfaction among the people and to work for the accomplishment of means to bring about the equality and justice so necessary to the peace and satisfaction of all the people.</p>
   <p>Labor politics consider all previous major political parties as a drawback to progress. Therefore it must not lower itself to the same trickery and machination which they used to carry out their principles.</p>
   <p>To join with them would be to lower and destroy the principles of justice and equality. Labor's politics must overcome all that is evil and unjust no matter where it is found and support all things that are just and for the benefit of all . For these reasons any sensible man may support the labor party for the interests of this party are the interests of all honest people whether they be laborers, mechanica, businessmen or farmers.</p>
