   <p>One maniac has caused many people to go wild. The English general of raving women, or so-called fighting suffragettes, Mrs. Emily Pankhurst, has not yet put a foot on American soil and has already caused a mighty uproar throughout the country. Now, if Mr. Wilson does not show a sufficient degree of firmness, and if he should be scared by the thousands of protests he has been receiving from all parts of the world, we here in America can expect some beautiful samples of what England has at home. All he has to do is yield a bit--and we shall have it.</p>
   <p>Our American women are getting their suffrage rapidly, and there is no doubt that they will have it in all states of the Union within a few years. So far they have not needed any help from English incendiaries. American men have earned the full recognition, appreciation, or at least the thanks of American women for their attitude toward woman suffrage. Instead of that, a much-divorced millionairess, Mrs. Belmont of New York, has invited the general of English raving maniacs to this country and expects to accompany her on a tour through the United States, during which time she (Mrs. Pankhurst) plans to teach American women how to commit such crimes as her supporters are in the habit of staging in England--all this just to create a sensation which would give Mrs. Belmont the much-desired publicity and renown.</p>
   <p>Now, as the police authorities of New York have detained Pankhurst in the port and are planning to deport her--the crime for which she was sentenced in England involved moral turpitude--she is receiving protection from women like Miss Addams and other really distinguished ladies who deserve much more credit for their work in the interest of woman suffrage than this frenzied English hag. And it is just here where the danger lies. If our Government lets Pankhurst in, her friends will proclaim her a martyr, sufferer for feminine rights, and the consequences of such a move are impossible to estimate. If she is to be admitted eventually, the immigration office should never have detained her in the port, but should have paid no attention to her and let her in quietly, without any ado.</p>
   
   <p>Since they have detained her, it is almost imperative that she should be sent back immediately, because now her stay in the United States will have most far-reaching consequences. All friends of the movement for woman suffrage agree with Miss Addams, who said that the invitation to Pankhurst asking her to come to America, was a serious mistake which will greatly harm the cause of women's rights. But the raving maniac is a woman, and if treated unjustly, she will have everybody on her side.</p>
   <p>With all that, it should be borne in mind that she has not come to lecture in America for the love of her sisters or for the love of her principles, but she has come because she expects to be paid good money. She is assured five hundred dollars for every speech. She has not come to deliver and liberate her hard-working sisters, but to make money for herself and to give sensational publicity to a millionairess with several living husbands.</p>
