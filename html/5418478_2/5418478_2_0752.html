   <p>The pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery Park was filled to capacity by an enthusiastic multitude last night. Czechs and Slovaks were hosts to representatives of the heroic French nation, from whom they heard how the fondest hopes and most cherished aspirations of the oppressed are winning sympathy in places of the highest authority and influence. They came to learn that the plan for the creation of an independent Czechoslovak state is being given serious consideration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Marcel Knecht, representative of the French National Council, and Abb√© Souris, field chaplain in the French Army, were the guests. They are both sincere friends of the Czechoslovaks, and particularly closely acquainted with Czech Sokols. The ardor with which they were acclaimed proved that <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>yesterday's mass meeting was but another link in the long chain of Czecho-French relations.</p>
   <p>It was 8:45 P.M. when the French patriots entered the densely crowded pavilion. They were accompanied by leaders of the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. They were greeted by the strains of the "Marseillaise," played by Rubringer's Band. The multitude pressed toward the platform where the guests stood amid thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>After the acclaim had subsided, Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, presented Messrs. Knecht and Souris as our rare and highly esteemed guests and precious friends of the Czechoslovaks. He emphasized the fact that our people owe them a great debt for having so efficiently brought our hopes and aspirations, with respect to the liberation of our old homeland, to the attention and consideration of the world forum.</p>
   <p>Dr. Fisher dwelt upon an historic reminiscence: He spoke of the time of the general rally which was held at Prague by all Slavonic gymnastic organizations <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>from Slavonic and foreign lands. There was a spontaneous demonstration in the square in front of the city hall of Prague. It was at the same place where, three hundred years ago, the Czech people received a cruel blow--and there our old glory flamed up again. Among the many foreign guests it was the French group that was conspicuous by its numbers. There was no World War that time, and nobody knew yet that a people of six millions would rise from the German flood like a solitary island and fight for what little liberty it desires to obtain. We were not known; our enemies placed all sorts of obstacles before us. While we beat our skulls against a wall, the rest of the world knew nothing about us.</p>
   <p>The speaker continued, pointing to France as the first country to embrace our country with sympathy--our forsaken country, which its own poets counselled "not to trust in anyone because we have not one friend in this wide world". It was France, that great, new, strong republic, proudly conscious of its might, which stemmed the tide of the Germanic hordes on the banks of the Marne, at a time when the latter were sneaking in like snakes to sink their venomous fangs into that country's very heart. This same France was the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>first to emphasize our demands. Therefore, we in America also hasten to bring our sacrifice under the leadership of the Stars and Stripes, while our men are fighting upon the soil of France to bring to a realization the prophetic slogan of our great national bard, Svatopluk Cech: "Na Lebky Katu...." (Smite the skulls of the henchmen.....) These last words, as well as the entire brief address by Dr. Fisher, inspired the crowd with enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knecht, introduced by Dr. Fisher, took the platform. Although he has a pronounced French accent, he used good grammar, so that he was easily understood. He was interrupted by bursts of applause. He expressed regret at not being able to speak to us in our own melodic language, and he offered this explanation in a very sympathetic manner. The Czechs, he said, have been studying the French language eagerly and learning it so quickly that the French, seeing that things were made so easy for them,simply settled down comfortably and did not cultivate the Czech language. The speaker hinted here at the great popularity among Czechs of the French language, which a strong percentage of our people speak almost as well as the German language, the latter having been forced down our throats in the public schools.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The purpose of Mr. Knecht's coming to us was indicated in the speaker's first words: To convey to us the greetings of the entire French Republic. This declaration evoked stormy acclaim. Mr. Knecht assured us that the French are very well informed about us. They know our history, he said, and our struggle with the savage enemy of all mankind--the beastly Germans, who wonder why, after centuries of efforts, they could not crush us.</p>
   <p>Our French guest related his experiences gained during his travels in the northwestern states of the Union. He found all the Czechs doing their duty by attending patriotic meetings, etc. The French visitors were received with manifestations of good will and rising enthusiasm. The speaker carried away the impression that the American people are wholeheartedly for the cause and determined to stand by the Stars and Stripes. Even some states that were doubtful a few months ago, since they are densely populated by the German element, have, by degrees, changed their minds and finally proclaimed themselves to be on the side of the democracies.</p>
   <p>The speaker brought German propaganda into the limelight. One of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>favorite arguments of the rabid pro-Germans is that France is weakening rapidly, and that she is bled white by now as a result of losses in this war. Mr. Knecht refuted this contention in a very apt manner. France could muster only one and a half million men at the beginning of the War. Yet now, while there are innumerable widows all over the country, his government has at least two and a half million men under arms--all of them determined to see the enemy conquered. At the beginning of the war, France was able to manufacture ammunition for only 1,500 cannon shots per day. At present, he said, his country can produce 2,500,000 missiles. This is due to the fact that new plants have been erected in locations where none existed before, while at the beginning of the War most of the French plants were located inside the present German lines.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Knecht reminded the audience in enthusiastic terms of the visit paid to France by the Czech Sokol societies, and of the brotherly associations perpetuated between the two nations for many years. He assured us that common sufferings will strengthen the ties existing between the Czechs and <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>the French. He paid homage to Professor T. G. Masaryk and Dr. Milan R. Stefanik, Czech leaders; he also spoke highly of General Pershing, commander-in-chief of the American expeditionary forces. The latter, he mentioned, traces his ancestry from the same country as the speaker himself--Alsace-Lorraine.</p>
   <p>The "Marseillaise" was played at the close of Mr. Knecht's address. The Reverend Jedlicka, well-known priest and patriot, mounted the speakers' platform. He evoked great enthusiasm with the very first words of his speech by stating that none of the French delegates who have paid us a visit so far was able to come as near to our hearts as Mr. Knecht, and that none has succeeded in presenting as clear a picture of the history of this War which, indeed, is identical with the history of France itself. The speaker advised Czechs and Slovaks to take the French people as an example. He admonished his countrymen to forget dissention in opinion and to unite as the French people did, in order that we may see Czechoslovakia rise again in new glory. Thorough concord is absolutely necessary. The only way to arrive at this end <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>is to gag slandering mouths that try to impede our noble efforts. Whoever disagrees may well be taken for an agent of the Kaiser. The audience responded most heartily to the speaker's fiery appeal.</p>
   <p>Abbe Souris, in the uniform of a field chaplain of the French Army and decorated with several medals for bravery under fire, was the last speaker. He used the French language, which is familiar to several of the Czechs who were present. These men gave the cue for the applause which frequently rewarded the speaker. Mr. J. Psenka later interpreted the French guest's address. He also greeted the Frenchmen in their native language, thanking them for their visit, and assuring them of the high esteem and heartfelt sympathy of the Czechoslovaks for the French nation and its representatives.</p>
   <p>Our French guests received a sincere welcome from our community, and they made no attempt to conceal their own emotion over the turbulent acclaim which followed them everywhere.</p>
   <p>Numerous members of our own "Little Bees" spread their benevolent propaganda <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>in the pavilion. These ladies solicited monetary contributions, from which they buy sewing material to produce sweaters, socks, and other necessary articles for the Czechoslovak soldiers now fighting in France.</p>
