   <p>Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst [British suffragette leader] may feel assured in advance that her lecture tour through the United States will be a huge financial success, even without the necessity of hiring an expensive impresario (sic) and paying a lot of money for newspaper publicity. All this has been taken care of by the colorful statement prepared by the immigration commissioner himself on the occasion of her release. This statement will no doubt be published by all newspapers free of charge....Only an extremely immodest person could possibly wish for anything more.</p>
