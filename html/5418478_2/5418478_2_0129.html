   <p>P.1--In the past Bohemians have been interested in how many candidates they have had on the political ballot, but at present they are concerned not so much with quantity as with quality. They are determined to put into office candidates of their own nationality whom they know to be qualified for the positions which they seek,--who are honest and reliable and will serve as honorable examples of their race. They want men who will be efficient and valuable in office, not men who desire to hold office because of the salary involved.</p>
