   <p>Czechoslovaks should follow the example set by the Ward Baking Company, where bonds are offered by their employers. Bonds bought by Czechoslovaks would then be credited to their nationality.</p>
   <p>Just as in many other concerns, Czechoslovak workers had been offered bonds by the Ward Baking Company. They showed readiness to buy bonds, but demanded that their bonds be marked "bought by Czechoslovaks". The Company's officials were willing to hear an explanation for this demand, and soon grasped the fact that the word "Czechoslovak" upon the bond has a practical significance for the Czechoslovaks. They even put the required word on the bond by themselves wherever a Czechoslovak subscriber was concerned. Some of the officials went even further, by signing their own bonds as "coming from Czechoslovaks".</p>
   <p>When Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who heads the Czechoslovak section of the Liberty <span class="page-break">2</span>Loan campaign, heard of these details, he discussed them with other officials of the main Czechoslovak campaign office, at 3342 West 26th Street, and it was decided to bring the case before the public. Our dailies are not in a position to conduct a column for the "roll of honor," as was done in the Third Liberty Loan drive. The patriotic behavior of the bakery employees mentioned is an outstanding example of national sentiment, and we do not hesitate to give the incident publicity as desired by Mr. Cermak. [Translator's note: List of names of those Czechoslovak employees is omitted in translation.] The amounts subscribed range from $50 to $200.</p>
   <p>An interesting report comes from the Reverend Father W. Jedlicka, head of the Czechoslovak campaign section in the Fifteenth Ward. It says that all of our people there are doing their duty. They do not omit to mark the word "Czechoslovak" on the bond, so that Czechoslovaks will be credited with it. We have even heard of cases where Irish fellow workers marked their bonds "Czechoslovak," when they saw how much importance is being attached to this formality by our Czechoslovak fellow countrymen.</p>

   <p>It often happens that workers belonging to one branch committee meet those from another Czechoslovak group, and of course both try to get the subscriber's name on their list.....</p>
   <p>Alderman Jos. I. Novak, while in the main campaign branch office at 3342 W. 26th Street, was given $24.25 to be divided between the Red Cross and the Czechoslovak Army. The money was the proceeds of a collection at a party in the home of Mr. F. Dobias, owner of a bakery. Bonds also were sold there.</p>
