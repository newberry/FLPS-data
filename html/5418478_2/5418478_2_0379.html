   <p>A meeting called by the Bohemian Section of the Socialist Labor Party was held in "Czechs" Hall on February 16th. The purpose of the meeting was to arrive at the truth of the statements published in "The Chicago Vestnik"(Advertiser) against the Honorable L. Meilbek (Representative of the Labor Party) that he has sold out to the Republican Party. More than 600 persons were present. Citizen M. Baumruker opened the meeting at 8:00 P. M. with an explanation of its purpose, that is, that the "Chicago Vestnik" published an article claiming that our Bohemian representative is bought out by the Republican Party and must dance as they whistle.</p>
   <p>The Labor Party wishing to have honorable Representation wants the charges against Rep. Meilbek either proved or disproved. Consequently the publisher of "Chicago Vestnik" has been invited to be present and to sustain the charges.</p>
   <p>The chairman then invited the publisher, Mr. Langmayer to take the floor and prove his charges. Mr. Langmayer was not present. Mr. K. Tuma thereon spoke saying that Mr. Langmayer received no invitation to be present. Citizen Belohradsky then read from the last issue of "Chicago Vestnik" an article telling of Mr. Belohradsky's visit to that paper and that he delivered the resolution requesting Mr. Langmayer's presence, thereby proving Mr. Tuma's contention a falsehood.</p>
   <p>The Chairman then introduced several speakers. The meeting was brought to a close at about 10 P. M.</p>
