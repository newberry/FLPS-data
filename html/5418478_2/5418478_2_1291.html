   <p>The relation between Italy and Germany is one of the most interesting things developing from the present European conflict. Already Berlin has threatened Italy several times, asserting that an army of several hundred thousand men of Bavarian origin is concentrated around Trent and Innsbruck, and will invade Lombardy! Once a report was actually published that several hundred wounded German soldiers from the Italian front had arrived at Constance. But this report has never been confirmed. All that Germany has done is to break off diplomatic relations, but a war between Italy and Germany has never been declared. The German Chancellor delivered a scorching speech in the German diet against Italy, the German press is heaping insults upon Italy, and satirical periodicals are finding an inexhaustible source of inspiration for their cartoons in the "treason" of a former ally; but that is all. The German and Italian soldiers have never met, and probably never will meet.</p>
   
   <p>Naturally, such an unclarified irregular relationship gives rise to wild and varied speculations and rumors. The three most widely circulated reasons for that relationship are discussed by the Italian historian, Ferrero. Many people consider this just a matter of form without any military or political importance, a mere diplomatic game in which each of the two countries is trying to put the responsibility for the war on the other. Others are of the opinion that this game is of considerable importance and believe that the entry of Rumania into the war depends on whether it be Italy or Germany who declares the war. Finally, there is a third group who believe that a secret, cunning treaty exists between Italy and Germany according to which these two countries will divide between them the remnants of the Hapsburg Monarchy and then join hands against the Allies.</p>
   <p>According to this version, Germany is merely waiting for Italy to occupy the Italian provinces of Austria, whereupon Germany will grab the German provinces of Austria and will force Hungary to do her bidding. Then Germany and Italy will form an alliance and try to force the Allies to conclude a peace treaty which will give Germany and Italy full hegemony over Europe. This plan may seem very fantastic at the first glance, but it must not be forgotten that the ruling classes are capable of the very basest criminal actions in case they have reason to hope that these actions will result in ultimate profit to themselves. Such a coup d'etat would be no more surprising than the rupture of the Balkan Alliance after its successful war against Turkey. The silliness of the reasons leading to that rupture was so clearly apparent to everybody that the first news about the battles between the former allies was believed to be mere inventions springing from the jealousy of Vienna, whose diplomatic circles were trying to sow discord between the Slavic allies. This news, however, soon proved to be only too true.</p>
   <p>It must be borne in mind that a pro-German clique exists at the Italian court, just as such a clique exists at the court of every other European nation. These cliques are not large, but they are extremely powerful. In this war Germany personifies reaction. Her victory would mean great strengthening of autocracy and the state, as against democracy and personal liberty. For that reason, in practically all countries that are still neutral, the people are for the Allies, while the ruling classes, aristocracy, bureaucracy, and the church, are for the Teutons. This applies also to nations which are as close to Germany as, for instance, Holland. It is the same in Italy. Most members of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, as well as the high state officials, were for Germany before the war; it was the common people who decided, and the King did not give in until he heard from the streets the dark rumbling of a revolution.</p>
   <p>It is practically certain that Germany will keep up this uncertain, undeclared relationship with her former ally, in order not to embarrass and endanger the existence of that Germanophile party which, under present conditions, does not have to stop its underhanded, secret work. It is not necessary for Germany to send a part of her army to the Italian front. She can keep Austria by taking over a larger section of the Russian front; that action would free a correspondingly large Austrian force which may be used against Italy. Since practically all Europe is now one immense battle field, it is easily understood that it does not make any difference whether German or Austrian troops fight at any one section of the front, provided the front is long enough to accomodate the whole available strength of that country [sic].</p>
   <p>Apparently, Germany still hopes to obtain a diplomatic revenge on the Allies by causing Italy quickly to end this war, which is far less popular than the first reports seemed to indicate, and by subsequently allying herself with Italy on a new basis.</p>
   <p>These, of course, are speculations which may or may not have a very solid foundation in fact. The most incredible intrigues and manipulations are going on behind the scenes all the time, well concealed behind the impenetrable wall of strict censorship and drastic military laws, limiting the freedom of the press and speech; and thus the world, every once in a while, becomes aware of a stupefying fact without having had even the slightest indication of its being prepared. It is certain that the undefined relationship between Italy and Germany is most depressing to London, Paris. and St. Petersburg. From a military point of view, this situation cannot affect the outcome of the war. Italy, having attacked Austria, causes Austria to concentrate her strength in the South and by doing so weakens the other fronts, which in turn affects Germany. All this is supposing that Italy will remain in the present combination. But if we consider that already relationship between Italy and Serbia is dangerously deteriorating because of the Serbian army's penetration into Albania, where neither the Serbs nor the Italians have any business, we have to be prepared for disillusionment of every sort, perhaps even the most improbable.</p>
