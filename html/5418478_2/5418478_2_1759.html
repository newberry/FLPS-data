   <p>When our friends are rejoicing, of course we cannot remain indifferent, we must share their joys. Mr. V. L. Blahnik, proprietor of the oldest Bohemian pharmacy, whose place of business is at Forty-seventh and Lincoln Streets, in the Town of Lake, is our old, proven friend. His arduous desires have been fulfilled recently. His son has finished his studies in medicine. Karel B. Blahnik was elevated Wednesday in a festive manner at Northwestern University when he received a degree of Doctor of Medicine. Now both father and son will work together for the alleviation of the suffering of people. The father is a recognized expert in pharmacy. The son, because of energetic work and thorough application, we hope will become a distinguished doctor.</p>
