   <p>At the last meeting of the "Society of Bohemian Journalists," it was decided that at the regular meetings, hereafter, some one of the members is to arrange a lecture. The first such lecture will take place at the next meeting to be held this coming Saturday in the club room on the second floor of the Schlitz Building, corner of 19th street and Blue Island avenue, and it is certain that all members will attend. The society's room is furnished with various comforts; there is a selection of American newspapers and there will be arriving soon the leading papers of Bohemia. The "Society of Bohemian Journalists" is zealously working toward an excellent goal and will surely become a good example in Bohemian-American public life.</p>
