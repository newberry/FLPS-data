   <p>The independent Democratic club of the 6th ward which originally proposed Mr. Kalal as candidate to the city council, but later accepted his refusal, turned its attention to F. Hubka, well known countryman, and a businessman on the south side of Halsted Street and was assured of the acceptance of the candidacy. Not only the numerous and notable citizens of Bohemian nationality have recommended Mr. Hubka, but the other nationalities have confirmed his candidacy very heartily.</p>
   <p>All depends now on Bohemian voters, if they will give their votes collectively because this way only, we can secure the victory for Mr. Hubka the victory so long expected by Bohemians. We recommend Mr. Hubka to all voters as a most suitable and able candidate to the city council.</p>
