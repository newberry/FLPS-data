   <p>Mr. James L. Kostka, a well-known Bohemian attorney, was recently appointed by State's Attorney Crowe as his assistant. His duties will be those of public prosecutor, and he will be assigned to the Municipal Court in two localities, one in the Englewood district and the other at Halsted Street and 47th Place. Mr. Kostka is the third of our countrymen to be appointed to such a post; the others were Josef A. Šmejkal and František C. Souhrada. Mr. Kostka is thirty-four years of age, was born in Chicago, and resides with his wife and two children at 1846 South Ashland Avenue. He is a graduate of the Chicago Kent College of Law from which he received his diploma in June, 1915. He gained much experience when he served as clerk of courts during the period from 1913 to 1915, having been assigned to the judge of the Superior Court, Mr. Clarence N. Goodwin. Afterwards he served four years as chief clerk in the offices of the former municipal bailiff, Anton J. Čermák, and from October 1, 1918, he started his own practice in his offices located in room 620 Ashland Block, which is on the corner of Clark and Randolph Streets.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kostka has a right to be proud of his success, for he attained it by his own industry and energy. As a son of comparatively poor parents and after having finished his public school work, he had to earn his own living when he was only thirteen years old; and he kept working for eight years in the printing trade. During spare moments and in the evenings he studied and finished one evening preparatory course after another. Today he may be proudly point to the fact that his persistence is bearing fruit.</p>
