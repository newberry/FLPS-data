   <p>Sheriff Gilbert kept his word at last and appointed a Bohemian as bailiff, and we are sure that by this act he will gain the favor of Bohemian Republicans whose concern it is to see that every office is filled by a capable person.</p>
   <p>The office of bailiff is more important than some think, and in convocation summons of jurors and in the keeping of their records great care is necessary.</p>
   <p>The sheriff must take into consideration, that many Bohemians come to courts unable to speak the English language and in order to avoid payment of hired interpreters by them it becomes necessary that there be placed in our court rooms men capable of filling the positions as Mr. Holy does. Having mastered the Bohemian, English and German languages, he is recognized as a capable interpreter and is good penman.</p>
