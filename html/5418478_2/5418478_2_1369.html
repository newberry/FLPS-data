   <p>The United States is treating Germany with altogether too much leniency. Pirates and murderers deserve harsher treatment and absolutely no consideration. Uncle Sam should sever all relations with Germany as a ruthless, barbaric nation and act as though Germany did not exist. The German Ambassador should have packed his trunks long ago and left the country with all his consuls and agents. That would have been a great relief, and the United States would again be as quiet as it was before these people started their eternal annoyances. They are nothing but a dangerous nuisance.</p>
