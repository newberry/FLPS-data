   <p>The question of Bohemians in England has been decided favorably by the Parliament. No more will the Bohemians be classified as Austrians, and a committee of Bohemians has been authorized to identify Bohemians and Bohemian property. The first action of the committee was to identify Bohemians in camps of war prisoners, and these people were immediately released.</p>
