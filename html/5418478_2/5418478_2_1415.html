   <p>[All the issues from January 1 to January 15, 1915, carry from three to four columns of names of soldiers who are wounded or sick, the soldier's place of residence, name and number of his military unit (regiment, battery, etc.), and names of those who are dead, carrying their rank and name of military unit. These appear to be extracts from official Austrian lists and refer to soldiers whose homes are in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, or whose military units recruit from one of the lands.]</p>
