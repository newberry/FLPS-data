   <p>František [Frank] Pošvic is one of the younger generation of Chicago Czech lawyers. The success he achieved in his profession has often been the subject of our articles.</p>
   <p>He was born in Chicago in 1884, the son of Chicago Czech pioneer settlers, who came here in 1878. After his graduation from Throop School, he located in our Plzeň [Pilsen] district. He worked as a bookbinder, and later was employed by Marshall Field &amp; Company.</p>
   <p>In 1900, he began to work in the offices of Rubens, Dupny &amp; Fischer, at that time one of the biggest lawyers' offices in Chicago. During the day, young Posvic found time enough to review the lessons taught at the Gregg school <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in which he had enrolled, and which he attended evenings. A course at the Y. M. C. A., which normally takes four years to complete, he finished in two years and a half. After this course, which made up for his lacking a high school education, he entered Kent Law School, a branch of Lake Forest University. He graduated in 1909. He had passed the examinations even before his graduation. The courts of the State of Illinois then awarded a diploma to him which entitled him to membership in the Bar Association [which one, is not said in the article]. Few students can boast of a progress like this.</p>
   <p>His initial success as a lawyer was so pronounced that when a group of older lawyers consisting of Messrs. De Witt, C. Jones, Otto F. Ring, and John M. Bryant formed a partnership, he was taken into the firm where he remained until 1912.....He formed several other partnerships, and finally established himself independently. Among his clients were such big concerns as A. Holpuch Company, building contractors, the Merchants' Wholesale Grocery Company, the latter a purely Czech-American concern, and many others.</p>
