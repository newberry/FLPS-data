   <p>The State of Illinois contributes the majority of the volunteers who enlist for service in the Army and Navy. Chicago stands in the front, but it would not be able to boast of this honor without the so-called "Hyphenated Americans," that is Czechs, Poles, Slovaks, Croats, and others of Slavonic blood, who might serve as shining examples to many thousands of American youths not burdened with the hyphen. The latter demonstrate their patriotic enthusiasm mostly by waving the Star Spangled Banner and by passing resolutions, while the immigrant is the first to rally behind the Stars and Stripes. He offers his services, and perhaps his life, to his new homeland.</p>
