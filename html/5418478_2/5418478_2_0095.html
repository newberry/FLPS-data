   <p>The graduates of the Farragut School at 24th Street and Spaulding Avenue have undertaken an important task: They want to get a playground for the children of our California district. The Municipal Council of Chicago is now establishing playgrounds for children throughout the city, and it is up to us, the residents of Bohemian California, to see to it that our children also have a place to play--a place with good fresh air, and which is removed from the dangers of the street.</p>
   <p>The desire to have such a playground near Farragut School is particularly justified because the nearest playgrounds to that school are in Douglas Park, at Harrison School, and at McCormick School. All these playgrounds are too far away. In our neighborhood there are 2,755 children between the ages of three and eighteen years, 1,548 of whom are pupils of the Farragut School.</p>
   <p>These children have no place to play in the open except on the street, where <span class="page-break">\2</span>they are in constant danger of being run over. It is therefore the duty of all of us to do all we can to have a safe place set aside for their recreation, particularly as the establishment of a playground will not raise the taxes in our ward. All we want is that, a playground for our children be established in our neighborhood instead of somewhere else, certainly a very logical and legitimate requirement that should be supported by every man and every woman, especially fathers and mothers.</p>
   <p>In order to give this requirement a proper backing, the graduates of Farragut School have arranged for a huge meeting of residents which will be held in the hall of Farragut School July 18, at 8:00 P.M. The meeting will be addressed by City Clerk Mr. Jan Siman, Aldermen Block and Otto Kerner, School Board member Joseph Holpuch, and Playground Director Theodore A. Gross. The orchestra of the graduates of Farragut School will play a number of selections.</p>
   <p>Citizens! Let us fill the hall of Farragut School to the very last place! Let us show that our neighborhood is inhabited by people who know how to defend their <span class="page-break">\3</span>rights, how to get what is due to them! Come all and hear our speakers! It is to your interest to have a playground in your immediate neighborhood! Show that you are sincere!</p>
   <p>For the graduates of Farragut School:</p>
   <p>Joseph A. Cerny, president,</p>
   <p>Julie Kaspar, secretary.</p>
