   <p>The principal of the Herzl Chicago Public School, Mr. Jaroslav J. Zmrhal, living at 1869 South Lawndale Avenue, who is one of the best-known Czechs in Chicago, received a cablegram yesterday from Gustav Haberman, Minister of Education of the Czechoslovak Republic, asking him to come to Prague, Czechoslovakia, and help them to organize the public school system after the pattern of the Chicago public schools. Mr. Jaroslav J. Zmrhal was recommended to Minister Gustav Haberman by the Czechoslovak commission, which was here several months ago. Mr. Zmrhal immediately asked the Superintendent of Chicago Public Schools, Mr. Mortenson, for an adequate furlough. His answer to Minister Gustav Haberman will depend on the outcome of this request.</p>
