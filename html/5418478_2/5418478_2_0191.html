   <p>The Republican party celebrated its big victory yesterday in all electoral districts. Not paying attention to the fact that only 50% of the registered citizens gave their votes in the election locals, the Republican ticket's victory in all districts was smashing, receiving an enormous majority of votes.</p>
   <p>We can say the election results are very satisfactory. Some of the aldermen were re-elected, some with bad recrods lost their lucrative jobs. The Bohemians received three nominations, one Democrat and two Republicans: Ward 8 - Democrat, Frank Meck; Ward 9 - Republican, Vaclav Klenka; Ward 10 - Republican, Anton Novak.</p>
