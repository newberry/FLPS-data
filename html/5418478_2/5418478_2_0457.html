   <p>Celebrations at the raising of service flags have come off in splendid fashion in our districts, and encourage us to further endeavor in this patriotic activity. One of the most elaborate will no doubt be held next Sunday afternoon on Harding Avenue where a flag with fifty-five stars will be raised, representing the number of enlisted army and navy men from the neighborhood between 24th and 26th Streets.....</p>
   <p>Thanks to the zeal of our ladies, mostly members of the Democratic Club of Czech Citizens, one flag after another is being raised in our "Czech California" district. Entertainments of various kinds are always included in the activities, so that these events have become extremely popular and have risen to the level of holidays for the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Mothers and daughters of soldiers from the neighborhood of Avers Avenue, between 26th and 27th Streets, will also raise a flag next Sunday, September 22, on which eighteen stars will sparkle.....</p>
