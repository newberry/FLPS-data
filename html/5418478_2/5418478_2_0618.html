   <p>Another contingent of our volunteers left Chicago last Tuesday night to go to France, there to join the Czechoslovak Army. The farewell given for them by our community was exceedingly cordial, and hundreds of men and women did everything to make their last hours here as pleasant as possible.</p>
   <p>Mr. Urban, a saloonkeeper, invited the soldiers to his place, Springfield Avenue and 26th Street, for refreshments, where genuine hospitality had been extended to volunteers prior to this occasion.</p>
   <p>The glee club Kosy hired a band of union musicians which played at Urban's saloon and also accompanied the soldiers on their march along 26th Street to Kedzie Avenue. Mr. F. J. Krbec, president of the Czechoslovak military committee, and Mr. J. Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, spoke at Mr. Urban's tavern.</p>
   <p>The ladies of the Slovak singing club Lipa (Linden Tree) brought smoking <span class="page-break">2</span>supplies. There were scenes of both deep emotion and exuberant joy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, and Vojta Bene≈°, its organizer, with other officials of that organization, joined the parade before it came to a halt at Kedzie Avenue and 26th Street. The soldiers then stepped into automobiles and were taken to the railroad station. The vehicles had been kindly furnished by Messrs. Zeman, Kotka, Jos. Kaiser, and the Pilsen Brewing Company.</p>
