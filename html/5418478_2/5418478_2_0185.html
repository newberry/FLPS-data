   <p>Karel J. Vopicka becomes the successor of C. R. Walleck.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison, yesterday sent to the City Council, a list of his appointments to the School Board, the most important of which, for us, is the installation of Karel J. Vopicka as a member of the board instead of Mr. Walleck. That Walleck did not have the slightest expectation of reappointment was known some time ago. The problem was simply to find a suitable person, who would accept his position. Finally the Mayor offered it to Mr. Vopicka, who at first was inclined to refuse the offer, because he is fully occupied with business matters. However, when the Mayor told him that there would not be any Bohemian on the School Board if he did not accept, he finally agreed to accept. Mr. Vopicka has an excellent reputation from a nationalistic, as well as from a political and business viewpoint and it is certain, that the greatest portion of his countrymen will be satisfied with his appointment. Besides him the following were also appointed: Charles J. Holmes, Dr. Heinrich Hartung, Mrs. Isabelle O'Keefe, Frank J. Loesch, Josef Downey and John F. Wolff. The last four were members of the previous Board.</p>
