   <p>President Hammerling, of the American Foreign Language Press Association, knows how to write good articles about personal liberty, and is an able defender of immigrants against assaults by fanatics and know-nothings. For this we have always been glad to give him full credit. But we are unable to agree with his most recent action on behalf of the Association. What Mr. Hammerling wants is to protest in the name of the Association against America's selling arms and ammunition to the warring powers, and in order to give his protest the necessary authority, he approached the Bohemian, Polish, Slovak, and other newspapers which are members of the Association with a request to sign a proclamation to that effect. As president of the Association, Mr. Hammerling would be well advised to learn something about the attitude of the Association's members toward some of the most important public questions. If he would do so, he would spare himself <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a disappointment, for the Slavic members of the Association have the disagreeable duty of telling him that such a protest on behalf of the Association and on behalf of the whole immigrant element in this country is absolutely out of place and fully intolerable.</p>
   <p>The letter, copies of which he has sent to the newspapers, is, of course, worded so as to appear that the protest is motivated by pure humanitarianism, but it has never been a secret to us that the ends thus followed are purely and only German ends, and that the protest is devised to promote German interests to the detriment of the interests of the whole nation. Mr. Hammerling writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"Since the month of August, we have been engaged in a deep study of the serious consequences of the terrible conflict now raging in Europe. We have studied them from very many and various points of view, and have come to the conclusion that the thirty-three million Americans of foreign birth and their children are particularly affected by the struggle because <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>a majority of them have brothers, sisters, parents, or other relatives in countries engaged in the war. By this we do not mean to say that the American nation in general and as a whole is not seriously affected, but we are tied with the warring nations by much closer bonds, and from day to day we feel the consequences of the war with growing intensity.</p>
   <p>"We firmly believe that the pleadings of mothers, children, and orphans in Europe should cause us to address an appeal to the American people, to the manufacturers of gun powder and ammunition, to the workingmen employed in arms industries of all kinds to stop immediately the manufacture of that powder, shrapnel, and bombs destined to kill our brothers, to make widows of our sisters and mothers and orphans of their children. We firmly believe that we should stop, even if labor should lose many opportunities of employment by it. The patriotism of the American people, the reputation of American manufacturers, and the honor of our workingmen demand that we show the world that they cannot be bought by money tainted with blood.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"We are asking you, therefore, in the name of humaneness, justice, and the true spirit of neutrality, to do all you can, in your paper, societies, clubs, and churches, to put an end to the manufacture, sale, and shipment of arms and ammunition of any kind whatever to countries engaged in the war, countries which would use them to kill and cripple the people.</p>
   <p>"We are preparing a proclamation to that effect, addressed to the American manufacturers the American people, and the forces of labor, and we ask for your co-operation. We are making this effort in behalf of humanity and in a purely patriotic spirit. We ask you to join us in this worthy undertaking by signing your name to the appeal we are preparing--an appeal whose purpose is to save the lives and happiness of our brothers without regard to religion, color, or nationality; they are all our brothers."</p>
   <p>All that Mr. Hammerling writes, we have read many times, in one form or another, stressed and put in various forms--pleadingly, satirically, blandly, and spicily--in local German newspapers. It was, and has been <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>nobody else but the Germans who were first to ask for an embargo on arms, and who try to influence public opinion for putting a stop to the manufacture and sale of munitions. It is to nobody's interest but theirs. They are the only ones who are harmed by the export of ammunition and arms, and they would be the only ones who would profit if we should accede to their will. Austria and Germany have long been making thorough preparations for war; they have immense munitions factories. But England, who Germany now considers its principal enemy and who it wants to defeat in the worst way, has not been prepared for war on land, and now is obliged to buy her arms and ammunitions elsewhere, principally in the United States. Hence the Germans appeal to our humanity, point to our neutrality, in order to stop this source of supply for England and thus assure their own victory.</p>
   <p>Taken from the standpoint of their countrymen in America, this propaganda is quite logical and proper, and so far it has not even entered our minds to fight it except for showing the mischievousness of such appeals to <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>humaneness and neutrality. In all previous wars, the Germans supplied arms to anybody who could pay for them without a momentary thought about neutrality and humaneness. But when we, Slavs, are asked to join in these protests and appeals, the only aim of which is to help the Germanic cause, it becomes our duty not only to refuse to participate in such propaganda, but also to explain our standpoint to Mr. Hammerling as well as to the whole American public.</p>
   <p>In the first days of August of last year, Germany's declaration of war against Russia was greeted by local German newspapers as the final act of the struggle of Germandom with Slavdom. It was proclaimed as the end of all Slavic aspirations, and that the Germans would soon become lords over Europe. But conditions have changed somewhat since those days, and a final German victory does not appear, even to the Germans, quite as assured as at the beginning. Hence all the appeals to America's humaneness and neutrality. But just because we love all humanity, because we want peace in this country and in our old native country, because we are Slavs, members of a nation which had to stand for abuse by its German neighbors for so many centuries and for which the time has now come to hope <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>for a better future, because we know from our own experience what Prussianism is, and know that Prussianism is the true cause of the war and will bring about new wars if it is not completely crushed--we must not only refuse to join the appeal to the American people, but take a definite stand against it. International law does not provide for, and the customs of neutrality do not require anything of that kind. The American nation has no reason to attempt a change of one or the other. Hence, neither as Slavs nor as Americans, are we in a position to help Mr. Hammerling in his propaganda.</p>
