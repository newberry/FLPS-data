   <p>To the Czechoslovak people: We are in the midst of the struggle. After years of suffering and resignation, after years of hope for an assured existence for our nation, there came the fury of war, which shook the very foundations [of civilization].</p>
   <p>We have come to know our duty, and Czech America has begun its great and blessed work for our nation. Those were trying days, but they bore fruit. We gave support to Masaryk's political work and started a movement which gathered under its flag the large family of the American people, regardless of convictions or creed. Our people awoke to a new life of toil and self-effacing sacrifice.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We have built up our own army in Russia and in France. Week by week our boys are crossing the ocean to make the supreme sacrifice for their motherland and its freedom--the greatest sacrifice that man can make to his people. The Czechoslovak Army in France is also our own, the American Czechoslovaks' Army. Do not permit this army of our children to be forsaken by us. They went under our name; they went for us, thus to testify to the infinite longing of our people for liberty--to demonstrate that wherever Czechoslovak hearts beat, they throb with yearning for the freedom of their people.</p>
   <p>The Czech people in the United States have not abandoned their boys over there. Like a firm wall which supports and gives strength to their wrath, like a healthy branch of the nation from which the leaves and the blood-colored buds of great sacrifice spring, the American Czechoslovaks will stand behind their boys in the momentous hour of noble decision--the American Czechoslovaks will not let them fight forgotten and forsaken.</p>
   <p>Our people will continue to stand behind our boys in the armies in Russia <span class="page-break">\3</span>and France; they will strive with words and deeds for the liberty of their people. We must not forsake the banner of defiance which we so proudly raised over Czech America. Czech America will fulfill its duty up to the last moment and each day will work harder for the cause.</p>
   <p>In these efforts Czechoslovak Chicago has already accomplished much. Our associations and lodges, our Sokols, the sacrifices made by our workingmen, and the great work performed by our wide-awake women: All this yielded a rich crop of moral and financial successes. But the sun has not yet set on the last day of hard struggles. The enemy still stands up, unbroken and ready to destroy by subtle cunning the fruits of our work. The moment of victory and of rest has not yet arrived. This is why our people in Chicago will not cease their efforts. We shall pursue our aims persistently and tirelessly. The armada of our workers is going to perform deeds worthy of the work done before, in spite of misunderstandings on the part of some or grudges on the part of others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Let the first of these deeds be the arrangements for a great bazaar which is to excel the bazaar previously held by the Czechoslovaks of Chicago. It will be sponsored by the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, and is to be held in the Pilsen Brewery Park from May 11 to May 18 of this year.</p>
   <p>We have formed a brotherly union to fight and work. The Freethinkers and the Catholics among the Czech people in America stand in serried ranks in the struggle for a better future of their nation.</p>
   <p>This is a time for work. We shall demonstrate this union again and again. The bazaar shall testify to it. The Czech Catholics, as well as Czech Freethinkers, are joining hands for noble support.</p>
   <p>We are addressing ourselves to our people in the firm hope that, as in former times, they will joyfully hasten to aid us so that our work will meet with new and still greater success. We are calling on our women.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>They stood by us at the time when we laid our devoted work into the cradle of hope. They surely will be at the head of our activities in the coming days. We are entreating our ladies' societies and all the zealous women who contributed days and nights of diligent work because of their love for the land of their fathers. Come and help! Without your aid our best endeavor would merely be vain effort bearing no results!</p>
   <p>We are again approaching our aid societies and lodges, be they Catholic or Free Thought, our workingmen's organizations, our large and patriotic Sokol community, the Catholic Sokols, and all individuals and good Czech souls--all those whose love and duty urge them to work and to sacrifice for the cause of the nation. Join our ranks, help, work! We shall welcome you joyfully and shall place you where you can best show your ability and willingness to work.</p>
   <p>Anybody and any organization intending to pitch a tent at the bazaar should apply at the bazaar office, 3242 West 26th Street, telephone Lawndale 410.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>A welcome is extended to every goodhearted person willing to contribute to the common cause.</p>
   <p>This is a new appeal to Czech businessmen, tradesmen, farmers--we are asking for help again in the hard times which oppress all countries and all walks of life. There is, however, no way out of the obligation to sacrifice heavily. We know that the Czech businessman, tradesman, and farmer will do his bit just as joyfully as the Czech workman who depends upon an income according to his circumstances is doing. We know that the heart of the Czech merchant knows how to open itself for sacrifice to our distressed nation with as much love as the poor woman who comes to us with a small gift which her tired hands have made after a day of hard work.</p>
   <p>We appeal to you, the branch of the Czechoslovak people! Your sacrifice, your work, and your satisfaction will last forever! Hurrah for the Czechoslovak Bazaar!</p>
