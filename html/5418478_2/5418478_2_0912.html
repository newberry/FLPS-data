   <p>Among all the nationalities who have helped make this great nation, there is none who wishes more eagerly for a victory of the United States in this war than the Czechoslovaks.....Americans are hardly able to grasp, as we do, the danger that lies in any possibility of a victorious Germany or Austro-Hungary.....</p>
   <p>Not everyone can take up arms or work in the Red Cross ranks, though there is hardly one person who could not become a member of that organization. Everyone can help in some way or other. Wars are not won by guns alone; money plays a great part. For the Germans, the wealth of the United States is their worst threat.....</p>
   
   <p>The United States is offering Liberty bonds. The proceeds of the sale, expected to reach the figure of seven billion dollars, will be expended in the fight for liberty. Czechs and Slovaks will not have to be urged to buy these bonds. Everyone of them knows his duty.....Any bank will accommodate you!....</p>
