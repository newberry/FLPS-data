   <p>That the last presidential election was a scoundrelly and thievish affair is known by every citizen, for the Republicans proved that the Democrats wanted to elect Tilden to help along with thievery, bribery and scoundrelism; on the other hand the Democrats proved for the Republicans the same things in regard to the occupancy of the White House by Hayes. The question now before both Republican and Democratic parties is how to prepare for the coming elections in order to insure victory for themselves, and for their work to be placed in the rich troughs of government office, where it is not necessary to do anything except take money, brag about oneself and steal so much as possible. Neither party gives any thought about an honorable triumph and an honest government, openly or secretly. We read how both parties are preparing for the coming elections. The Democratic "New York Express" write about it as follows,"Tilden is very wealthy, has no family and can devote a million dollars to become President; and the Democratic party, which has no patronage and no money resources like the Republican party where every office holder must contribute financially, must have a rich candidate who will not be miserly with the dollar. This reasoning is not ordinarily published in newspapers but is discussed privately.</p>
   
   <p>What would the founders of our republic think if they could know of the preparations being made for the presidential election. Imagine for yourself a great national party coming before its voters with this, "Can we not find an honorable capable candidate who can afford to spend some ten millions for election purposes?"</p>
   <p>What the Democrats do on one side the Republicans duplicate on the other side. Money is appropriated and all other conditions are side tracked.</p>
   <p>Oh! where are we going?</p>
