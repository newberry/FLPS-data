   <p>Large subscriptions came in yesterday, so that there is no doubt that the quota for Chicago will be reached. The Tenth Ward with its Czechoslovak population has subscribed $561,850, or 112 per cent of its quota. The Twelfth Ward had subscribed $801,400, or 80 per cent of its quota of $1,000,000 up to last night. It is sure to reach 100 per cent. The only question remaining is how much will be oversubscribed.</p>
   <p>Two of our banking institutions, the Lawndale State Bank and the Lawndale National Bank each subscribed $100,000 yesterday. This of course, does not include subscriptions made by their depositors. Reports from other Czechoslovak wards indicate that their quotas will be reached.</p>
