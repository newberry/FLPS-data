   <p>The Germans of this town have suddenly changed their opinion about President Wilson. "The British Clodpole," as he was dubbed by them, has now become a "secret ally" of the Teutonic powers. We think that the President ponders only about means to avoid the danger of America's being drawn into the tangle while we are not prepared for war. The "friendly" visit by the U-boat "U-53" proves that Germany could transfer its activities to this side of the Atlantic ocean and damage business along our shores. This is the reason why he is making efforts to end the war. Nobody doubts his pacifistic intentions, but the nations fighting the Teutons are faced with a question of life or death, and so cannot afford to listen to voices clamoring for peace. They will rather seek to give better protection to the ships which carry the business between the United States and Eurppe, so as to calm the nerves of our capitalists, whose influence in the peace movement is clearly seen.</p>
