   <p>The Chicago Daily Journal, which is numbered among our staunchest supporters, printed another article yesterday in which it declares that there can be no thought of peace if the Czechs remain under Hapsburg rule.

   <p>We should like to advise our fellow countrymen to order a copy of the Chicago Daily Journal of February 26, and to state in the order why the copy is wanted. Keep that particular article and show it to your acquaintances and their children. If you have ordered several copies, send them to your American friends. You will in this way render your nation a service which, though easy to perform, has a value not to be underestimated.</p>
