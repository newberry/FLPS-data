   <p>A collection undertaken in the well-known Mr. Andel's Cafe yielded fifteen dollars, which was sent as a Christmas gift to some of the Czech volunteers in the Canadian Army. A letter of appreciation from the soldiers stated that the Czech volunteers are well taken care of by the Canadian Army; they would, therefore increase the amount to a round figure and donate it to a fund for the widows and orphans of Czech soldiers who have lost their lives in France. "We are glad we can help the cause of liberty," they continued, "and first of all, do our bit for the Czech people. We are ready for any sacrifice and willing to lay down our lives for the cause. We seek neither publicity nor praise - only we would not stand for any disparaging remarks about our doings. There is a goodly number of us here in the army who have belonged to the sociable family in Mr. Andel's place."</p>
