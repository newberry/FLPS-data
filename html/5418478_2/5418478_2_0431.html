Courses began in the home of the Pilsen (Plzensky) Sokol, and the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs with twenty-five students each. Examinations were held after the first two courses. In the Pilsen Sokol course six girl students achieved the highest number of points.....Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky will accept applications at 1900 Blue Island Avenue.</p>
