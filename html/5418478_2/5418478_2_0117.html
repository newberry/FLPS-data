   <p>The election of Judges of the Superior Court of Cook County will take place on Tuesday, November 7. It certainly is not necessary to particularly explain to the voters of the county how important is the office of Judge of the Superior Court, and what care is necessary in the selection of candidates in regard to their qualifications.</p>
   <p>Insofar as we Czechs are concerned, we must first of all support men of whom we are fully convinced that they will not be prejudiced in any respect after they have taken their place on the judicial bench, and that justice will be shown before them.</p>
   <p>Because of the above and for other reasons, we, the undersigned Czech businessmen, have decided upon the following resolution:</p>
   <p>In consideration that Mr. Hugo Pam, candidate for the office of Judge of the Superior Court on the Republican ballot, is known to us as a distinguished lawyer, a man of good character, about whose rare abilities and fine qualifications there is no doubt.</p>
   <p>In consideration that Mr. Hugo Pam is the son of Czech parents, and that he was reared in a Czech neighborhood, we have no doubt but that he well knows our mode of living, and, therefore, he will not be prejudiced against our nationality if we help to elect him with our votes.</p>
   <p>In consideration that Mr. Hugo Pam takes an active. part in charitable activities, we take it upon ourselves as a duty to remind voters of Czech origin to vote for him in the judicial elections.</p>
   <p>In confidence that this resolution will receive a hearty acceptance and correct understanding, we remain with deepest respect,</p>
