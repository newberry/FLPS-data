   <p>The Chicago Daily Tribune published an article which surprises us coming as it does from the Tribune itself. Its originator is Robert Herrick, Tribune correspondent, at this time in Paris, France. It discussed a German peace offer, which is considered by the Tribune and other Chicago papers as sincere, as a precious opportunity, which should be eagerly seized by the Allies, so that an "honorable peace" could be declared upon its basis. Nobody has spoken in this trend as yet in the Chicago press! we do not doubt that the article has evoked uneasy feelings among the readers of the Tribune, yet it surely will also do some good in informing the broad American public, that part of it, that draws its knowledge about the War from the English language dailies on details that will enable them to form a proper conception about the Germans and America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Mr. Herrick sent his article to the Tribune on December 17, soon after the peace overtures made by our President, which so conspicuously fitted into the German peace proposals. We shall try to make the reader acquainted with the contents of the article, although, on account of limited space, we cannot fully reprint it to do it justice. The parts which are of signal importance read as follows:</p>
   <p>"The only spot where the peace proposal is taken seriously is the United States, or where the people talk of peace is when they are not preoccupied with making money. In America, and in Germany, they constantly talk of peace, which, of course, causes the people of the Allied nations to become convinced that the Central powers need peace more than the Allies. Those newspapers that sympathize with the Allies have indeed fallen for the German peace propaganda, as directed by Schiff; they elaborately treat all the possible conditions, and so take the attitude that the war is a draw, that the Allies, who have set themselves to the task of liberating the <span class="page-break">3</span>world from German militarism and Teutonic lust for conquest, should view the situation with good grace, and abandon the major part of what they have brought sacrifices and shed their blood for in this most costly and bloody War in history."</p>
   <p>To cap this, suggestions are being made to the Allies for a more expansive and energetic propaganda among the German peoples so that they should rise against their rulers, because, once the Hohenzollern are removed, the Allies will be in a better position "to save their face." But why should the German people wish to change their government when the Kaiser, with his Bethmann and his Hindenburg, has forced the rest of Europe down to her knees, so that she is willing to listen to the German peace terms, when Germany is in possession of Belgium, Poland, Servia, Roumania? Why do Americans babble so foolishly when touching upon European affairs? The great majority of Americans evidently do not know at the present time what Europe is fighting for. Germany, <span class="page-break">4</span>whose propaganda has burned out everywhere else, has found a most fertile soil for it in our United States.</p>
   <p>Peace, of course, could have been concluded any time during the last two years - a German peace, in which the holy German Empire could safely spread out over Central Europe, and from the Baltic sea to the Persian gulf, a peace which would in reality be only a short-lived measure until this same holy German Empire would triumph over the whole world, even over the naive populace of the United States of America. But, the Allies do not give one moment's thought to a peace such as this, even when they have become fully conscious of their innumerable mistakes, of their comparative lack of success up to this day, and of the necessity of changing their present organization into an efficient instrument of war. They do not long for a peace like this. They would rather expose themselves to the terrible danger of being annihilated, destroyed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>For the very reason that these nations have some spiritual and moral strength still left, that they prefer War, and a final decision to such a holy German Empire, their platform which is firmer than that of the American civilization would be poorly served, indeed, if it were deprived of its fortitude, its courage; anything better than to bend under the yoke of the Teutonic World - Empire! It is true that Americans, who enjoy Hindenburg's confidence, believe that the most favorable outcome for the Allies of the war can be a draw. But there are other opinions. General Nivelle, who is not given to idle talk, spoke thus to his soldiers: "The German army is not as good as ours, and anyone who says it is lies." The multitudes of Germans who surrendered during the last month, when there was no fighting done, furnish ample refutation of Hindenburg's babble. A victorious army does not surrender without previous defeat. The Germans are no amateurs, they know as well as their enemies that the vast territories held by them represent only a ramshackle structure, which, if not securely gripped by the Germans to <span class="page-break">6</span>unite what they have stolen, would tumble quicker than it was erected. This explains the call for peace from Berlin.</p>
   <p>But let us assume the Allies were at the end of their resources, that they felt compelled to admit their utter defeat, and to concede that the Central powers could retain the entire territory they stole, aye, that they could start a raid on Odessa or Egypt, that they could devastate northern Italy before next fall, or convinced that necessity gives them the right, they would violate the neutrality of Switzerland - what then? Would it be wise for France or England to conclude peace? Even if the peace terms were really much more favorable than those that have been superficially intimated, even if Germany would declare itself satisfied with the "status quo ante" - which, of course, does not lie in her intention - if she would vacate the countries taken, and demand not more than that the colonies be given back to her, and that a decent commercial treaty be signed among the former belligerents, even then the Allies could not accept.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>What guaranties could Germany offer that she will adhere to the terms? Who would vouchsafe for them? Would the United States be willing to bear the responsibility for a treaty signed by Germany for the duration of one, two, ten or twenty years? Who can say whether Germany would not in a propitious moment proclaim the treaty to be a mere scrap of paper as she did when violating the neutrality of Belgium? Neither Schiff nor Ford would stake their fortunes on such a gamble. Just for the reason that they are good businessmen would keep them from wagering one single dollar in a deal with people who betrayed the confidence of everyone with whom they came in contact, where humane feelings played a part.</p>
   <p>Germany built an unsurmountable wall against peace, when it destroyed mankind's confidence in her honor as a nation. Thus, she brought a catastrophe upon herself and the world. No one can be found who would believe in what a German says under oath. Had Germany conducted an <span class="page-break">8</span>honest War, had it not sinned against Belgium, not murdered non-combatants, and not enslaved countless numbers of inhabitants - peace could be made any day.</p>
   <p>There is no human force that could deservedly punish Germany for all that she has sinned - but she has castigated herself, more than the Allies could do if they won a decisive victory over her arms. All the nations of the world hate and curse the Germans. They consider them the embodiment of all evil. Mankind trembles before them. It will take a generation before her guilt is "whitewashed." Future generations will expiate for the crimes of the Germans. Among the nations, the German people will move, wearing the brand of Cain far into the remotest future.</p>
