   <p>The Spolek Ceskych Pravniku (Bohemian Lawyers' Association) held a special meeting on the premises of the Probate Court to consider the coming election and unanimously agreed to recommend to Bohemian voters the candidacy of Alderman Otto Kerner and that of Judge Joseph Sabath, both of whom the Democratic party puts up for the office of Judge of the Circuit Court. The meeting was presided over by Joseph C. Pisa and enjoyed a large attendance. A resolution was adopted, signed by Members Vitera, Ring, Churan, Truc, and Chotek, by President Pisa, and by Secretary Bicek, in which satisfaction is expressed with the nomination of two Bohemian-American lawyers, nominations, which should be considered as a compliment to the Spolek Ceskych Pravniku.</p>
   <p>The Spolek recognizes the great merits of Kerner as alderman for the Twelfth Ward and as chairman of the law committee of the city council and also the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>successful work of Municipal Judge Joseph Sabath. Their experience renders them highly qualified for the office of judge of the Circuit Court. Therefore the Spolek recommends the election of both these Bohemian candidates and feels certain that they will fill the office with dignity and honor.</p>
