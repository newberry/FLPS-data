   <p>Citizen John Kralovec, received from Governor Fifer, his confirmation as park commissioner, signed by Gov. Fifer and by the Secretary of State Pearson. Today, Mr. Kralovec, will deposit the required bond and one week from next Tuesday he will be introduced to the Park Board by his predecessor, Judge Kohlsaat. We feel certain that every Bohemian will agree with us, if we say, that, for this responsible office, there could not have been found a more capable countryman and that the Bohemian Nationality will have a dignified representative in Mr. Kralovec.</p>
