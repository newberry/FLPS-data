   <p>After the successful and enthusiastic meeting held last Friday, we feel obliged to appeal to the Sokol organizations and other associations, as well as to our young men, not to cease their activities because of the considerable number of recruits who have joined the colors up to the present. The first response to the call to arms was satisfactory. We are, however, aware of the fact that only one Sokol organization has furnished a proportional number of recruits commensurate with the seriousness of the situation. We have further noticed that the majority of enlistments came from young immigrants. Will you young men who were born here allow yourselves to lag behind these recently emigrated men, and be outdone in the fulfillment of the duty towards your native land? Keep in mind that for a young, able bodied, and capable man there is no other proper place today but in the United States Army or Navy!"</p>
