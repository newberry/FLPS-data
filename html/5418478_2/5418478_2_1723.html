   <p>A new organization of Bohemian-American dentists of Chicago has just been founded under the name of the Spolek Ceskych Zubnich Lekaru. This organization will endeavor not only to promote further specialized study and the adoption of the newest methods and dental knowledge, but also to inform the public by means of lectures and newspapers about the importance of good sound teeth and how to keep them in good condition.</p>
   <p>Further, their aim is to provide free dental service to all inmates of the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage and the Bohemian Catholics' Orphanage in Lisle, Illinois. Heretofore, this service had been donated according to the best efforts and possibilities of individual dentists for which they were given proper recognition.</p>
   <p>From time to time a social entertainment with the societies of Bohemian physicians and pharmacists will be arranged. All reputable Bohemian <span class="page-break">\2</span>dentists of Chicago and vicinity may become members. About thirty Bohemian dentists were charter members and they elected the following officers; Doctor L. E. Jelinek, president; Doctor John E. Hajicek, vice-president; Doctor Edward Soucek, secretary; Doctor George W. Cisar, treasurer; and Doctor Irwin G. Jirka, librarian.</p>
