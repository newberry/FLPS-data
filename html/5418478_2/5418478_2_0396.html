   <p>A few days after the news had reached this country that Germany has made peace offers, a considerable decrease in the number of subscriptions for the Fourth Liberty Loan became evident. This can be explained by the fact that some people think the war is coming to an end, and, therefore, no more money is needed for its prosecution.</p>
   <p>If the German peace proposals were made for the explicit purpose of impeding the progress of the campaign, they certainly came at the right time to do the intended damage, for they provided some people with flimsy excuses in evading their duty--people who never would have met their obligations. This, in our estimation, is the reason for the shrinkage.</p>

   <p>The falling off in the purchase of bonds will, however, be only temporary. Patriotic sentiment and enthusiasm will most assuredly be aroused in the last week of the campaign; the quota will be reached, and the Loan oversubscribed by millions. This will again place necessary funds at the disposal of the government, and be a pertinent answer to the German approachment. No one has, of course, the slightest doubt that the end of the World War is drawing near but to speed it up, it is imperative that everybody support the government, thus lending it the means for a quick enforcement of peace, which will be dictated by the Allies, and not by Austria and Germany.</p>
