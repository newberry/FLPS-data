   <p>The auditorium of Sokol Havlíček Tyrš, Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street, was filled by the largest crowd in its history yesterday afternoon. At the same time it welcomed two distinguished and sympathetic guests, Dr. Milan Rastislav Štefáník, one of the greatest sons of downtrodden Slovakia, who was sent out to inform the world of the plight and the just demands of his country; and Count Demotal, colonel in the French Army and military attache in Washington, D. C., who is representing our friends and brothers, the French nation, to whom the Czechs and the Slovaks have ever been attached by ties of sincerest friendship. Their visit supports a purpose which is certain to be of monumental importance for the Czechoslovak cause. Štefáník and Demotal appeared before the largest crowd that ever thronged any of our Czech Chicago halls. These men came to plead for the creation of a Czechoslovak army as a compact unit. The nucleus of this army, which already exists, is the result of untiring work by that old gentlemen, Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, in <span class="page-break">\2</span>collaboration with the Česko-Slovenská Narodní Rada (Czecho-Slovak National Council). This army is expected to give substantial weight to the common demands of the Slavonic peoples when the terms of peace will be discussed.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's meeting, with the consent of the Government in Washington, the first firm foundations were laid for the recruiting of the army. The Česko-Slovenská Výbor (Czecho-Slovak Committee), sponsor of the movement, is composed of representatives of the Czech National Alliance, the Slovak League, and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics.</p>
   <p>When the two distinguished guests were ushered in by leaders of the Czech National Alliance, and the band played the "Marseillaise," the patriotic commotion defied description.</p>
   <p>The platform was decorated with the colors of the Allied nations. A large picture frame was very aptly placed on the stage with the photographs of the thirty-two members of Havlíček-Tyrš who were the first to enlist for <span class="page-break">\3</span>service and are now fighting on various fronts. Among them was the likeness of that enthusiastic patriot, Anton Nedelka, who was the first to give his life for the cause of humanity.</p>
   <p>Both Dr. Štefáník and Colonel Demotal wore the uniforms of officers in the Flying Corps of the French Army. Štefáník's chest glittered with four medals which he had won by his daring exploits in the French Army. Both guests were given the place of honor in the center of the platform.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, first greeted Colonel Demotal, introducing him as the official representative of the Republic of France. The Colonel came, Dr. Fisher stated, to attest to the Franco-Czech solidarity which has been sanctified by the blood of Czech soldiers upon the battlefields of France.</p>
   <p>Dr. Štefáník was introduced to the tumultuously jubilant multitude as a member of the Slovak group whom every Czech would begrudge our brothers, the Slovaks, if he had not demonstrated a thousand times that his heart <span class="page-break">\4</span>beats equally for all the Slav nations.</p>
   <p>Dr. Štefáník then took the platform, first speaking in the Slovak language, but continuing in faultless Bohemian. In spite of his unassuming way and the absence of oratorical phrases in the delivery of his address, the audience was moved. This was repeatedly demonstrated by the loud applause of the audience.</p>
   <p>The speaker outlined the purposes which brought him to the United States. He has come as a representative of the Czechoslovak National Council to obtain permission from the United States Government to build an independent Czechoslovak army which would given every Slav the opportunity to do his duty. He stressed the fact that the time in which we now live is too critical for hollow phrases. We must state our demands frankly, and we must learn what is expected of us. It is necessary that the situation of our people at home and in foreign countries be analyzed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>What are our aims at home? The speaker proposed this question and answered it. Our aim at home is to make the masses and the individuals conscious of their nationality; to organize them; and to remove all obstacles which might involve danger. One of the preliminary requirements must be the unification of all Czechoslovak political parties, whatever their nature may be. If a nation is to be independent, its members must first make some moral progress; for, he who is a scoundrel in private life will do mischief in public and national life also. There cannot be any misgivings about our people at home. They have unanimously accepted Professor T. G. Masaryk's program which is based upon complete liberty. We have lived through enough slavery, and no more compromises with Germans or Magyars are possible.</p>
   <p>Those of our people who live beyond the borders of our old homeland have before them the task of organization.</p>
   <p>At this point Štefáník described the progress made in organizing, the chief result of which was the creation of the Czechoslovak National Council which <span class="page-break">\6</span>is to become the supreme forum of all Slavic nations, regardless of the difference in language.</p>
   <p>It is to the sole credit of Masaryk, Dr. Edward Beneš, and other inspired leaders that the whole world knows about the aims of the Slavs today, i.e., that the independence of a Czechoslovak state be established at the peace conference.</p>
   <p>True enough, Czechoslovak independence has not been formally announced as a condition of peace by the Allies, as was the liberation of Belgium and Serbia. However, Czechoslovak independence will become a reality if the Slavs will do their duty. The main responsibility for this work rests upon the shoulders of the Slavs in America. Their first duty, the speaker declared, consists of voluntary submission to discipline and a judicious distribution of the work at hand. The second duty demands the regular payment of the contributions needed for the prosecution of our aims. The contributions are levied in the form of a national tax.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Dr. Štefáník acknowledged the many gifts that have been sent by America, but he said that the burden of payment was not justly apportioned among the contributors. As it happens in other cases, it was one part of the people who paid, only to make up for the indolence of others who were lax in the fulfillment of their patriotic duties. If every Slav in America did his duty by placing only five cents a day upon the altar of the motherland, the enormous amount of one hundred and fifty million francs could be collected every year. No one would become impoverished by such a procedure, Štefáník assured the audience, and an immense quantity of work could be accomplished.</p>
   <p>A third duty is incumbent upon the Slavs in America, and that is, Štefáník pointed out, organization for military service. Many courageous fighters came from our midst, but that is not enough. Systematic progress is also needed here. He who relies upon the other fellow to win liberty for him is simply not worthy of it. Our task today is primarily to win liberty, and all the details can be taken care of later.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The United States Government has given its consent to the creation of a Czechoslovak army, and this body will have to assert itself upon the battlefields in Europe. A Czechoslovak fighting unit with its own banner will be the safest guarantee that the victory for the Allies will also be a victory for our cause. We have already made many sacrifices, but if we should slacken our efforts at the decisive moment and show that we did not know how to appreciate the great advantage given to us by the governments of the Allied countries as a result of the persistent work of Masaryk and his collaborators--then we would brand our own foreheads with the mark of cowardice.</p>
   <p>Štefáník closed his fiery address by an appeal to the Czechoslovak women. He urged them not to place obstacles in the way of their men who are willing to sacrifice their lives for the patriotic cause, but on the contrary, to support them in all possible ways, following the slogan; "We are not going to bring slaves into the world any more, but children of a free nation."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>"Hej Slované" (Onward, all you Slavs!), Czech national anthem, was sung by the multitude in a long outburst of patriotic ardor.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher then began his address by declaring that from the very first moment of the war, there could not have been any doubt about what side the Czechs and other Slavs would take. But our people knew that they could not be given liberty, even by the Allies, unless they win it by their own hands. This furnished the impulse for the formation of a Czechoslovak legion; this also caused the people in the old country to proclaim their demands for independence through their representatives in the Austrian parliament. Thus today the whole world knows that we are not, and do not want to be Austrians, and that the Czechoslovak problem must be solved by the peace treaty. This solution, however, must be brought about by our fighting.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak National Council has made every effort toward the establishment of the Czechoslovak army, which should become an efficient cog in the gigantic wheel of the international struggle and work for the Allies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>This has been granted to us. What will our attitude be? Our boys have gone through the hell-fire of many a bloody battle, and they are again joining the forces. All of our settlements overseas have joined the movement, and we Czechoslovaks in America are called upon to follow their example. It is up to every Czechoslovak who is not burdened with care for his family to prove that his patriotism is honest and sincere.</p>
   <p>Tumultuous applause greeted Dr. Fisher when he declared in a loud voice that he would consider himself a pitiful example of a Czech patriot if he himself did not practice what he preaches to others. The speaker then turned to Dr. Štefáník and requested him to announce to Professor Masaryk that he, Dr. Fisher, is the first to offer his services to the Czechoslovak army, and that he is ready to give his life for the old motherland. He closed with an appeal to the Sokol societies to be true to the teachings of Tyrš, and to form a group of volunteers to fight upon French soil.</p>
   <p>The strains of "Kde Domov Muj" (Where Is My Home) played by the band and <span class="page-break">\11</span>sung by every man and woman, mingled with the tumultuous applause which followed Dr. Fisher's address.</p>
   <p>The audience was pleasantly surprised by Colonel Demotal, the next speaker. Everyone was expecting to hear him speak in French, his native tongue. Instead, he spoke in fluent English, although he has a pronounced French accent. After mentioning the courage of the French Army and the devoted-ness of French women, he greeted the Czechs and Slovaks as friends of his nation and as standard-bearers of common ideals. He reached out for Dr. Štefáník's hand while thousands of voices shouted "Vive La France!"</p>
   <p>"Awaken in the name of justice, awaken in the name of liberty!" These were the parting words of the speaker. The "Marseillaise" was played while the Colonel was loudly acclaimed.</p>
   <p>Karel Pergler, the next speaker, made reference to the proclamation of independence of the Czechs and Slovaks, which was issued by their representatives <span class="page-break">\12</span>in the Austrian parliament. Mr. Pergler pointed to the fact that even the Czech Socialists have joined the independence movement, and he urged all able-bodied Czechoslovak Socialists to enlist in the army.</p>
   <p>After this address the leaders left for the Pilsen Brewery Park pavilion, where the Czechoslovaks Catholics were holding a large festival. Mr. Joseph Tvrzický, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, remained and closed the meeting with a short address. The business of signing up for the army was then attended to. The number of volunteers is growing rapidly.</p>
   <p>The United States Government is looking favorably upon the formation of the new army. Secretary of War Baker issued an appeal to the Slav population to build up an army. Yesterday's meeting proved that the Czechoslovaks will heed these appeals.</p>
