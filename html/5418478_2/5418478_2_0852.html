We feel the painful throb in a mother's heart....but her son is going to fight for a cause dear to Czechs and Americans alike. Just let her think of Czech mothers in the old homeland who must sacrifice their sons and see them slaughtered for the benefit of Austria, which is bent upon murdering and destroying our people....</p>
