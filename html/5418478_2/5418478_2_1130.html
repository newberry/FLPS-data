   <p>For reasons unknown to us, but certainly shady ones, reports are being circulated that our Czech banks are facing default. Their purpose can only be to undermine the sound financial structure of our institutions and thus shake the faith of the community. Exactly one month has passed since the news of the United States' severing diplomatic relations with Germany became known, and almost simultaneously our people, in all walks of life, began to receive intimations over the telephone tending to disquiet them concerning the security of deposits. Others were addressed directly. Last week, those conspiring criminals, for they are nothing else, concentrated their pernicious activities upon concerns located on 26th Street, and among these particularly the National Lawndale Bank. The investigations begun by police have not brought any tangible result as yet. Competitors, who themselves are sitting in a glass house, may have a hand in the dirty game, and are trying to save themselves by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>this whispering compaign. Or, perhaps some evil spirits, knowing that we all are preparing for the Czech bazaar, where we shall contribute to our national patriotic work, are trying to create a panic in the minds of the people and thereby dissuade them from parting with their money for our patriotic cause. We cannot answer, but the conspicuous point of the issue remains in the fact that the rumors began when the United States took a decisive step in breaking with Germany, which brought us nearer to the fulfillment of our wishes.</p>
   <p>Any person ever so slightly acquainted with the conditions of our state and national institutions cannot be frightened by such insidious rumors. But there are some who still are under the impression that some foreign, and recently two Czech-American, institutions have broken down, and who in the excitement will lend an ear to reports of any sort. It is to these people we appeal to not take part in any run on their bank before they have investigated, and to not rashly undertake anything that would <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>play into the hands of the crooks who want to precipitate a panic, whatever the motives for their actions may be. Anyone who was approached by these scandalmongers will ingratiate himself not only to his bank but to the whole community if he finds out and reports the names of the persons who are spreading these false alarms.</p>
   <p>We have learned that one of the malefactors is an employee of a German wholesale house which supplies ham and other smoked meat to some of our Czech butchers. Another instance is furnished by the salesgirl in a business house of foreign nationality who is said to have come home from the store, on 26th street, breathless, and shouting that a run had been started on the Lawndale Bank. We have been unable to establish the source of this rumor.</p>
   <p>A man entered the First National Bank last Friday and attempted to pass a bad check; he was seized, and police occupied the doors. This incident <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>was sufficient to cause people to suspect something wrong.</p>
   <p>Once more, fellow-countrymen, we want to admonish you to keep your composure. Don't let yourself be bamboozled into an action you might be sorry to have undertaken! Our supervised Czech-American state and national banks are perfectly safe! Do not play into the hands of malevolent persons who are antagonistic to our Czech enterprises and are perhaps enemies of the entire Czech nation!</p>
