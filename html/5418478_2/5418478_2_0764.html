   <p>Sokol uniforms and picturesque Czech, Slovak, and Moravian costumes will lend a colorful aspect to the mass meeting at which Mr. Marcel Knecht, representative of the French Government, will be welcomed by Chicago Czechs and Slovaks in the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery Park Friday evening. This will be another event of great importance. It will be given world-wide publicity. Not only the Czech, Slovak, and American press will give it abundant space, but Allied papers, particularly the French, will devote extensive editorial comments to it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knecht has come to our country to make close contact between France and America for the purpose of furthering co-operation in the pursuit of our aim, i. e., ultimate victory in the World War. Our guest is a sincere friend of the Czech nation and a close acquaintance of Dr. Milan R. Stefanik, vice-president <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the Czechoslovak National Council (of which Professor T. G. Masaryk is the president)..... Mr. Knecht's visit here is of immense importance for the cause of liberation of the Czech people.</p>
