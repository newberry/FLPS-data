   <p>The great masses of our people have not yet a full understanding of the importance of the office of judge and of the judicial elections. Hence, there is a justifiable apprehension that the coming judicial election will be just as poorly participated in as has been the rule with previous judicial elections. The election of judges should be receiving greater attention than any other local or county election. It does not help in the least to have good laws if those who administer them are incompetent. What good would be capable officials, men working conscientiously for the public, if their efforts were to be nullified by injunctions issued by men who should not be sitting on the bench? Our workingmen should be particularly interested in the coming election, and should give their votes only to candidates whom they know for certain to be just to the laboring classes, and firm enough to refuse to become tools of the enemies and exploiters of labor.</p>
