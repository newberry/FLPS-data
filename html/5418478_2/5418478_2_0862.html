   <p>The Naredni Socialisticka Delnicka Beseda Fresl (National Socialist Working-men's Club Fresl) is deeply interested in the mental recreation provided for our boys in camps or trenches. Every sheet of hews or page of literature is eagerly accepted and greatly appreciated by soldiers far away from their homes. The Czech public is requested to leave newspapers, magazines, or books, already perused by them, in these substations: Andelova Kavarna (Andel's Cafe), 1651 Blue Island Avenue; Anton Podlipny, 1829 South Throop Street; Frank Masa, 1834 South May Street; and others.</p>
