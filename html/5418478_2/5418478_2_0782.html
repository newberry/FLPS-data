   <p>Brothers: We live in a time when every man, woman, and even every child is called on to make sacrifices in order that this war into which our Republic was drawn against its will may end with a victory for humanity and justice; in order that this violent, repulsive militarism which has driven the whole world into hell-fire and destruction be forever downed.</p>
   <p>It is now generally admitted that world-wide peace can be secured only by a victory for the Allies, and it is the duty of everyone to work with all his power toward this end. No sacrifice must seem too great for us.</p>
   <p>The Sokol organizations also are going through a harassing trial. We are anticipating with great joy the victory which will bring independence to our nation; but Dr. Milan R. Stefanik, who was sent to us by the Allied war council, declared that if we are eager to win liberty for our old homeland, we shall <span class="page-break">2</span>have to show that we are worthy of such a boon. He declared that our own dignity would not permit us merely to look at the struggle from afar, to let men of other nations fight and shed their blood, and then to appear as claimants of the fruits of their victory. Our brothers from the prison camps have already spoken. After terrible suffering they have joined the Allied ranks and now face misery for a second time in the fight for freedom of the old homeland. At the same time, however, they are turning toward America, longing and wondering how the Sokols in America will stand up for our cause.</p>
   <p>And here, Brothers, let us remember the words uttered by Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, at a memorable meeting in Chicago. He spoke about the patriotic duties of the Sokol organizations:</p>
   <p>"I am addressing myself especially to you, brother Sokols, who have brought the great teachings from the suffocating atmosphere of Austrian tyranny so that they may shine with new brilliancy; that they may begin to blossom again; that <span class="page-break">3</span>they may speak the word at a time when several millions of our Czech brothers and sisters are waiting in suspense to hear what the Sokols in America, the heirs of the teachings of Tyrs, will answer in this crucial hour. Remember what Tyrs professed fifty years ago; how he shaped the program for the activities of the Sokols in the future:</p>
   <p>"'Not the glorious history, not the constant allusions to it, but a healthy, vigorous present--a present rich in sacrifices of its sons--alone insures a better future for a nation.'</p>
   <p>"Thus taught Tyrs in the sixties of the last century and these words, my brothers, have not lost their validity and meaning for the Sokols. We should, indeed, keep them persistently in mind, especially at this portentous time. Remember also how often Tyrs referred to the magnificent examples in ancient Greek history, in those times when Hellas was sure of its liberty because of the mighty chests and courage of her sons. Remember that Tyrs's ideals strove to uplift the sons of his beloved nation so that they might reach a similar level <span class="page-break">4</span>of harmony of their physical and mental powers; that he endeavored to teach the youth of his nation what self-denial means; and that self-interest should count for naught--and the nation and its welfare for everything.</p>
   <p>The spirit of Tyrs is revived--the same Tyrs who in the year 1866 asked permission for his comrades and himself to help stem the tide of the German hordes that was driving through the passes of the mountains to invade Bohemia--that spirit is coming back to see whether we have preserved Sokol ideals in our hearts; those true, conscious, and united Sokol ideals--or whether we are mere flag-waving would-be heroes who are not worthy even to utter the name of our dear departed leader."</p>
   <p>This is what the president of the Czech National Alliance said of the duties incumbent upon the Sokols in America at present.</p>
   <p>Brothers: We agree with every word pronounced by that speaker relating to the <span class="page-break">5</span>duties of the Sokols today. We do not belong to those who, while carried away by enthusiasm, close their eyes to reality; who do not want to face the numerous obstacles which confront the endeavor of the Sokols in America, obstacles which may cuase the Sokols to fulfill the hopes placed in them to a somewhat lesser degree than is expected of them.</p>
   <p>One reason for this is that the flower of our Sokol members joined the Allied forces even before war was declared here. Those young men who were left joined the American Army and Navy as volunteers at the first appeal by President Wilson. Finally, those who did not join as volunteers were drafted, while others are awaiting the call to arms. The interest of the Sokols in America bids us mention this condition. This is done so that people will not be misled and pass harsh judgment upon us if we should not be able to send young men into the newly-created Czechoslovak Army in the numbers expected of us.</p>
   <p>But, Brothers, there are many among us who are exempted from active military service because of age. There are many who are under no familial obligations. Some have not become citizens of the United States and so are not subject to <span class="page-break">6</span>compulsory service in this country. To all these persons we direct our appeal, expecting them to show that Sokols do not talk, but do their duty. Signed: J. Cermak, president; Cyril Popelka, secretary; V. Vonasek, manager.</p>
