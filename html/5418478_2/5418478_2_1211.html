   <p>One good result of the European war is that the United States is now manufacturing materials which previously had to be imported from Germany. Among such articles are aniline dyes, potassium and other items absolutely essential to certain types of American industry. These had to be imported from Germany and cost many millions of dollars each year. When all exports from Germany were halted by the war, means were sought to replace them by their manufacture at home. Some of them will soon be available to our industries. Mr. Edison has invented a new way of making aniline and will soon manufacture two million pounds of it yearly. He will also manufacture carbolic acid, or phenol, which, previously, could only be purchased from Europe. Thus our great scientist and inventor has found a means by which to save, and keep in the United States, the sixteen million dollars paid to Europe every year for potassium salts used by us in the manufacture of artificial fertilizers.</p>
