   <p>When President Wilson, on the occasion of the Decoration Day celebration at Arlington Cemetery, said, "greater days are coming for this country than any through which she has lived before, and those who hold the highest offices in the country must be sure to incorporate into everything they say and do the best there is in the United States," he could have said nothing more true, more proper, and more justified.</p>
   <p>Verily, great days are coming for this Republic. She must decide definitely what stand she will take toward a country that, with the help of a subservient and enslaved people, is trying to plunge the whole world into a fratricidal war. President Wilson now faces the duty of replying to the shameless note from Berlin, a note that has been delivered after sixteen days of deliberation, and that not only fails to give an answer to demands which the United States makes as a result of the terrible crime committed on the steamship "Lusitania," but contrives to be evasive in places where it is not directly insulting.</p>
   <p>Predictions in Washington concerning the reply of the United States to this impudent note are to the effect that President Wilson will recede not an iota from his original demands. In fact, the President cannot do anything else. He cannot accept the German proposal to start an investigation concerning the "Lusitania's" cargo. In the first place, the proposal is an insult to the American Government, because it implies a doubt of the truth of the statement of federal port authorities in New York that the "Lusitania" was not armed. Neither can he start any diplomatic conversations, because these would become protracted indefinitely for the purpose of giving German submarines time and opportunity to continue their murderous activities. President Wilson is well aware that by inaugurating such conversations be would be falling into a trap set for him by the "overly wise" German diplomacy.</p>
   
   <p>If the German proposal for arbitration or investigation were honest and sincere, Germany would have to discontinue the practices which are a part of the question that is to be subject to arbitration or investigation. That the Germans are not at all ready to do this is proved by yesterday's news concerning the sinking of merchantmen, not only British, but also neutral ones, Portuguese, Danish, and one which was American, although it flew a British flag.</p>
   <p>Should the United States agree to an investigation, it would, by that very act, concede that it is not quite certain of its own position. It would be a confession of having acted in haste and without due deliberation by serving Germany with a note containing such far-reaching demands. Hence it is quite clear that after Wilson's--that is to say, Bryan's--very definitely worded note there is no going back.</p>
   <p>It may be said, though, that the Germans do not admit that the problem concerns their method of submarine warfare; that the investigation should concern only specific facts in a specific case; that Germany does not offer to permit the arbitration or investigation of the German method in this kind of warfare, and that the method does not have to be discontinued because of the conduct of investigations of the sinking of the "Gulflight," "Cushing," and "Lusitania," provided, of course, that the German proposals for such investigations are to be taken at all at their face value. [Translator's note: The Bohemian text is not quite clear, at least now and to the translator, no doubt because it refers to a note whose content was clearly in mind of all readers at that time, and the author of the article did not feel he had to be more explicit.] But such an attitude would be completely untenable. The American Government considers the method of submarine warfare as part and parcel of the three cases. It considers this campaign as in contradiction to all conceptions of present-day civilization, if there is such a thing as civilization; it condemns it as the resurrection of the barbarous practices of the Middle Ages, and demands its discontinuance not in the name of the United States, but in the name of humanity. The fault of German diplomacy is that it has misunderstood, purposely or unwittingly, President Wilson's lofty point of view.</p>
   <p>The clear realization of the fact that the note in question does not refer merely to the three mentioned cases, but refers to the whole principle of submarine warfare, will help in realizing how shallow, evasive, and arrogant is the German reply, a reply drafted by an autocracy that loves to look condescendingly on American "shirt-sleeve" diplomats. Germany would like to see America tied down with one phase of the problem while the problem as a whole would be pushed into the background. The future would be quite insecure while there would be haggling going on over compensation for past offenses. In this way the United States would be kept busy indefinitely.</p>
   <p>Such a condition is absolutely unacceptable to the United States. The United States has a quarrel with Germany concerning the principles to be applied in waging the war on Europe's bloody plains, and the United States must take a definite stand in regard to these principles, a thing she should have done before when the German barbarians invaded Belgium, but which she failed to do, to her own and the whole of humanity's terrible sorrow and disadvantage. Once the United States has become involved in the whole matter, being pulled into it by the Germans themselves, she must not back out from the stand taken in her note concerning the "Lusitania". Germany must be taught clearly to understand that in this conflict, provoked needlessly by her lackeys in Vienna, she stands all alone among all democratic and liberal-minded nations. The intervention by the United States does not have to mean war, and hardly will mean it, if public opinion in the country has any value or any influence. The people of the United States are definitely against war; there cannot be any question about that. But the people of the United States are equally against leading the German government to believe that Germany may commit any act of rudeness toward the United States and the whole world, just because the United States is not an armed camp, while Germany is one. There are many means by which to make the Prussians understand that their terrorism is not the supreme argument. And President Wilson is just the man who may be expected to take the proper course in this difficult problem.</p>
