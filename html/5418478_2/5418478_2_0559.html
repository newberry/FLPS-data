   <p>"Az Do Tech Hrdel a Statku!" This idiomatic phrase, coined by Professor T. G. Masaryk, is the equivalent for our "Give till it hurts!" It is the slogan of all Czech-Americans who are determined to do everything in their power to help assure victory for the United States against Germany. The Czechs gladly offer their lives and their money for the successful prosecution of the war. Czechs of this country are fully aware of the importance of the war. They are, let us put it blandly, more conscious of the significance of this struggle than the native Americans themselves.</p>
   <p>The Czechs know that America's victory in this war is not the only issue in question. They know that the fate of small oppressed nations is at stake, their liberty and right of self-determination. Among these nations is included our Czech nation. It may be small geographically, and its population may not run into large numbers, but it is great by the mental maturity of its people. It is great by its love for liberty, and it is great by its love and gratitude for this country which has drawn the sword in the interest of the Czechs also.</p>
   <p>The Third Liberty Loan issue has met with pronounced success as far as the Czechs are concerned. This splendid showing, although not expected to such a high degree, was most conspicuous in the Seventh Federal Reserve District which comprises the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, part of Michigan, and northern Indiana. It was in this section of the country that the Czechs surpassed all expectations. This was due to the perfect organization within the Czech section for the propagation of the Third Liberty Loan, and the vigorous agitation by the various committees. The Czech section was specially authorized by the United States Government and given full power in the Seventh District. The remarkable progress made by the Czechs is due not only to the perfect system adopted by the Czech section, or the arduous exertion of its workers and the full co-operation of our men, women, and children, but it is primarily due to the thorough understanding by our people of the great significance of this struggle--it is the intense love of liberty and democracy for which our armies are battling, and in which they will surely be victorious. It is the beautiful traits adorning the character of our Czech people which have helped produce such unqualified results.</p>
   <p>In mentioning the praise bestowed by non-Czechs upon us for our work, we do not imply that we ourselves are, just for that matter, satisfied with our achievements. We are out for more. We want to overshadow all other nationalities in this country. We want to stand first, even against the Germans, of whom there are five times our number. We shall be able to do this if we exert ourselves a little more. Let us state right here that those of our men and women who have enrolled as workers in the Czech section have assumed a serious responsibility. They have fulfilled this duty up to the present, and are determined to continue. It was resolved, for this reason, to designate tomorrow as Czech Day. Be it well understood that this day is not one on which to celebrate, but that it should be a day of strenuous work, of agitation for the Third Liberty Loan. It shall serve to intensify the interest of our people for the campaign.</p>
   <p>Those who have not subscribed to date should do so now. Those who have subscribed should buy more if circumstances permit them to do so. Such is the purpose of Czech Day, and it must be carried out under any circumstances. Anyone can see that the time is short for making preparations for particular festivities. There is, however, ample good will and incentive for work. What counts mostly is the confidence placed in the Czech people whose full co-operation is expected. We reported yesterday that a meeting was held last Tuesday in which a special committee was formed to take charge of the arrangements for Czech Day. This committee set to work immediately, remaining in session throughout the night. The members had very little sleep during the night, and they began to function Wednesday morning.</p>
   <p>The first subject discussed by the special committee was the decoration of Czech houses. Although the committee was certain of the general co-operation of the community, it sent deputations to almost all business houses on the main streets, urging them to decorate. Our Czech public is further being informed about another very important matter. The leader and idol of the Czech people, Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, will arrive in Chicago next Sunday. There will be celebrations in his honor, and decorations will appear as a matter of course. Decorations may, therefore, be left on the houses from Friday to Sunday. This will help make Czech Day and Professor Masaryk's arrival really magnificent. Every effort should be made, at any rate, to flood the streets with flags, indeed, to transform them into a veritable sea of decorations. Let us not forget that hundreds of guests will come to us on Czech Day, among them numerous influential men in close contact with the Federal Government. They are to witness our enthusiasm and the splendor of our celebration. He who fails to decorate on Czech Day will act directly contrary to our efforts and endeavors. Such a person surely does not exist among us and, let us hope, never will.</p>
   <p>Those who use vehicles should not take them out on Friday unless they are decorated with the national colors, and, if feasible, fitted out with posters, slogans, and pictures advertising the Third Liberty Loan drive. It does not matter where you are sending your vehicles; if they are properly decorated they will attract public attention everywhere and so proclaim to the people of Chicago that the Czechs stand behind the drive to the last man.</p>
   <p>Czech Day is going to be, above all, a day for our flying squads. They will begin in the morning and swiftly cover thousands of dwellings in the Czech settlement, seeking to obtain the largest possible number of subscriptions. There will be many Czechs who apply at their neighborhood banks and branch offices of the Czech section, and in general, wherever subscriptions are accepted. To obtain the best of results for the Third Liberty Loan drive is the purpose underlying Czech Day.</p>
