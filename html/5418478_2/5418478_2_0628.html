   <p>In January of this year, in the historic city of Prague, Bohemia, events of monumental importance occurred. The Czech and Slovak representatives in the Austrian parliament declared themselves in a most determined manner for a completely independent Czechoslovak state. Their declaration re-echoed in large meetings of all Czechoslovak workingmen's organizations which took a definite, determined stand alongside of their representatives against the Austrian government. They vowed to achieve a final victory. This fight is going to be a bloody one, judging by the reply made by the Austrian premier, who presages a relentless suppression of the movement. Everyone who is even slightly acquainted with the usual methods of the Austrian government can guess what this means. It means new persecutions--throwing our leaders into prison and dragging them upon the scaffold. Our Czech fellow countrymen in the motherland are not afraid of this threat, and it is incumbent upon all Czechoslovaks in America to lend them as much support as possible.</p>
   <p>In order to initiate the movement to aid them, a mass meeting was called by the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, the Slovak League, and kindred Jugoslav organizations. It was held last night in the hall of Sokol Havlíček-Tyrš, Lawndale Avenue near 26th Street. The situation was thoroughly discussed, and a resolution was passed by means of which the attention of a large part of the American public is to be drawn to our cause, thus reaching influential circles, and even President Wilson.</p>
   <p>Mr. Krbec, president of the Chicago district of the Czech National Alliance, opened the meeting with a survey of recent events in the motherland, weighing their possible effect upon the American public, and the attitude which President Wilson might assume. He also pointed out ways in which we Czechs and Slovaks of America should support the movement. Large enlistments in the Czechoslovak army in France is one of them. Those who cannot enlist should do their bit by patriotic detail work at home. After this introduction, Mr. Krbec presented the first speaker, Mr. Joseph Tvrzický, secretary of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzický presented a summary of the thoughts and attitudes of all true Czechs, and assured the audience that in spite of the length of the war, the Czechs will remain true to the traditions and principles to which they claimed allegiance at the outset of these decisive times. Regardless of some "screech owls" who hope that our nation will be satisfied with concessions which the Austrian government is offering, in spite of occasional fears, Czech representatives and the Czech people refused to accept alms and proclaimed themselves for independence, submitting their demands to the entire world, which will undoubtedly accept them.</p>
   <p>There cannot be any question about Czechoslovak independence. The justice of it is admitted even by the Germans in Bohemia and Moravia. The proclamation by our nation is an echo from the times of John Huss. It is a moral victory and has to be taken as such, for it dates from a moment when even the Allies stood wavering in the face of a critical situation in the World War, when Russia was sinking and the Bolsheviks were spelling the doom of everything Slav.</p>
   <p>In these momentous times, the Czechs have stepped forth with their demands in order to save the whole situation. This was admitted even by Dr. Seydler, Austrian premier. The Czechs not only demand an independent Czechoslovak state, but they consider it an accomplished fact. They show this by demanding full powers to vote at any conference on peace proposals.</p>
   <p>Complete approval of the declaration of independence as promulgated in the motherland is to be expressed at this mass meeting. The American public, as well as Congress and the President, are to be informed about the results. We have long been waiting for the great event--this demonstration. Now that it has arrived, we cannot but persist in this fight to the finish, calling out in loud and clear tones, "May darkness cover him who quits--a traitor!" It is our duty to call on American democracy to act now in the spirit of the great democracy and recognize self-determination for all nations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzický then read excerpts from the Narodní Listy (National Newspaper), quoting Czech parliamentarians and relating scenes in the Austrian parliament. We wish to advise our readers that they may find the complete article on another page of this issue; it has been edited by the Press Bureau of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak state has thus become a reality. The question now is whether we stand firmly behind it. This will be answered by the results, mainly by numerous enlistments in the Czechoslovak Army and by vigorous support of it. Mr. Tvrzický's speech was rewarded by warm applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schustek, district president of the Slovak League, followed. He emphasized the fact that, at first, the Allies did not pay much attention to our movement.</p>
   
   <p>This was evident from the English language press. He referred particularly to an editorial about us which was printed in yesterday's Chicago Tribune, a paper not too close to us. This article, however, speaks favorably of our cause, which proves that sentiment has changed considerably. Public opinion is the deciding factor, and this will assure our success in the same way as the Czechoslovak Army, which should mirror the whole nation. After the war, it will be the people who will dictate the peace terms. The people should therefore become our friends, and we have to win their sympathy in order to secure co-operation.</p>
   <p>After this address, Mr. Kaspar was introduced as a salesman for war-savings stamps, and the audience was urged to buy liberally.</p>
   <p>Dr. [Jaroslav F.] Smetanka spoke in the English language for the benefit of the English language newsmen. He substantiated the claim of the Czechoslovaks, declaring that they are a mature nation and are fully entitled to independence. Poles and Ukrainians, he said, were given a form of independence concerning which the people were denied the right to decide. The Czechs, on the other hand, are seeking independence through the representatives of the people. In this difference there is reflected the determination with which Czechs fight for liberty and will keep on fighting to the last breath. We Czechs in America owe very much to our old homeland, and as a token of acknowledgment of our debt we should join the Czechoslovak Army or work for the cause in some other useful way.</p>
   <p>Mr. Straka spoke for the Czech Catholics. This meeting, he said, was called not only to stimulate our activities, but also to express our joy over the declaration issued by the Czech people in the old homeland and over the courage shown by our people while they stand, so to speak, under the very shadow of the gallows. They proclaimed their will with one mighty call, ignoring any differences in religious or political creeds. According to the example set by them, we should unite our ranks and so prove that Czech blood surges in our veins, that we are sons and daughters of the Czech nation. We can do this by becoming apostles in the cause of Czechoslovak liberty and by spreading it among those whose sentiment is only lukewarm, and who have not learned, up to the present time, to understand that our cause concerns the whole nation. Bearing this in mind, it follows that everyone should help, thereby proving that this meeting has not been held in vain. Mr. Straka also mentioned the recent statements of Lloyd George and President Wilson. They should not disquiet us, for every nation is expected to work out its own salvation. Nor need we fear for our people abroad, for they themselves will know how to get rid of that carcass called "Austria". The speaker exhorted the assembly to be good Americans, to support the Red Cross, and to buy war bonds and savings stamps. At the peace conference, America will uphold the Czechs, and, in recognition of their patriotism, give their demands due consideration.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kristan, former member of the Austrian parliament, spoke for the Slovenians, whose grievances are similar to those of the Czechs. He assured the gathering that there are no Austrians except their emperor and his footmen.</p>
   
   <p>He pointed to Trotsky, the Russian revolutionist, who has declared that the question of peace cannot be left to the discretion of the Hohenzollerns, Hapsburgs, or Austria itself.</p>
   <p>The audience lavished turbulent applause upon every speaker.</p>
   <p>A resolution was passed which advances the following points: The representatives of the three countries once under the Czech crown have declared themselves for an independent Czechoslovak state.....We are in complete agreement with them....and request the right to sit in the peace conference and present our demands.....This resolution is to be conveyed to President Wilson, the Secretary of State, senators, and congressmen. The President is to be entreated kindly to remove the odium of "alien enemies" from our fellow countrymen who have voluntarily joined the United States Army.....The President is assured of our loyalty to him and to this country, our new homeland. We urge our fellow countrymen to support all war measures in every possible manner and to remain, as they have thus far, model citizens of this Republic.</p>
