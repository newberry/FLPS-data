   <p>Tabor, a Czech farmers' colony in the district of Vilas, Wisconsin, directed by J. L. Bumbalek, [invites you to inspect the] forty acre farms in the Czech neighborhood. You can pay $250 down, and we will build the house; we will also plough two acres of the soil. There will be no payments during three years, balance on long term payments. In event of your death, your family will receive a clear title to the farm, and payments on the farm will cease.</p>
   <p>There is a good market in the summer resort for your vegetables, small fruits, poultry, and dairy products. Write today for particulars of our plan, and your communication will be handled by a Czech, a graduate of the Wisconsin Agricultural College.</p>
