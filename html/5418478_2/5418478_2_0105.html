   <p>In addition to the election of able city employees, the voters will be called upon to decide nine important questions which will be presented to them next Tuesday on the so-called "small ballot". This ballot is really much larger than the ballot containing names of the candidates.....</p>
   <p>In the first place it is the question of approving expenditures totaling $3,972,000 for various public works and improvements, some of which are really necessary, and the approval of the bonds to finance these improvements becomes imperative.....One of these proposals concerns a bond issue of $500,000 necessary to finish the work on the contagious hospital which needs an addition in the form of a pavilion for the nurses.....This issue should be approved.....The same applies to the expenditure of $60,000 for the remodeling of the John Worty School at Gage's farm near Riverside. Not less important is the <span class="page-break">\2</span>third question asking for $250,000 for a farm colony to be attached to the Bridewell.....All other large cities have such farms, and it is time that Chicago had one also.</p>
   <p>The fourth proposal concerns $700,000 for a garbage incinerator. So far this work has been done by a private firm which has been making huge profits. The establishment of such an incinerator will save a great deal of money for the taxpayers, and the issue should, therefore, be approved.....</p>
   <p>The fifth issue really should not be discussed at all. It concerns $600,000 for playgrounds for children, places for sports and games, public swimming pools, and similar necessities.....</p>
   <p>The necessity for the above-mentioned improvements is clearly apparent, and there is no reason why our voters should not sanction them.</p>
   <p>The sixth and seventh proposals deal with the building and remodeling of fire <span class="page-break">\3</span>stations and police stations....Many arguments for and against the necessity of a bond issue to pay for such matters have been offered.....But it would seem that....such expenditures should be covered from the current income of the City, and we therefore recommend that voters oppose these two issues....Neither new fire stations nor new police stations are necessary, and whatever may have to be done in this respect should be paid from Chicago's regular income.</p>
   <p>Other questions deal with the incorporating of the villages of Clearing, Elmwood Park, the town of Blue Island, and a small community near Norwood Park with the municipality of Chicago. The incorporation of such communities is just a question of time and will come sooner or later. Citizens who wish to see our city grow will vote for the incorporation, and it is to be expected that these proposals will be approved by large majorities. However, the principal struggle in such matters takes place in such communities themselves, and without the approval of the respective communities no such incorporation <span class="page-break">\4</span>can take place.</p>
   <p>The last proposal....concerns the division of firemen into two shifts, that is, introduction of day and night work. It is called the "Double Platoon System," and if approved it will crown with victory a long struggle of thousands of firemen.....They desire at least as much of family life as any common laborer enjoys. The Firemen's Association is a member of the American Federation of Labor and had the proposal approved in the General Assembly last year.....But a rider accompanied the bill of approval requiring the sanction of the voters, and no honest man or woman should think of withholding it.....</p>
   <p>Our voters should vote by placing a cross behind the word "Yes" in all cases but the one concerning the remodeling of fire stations and police stations where a cross should be marked behind the word "No".</p>
