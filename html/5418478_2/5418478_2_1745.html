   <p>Mr. Miles F. Havlíček, our fellow countryman, was graduated with excellent marks from the Normal College of the North American Gymnastic Union in Indianapolis, Indiana, and was appointed instructor at Culver Military Academy of Culver, Indiana. Four years ago he represented Chicago at the International Gymnastic Tournament at Denver, Colorado, winning high honors; he also excelled in 1916 in the Normal College tournament. Chicago and Indianapolis, Indiana, are indebted to him for his work as a Boy Scout organizer. He was born in Chicago twenty-five years ago.</p>
