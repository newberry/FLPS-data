   <p>Full page advertisements in the form of an "Appeal to the American People" have been published lately in many American newspapers with the intention of embarrassing the Government of this Republic in its attitude of strict neutrality and of artificially creating public sentiment in favor of a course of action injurious to the best interests of the country.</p>
   <p>The "Appeal" was signed by newspapers whose publishers did not understand the real intention of the document and did not realize its full text. Their signatures were obtained by false pretenses.</p>
   <p>It is true, no doubt, that this action failed wholly to achieve its aim, but since the manifest[o]--an advertisement pure and simple and paid for as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>such--was misinterpreted, intentionally or unintentionally, in the columns of some Central European newspapers, into an expression of the feelings of the foreign-born citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>We, the representatives of the great part of European immigrants in America, deem it our duty solemnly to declare that:</p>
   <p>We emphatically deny any assumption that the export of munitions of war violates in any way the neutrality of the United States, observed heretofore with the most conscientious regard of international law. If the delivery of German arms to Mexico during the American occupation of Vera Cruz, when this country was in armed conflict with Mexico, was no violation of neutrality, neither is the present commerce in munitions of war a violation of neutrality on the part of the United States.</p>
   <p>We condemn severely this hypocritical agitation, because it is plainly intended <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to secure to Germany and Austria permanently the advantage of their long continued preparation for war and thus handicap the allies whose industries had not been devoted to the building up of tremendous araments.</p>
   <p>As loyal American citizens and residents, we endorse the principle of free export of all our products, agricultural and industrial, including the munitions of war, a principle long recognized by international law and followed by the very same powers at whose instigation the so-called "Appeal" has been published.</p>
   <p>We express our complete confidence in the government of this republic for its careful and correct attitude as the one great neutral power, and we repudiate most emphatically the immoral and hypocritical campaign conducted against countries that defend violated Belgium and fight for the right of small nations to a separate existence and unhampered development.</p>
