   <p>A meeting of leading citizens of the "Bohemian California" district was held in the offices of the Pilsen Brewing Company last night. It was called to make all necessary preparations for a meeting in which, the residents of the "California" district will give evidence of their Patriotism as Bohemians, their Slavic feeling and their readiness to sacrifice when is a question of helping a great Slavic cause for which thousands of our brothers in the Balkans are heroically braving their lives and other thousands are in hospitals suffering from wounds and diseases which are always so plentiful in the wake of a war.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to explain to our men and women in "California" how and why the war started and that it is of tremendous importance not only for the warring nations, whose bravery is admired by everybody, even their enemies, but for all Slavs, and consequently for the Bohemians. A new Slavic power is being born south of Austria--a power that will be a pillar of strength to the Bohemians and to all other Slavs in Austria, just as Germany is a pillar of strength for Austrian Germans.</p>
   <p>Thus, our Yugoslav friends who are fighting, suffering, and dying in the war are fighting, suffering, and dying for us. The least we can do is to raise as much money as possible and send it to them. This is our sacred duty, and it will help to give the wounded and sick the proper care so that they may be saved for their families, their nations, the Slavic world, and all of us.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Pilsen district has already spoken and done its duty. Next Sunday it will be "California's" turn. No doubt the meeting will be "California's" turn. No doubt the meeting will be worthy of the largest of our settlements.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting was attended by Stan. Loula, Jos. A. Šmejkal, Jos Štastný, Frank Hájíček, Jos. Kopecký. John R. Červenka, C. Roubal, R. Sedláček, Anton J. Cermak, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, Jos. O. Kostner, Jos. E. Bolek, Peter Drije, Reverend Vaclav Vanck, Jos. Z. Uhlíř, and Ant. Vanék.</p>
   <p>These men comprised all the necessary committees and started working with an enthusiasm and zeal worthy of the good sacred cause they had set out to aid. Let us hope that their work will meet with success.</p>
   <p>The meeting will take place in the Pilsen Park pavilion on Sunday afternoon at 2 F. M.....There will be a number of good speakers, among them the well-known Slavophile, Mr. Charles Crane. Information about other details will be published later.</p>
