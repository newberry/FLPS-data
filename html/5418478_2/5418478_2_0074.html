   <p>Yesterday's report about the new redivision of Chicago wards aroused considerable astonishment among Czechoslovak voters of the Tenth Ward, and the action undertaken yesterday in this regard gives hope that the original plans will be changed. The election committee of the City Council held its meeting yesterday afternoon, at which the redivision work should have been accomplished, but they postponed the matter temporarily. The meeting was attended by Bohemian voters who came to protest against the unjust and impractical redivision. Because of their vigorous protest, it was finally decided to postpone the matter until tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow's meeting of the election committee will be called to order at 11 A. M. in the City Hall and will be attended by representatives of the Bohemian press and by other citizens who will again protest against the redivision of the old Tenth Ward. Representatives of the Bohemian press will meet at 10 A. M. and will attend the meeting of the election committee <span class="page-break">\2</span>in a body.</p>
   <p>Results of yesterday's meeting, thanks to the vigorous protest of Bohemian voters, give hope that the redivision will be completed to the satisfaction of citizens of the Tenth Ward who live south of the Burlington and Quincy Railroad tracks.</p>
