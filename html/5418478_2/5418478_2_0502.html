   <p>Americans are reading about our valiant Czechoslovak Army in Russia. The average American has no correct conception of where Czechoslovak lands are located. Some think that we are former subjects of Russia.</p>
   <p>If we demand an independent state we shall have to show that our natural location is of importance to the Allies, just as is our Czechoslovak Army. We shall have to show that Austria-Hungary can neither exist without us nor against us, and that America and world democracy would commit a grievous error if they allowed themselves to be appeased by a "federalized" Austria.</p>
   <p>We can uproot this fallacious idea by stressing the establishment of an independent democratic Czechoslovak state and proving the necessity thereof. This can be done by the use of a map of central Europe with the boundaries of Czechoslovak lands properly defined. The July number of the Bohemian Review contains such a map.</p>
