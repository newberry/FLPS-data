   <p>The appearance of the marching Czech-American volunteers did not fail to make a deep impression upon the public which acclaimed them so enthusiastically. The sentiment aroused reflected in the meeting held in the Pilsen Park last night. A new group of young men enlisted for service there. They will march this evening to the depot to join their comrades in Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, Mo. We have no complete list of their names on hand, as recruiting is going on at a high rate. The Pilsen recruiting station was indeed so crowded that the recruiting officers declared themselves unable to handle the throng. [Follows list of some of those enlisted last night.]</p>
   <p>There came demands in great numbers for information from Detroit, Mich., <span class="page-break">\2</span>where Sokols intend to join those Sokols who have already begun to serve in Uncle Sam's Army.</p>
   <p>Enlistments for service in the United States Navy are making slower progress. Commander W. A. Moffett of the Lake Bluff station declared that man enlisted in the Navy will automatically become second-class seamen with a pay of $20,90 per month. Ordinarily, this rank was not reached before one year's service.</p>
   <p>About forty newly enlisted Czech-American Sokols will leave for Jefferson Barracks this evening.</p>
