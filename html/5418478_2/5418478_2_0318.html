   <p>In spite of the rebuff which William N. Gemmill, judge of the municipal court, suffered from the judicial committee recently, he again raises accusations against Anton J. Cermak, bailiff of the municipal court. The details which Judge Gemmill plans to reveal will be given in a conference when the judges will investigate the validity of the charges. He has filed a list of grievances against the bailiff's office in which he mentions Harry Olson, chief justice of the municipal court, as the official who is the superior officer of the bailiff.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cermak reacted by sending to Chief Justice Olson a list of complaints against Judge Gemmill which Cermak promises to substantiate by the testimony of witnesses.</p>
