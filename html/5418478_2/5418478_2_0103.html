   <p>All proposals placed on the small ballot were approved yesterday by the voters except the one concerning the firemen's "double platoon". The total number of people voting the small ballot was not nearly so large as it should have been; this was not because of lack of interest on the part of the voters but simply because thousands of citizens did not know what to do with the "bed sheet". The small ballot was so big that no voter had time enough to read it through, and those who had not investigated every proposal and made themselves acquainted with the import of it well in advance, preferred not to vote at all lest they vote the way they should not. If each proposal had been summed up in a few words, the ballot could have been two-thirds smaller and every voter would have been able to read what he was about to vote on. Of course, he knew from his newspaper what proposals would be submitted, but it was not easy to keep them in mind so as to be quite sure how he wished to vote. There should be some arrangement made for future elections which would make <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>it possible to keep the"small" ballot really small, and give the voter a chance to place his vote with full understanding as to what he is doing.</p>
