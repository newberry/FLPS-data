   <p>Slowly, but surely, like spring drawing near, enthusiasm is growing among our young men, thus bringing the creation of a Czecho-Slovak regiment within reality. The basis of these hopes is given by the attendance of the agitation meeting which was held in the halls of the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs last night. The gathering had been arranged by the above Sokol gymnastic society in collaboration with the Bohemian National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Peals of applause rewarded the music of the patriotic tunes, both Czech and American. There surely must have been many who, during these outbursts of genuine sentiment, made up their minds not to stand back, neither will they wait for conscription, nor will they scamper to the county clerk's office to take out a marriage license and hide behind a woman's skirts to escape something which, in their cowardice, they regard as a burden. It is our <span class="page-break">\2</span>fond hope that the regiment will be complete before compulsory service is introduced. We hope that our young men will not hesitate until they will be compelled to march behind the banner which has given protection and assured liberty to their ancestors and to themselves. The purpose of the meeting was known to all those present as it had been given the required publicity.</p>
   <p>The opening of the meeting was performed by Mr. Adolph Vlk, chairman of the military committee, who pointed out the duty incumbent upon the Czech-Americans to serve our new homeland just as they would have served the old homeland. Mr. Tvrzický, secretary of the Bohemian National Alliance, was the next speaker. He is well known as an orator, and he used his outstanding ability to persuade the young men to act determinedly, and join the groups who are to defend our country. He laid stress upon the opportunity given to the American Czechs who can demonstrate now that they have grasped the meaning of democracy, and attest to their sentiment by immediate action. "We Czechs have always leaned toward these principles," Mr. Tvrzický exclaimed, <span class="page-break">\3</span>"and have never failed to battle for them, for they were born in the times of John Hus. We must fight for them to the last drop of blood. As our leader, Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, has been emphasizing, we feel compelled to accept these principles, not only because they constitute a heritage, but also because they are a prerequisite to our adoption of our new homeland." Mr. Tvrzický further quotes Professor Masaryk: "The Russian revolution has a great significance inasmuch by it a Slavic people was given the right to voice its own candid opinion for the first time." The speaker proclaimed in connection with Masaryk's words, that in a not very remote future the Czechs, Poles, and other Slavonic nations also will be able to raise their voices as free nations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzický read a cablegram, sent to the meeting through Mr. Fr. Kupka, head of the Paris, France, branch of the Bohemian National Alliance. It came from the Czech volunteers, who are fighting in the trenches on the French front, and read: "Greetings! Follow our example!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The speaker continued by declaring that up to some time ago one excuse was being advanced by those who would not volunteer on the side of the Allies; namely, that America was still neutral, and that the men had obligations toward this country in the first place. This explains the sluggishness of some men toward the patriotic activities of the Sokol organizations, particularly toward enlistment in the Czechoslovak battalion in the Canadian army. No one need fear that he might violate this country's neutrality today. On the contrary, everybody should work with all his power to save humanity from the clutches of Prussian despotism and Hapsburg autocracy. In the beginning of the War, the Czech-Americans were underestimated by their friends and also by their enemies. The French expected at least twenty thousand volunteers from the Czech-Americans, and Austria actually feared that such a contingent could be raised to fight for the Allies. But that number was not found here, and, therefore, so many more ought to be furnished now, when not only our motherland, but also the new homeland is calling.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Mr. Tvrzický reverted repeatedly to the fact that the volunteers will be fighting for two countries. The old homeland, he visualizes, will be reborn upon the ruins of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy. The old homeland will greet the fighters with a smile, it will look up to them as heroes. These heroes will be those who have given expression by action to the silent, or secretly uttered wish of the Czech brethren, the wish that manifested itself when the Czechs declined the offer of Karl, Emperor of Austria, to allow himself to be crowned king of Bohemia. "Let us see to it that after the War it will be said of us that wherever the Czechs were they fought bravely and honestly for human rights and world democracy." Thus Mr. Tvrzicky concluded his oration to a capacity audience.</p>
   <p>Doctor Rudiš Jičinský, the next speaker, widely known as an ardent worker for the Sokol gymnastic organizations, gave a summary of the purposes pursued by the Sokols which are to center upon their goal now. He stated that most of the Sokols in the old homeland have been jailed by the Austrian government, and that their organizations have been dissolved. It is, therefore, up to <span class="page-break">\6</span>the American Sokols to take upon themselves the patriotic burden which is part of the Sokol heritage. He explained how the governments of Austria and of Germany, both hostile to the Slavonic peoples, have wantonly begun the War. He lashed the two ramshackled governments, which are founded upon the rule of monarchs who are vested with power "by the grace of the Lord" and sit upon wabbly thrones. He closed his talk with a warm appeal to the young men, admonishing them to do their duty.</p>
   <p>The chairman then introduced Captain F. H. Kenney, of the United States Army, who was greeted with a stormy applause. He began his speech by deducing and proving from historical facts that the Czechs were real defenders of liberty, and excellent soldiers. He compared the Czechs and their struggles with the War that the United States had to fight to win independence. The Czechs, he reasoned, are by their tradition fully authorized to fight alongside of those who follow in the footsteps of George Washington and the other founders of this republic. The Captain then set forth the advantages accruing from voluntary enlistment. He further stated that tens <span class="page-break">\7</span>of thousands of Czech prisoners of war are now fighting in the ranks of the Allies against their one time oppressors, he also mentioned the many heroes among them who have given their lives in order to assure a better future for their fatherland and for mankind. He reiterated the promises of certain advantages for the volunteers and voiced his hope that the Czech regiment in the United States Army shall soon be a reality.</p>
   <p>The floor was then given to Sergeant Vosátka, who was one of the first Czech volunteers, and is now in recruiting service, detailed to the recruiting station in the home of the Plzeň (Pilsen district) Sokol. He said that those enlisting now so that they can be transported together for the drill in Jefferson Barracks, will be in the status of "founders of the regiment". He assured the gathering that the formation of the regiment cannot meet with the slightest difficulties if Czech volunteers from the diverse cities in the United States will ask for a transfer to the Czech regiment. Sergeant Vosatka then announced that there will be a recruiting station opened in the halls of the Pilsen Sokol at 8 A.M. tomorrow.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>A declaration of loyalty to the United States was read by Mr. Vlk. It will be communicated in the shape of a resolution. Its body consists of a solemn promise by the Czechs and Slovaks to work for the preservation of the ideals for which this country has gone to war. The resolution was passed unanimously.</p>
   <p>A farewell address was delivered by Mr. Fráňa Klepal who is to join the Czecho-Slovak battalion in the Canadian Army; he signed up before the United States went ot war. He pointed to the obligation that comes with the acquisition of the United States citizen's papers. His fond wishes, he said, converge upon the formation of the Czech regiment at the earliest possible date.</p>
   <p>While the meeting was drawing near its end, the band under the direction of Mr. Brousek again played national airs. The musicians donated their services. Many signatures of enlistment were obtained, the names of whom are printed on another page.</p>
