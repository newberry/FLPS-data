   <p>Compulsory service is not a welcome institution, true enough, but it was already needed the moment voluntary enlistment was introduced for the Army and Navy. Manifestations of loyalty, and enthusiastic, warlike resolutions, we have had in abundance all over the country, and even now our President is being flooded with them, but volunteers are still very few. It appears that that patriotism among those who boast of it more than others, does not reach far enough to move them to any sacrifice; among the wealthy there might be some who would enlist as generals, but not as mere "rookies." Recently, when young Field enlisted for service in a cavalry regiment, the English language papers reproduced his photograph, and for several consecutive issues at that, as if something out of the ordinary had happened. It may, in fact, have been something unusual, considering that Fields are <span class="page-break">\2</span>scarce. Under such circumstances, of course, there was no other resort left for the government than enforced recruiting, in order to have on hand, within a short time, an army of adequate size. From the very beginning of the war, the introduction of compulsory service had appeared to us as inevitable.</p>
