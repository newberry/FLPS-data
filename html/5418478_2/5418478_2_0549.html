   <p>More work, very important work, is waiting for us, and the help of all is needed. Anton J. Cermak has been appointed chairman of the committee which is to conduct the Red Cross campaign among Chicago Czechs. The campaign will last from May 20 to May 27.</p>
   <p>All those who took part in the previous Liberty Bond campaign and those who want to join the ranks of the workers for the coming drive are requested to report at the offices of the Czech section at 3347 West 26th Street--Cermak and Serhant. They will be supplied with badges, literature, and everything else necessary for the work. In order to make our efforts produce splendid results, it is necessary that one or two workers operate in each block.</p>
   <p>Anton J. Cermak, chairman</p>
