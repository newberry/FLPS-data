   <p>The demand of the National Defense Council made upon President Wilson that he also declare war upon Austria and its allies, Bulgaria and Turkey, is timely. The reasons the Council is advancing are irrefutable and are in complete accord with what we think necessary to abolish completely the dual-monarchy and its system of bureaucracies, militarism, arbitrariness, and tyranny.....</p>
   <p>It is a little-known fact, but one of the utmost concern to us, that the possibility of a separate peace between the Allies and Austria is hovering menacingly above us; and the fact that a peace has not been concluded up to this time is to be ascribed solely to the blindness and stupidity of Austrian leaders who are still reluctant to grasp the opportunity....</p>

   <p>This separate peace would be tantamount to a silent admission that the Allies' war aims are directed only toward the removal of Germany as a dangerous competitor in commerce and not toward the establishment of democracy.....</p>
   <p>In the note which President Wilson sent in answer to the Pope's peace proposals, there is a passage which may well enough disturb the peace of mind of the small nations, for it speaks of 'the undesirability of dividing the state'. If Austria is meant, then the danger of its preservation is becoming increasingly acute, commensurate with the growing influence of the United States in the Allied council.....The National Defense Council's warning comes at the proper time.</p>
