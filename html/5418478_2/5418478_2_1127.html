   <p>More than ten thousand Czechs and Slovaks entered the gates of the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewery Park, where the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Czech National Association) has opened a bazaar for the benefit of patriotic enterprise, and filled the two large halls to capacity. In the evening, when the multitude burst into singing of national anthems, there was hardly any standing room left for the many who were trying to gain entrance. The crowd then divided into streams by which the visitor was carried involuntarily from one stand to another.</p>
   <p>Children played a conspicuously colorful part in the propagation of sales in an around the booths, where an immense variety of articles were offered to the eager purchaser. Little boys and girls gave a regular sales talk, couched in verses, praising their particular "line," ranging from aprons to old country sausage and further up or down.</p>

   <p>In an almost secluded corner, there stood a booth which was obviously regarded with great reverence. Within was kept the "Golden Book." Those who had bought to their hearts content at the stands, and also had supplied themselves with tickets for a lot in the raffle, could give still another test to their patriotic convictions by signing their names in the book with the amount of money they are further willing to sacrifice for the good cause. The first line was occupied by the name of one of our most generous and devoted patriots John A. Cervenka president of the Pilsen Brewing Company a concern conducted by sincere Czechs. He led with a contribution of fifty dollars. A long series of names of leaders of Sokol organizations was headed, of course, by Vojta Benes. Many outsiders, from near and far, even from Detroit, Omaha, and other cities, signed their names, a testimony of their sentiments. The "Golden Book" contains many Slovak names, and so serves as a record for the unity of thought of the Czechs and Slovaks. Is your name in the book? If so, you are helping make history for the <span class="page-break">3</span>Czechs and Slovaks in Chicago during fateful hours. It is your duty to make this history worth recording for our posterity.</p>
   <p>The contest among the ladies for the honor of being crowned queen at the close of the bazaar next Saturday is assuming great proportions. Friends of the contestants are exhibiting great eagerness in buying voters' tickets, the numbers of which run into many thousands. A strong stimulant was instilled into the contest by three additional prizes, a gift by the Association of Czech Jewelers and Watchmakers: Second prize, a gold bracelet with a diamond worth $100; third prize, a cameo ring with a diamond worth $50; fourth prize, a fourteen carat gold watch worth $30.</p>
