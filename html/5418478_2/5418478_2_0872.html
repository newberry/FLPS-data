   <p>In such critical times as these, it is absolutely necessary that everyone be mindful of his duty, that everyone take the place assigned to him, so that a victorious result may bring us a lasting peace. In the first place, this concerns all men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty, who are, by act of Congress, to enter the United States Army and Navy, to defeat the enemy....</p>
   <p>Uncle Sam is now taking determined action in the most important preparations. A gigantic draft has been established, from which our men drew numbers last Friday; this will automatically place them on the list of recruits.</p>
   
   <p>The establishment of this draft is a historical event of great importance, for this system of recruiting eliminates the question of wealth, and leaves the fate of hundreds of thousands of men in the hands of pure chance. It has been used in other countries, at times, but nowhere has it achieved such magnitude as it has in the United States.</p>
   <p>The business of the draft was carried out under the strictest supervision of our government officials, and in the most just, indiscriminating manner. Not the slightest suspicion could arise, of any advantage offered to certain select classes of the people.....</p>
   <p>It would not correspond with the true state of affairs if we contended that every man among those who drew a number from the first two thousand is elated over the chance immediately to serve in Uncle Sam's army. The first registrations have already made it clear that large numbers of men are putting in claims for exemption. In general, however, everyone seems satisfied by the certainty of either being one of the first in the Army, or not; in the latter case, he may remain in his present sphere somewhat longer.</p>
   <p>It would be advisable for objectors to ask themselves twice if their health might really suffer by service in the Army, or if their dependents would be deprived of their breadwinners. In doing so they would reveal their true convictions in regard to genuine American patriotism.....</p>
   <p>For a long time, America fought with tooth and nail against becoming a militarized power. There was no possibility of dodging the issue. Duties toward mankind and toward America itself loomed up as compelling forces. Our country would not suffer the unheard-of crimes perpetrated by the Germans to go unpunished. It could not tolerate a Prussia triumphant. It must do everything to down Prussian militarism and put an end to the terrible massacre.....We shall have a strong army; at home, however, every one is expected to contribute to the good cause. We mean farmers, workmen, businessmen, all of whom should help, so that the strength of the United States shall be visible to the entire world, and consequently, respected and even feared.</p>
   <p>The peace which will result from our efforts shall surely be worth the sacrifices made by us.</p>
