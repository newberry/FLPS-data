   <p>Yesterday evening the Club of the Bohemian Citizens of the 6th Ward held a meeting at 582 Center Avenue. Frant Fucik was nominated as candidate for alderman of the 6th ward. He accepted the nomination, and being a Republican, he will run on the workingmen's ticket. In all probability he will receive all the votes against Cullerton.</p>
