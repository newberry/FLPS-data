   <p>The sight of our Czech soldiers leaving for the training camps has filled our hearts with great joy. Our boys joined the ranks willingly, even after the introduction of compulsory service.</p>
   <p>However, we deeply regret that we are compelled to report some cases of desertion from the Army, and that there were Czechs among the slackers.. We wish that they would shed their Czech names along with their uniforms. We are ashamed of them--that is all we have to say.</p>
