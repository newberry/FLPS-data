   <p>Buying Liberty Bonds is the duty of every patriotic citizen, and at the same time, it is the duty of every prudent man who intends to invest his savings in the best security existing under the sun under the present conditions. Our Government is not going to become bankrupt. Before anything like that could happen, the European countries would have to declare themselves in default, and a general panic would spread throughout our own country, while properties; securities, mortages, etc., would lose their values. He who intends to help our country toward victory, and secure his own economic position, should, therefore, buy Liberty Bonds.</p>
