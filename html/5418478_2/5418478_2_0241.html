   <p>The Cook county executive committee of the Democratic party is in a quandary about the nominations for office. Mr. Anton J. Cermak has declared that he would not aspire to a nomination for the office of sheriff if Mr. John A. Cervenka is not nominated for re-election as clerk of the Probate court, or if he is selected for some other office, or for none at all.</p>
