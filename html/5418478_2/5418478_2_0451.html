   <p>The executive committee of the Czechoslovak branch for advancing the sale of Fourth Liberty Loan bonds met last night, Mr. Anton J. Cermak presiding. A detailed account of the proceedings will appear in our next issue. The main feature of the deliberations was a resolution to appeal to our people to give the campaign fullhearted support. Czech banks, business houses, and special substations distributed over the district will serve this purpose. Our campaign is to be conducted in such a manner that every bond bought by our people should be credited to our own nationality. Do not let us forget that this concerns our national honor!</p>
   <p>Do not allow yourself to be persuaded into buying a bond in your place of employment when you can obtain the same bond from people of your own nationality. No one can compel you to purchase the bond where you do not wish to buy. In case you cannot avoid buying the bond from others you should merely write "Czechoslovak" upon the application, and the bond will be credited to you. You <span class="page-break">\2</span>will be given a receipt immediately upon subscription, and if your employer demands that you credit the bond to him, you will simply show him your receipt and he will not ask you again.</p>
   <p>By all means, however, subscribe for a bond. Do this quickly, and buy as many as possible.</p>
