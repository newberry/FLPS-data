   <p>The bloody drama taking place in the Balkan Peninsula has naturally attracted the interest of the whole civilized world. For more than a score of years it has been evident that sooner or later the Balkans would develop into a volcano; the world knew that the patience of the oppressed Yugoslavs would become exhausted, and that a bloody, far-reaching international conflict would ensue. But nobody had any idea that the struggle would show evidence of such a love of liberty and native soil, that by its impact the whole Ottoman Empire would shake to its very foundations. Modern history has no examples of such heroism as those seen in the present war of the Yugoslav peoples against Turkey. All battles fought so far form a chain of successes for the Slavs, who left their huts, their wives, and their children in order to take up arms against a ruthless enemy. Many of them are already sleeping their eternal sleep in common graves, whose number grows with each new battle; many lie helpless in lazarettos, from which they will return probably crippled for life. But the whole world looks with admiration at this small body of men who are crushing a much stronger enemy by the force of sheer enthusiasm and valor. That the greatest part of the world's sympathies is now with the Yugoslavs is self-evident.</p>
   <p>But sympathies, no matter how keen, warm, and sincere, cannot by themselves mitigate the horrors of a war. A war invariably brings with it hunger and misery, suffering and need.....Therefore, immediate financial assistance which would make it possible to give the wounded heroes the necessary care--and possibly a little comfort--is of infinitely greater value and will be much more welcome than any amount of sympathy. Thus a duty has to be performed, and we Slavs must step forward first. All Slavs, without exception, are challenged to help those to whom they are bound not only as men to men, but also as members of the same great family of Slavic nations. It is most gratifying to know that this challenge has been accepted by the Slavic people throughout America. The Pan-Slavic mutuality of interest is not an empty phrase. We realize our duty toward our heroic, fighting brothers, and we are trying to fulfill it as best we can. Collections are being taken up everywhere; there are meetings which end with overwhelming expressions of love and admiration for those who are fighting for their most sacred rights. Everywhere great efforts are being put forth to furnish the non-Slavic public with true information concerning the state of affairs in the Balkans.</p>
   <p>A similar expression of love and admiration was the result of the meeting called by the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) in the Pilsen Auditorium on Blue Island Avenue last night.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting may truly be termed an enormous success not only from the moral, but also from the purely financial point of view. Never--and we say that quite advisedly and without any unnecessary exaggeration--has any of our halls been filled with a more enthusiastic public or a public more ready for sacrifice; and never before have we seen greater manifestations of Slavic solidarity. The spacious hall of the Pilsen Auditorium, though one of our roomiest, was filled to the very last seat, galleries not excepted. The public itself was an interesting collection of various Slavic types, among whom the southern Slavs represented a large percentage. It was a day of close rapprochement among representatives of the large Slavic family settled in Chicago; it was a day of elation, a day of largess.</p>
   <p>It was shortly after 8 P. M. when the meeting was officially called to order. On the stage, which was decorated with flags of Slavic and American colors, were grouped the representatives of various nationalities who were to address appeals to those assembled, as well as representatives of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada, under whose auspices the meeting was organized. The chairman of the meeting was James F. Stepina, a banker, who opened with this brief but fitting address:</p>
   <p>"Dear Brothers--Serbs, Bulgars, Croatians, Slovaks, Montenegrins, and Poles! On behalf of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada I have the privilege and honor of opening this meeting. It has been called for the purpose of helping our suffering brothers in the Balkans morally and financially.</p>
   
   <p>"The whole world admires the masterful tactics of Serbian and Bulgarian strategists and is astonished by the intrepidity and valor of their army. The American press carries full columns of praise of the ability of Bulgarian and Serbian generals. This is very fine and very flattering. But so far I have failed to see anything in the American newspapers about the necessary funds which are needed to mitigate the suffering of the wounded and to help the bereft.</p>
   <p>"During the Russo-Japanese War, the same newspapers did all they could to stir up the American public's sympathy for Japan, and hundreds of thousands of dollars were sent to that country. But they have have yet to remember our friends in the Balkans.</p>
   <p>"I said, that this meeting has been called in order to secure help for our suffering brothers. There are two ways in which we must help: Financially and morally. Some financial help can be obtained by frequent collections among ourselves. Moral help we shall secure indirectly by proving to the American newspapers that all Slavic nations stand united as one man behind this movement.</p>
   
   <p>In this way we shall call the attention of the American Red Cross to the necessity of organizing collections among Americans.</p>
   <p>"Permit me to thank you for coming in such large numbers to this important meeting, and to express the hope that it will achieve complete success."</p>
   <p>After Mr. Stepina's speech, which started a long storm of applause and sounded the keynote to the general attitude of the huge assembly, our popular Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society) stepped to the platform and under the direction of Mr. Karel Malik, sang the stirring song, "Bojovnici v Noci" (Night Warriors). No other song would have better fitted the occasion and would have been emotionally closer to the spirit of the evening's program. As usual, our singers were rewarded with tremendous applause and obliged the audience with an encore, "Ja Jsem Slovan S Dusi, Telem" (I am a Slav, Body and Soul).</p>
   <p>The song was a signal for the start of an oratorical contest, and Mr. Stepina introduced the representative of the Bohemians, Mr. R. J. Psenka, as the first speaker of the evening.</p>
   <p>Mr. Psenka addressed the meeting in the absence of the organizer of the Cesko-American Narodni Rada, traveler, and writer, Mr. E. St. Vraz, who is at present on a lecture tour in the South. To take the place of Mr. St. Vraz, a fiery, impassioned orator who has very few equals, is an extremely difficult task at best, but Mr. Psenka fulfilled it very well, and his speech was a remarkable exhibition of rhetorical ability. Constantly interrupted by bursts of applause, it ran as follows:</p>
   <p>"Welcome, dear Slavic brethren, under this Bohemian roof where our mutual feelings and hopes have brought us together!</p>
   <p>"Lo and behold, there are assembled here hundreds--perhaps a full thousand--of members of several nations, each of which has its own language, its own characteristics, and its own country. But there is only one common passionate enthusiasm that stirs all our bosoms, because one common mother spreads over us the wings of her love--our Mother Slavia [collective personification of all Slavic nations].</p>
   <p>"These glorious and memorable times remove even the slightest vestige of difference among us. We cease to be divided into Bohemians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, Serbs, Montenegrins, and Bulgars. We are all just Slavs. The distant din of cannon, the piercing call 'Our men are fighting!' reverberate with the same echo in the heart of a Bohemian, a Slovak, or a Bulgar.</p>
   <p>"Yes, our men are fighting. For those valiant lads who are shedding their blood and who are suffering infinite hardships beyond the seas and mountains are not the brothers of you, and you, who have come to America from their countries: They are brothers of all of us. We all feel with them; we all triumphantly rejoice over news of the victories of Slavic arms; we all tremble with fear and hope for a happy ending of this bloody war; we are all filled with compassion over their hardships; and we all bless the memory of those who have already given their lives in search of liberty.</p>
   
   <p>"I have been asked by those who called this meeting to address you on their behalf and on behalf of the Cesko-Americka Narodal Rada, which originated the idea which has been realized today.</p>
   <p>"I am sure you will believe that all I am saying to you flows from the very heart of the family--one hundred and fifty thousand strong--of Chicago Bohemians.</p>
   <p>"I appreciate this privilege, but I have little confidence that my ability as a speaker will do justice to such an important assignment as mine is today. But where is the man who would not be inspired to eloquence by your radiant and determined faces, by looking at this assembly, by listening to the beloved Slavic sounds uttered in various tongues--all equally sweet to the ear?</p>
   <p>"Frequently, an erroneous opinion about us Bohemians is found among other Slavs. This has to be admitted for the sake of truth. You have believed us to be infected by German culture, snobbishness, and arrogance toward other Slavs, perhaps even to the point of despising them. Only recent, more plentiful, and intimate contacts, particularly with the Sokol morement which sinks its roots into the soil of all Slavic lands, have lighted the torch of better understanding and new appreciation.</p>
   <p>"Even a very modest knowledge of Bohemian history leads to the realization that no other Slavic nation has suffered as much for its Slavic onvictions than the Bohemians and Slovaks. No other nation has shed more of her sons' blood in the defense of her language of her national existence. You Yugoslavs have your Trnovo and Kosovo; we have our Bila Hora (White Mountain). All these deep, open wounds are on one and the same body--on the body of our common Mother Slavia.</p>
   <p>"And because the Bohemian has suffered so much, because his body and his heart has bled so often, he puts the ideal of liberty on a high pedestal; he feels keenly with everybody, especially with a brother Slav when the latter goes to war for that liberty.</p>
   <p>"Brother Slavs! we are not for you because you are winning. You would find us equally disposed if your armies were failing. Look here: As soon as the news spread through Bohemia that the Slavic Balkans were going to war with Turkey, a peculiar excitement and stir went through even our Maticka Praha (Little Mother Prague), as we have learned from recent communications from overseas. Bohemian men and women, physicians and nurses, immediately got ready and set out for the battlefields. Field hospitals were equipped and sent out with money secured by collections. Such collections are being taken up in homes, apartment buildings, restaurants, stores, and factories everywhere. In fact, a Bohemian in his own country is living through the excitement of war. Here, far overseas, a Bohemian also experiences the warlike stir and awaits the news from the battle field with equal anxiety. We are your brothers. Your failure would be our failure; your success is our success.</p>
   <p>"Yours is a holy war. For is it not proper to throw a depredator, a ravisher, a trespasser, a tyrant, out of one's own house? Is it not permissible to chase him so far away that he becomes harmless for all time to come?</p>
   
   <p>"May our hopes and our prayers bless the success of arms raised for such a sacred purpose! We are enemies of war, that is, enemies of war waged for trifling reasons or for a ruler's whim. But where the war is a revolt against tyranny, there our hearts are with those who fight, and every man's arm trembles with yearning to grasp a gun or a sword; every man's ear longs to hear the din of the battle; and every man's chest hopes to stop the deadly blow.</p>
   <p>"This demonstration for which we have gathered together here from all parts of this enormous city is for the warriors who brave misery and death for a just cause. The money which will be collected here is for those who are suffering because of the war. All war, including a victorious war, has its dark and bright side, and we know that both the army opposing the enemy in the field and the nation bearing the brunt of the war experience unspeakable suffering and woe.</p>
   <p>"What a beautiful, noble, godlike privilege to be able to help those who suffer!</p>
   <p>"There is still a great deal in my heart that I should like to say. But my time is up, and other speakers will take this platform. I should like to talk about this war as a splendid example of what the Slavs can achieve when they unite their strength; as something unequaled since the time of old Hellas; as something the results of which have astonished and stunned the world; as something that makes the enemies of Slavs sit up and take notice and sly diplomats forget and revise all their calculations. I should like to talk about the hideousness of fanaticism, no matter whether it is religious or national, and how it backfires at those who embrace it, as is now being demonstrated by the Turks. But all this will be told much better and much more forcefully by the flow of current events than I could hope to tell it.</p>
   <p>"I conclude by expressing two wishes: May this, an auspiciously begun and valiantly fought war, soon end in complete success for the Slavic arms, and may the awareness of Slavic brotherhood, burning in so many millions of Slavs these days, burn with an eternal, unextinguishable, ever lasting flame! Now I salute you with our sincere, brotherly, Bohemian 'Na Zdar!' (To Success)."</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Psenka mentioned in his speech the keen interest of our Maticka Praha engendered by the Balkan War. According to reports reaching the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, the people working throughout Bohemia are enthusiastically for our Yugoslav brothers. The faculty of medicine at the University of Prague has started relief action. Professors Jedlicka and Kukula [leading surgeons] are at the head of the movement. Dr. Jedlicka, with five of his assistants, arrived in Belgrade on October 26 and went on to the battlefield. Dr. Rychtik, first assistant in Dr. Kukula's surgical clinic, and Dr. Stepan, with twenty medical students, left Prague on October 29. They will go to Montenegro.</p>
   <p>Immediately thereafter a member of physicians with thirty medical students were sent to Serbia. All students have been granted a leave of absence from the University for three months, and it will be renewed if and when necessary.</p>
   <p>The Ceska Obec Sokolska (Bohemian Sokol Community) has created a special auxiliary body and has put at its disposal the sum of fifty thousand crowns ($10,000).</p>
   
   <p>The four foremost Bohemian banks are collecting contributions. The Royal City of Prague has contributed a portable field hospital with thirty beds. From another source one thousand beds, complete with sheets, blankets, pillows, etc., have been received, and all that material is now on its way to the Balkans. All principal institutions and corporations are sending donations:</p>
   <p>The Slavia Insurance Company was first with one thousand crowns from the company itself, and another thousand from its directors and employees. A "Permanent Bohemian Auxiliary Committee" has been organized in Prague.....</p>
   <p>This news was received with thunderous applause and continued shouts of approval.</p>
   <p>After the audience had quieted down, the representative of the Croatians, Dr. Pero Peric, was introduced. He delivered a short but very appropriate talk, in which he wished on behalf of his nation the best of success to the Slavic arms. Judging by the applause he received, there must have been quite a large percentage of Croatians in the audience. After his speech, the Croatian singing society Zora, with its conductor, Mr. K. M. Coufal, ascended the platform and sang two beautiful chorals, "U Boj" (On to the Fight) and "Oj, Synci Zvonimira" (Hey, Ye Sons of Zvonimir). The selections were most sympathetically received, and Mr. Coufal has every reason to be pleased with his personnel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stepina then read a letter from Mr. Alexander McCormick, who was to be one of the speakers, but who, because of urgent business, could not attend the meeting. Mr. McCormick's letter was kindly received, particularly its last sentence in which he promised to make a substantial contribution to the Slavic Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Our well-known national worker, Mrs. L. J. Veselsky, delivered a beautiful, impassioned speech on behalf of Bohemian women. She said that perhaps just now, flags of Slavic colors are being hoisted in Constantinople--flags which will be greeted by the whole Slavic world as evidence of the downfall of the Ottoman domination in Europe--a domination which has been causing so much sorrow and suffering to the Slavic people. In the endless struggles with the wily Turks, women have been playing an important part, standing by their men in the most critical times. Today, also, all Slavic women turn their tearful eyes toward the Balkan battlefields and pray for a great, glorious victory of Slavic arms.</p>
   <p>....After Mrs. Veselsky's speech, Mr. Sus announced that the dramatic group of Sokol Chicago will present the play, "Zertva Na Balkane" (A Balkan Oblation), for the benefit of the fund next Sunday. His announcement was received with approval.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jaroslav J. Zmrhal then delivered a lengthy, well-organized speech in the English language. He correlated his discussion with an event of 150 years ago when the American colonists revolted against the ruthless British domination, and their first shot stirred the whole world like a heroic demonstration of a man who is fighting to prevent his being strangulated. And today, after a century and a half, another such shot is heard throughout the world--a shot that has been fired by our brothers in Europe's South. What we see is not simple a struggle of Slavs for the Slavic cause. A terrible but just war for the best that is in human nature has developed here. Therefore, there is no reason to fear where American sympathies will be in this case. An American man could not call himself a free American if, after learning all the facts, he did not stand, body and soul, behind the oppressed Slavs who are fighting today for those things which made the American Union great--liberty and the right to live. His speech provoked a great deal of applause.</p>
   <p>Especially remarkable was the speech of the Slovak representative, Mr. Andrej Sustek. Mr. Sustek is not only a fine speaker, but he is a sincere Pan-Slavist as as well, and his discussion clearly revealed these two facts. He first spoke about the Austrian government, which has always exerted its efforts toward the suppression of the Slavs, not only in Austria itself, but everywhere else. This war should wake up all the Slavs and all of us who come from Austria, and it should be an impulse for uniting all Slavs into one phalaux. The speaker aptly remarked that it is the Slovaks' duty to stand close by the fighting heroes of their Yugoslav brothers in this struggle, because the lot of both is almost identical. while in the south the Slavs are being oppressed by the Turk, in the north his place is taken by the plotting Magyar. There is practically no difference in the fate of the various Slavic nations. The only difference, if it may be called one, is in the name of the oppressor--the system is the same everywhere. Mr. Sustek's speech went directly to the hearts of all those present, and there were very few, if any at all, who did not rise to reward the speaker with prolonged applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anthony Czarnecki, our enthusiastic brother Slav who proved his heart's interest at the time of the Sokol Slet (Gymnastic Festival) in Chicago when, through his efforts as a reporter of the Chicago Daily News, articles about the Sokol Olympic Games penetrated the English press for the first time, spoke for the Poles. He stressed the fact that it is our sacred duty to render our Slavic brothers the best possible service, not only morally, but also financially. The best moral support will be rendered by seeing to it that the English language press receives truthful and ample information concerning the real state of affairs in the Balkan Peninsula. Financial support will be given by contributing, even ever so little, to the collection. Each small drop helps to make the rain heavier, and a large amount of money can be raised from small contributions if the collecting is done systematically and efficiently.</p>
   <p>Mr. Uro. Ducic spoke for the Serbs. Mr. Ducic is a young, vigorous speaker. He succeeded in fascinating his audience, and his speech was naturally followed by huge applause. The Bulgars were represented by Mr. Kaley and Mr. Theodor Vladimirov, and the Montenegrins by Mr. Martinovic. Their speeches spelled enthusiasm and love of their native land, and each evoked an endless storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stepina announced that Mr. Pupin, a Serbian professor who initiated the collection of funds among American Slavs, was the first to make a donation. He gave ten dollars. The Bohemians collection amounted to $322,50, and since then an additional $60 or so has been received.</p>
   <p>All those who care to contribute to the collection may do so at the American State Bank on Blue Island Avenue at 18th Street. Mr. Stepina suggested that was usual, a resolutions committee should be nominated to draft a resolution or a report of the meeting for the English language press. Following a motion to this effect, such a committee was appointed. It consisted of the speakers of all Slavic nations who took part in the meeting. The Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada had a fitting draft resolution prepared in advance. This was read by Mr. Charles J. Vopicka and was unanimously approved. The resolution will be sent to Professor Pupin in New York with a request that our heartfelt sympathies be expressed in Sophia, Belgrade, and Cetinje. It reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"We, American citizens of Slavic origin--Bohemian, Slovak, Polish, Slovene, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and Montenegrin--assembled at a great public meeting in the Pilsen Auditorium, November 10, 1912, make the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Our Slavic brothers in the Balkan Peninsula have recently started a historic, heroic, and desperate fight for their human rights, for freedom, and for liberation from the Turkish yoke under which they have suffered for centuries; and</p>
   
   <p>"Whereas, The Balkan soil reddens with the blood of valiant men fighting against the Turk for the noblest ideals of man; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we express our sincerest sympathy to all Slavic warriors in the Balkans who have surprised and astonished the whole of Europe and America by unsurpassed heroism and have again demonstrated what can be accomplished by small nations fighting with extreme enthusiasm for their liberty; and be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we express our very best wishes for a complete victory of our Bulgarian, Serbian, and Montenegrin brothers and sincerely hope that they will not be deprived of the results of their heroism by intrigues and base schemes of the plotting European diplomacy; and we request our co-citizens of Slavic origin throughout America to prove in these great, historic times that the Slavs, who have ever fostered and defended the great ideals of human rights and brotherhood, are always ready to make great sacrifices in order to help those who fight for such ideals. May a fervid desire to alleviate suffering spread everywhere.</p>
   
   <p>May everybody contribute as much as his situation permits to the Slavic Red Cross, which carries to the battlefield immediate medical help as well as the blessing of compassion and consolation."</p>
   <p>It was 10:30 P. M. when the meeting was adjourned and the guests started to leave. There can be no doubt that this great Slavic demonstration achieved complete moral and financial success. All English language newspapers will be sent a complete report of the meeting, and as far as material results are concerned, it is certain that the collections will excede all expectations. During the meeting, each participant received an envelops for his contribution. When the time came for the treasurer, Mr. Joseph Triner, and his assistants, Messrs. Karel Braun and Frantisek Sedlak, to open the envelopes, they were pleasantly surprised. There was quite a stack of currency and many, many silver coins. Probably never before has as generous a crowd as the one assembled last night in the Pilsen Auditorium filled any one of our halls. When all the money was counted, it was found that the collection netted $405, while the admission fees amounted to $80.15, so that the noble cause will be given $485.15.</p>
   
   <p>Due to the late hour, we are unable to publish the names of all contributors in this report, but each contribution will be acknowledged in Bohemian and other Slavic newspapers. Just in passing, we must say that the "Bonaparts" of Little Bohemia donated twenty-five dollars, and the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor, in addition to their contribution to the artistic part of the meeting, gave five dollars. Splendid examples--may they be emulated! To this we salute a sincere "Zivio!" (Serbo-Croatian: May it prosper!)</p>
   <p>Within the next two weeks a similar meeting will be held in the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewing Company in Bohemian "California". There is not doubt that it, too, will be a complete success.</p>
