   <p>Congressman Bartholdt of St. Louis, the Dalai Lama of American Germans, has presented a resolution requiring the United States to take the lead in a world movement for the organization of an international court of arbitration, which would arbitrate all differences among nations and enforce its decisions by an "international police force". This may be a fine proposal, and it should be worth considering, but it is doubtful that it could be realized before a general disarmament has taken place; and in that case, a court of this kind would be superfluous, because wars would be impossible. Hence, the Bartholdt resolution is nothing more than a veiled admission that our Germans see the hopelessness of their fatherland's situation, and a proof that there is among them a plan to drag the United States into the war with the Allies. If this should prove impossible, they would like to <span class="page-break">\2</span>create tension between the United States and the Triple Entente which would lead to antagonism.</p>
   <p>It is easy to understand why our Germans are trying all means to help their country, but if their action should go so far as to endanger the neutrality of the United States, it is time to consider steps by which we can effectively oppose such action.</p>
   <p>The first thing that stirred up the Germans was the strict measures adopted by England in regard to the transportation of contraband material to enemy countries on neutral vessels. Although the English war vessels have acted fully in accordance with international law, which permits the inspection of the cargo, and although it has been proved that American exporters have been smuggling contraband into Germany in a shameless manner, the American Government has filed a protest--a completely unjustified protest--in London. This protest has caused a great deal of indignation and has created a lot <span class="page-break">\3</span>of bad feeling against the United States in the Allied countries, which, we are sure, will bring us most undesirable results.</p>
   <p>Immediately thereafter, the Germans started a loud protest against the export of war material to the Allies, although this is no violation of neutrality. How poorly justified was this protest is shown by a report of Secretary of Commerce Redfield, according to which the export of war material during the month of November did not amount to more than two million dollars. Such a trifling quantity of arms and ammunition can have no practical effect upon the outcome of the war.</p>
   <p>Then there was the Buffalo incident where two Canadian militia men shot a poacher who, by chance, of course, happened to be an American citizen of German descent. This incident, the like of which occurs daily without causing any comment, was exaggerated by the German press into an affair of international importance, only so that it might be used for anti-British propaganda.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>An event showing how far our Germans are ready to go in their mad desire to cause difficulties to the Allies passed almost without notice. It is connected with the hoof and mouth epidemic among the cattle in stockyards and on farms. This epidemic has caused losses reaching millions of dollars. Federal investigators have found that the disease had been inoculated in a number of cattle on a farm in Michigan. From there it has spread into all Midwestern states of the Union, and also into our stockyards. Since at that time many horses and much meat was being exported to Europe, and particularly to England, it is not difficult to see against whom this infernal conspiracy was aimed, although the nationality of the culprits has not been revealed. But that is not all: In the Springfield legislature, a proposal was made to pass a law by which all those whose herds of cattle had to be slaughtered would be indemnified for their losses by the state. Thus, the whole body of our taxpayers would have to pay out of their own pockets for losses brought about by fanatical "patriots".</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Another occurrence of a similar nature is the German conspiracy discovered in New Orleans. There a time bomb was deposited in the cargo of a vessel and was so timed that it would explode when the boat was far out at sea. It is easy to imagine what would have happened to the crew. Mysterious fires breaking out aboard ships carrying cargo for the Allies are much too frequent to justify the theory that they "just happen". It is clear that these fires are nothing more nor less than brutal, murderous attacks on the lives of sailors made by a nation that drops bombs upon and kills sleeping women and children. Hence, it cannot be expected that this nation would shirk this method of helping to victory a state which is now harvesting what it has been so diligently sowing for the last forty years.</p>
   <p>But the most insolent attack against American neutrality by the American Germans is being engineered in the port of Port Arthur, Texas, just now. In the case of the steamship "Dacia," which was previously the property of the Hamburg-America Line, and which was hiding in the port at the <span class="page-break">\6</span>outbreak of the war. This steamer has been "sold" under most suspicious circumstances to a certain American citizen by the name of Breitung, of Marquette, Michigan. Breitung is a German, and so far has never owned as much as a little motorboat, much less that he should now be interested in investing his money in the shipping business. The British government announced right at the beginning of the war that, in accordance with international law, it will not recognize as neutral a vessel which has been bought from a member of an enemy country after the outbreak of the war, and if such a vessel should sail under a neutral flag, it will be considered by the British government as a legal spoil and will be dealt with accordingly. Great Britain is fully entitled to do this, and our State Department knows it.</p>
   <p>In spite of that, however, "Dacia" is being loaded with cotton in the Texas port and will sail to Bremen in the next few days. Breitung's representatives, having been notified of England's attitude, have let <span class="page-break">\7</span>it be known in our State Department that they will send the boat out to Europe no matter what the consequences may be. There can be no question as to the results. The first English war vessel to meet "Dacia" will take it into an English port, and the disposition of its cargo will be decided by the court of spoils, an international institution. What the decision will be is clear. England has not only the letter of the law, but also its spirit on her side. Our State Department will again be put under the pressure of our organized and fanatical Germans to send another protest to London. From a protest there are just a few steps to an ultimatum, and just a step from an ultimatum to a war. This our Germans know very well, and especially Herr Breitung.</p>
   <p>But American citizens of other nationalities do not seem to know it, or otherwise they would not be facing these dangerous German machinations without protest. But every bit of procrastination in taking defensive measures brings the United States dangerously closer to the peril of war.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>It is therefore imperative to wrest from the American Germans the torch with which they threaten to set aflame our common home.</p>
