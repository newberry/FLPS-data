   <p>The time has again come for us to speak--to speak so that we shall be heard all over this country. In the streets in the Czechoslovak land there walk large crowds who are clamoring for their rights. In their difficult struggle, they rely on aid from the President of this country. They rely on his longing for a just peace, one that is based upon liberty and self-determination of the nations. Our people have gone through hard days, through days of starvation, death upon battlefields and even on the gallows. Yet our people have found enough courage to go on. Hope has risen in the hearts of many thousands, whose cries reverberate through the streets of Czech towns. They shout: "Hurrah for President Wilson! We want peace, but only the peace that he is offering--a peace of the sacred right to live for all nations! We want Wilson's democratic peace!"</p>

   <p>If we consider that along the whole French front, German guns are roaring, and that entire battalions of Germans hurl themselves to a terrible death only for the purpose of destroying the hopes of democratic nations--if we consider that all of this is happening at a time when Allied statesmen and leaders of their armies are declaring that this is the most critical time in the struggle and are holding back the terrible blows, waiting for the aid of our Republic--then the strength in the soul and the heart of our Czech people becomes evident. Our people do not, even during this most terrible ordeal, abandon the one man from whom it expects either life or death. Our people are calling out: "Long live Wilson!"</p>
   <p>This call, which reverberates through the streets of Prague, has traveled over the ocean to far-away Washington and has made a deep impression everywhere.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>What a nation, those Czechs! How much moral strength must be accumulated in them!</p>
   <p>A strong link has been built up between this Republic and our native land, for they are tied together by similar ideals. Washington has learned to know that over there, in yon small nation that has been subjugated for ages, the world has again found a strong and dauntless protagonist of the democracy of nations. In a moment such as this, the Czech people in America must not forsake their nation or forget it in its manifestations of love and admiration for the President of our country.</p>
   <p>We are, therefore, addressing ourselves to the Czech and Slovak people of the City of Chicago, urging them to prepare for mighty demonstrations of our loyalty to our President, who is holding up the principles of humanity and rights for all nations and considers them to be the sacred and sublime aim of this war. We are calling on the Czech and the Slovak nations, regardless of creed or convictions, to testify to their loyalty to this country which has <span class="page-break">\4</span>inspired the world, now fighting for ideals, with such mighty moral strength and is helping it in the terrible struggle.</p>
   <p>New tidings may reach us soon. We fear that this news from our native land would fill our eyes with tears. The month of May is drawing near. We are apprehensive of this coming May Day, for it is likely to become a day of bloodshed. Dr. Rasin [one of the revolutionary leaders in Bohemia] spoke of it when he proclaimed in the name of the Czech people that his nation is determined steadfastly to pursue the struggle for independence, and to persevere to the last beat of the Czech heart.</p>
   <p>May Day is coming, and our people will again call for liberty and their rights. Countless voices will again proclaim loyalty and admiration for President Wilson, and confidence and firm hope in this Republic.</p>
   <p>We want to chime in with the chorus from our bleeding motherland. We want to show America that we join it in its tears. When our brethren across the ocean <span class="page-break">\5</span>shout the praises of Wilson, let our voices, here, sound not only confidence, but also grim determination to stand firmly behind the President in the fight for the high ideals with which he has emblazoned the starry flag.</p>
   <p>In the second half of next May, the Czech and the Slovak people will hold a magnificent festival in one of the largest halls of Chicago, the Coliseum. We are inviting all Czech organizations to participate. At the same time, we wish to call the attention of the Czech public to this great demonstration of loyalty on the part of the Czech and the Slovak element. We shall issue a call to all male and female organizations to appear in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on April 30, where the arrangements will be discussed so that the festival can be organized properly. We sincerely hope that Czechs and Slovaks will take part by the thousands, so that the event will overshadow everything of its kind that has ever taken place in this city. All our singers in the city will join to represent Czechoslovak song in an impressive manner.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>All our musicians are requested to inform us whether they are able to assist, and under what conditions. We are also asking our organizations to send us their resolutions concerning this matter.</p>
   <p>We know that this demonstration will create wide interest in the United States, and particularly in Washington. We implore all Czechs and Slovaks in Chicago to approach the solution of this problem joyfully and with a thorough understanding of the vast importance of this event for our cause. We want to support our people and show them that we stand behind the President and his ideals, just as the entire American nation does. Czech and Slovak Chicago is sure to do everything to lend might and weight to our voice so that it will be a powerful example of our willing and sacrificing support of both our new homeland and the land of our birth.</p>
   <p>We shall keep our public in constant contact with the progress of our efforts. We shall do this by means of publications.</p>
