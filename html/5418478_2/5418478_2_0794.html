   <p>Our boys are working hard to train themselves to be fit when the moment comes to fight for the freedom of America and for the liberation of our brothers in Czechoslovak lands. It is certain that within a short time these boys may be exposed to ice-cold weather somewhere in France, and we shall feel sorry for them. This will not help them, but nevertheless we should try to make their lot as bearable as possible.</p>
   <p>In what manner can this be done? If we send them sweaters, warm gloves, and socks, they will feel greatly relieved.</p>
   <p>The director of Dvorak Park is sending out an appeal to all women, married or single, to take part in the sewing parties which are to be held in the Park building. There will be a gathering in the park tomorrow, Sunday, at 3 P.M. for the purpose of discussing arrangements for this humanitarian work. All that is necessary for the realization of the idea is just a little good will.</p>
