   <p>The new City Council will be installed into office tonight. The ceremony will not have the picturesque features of former years, because the police will see to it that no floral decorations are brought into the council chambers.</p>
   <p>It is expected that there will be some significant changes in the committees. Two Bohemian aldermen, Ed. T. Novak and V. E. Cerveny are retiring from the Council, but their places are being taken by two other Bohemians, Rud Hurt and Jos. Z. Uhlir.</p>
