   <p>While the European press plainly recognizes the open revolt of Bohemian soldiers and considers it a full-fledged revolution, there are still some Bohemian-American newspapers which take a delight in minimizing the significance of the resulting suffering and loss of life by printing in bold type occasional stories about the "bravery" of Bohemian soldiers. In doing this they wittingly or unwittingly serve the Austrian cause and make themselves deserving of the strongest criticism and censure.</p>
   <p>The European Press about the Revolt of Bohemian Regiments</p>
   <p>Not only the French, English, and Italian, but also the Swiss and German newspapers have been printing long and detailed reports and comments <span class="page-break">2</span>concerning the arrest of Dr. Kramar [leader of the "Young-Bohemian" political party], Dr. Josef Scheiner [head of all sokols], Slama, and Fischer important men in Dr. Kramar's party], as well as the disbandment of some Bohemian regiments, all of which news means that the Austrian persecution in Bohemia and the revolutionary behavior of Bohemian soldiers are gradually waking Europe up to the realization that the Bohemian question is a question of international importance. Up to this time even people who are no particular friends of Austria have failed to believe that the opposition to war in Austria is so grave as to assume international proportions, and the Austrian government hoped that it would be able to handle the situation by strict denials of all news of this nature which leaked through its censorship, at least until, with Germany's help, the war should be won.</p>
   <p>That situation has, however, changed considerably. Official denials will no longer do any good. Every day brings new reports of surrendering or revolting Bohemian regiments, and the Austrian government has been obliged to use measures against the Bohemian passive and active resistance that can <span class="page-break">3</span>no longer be kept secret. The quiet ways of suppressing that resistance had to be changed into suppression by plain terror. All political leaders--that is, those who had not fled the country in good time--have been arrested and are kept in prison. News about the execution of soldiers and civilians for high treason may now be published in newspapers. All Bohemian regiments have been removed from Bohemian lands, and the fact that Austria is fighting also in Bohemia--against an inner enemy--is no longer a secret.</p>
   <p>Archduke Frederick in Forebears' Bloody Footsteps</p>
   <p>It is characteristic that the order for this change in tactics came--as we are learning from an unimpeachable source--from the commander-in-chief of the Austrian armies, the Archduke Frederick himself. First of all, it is absolutely certain that the order for the arrest of Dr. Kramar and Dr. Scheiner was issued by the army headquarters over the head of the highest civil authorities in Bohemia, without consultation, with the cabinet, and probably against their wishes. It is reported that the Archduke issued the <span class="page-break">4</span>order after having gathered convincing evidence of the treasonable spirit of the whole Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>It has been learned from well-informed circles that the Archduke has passed on to the office of the Emperor, to the military supreme court, and to the ministries of war, the interior, and foreign affairs, a report in which he maintains that the whole Bohemian nation, including all its strata, even the civil service men, is saturated with Russophile tendencies. It is reported that as a proof of his statement he mentions that ten thousand Bohemian prisoners of war have enlisted in a legion in Russia which fights side by side with the Russian army, that a number of Bohemian regiments in Galicia and Serbia have gone over to the enemy, and that Bohemian prisoners of war in St. Petersburg had, in a spirit of mockery, played for them the Austrian Imperial anthem! This report, in which the Archduke insists upon having the strictest measures taken against the Bohemian nation, has caused an immense sensation in Vienna, it is reported. Pressure has been brought <span class="page-break">5</span>to bear upon the Bohemian members of the parliament and diet in an effort to make them express their regrets for these developments, and at least their regret of the surrender of the Prague Bohemian Infantry Regiment No. 28, which went over, officers and all, to the Russians in Galicia on April 3.</p>
   <p>Bohemians Resist Pressure</p>
   <p>A request has been made known that the representatives of Bohemian political parties, that is of the "Young Bohemian," the Catholic, and the Agricultural parties, should personally express their regrets in an audience with the Archduke. To the honor of our political parties it must be stated that they refused to commit such an act of disloyalty toward the nation, and the new Mistodrzitel (German: Statthalter, head of the government in Bohemia) got nothing more than some meaningless, worthless assurances of loyalty from a few subservient city councils, such as those of Prague and Plzen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Rough Treatment of Leaders</p>
   <p>In retaliation, a crueler military regime was introduced. Dr. Kramar and Dr. Scheiner were treated like common criminals. They were arrested without any court order, and absolutely against all existing laws. In Vienna they were put in filthy cells without table or washstand. Only after strong protests was Dr. Kramar able to secure these most essential pieces of furniture. Similar protests were necessary to secure permission to get his food from the outside. The government, which is now absolutely powerless against the military regime, has been afraid of the results of such treatment of the foremost leaders of the Bohemian nation and has issued to all its offices, throughout the country, the order to announce to the people in Bohemia that they had been released. Also the press received a statement--false, of course--to that effect. But such things do not mean anything; they are simply an evidence of the fear that the civil authorities have of the effects such actions are bound to have. But the civil government has no power now; as has been said before, it has nothing to say, and everything is up to the Austrian, and even more to <span class="page-break">7</span>the German army headquarters.</p>
   <p>Efforts to Exterminate the Nation</p>
   <p>These have, it seems, set out to exterminate the Bohemian nation. The best method to use to achieve that end is recruiting. The newly ordered physical examinations of those who had not passed them previously are most efficient, in that everybody is being found able to serve. This applies particularly to the educated classes, because the government is of the opinion that without their leadership the nation will not be capable of an organized opposition. While in German-speaking districts a maximum of fifty per cent of draftees are found fit for military service, there are from eighty to ninety per cent of draftees from Bohemian parts accepted. Not even a very evident physical disability is being considered. All those who are thus found able are immediately removed from their home surroundings and enrolled in non-Bohemian regiments, mostly in Styria. Naturally, laws lost their power long ago. There exists a law that Zemebrana (German: Landwehr, <span class="page-break">8</span>military units designated to defend the crown land from which they are recruited and which are composed of less able, older men) must not be used outside of their home land without specific approval by the parliament. Another law provides that no men over forty-two years of age are to be used at the front. But the Bohemian Zemebrana has been used for a long time in Galicia and Hungary, and the draft will soon reach the men fifty-six to sixty years of age.</p>
   <p>Sokols--Rebels. A Sokol Identification Card Means Death</p>
   <p>In all this, the first principle is to Bohemian soldiers, and particularly those who are Sokols, the very worst of it. As it is, the Sokols have been looked on as dangerous traitors. This is due to the fact that the largest proportion of those who surrender to the enemy is among the Sokols, and that Sokol identification cards are being carried by many of them. The explanation of this is seen in the assumption that these soldiers want to have handy a document proving their Slavic orientation. Lately it was particularly  <span class="page-break">9</span>the Krakow army headquarters that took the most drastic steps against the Sokol "high treason". An order was issued at the end of April and three times in succession read to the soldiers, providing for the application of martial law to offenses of that kind; that is, any soldier on whom a Sokol identification card is found must expect to be shot.</p>
   <p>All this terrorism, quite naturally, has only one result: it educates the Bohemian people in a carefully thought-out opposition and strengthens the unity of the whole nation. The terrorism will grow as time passes, but by the same token the conviction will grow that no relinguishing of the fight between Prague and Vienna is ever possible.</p>
   <p>Smetana's Symphony Perils Austria</p>
   <p>Austria's petty maniacal ragings are best demonstrated by the fact that even the performance of the most outstanding Bohemian musical compositions is forbidden by law. Last May, the National Theater in Prague put on, as is <span class="page-break">10</span>customary, a series of Smetana's works, among them the symphonic poem "Ma Vlast" (My Homeland), which is immensely popular. This time its success was so great that a repetition of it was being prepared. But the police have definitely forbidden the repetition "Ma Vlast" because "Smetana's symphony nurtures opposition to Austria among the Bohemian people". Thus, Austria has been saved again--but for how long? Their bad conscience is driving the Austrian bureaucrats to outbursts of insanity.</p>
   <p>A Lot of Money for War in Bohemia</p>
   <p>Many Bohemian newspapers in America have maintained that in Bohemia there is enough money for the war, and even the Austrian press bureau points frequently to the spirited subscribing to war loans as definite evidence of the war enthusiasm of the people throughout the Monarchy. We have succeeded in getting hold of a document that shows this enthusiasm among Bohemian financial institutions in a somewhat different light. It proves that the reports about spirited subscribing in Bohemia are lies calculated <span class="page-break">11</span>to deceive the public, and that the government exerts the strongest pressure in order to break down the opposition of Bohemian financial institutions to war loans. In the latter part of May, the head office of the new Mistodrzitel sent to all Bohemian loan banks and savings institutions the following printed circular letter:</p>
   <p>"According to a report submitted to me for information, your institution has subscribed from its own means only Crowns....to the 1915 war Loan. This is....per cent. of deposits reported by you as amounting to Crowns....According to the report of the ministry of the interior, your savings bank was, regrettably, among the institutions which failed to subscribe to the first war loan in such proportion to their means as other financial institutions in the country, and now, on the occasion of the second war loan, your bank has failed to correct that proportion. No unusual circumstances that would make it impossible for your institution to subscribe in an adequate proportion are known here. I request, therefore, that your board of directors rescind its old decision and make a new one concerning your institution's <span class="page-break">12</span>war-loan subscription, and that they report to me the amount to which your subscription was raised, thus proving that your institution is prepared to do the natural patriotic duty to support as much as possible this most important war loan. If, contrary to all expectations, your board should not make the decision to raise your subscription, this fact is to be reported to me also, together with a statement of reasons why the board has failed to raise proportionately the amount of your war-loan subscription. Should your board try to justify an insufficient measure of subscribing by some special, unfavorable conditions and a resulting shortage on liquid funds, I remark right now that I should have to give very serious consideration to such conditions when the time comes to make decisions concerning the savings bank's requests for communal loans, for approval of donations, etc., which the savings bank may already have submitted or may submit in the future.</p>
   <p>"C. K. (Cisarsky-Kralovsky - Imperial-Royal) Mistodrzitel Coudenhove."</p>
   <p>What does the threat contained in the last sentences mean? It means that <span class="page-break">13</span>Count Coudenhove will stop a large portion of the business of such savings institutions by prohibiting them from making loans to communities, and will prohibit the usual distribution of donations for national and charitable purposes out of the bank's surplus. It is customary in Bohemia for all financial institutions to contribute at least a part of their earnings to-ward national purposes. That, the Mistodrzitel is trying to stop, and he also seeks to ruin, economically, the cities and towns whose payments of obligations frequently depend upon their ability to get loans from local financial institutions. He threatens economic reprisals which would still more impair the economic standing of Bohemian communities and with them that of thousands of little people in Bohemia.</p>
   <p>This is a new method of financial persecution. The Austrian bureaucrat threatens that, in addition to the state bankruptcy, there will be communal bankruptcy in Bohemia, if--But this type of immoral tour de force is fittingly supplemented by pressure upon Bohemian industrialists and their employees, upon anybody who may be a prospect. Small wonder, then, that <span class="page-break">14</span>scattered Bohemian names appear on lists of war-loan subscribers. However, these are principally names of Bohemian industrialists and higher ranking government or civil and private employees, who are so situated that noncompliance would result in their own ruin and that of their employees as well as that of their families and other dependents. These contributions are made under duress, and it is therefore an act of cruel injustice when even Bohemian newspapers in America appear to relish the brutality of Austrian bureaucrats and harm the Bohemian cause by publishing misleading articles and news. The excuse that the names of subscribers have been taken from Prague newspapers is no excuse at all. Prague newspapers must publish these official lists exactly the way they have been given to them by the authorities. A refusal to do so would result in the stopping of their publication, and that would mean not only the ruin of the newspaper itself, but also loss of employment to hundreds, in some cases thousands of employees in their printshops, and consequently loss of their means of support. These facts may suffice to give those in America the proper conception of the life in Bohemia at the present time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">15</span>
   <p>American Expectations of the Bohemian Nation in the Year of John Huss</p>
   <p>In these distressing times, when the only source of moral strength of the Bohemian nation is in its history and the heritage of its great men, when it is forbidden at home to commemorate John Huss' anniversary, an event observed throughout the civilized world, in these times the eyes of the Bohemian nation turn toward foreign shores; toward those of its leaders and workers outside of the country who are now, under extremely difficult economic conditions, developing an energetic movement for Bohemian independence, toward those members of the educated and working classes who have enrolled in the French and Russian armies and are risking their lives for their oppressed nation. But it is now well known in Bohemia that the largest branch of the nation, away over the wide ocean in the land of the starry banner, has awakened from its inertia. The greatest hopes of Bohemia are in Bohemian America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>All Bohemian colonies outside the old country are in arms, and are giving in sacrifice the lives of their sons and fathers. This the Bohemians in America cannot do. It is no more than just, then, that greater financial sacrifices should be expected of them, sacrifices that will compare, if that is at all possible, with sacrifices of lives made by Bohemians in Russia, France, England, and Serbia. They know, in Bohemia, what is being written in Bohemian newspapers in America, they follow the demoralizing work of Austrian and Hungarian agents and their moneys, and many of them have been bitterly disappointed in learning about the fatal lack of understanding, the malicious hatred which, it seemed, were the result of foreign influences. Many press attacks have caused astonishment; many, also, rightful wrath to which vent will be given when the Bohemian people have done their work at home. Nobody in Bohemia, nobody outside of Bohemia, could have thought it possible that Bohemian blood could become so badly tainted in America, that creatures can exist of such baseness as to use even the slightest opportunity to cause great pleasure to Austrian hirelings and great moral damage to the Bohemian cause. It should have <span class="page-break">17</span>seemed that the maturity of the Bohemian character would manifest itself here in America, and that from here, from Bohemian America, the chief impulse toward the fight against the militaristic monarchy would come forth. Instead of this, in the very first months of the war, some newspapers arriving in Bohemia from Bohemian America caused a great deal of disappointment, and more recently some have arrived there whose attacks against the most unselfish representatives of the Bohemian nation have been, in these warlike times, nothing but high treason committed against Bohemia, acts certainly unworthy of the admirers of John Huss and the revolutionary Taborites, and certainly fully worthy of some of the Bohemian Judases of whom, fortunately, we have had very few in really decisive moments. But what is being perpetrated in Bohemia by fanatical German Jews and by bureaucratic or Catholic Church-fed monsters, must not go on here in America. All Bohemian newspapers in America are being most carefully perused, officially reported upon, and those who still want to engage in polemics with workers for the Bohemian cause, and citations of "bravery" of Bohemian soldiers, are enemies of the cause and it will be necessary that the American Bohemians devote their <span class="page-break">18</span>full attention to that type of "work for the Bohemian cause". Because those who now, in the eleventh month of the war, are still ignorant of the true state of affairs, who still use Austrian official reports as their justification, or who take sides with the centripetal forces against the central political leadership, are doing an unpardonable wrong. And those who maintain that the leaders of the Bohemian action work for Austria and her cause are committing an injustice they will hardly ever be able to undo.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we say to all well-intentioned Bohemians overseas:</p>
   <p>Do not give in!</p>
