   <p>We should not forget in these turbulent times of War the thousands of Czech and Slovak brethren who are prisoners of war in Russia, Italy, Corfu, and particularly in France, or who work in the shops of the Allies, and also those who have not succeeded in joining some Czech organization, or the Foreign Legion up to the present time. In all of these camps there are many of our men who came from Servia, by way of Italy to France. They are in need of clothing and other necessities. They also want Czech-American newspapers and books. The latter articles are being regularly sent to them by the Narodni Soc. Beseda Fric, which club is doing its duty in an admirable manner. Of clothing, however, very much is needed, and for this reason the Czech-American Aid Society has decided to start action for the purpose of collecting the articles lacking in the camps. The above gifts are to be sent to brother Josef Vokral, 1735 West <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>18th Street. It is understood that clothes and underwear must be perfectly clean and repaired, but they will be disinfected before they are placed in the boxes which will be taken care of by the American Red Cross for delivery. This method has been practiced for a long time. Gifts of money will be distributed by banks, and even the smallest amounts will be appreciated by the Aid Society.</p>
