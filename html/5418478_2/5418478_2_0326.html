   <p>The present time certainly offers a good opportunity for observations on the man who represents Chicago, one of the largest and most cosmopolitan cities of the world. Each of the big cities has its characteristics. Chicago also has an earmark of its own - that rascal, Mayor William Hale Thompson, who, himself, insists upon being talked and written about....and who is doing his utmost to expose himself to severe criticism.</p>
   <p>Before election, he promised the blue sky, and seemed to be the most enthusiastic American and patriot at that. He proclaimed in thousands <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of handbills that it is the foremost duty of the citizens to elect a man whose Americanism is beyond reproach.....The voters fell for this rigmarole, and the Mayor won, but only to cause embarrassment and disappointment to all those who had cast their votes for him.....He made a name for himself by closing the saloons on Sunday against the wishes of the great majority of the populace. He did not change his order, even after he had been shown up as a double-crosser.... Our readers surely remember all the cases in which Mayor Thompson demonstrated his duplicity, and principally his incapability..... The Mayor crowned his achievements finally by a conduct which attracted the attention of the whole world....The French delegation with General Joffre, and the English delegation, arrived in America for a conference with our government. It consisted of men of renown and great prestige.</p>
   <p>They came for a visit to Chicago, but not upon the invitation by the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mayor, for he had refused them this courtesy. He made a spectacle of himself as a man bare of loyal sentiment, one who should be driven from office. The most deplorable part of all this is the fact that he, who first was so recalcitrant, now is beginning to confer with the committee in charge of the reception of the Allied delegates. The Mayor thus proved himself to be a man without shame or honor. A man of this caliber is the person who represents us.</p>
