   <p>The Thompson administration, whose conscience is already overburdened with many sins, has perpetrated so much mischief that it will be remembered with righteous indignation for many years to come. These evil deeds are crowned for all times by the fact that the Mayor packs the Chicago School Board with people who, in these portentous times, make no effort to control their rabid pro-German sentiments. These same people violently oppose the removal of the name of Bismarck from the books in our public schools--Bismarck, who is characterized by all sensible men as the lowest human beast in modern history and the most successful criminal on whom the German nation can pride itself before the civilized world. If the people of Chicago forgive every sin the Mayor has committed against them, they surely will not forget this particular disgrace.</p>
