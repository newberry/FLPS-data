   <p>The Czech picture card club Letem-Svetem (Round the World) has only three hundred members and $200 in the treasury, yet it appropriated $150 for the purchase of Liberty bonds. The members pay only ten cents per month in dues, but everyone pledged to buy one bond. The sum of the individual purchases will thus amount to $15,000. Mr. J. Pavloff, the president of the club, was one of the speakers for the war loan.</p>
