   <p>Everyone must be in his place; everyone must do his duty. The child, the boy and girl, the husband and wife, old man and old woman: each must stand up in this critical time and take upon himself the burden which the just war we are pursuing now has placed upon our shoulders. Everyone must work for an early and complete victory. Even the most convinced protagonist of peace must take part in this patriotic work, for only when all the American people step in as one man and exert their powers, only then this terrible war will end and peace will reign. Today we should not speak of peace, but of war and victory only. When we have won the war and attained victory, we will have a peace which will be a boon for all humanity. It will be a permanent peace, founded upon the principles of liberty and the rights of all peoples.</p>
