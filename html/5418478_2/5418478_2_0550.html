   <p>Everybody can pledge himself to buy War Savings Stamps regularly during the year 1918. Nobody is too important to buy War Savings Stamps. Nobody is too insignificant. Now, let us join hands, employer and employee, banker and bootblack, wholesale merchant and newsboy, society lady and washerwoman, student and common laborer!</p>
   <p>All Americans, all Allies, all determined to support Uncle Sam to the limit!</p>
   <p>We must win the war! War Savings Stamps are the most beautiful emblem of American humanitarian government. Every one of us can afford to have them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Any one who has not got them ought to be ashamed of himself.</p>
   <p>Pledge--Week of May 11 to May 18</p>
   <p>Sign a pledge to buy and to continue to buy! Promise to buy weekly and monthly a certain amount, for the whole year! Pledge yourself to buy what you can--then keep your word!</p>
