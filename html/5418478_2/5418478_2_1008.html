   <p>Theodore Roosevelt is expected in Chicago this week to deliver a speech to stimulate eagerness for enlistment for service in the United States Army. We predict a welcome this time more hearty than the one extended to him when he came as a candidate for the presidency. His activity in favor of the United States Army will be more valuable than when he is a politician.</p>
