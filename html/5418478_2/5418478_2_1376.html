   <p>We would like to see the "Lusitania" disaster accelerate the decision of Italy --and other until now neutral countries of Europe--because we firmly believe that this decision will be very unpalatable both to the Germans and to their always faithful, admiring followers, the Austrians. We are convinced that Rumania, and particularly Italy, will think twice before they decide to have anything to do with the Germans, the world's worst barbarians, after the criminal affair of the "Lusitania". We trust, therefore, that Rome and Bucharest will join the Allies and thus help to bring this war, which has involved almost the whole world, to a just conclusion, which would be a victory for the Allies. Such an end would give a powerful and fully deserved lesson to the three most disgusting allies the world has ever seen, Germany, Austria, and Turkey.</p>
