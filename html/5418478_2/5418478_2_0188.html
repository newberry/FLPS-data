   <p>Those who were victorious are rubbing their hands with joy, although the careful observer knows that this result was accomplished only with the help of the money of New York's Tammany, and those who were defeated, will again turn their attention to private matters in the knowledge that they endeavored according to their best capabilities, to bring the taxpayer's money into the pockets of unnecessary officials and contractors. So far as we Bohemians are concerned, we see nothing in the results, except the decline of national consciousness.</p>
   <p>The personal political interests of some climbers have suppressed, so it seems, absolutely that sublime idea of one large Bohemian-American family, of that branch of a great people, which transplanted to the fertile soil of Free America will bloom again. There was a time when our countrymen, regardless of political affiliation, would vote for a Bohemian, as such, but that time is past.</p>

   <p>We recollect the words of V L K: "Moral poison is a cheap article among Bohemians, for it is cooked up in so many Bohemian hearts and heads. Bleed from a thousand wounds, dear fatherland, your sons will heal you by pouring into fresh wounds new poisons."- Wherefore are we hastening on earth? Isn't it time that we face about, isn't it time that we open our eyes to see, that in the pursuit of the Golden Calf, we are selling national ties, which thus far have bound us for a plate of simple porridge?</p>
   <p>Isn't it time that we expose those various false prophets among us, who praise the work of individuals in the various offices only so long as they have some gain therefrom, but persistently pass the workers by in silence, when they could be given recognition in the form of an honorable public office, and they ignore them, only because they received from the other political party a paltry sum and two lots on which to build a printing plant?</p>
   <p>Isn't it time, that our people prepare themselves to tear down and destroy this artistic structure of the political clique, which lies on the breast of our entire national activity like an Alpine mass, so that we can not even breathe, let alone live and successfully advance?</p>

   <p>If the principle of neighborly loveis a simple farce, which is good enough for celebrations and theory, but in practice is rejected, it is better that you fling it away at once; at least you will be sincere to the masses of our people, and at least the people will know where they stand. So far as we are concerned we can sleep in peace. We did our duty in supporting all sincere and actual Bohemians, who sought public office and everyone knows, that only shameful practices, fraud and bribery caused the victory to fall to the other side.</p>
   <p>We shall not stop before the film is removed from the eyes of our people, and, surely, the time is not far off when they will awake and realize who gave them good advice.</p>
