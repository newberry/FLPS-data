   <p>The hopes of the Democrats are blighted and the wishes of the Czechs go unfulfilled. The entire Republican county ticket has won. The blame for the Democratic defeat is laid upon the Hearst Independence League, which received about 50,000 votes which the Democrats lacked. The ninth senatorial district will be represented in Springfield by two Democrats, Anton J. Cermak and Danahue, and one Republican. Cyril Jandus, Democratic senator, and Mr. Hruby, Democratic representative, elected from the fifteenth district, and E. J. Smejkal, Republican from the seventeenth district, are Czechs.</p>
