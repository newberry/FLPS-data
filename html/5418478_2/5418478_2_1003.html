   <p>We have just received a letter from a fellow-countryman who is a prisoner of War in Russia now. It pictures interestingly the associations and general conditions among the prisoners. It also conveys a hearty appreciation of the work done by the Denni Hlasatel for the alleviation of the sufferings of the men. Special thanks are also expressed to the club, Beseda Fric, and to Mr. Vokral, who takes care of the transportation of the articles donated. The letter comes from Berislav, Russia, and is dated January 11, 1917.</p>
