   <p>September 26, 1914, is a red-letter day in the history of Bohemian propaganda. The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni has secured, through a serious, well founded, and tactfully conducted move a group of friends who may mean a great deal in times of transition and profound changes which Europe will have to go through at the end of this war.</p>
   <p>It is the day of the visit to Chicago of the commission sent by King Albert I to the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson. After having completed their diplomatic mission, the members of the delegation made a hurried trip throught the United States and Canada. They stayed in Chicago only fourteen hours. They spent the day sightseeing, were the guests of the <span class="page-break">2</span>Chicago Club at noon, and were introduced in the evening to their countrymen at a huge and spirited mass meeting.</p>
   <p>This meeting took, place in the Gold Room of Hotel de Jonghe at Monroe and State Streets. The small Belgian colony of Chicago was represented by about two hundred members, in addition to whom there were many Frenchmen, Englishmen, and a delegation of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance). The reason for sending this delegation was to express to the Belgians the heartfelt sympathies and sincere admiration of the Belgian nation by all American Bohemians, to give them in formation concerning the situation of the Bohemian nation in this world conflict, and to ask their friendship for a nation which, in so many respects, particularly in its history of suffering and oppression, resembles the nation of the brave Belgians. The Bohemian delegation consisted of Mr. James F. Stepina, president, and Mr. Jaromir R. Psenka, secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau); Professor <span class="page-break">3</span>Jaroslav Zmrhal, secretary of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council); Josef Holpuch, president of the Ceska Beseda (Bohemian Club); Dr. Ludvik Fisher, president, Mr. Emanuel Beranek, vice-president, Mr. Alois Melichar, secretary, of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance); and Mr. F. J. Trunecek, chairman of the Cleveland branch of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Felix J. Streyckmans, president of the association of Belgian societies in Chicago, who introduced the several members of the commission. The chairman of the commission, Henry Carton De Viart, addressed the assembly first in the French language and then in the Flemish language. He expressed pleasure at the fact that the American Belgians, although they have become Americans, do not lose their love for their native country; and now, particularly, they show such a deep interest in its future fate. He cautioned his countrymen to resist all temptation to violate the neutrality of this country, and asked them to contribute <span class="page-break">4</span>generously to the relief of their countrymen in Beligum, most of whom are now in misery and distress, driven from their homes, and deprived of their supporters.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was the well-known leader of the Free Thought movement, Mr. Hymans, who spoke in both languages of his country.</p>
   <p>The horrors of war and the devastation of beautiful Belgium by German vandals were vividly described by the minister of foreign affairs, Emil Vandervelde, who is the leader of the Socialist Party in Belgium and organizer of the General, so-called "quiet" strike that took place in Belgium two years ago. "God, to whom the German Kaiser so frequently prays for help," said this prominent Socialist, "has done one great thing for us Belgians. He has joined all of us--Catholics, Liberals, Socialists--into one single nation. I, who was a leader of the Republican party in Belgium, am talking to you now as a representative of the Belgian King.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Now we are all Belgians, and therein lies our salvation." Minister Vandervelde said that his wife was born in England and is, at present, in the United States organizing collections for Belgians who have been impoverished by the war. He announced that she will soon be in Chicago, where she will lecture.</p>
   <p>The speakers were frequently interrupted by applause. But when they described the suffering and sorrows that have visited their nation; the flight of the inhabitants of cities, towns, and villages from their homes in order that they might save bare lives, and now they roam, shelterless, about the devasted country and are perishing of hunger; the women who were catching and hanging on to automobiles on the highways, praying the travelers to take them along and let them flee the approaching German soldiers; the children, without parents and relatives, sneaking with heart-rending cries around their burned homes: Many a brave man's eye shed a tear of profound sympathy and compassion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The meeting ended with the singing of the Belgian and American national anthems. While marching out of the hall, the assembly sang the "Marseillaise," in which most voices joined and resounded majestically throughout the entire hotel.</p>
   <p>Thereafter, the Bohemian delegation was granted a special audience in the Green Room, adjoining the room where the meeting had been held. When the delegates of the Belgian nation entered the room, the Bohemian delegates were introduced individually by Consul Cyrill Vermeren. They all exchanged cordial handshakes with one another, whereupon the spokesman for the Bohemian delegation, Mr. Psenka, greeted the guests in the French language on behalf of Chicago Bohemians and the entire great branch of the Bohemian nation in America. Among other things, he said:</p>
   <p>"Your soldiers are shedding their blood for the sacred cause of liberty; they are giving their lives for the independence of their country; they are <span class="page-break">7</span>sacrificing all that is dear to them for the honor of their flag, thus putting in practice the slogan of your noble, galant King Albert: 'Potius mori guam coedari' (Rather die than yield).</p>
   <p>"Our unfortunate brothers in the beautiful Bohemian lands, in the very heart of Europe, cannot do this, because they are being made a part of the Austrian army by force, under the flag of their oppressors, in the ranks of foes of justice and liberty. But their hearts and souls are all on your side--on the side of right.</p>
   <p>"The Bohemians, the Slovaks, the Poles, the Ruthenians, the Slovenes, the Croatians, the Bosnians, the Dalmatians: All these Slavs are your brothers. How many of them--nobody will ever be able to determine their number--are giving their lives for your cause, for the cause of liberty of small nations? We know very well where to seek the reason for the general failure of the Austrian army, which loses even in cases where the enemy is many times <span class="page-break">8</span>smaller. The Slavs of Austria are convinced that the victory of the Allies will mean the beginning of an era of new life for them, an era in which they will finally be able to breathe the blessed air of freedom.</p>
   <p>"We have come to express to you the admiration and sympathy of the Bohemian nation and, at the same time, to present the request that your Excellencies may also remember other small nations when Europe is finally liberated from the monster of tyranny and the time comes to discuss the conditions of peace; may the small nations which do not enjoy the privilege of fighting for their destiny with an armed fist, be remembered. We hope that you will speak for your friends, the Bohemian nation, whose eight million members worship at the shrine of the same ideals of equality, fraternity, and liberty of which the Belgian nation is justly so proud."</p>
   <p>After this address, delivered in the delegates' native language and listened <span class="page-break">9</span>to in deep silence and with keen attention, the Bohemian delegation presented each member of the commission with a printed copy of this address and a copy of an informative article. This article, written in the French language, contains concise, but exact information concerning the desires and rights of the Bohemian nation, and a clear explanation of its present situation. It is printed in a booklet of exquisite taste on heavy vellum. The document's beauty is equalled only in its importance. An additional ten copies of this memorandum were given to the commission's secretary, Count Louis Lichtervelde, with the request that he present them to other influential people in Belgium. Each member of the commission was also presented with a copy of Professor Will. V. Monroe's beautiful book, "Bohemia and the Cechs".</p>
   <p>After the address by the speaker of the Bohemian delegation, the Belgian minister of justice and the leader of the Belgian commission, Carton de Viart, took the floor and cordially thanked the Bohemian delegation for <span class="page-break">10</span>its expression of sympathy. He promised to pass it on to the leaders of the Belgian nation and to the Belgian people.</p>
   <p>Following this, he made a statement which deeply stirred the hearts of all the Bohemians, and which may be presented to the Bohemian nation as a promise for the future made by a man who belongs to the ranks of those who will participate in negotiations in which conditions in Europe will be settled after the war.</p>
   <p>"You have touched upon a question," said the chairman of the commission, "to which diplomatic circles today pay great attention. My obligation to respect the neutrality of this country restrains me from going into details, but I may say this much: In the present case, European diplomacy will not be able to avoid finding a definite solution to the problem of relations between large and small nations, and it will have to be solved in a way which will stop all national strife once and for all, making it <span class="page-break">11</span>possible for every nation to live its own life and to progress as an individual, independent unit. After independent Poland, whose destiny is now emerging from the chaos of war, the rest of the oppressed nations will have to get due satisfaction.</p>
   <p>"I repeat that we shall study the memorandum by whose presentation you have honored our delegation most carefully, and we shall speak about you and support your claims whenever and wherever we shall be able to help your cause. Your visit and your action will remain in our memory as one of the most outstanding events of our journey which we are undertaking in these sad and critical times.</p>
   <p>"Many thanks to you, friends; many thanks to you, Bohemians, many thanks!"</p>
   <p>The stately, sturdy Belgian spoke these words with deep emotion, which was shared by all who were present. After this, the members of the Belgian <span class="page-break">12</span>commission grouped around the Bohemian delegates and asked them, first in English, then in the French language, various questions which showed their lively interest in the Bohemian nation. Of course, all questions were gladly and readily answered. The Belgians were particularly interested in learning about the relations between Bohemians and Austrian Poles. They knew quite well that until now, the Poles had been supporting the government party that has been preventing the other Slavs from getting justice. But they were confident that this will change in the near future.</p>
   <p>The Socialist leader, Vandervelde, asked whether the news of the many Austrian debacles has reached Bohemia. The reply to this, naturally, was in the affirmative, and was substantiated by citations from various passages in recent letters which carry true indications of the spirit now prevailing in the old country.</p>
   <p>The Belgians remained in the company of the Bohemians for about fifteen <span class="page-break">13</span>minutes, and departed only when the commission's secretary came in with the announcement that it was time to start for the depot. The adieus were as friendly and warm as the presentation of the memorandum was ceremonial and formal. This is being construed as an indication that the Bohemian party will soon hear from the Belgians, and that our men have made a good and lasting impression.</p>
   <p>The presentation of the memorandum was the kind of step which the Narodni Sdruzeni is planning to take whenever there is an opportunity to influence such personages of whom it can be expected to have a word in deciding the future form of Europe.</p>
   <p>There have been organizations similar to the Narodni Sdruzeni formed in several other Bohemian settlements in the United States. They have been asked by the Narodni Sdruzeni to join efforts in order that any action the Bohemians in America may undertake will be strong, unified, and well organized, <span class="page-break">14</span>and have behind it all of Bohemian America. A number of these organizations have already expressed their willingness to cooperate, so it may be expected that in a few days the American branch of the Bohemian nation will have a body which will be able to represent and act for it in these important times.</p>
