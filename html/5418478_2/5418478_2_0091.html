   <p>Our countrymen in Berwyn recently held a meeting for the purpose of registering a protest against excessive taxation, and their protest is entirely justified if we consider the amounts of their assessments.</p>
   <p>No one need be surprised that the Berwyn citizens are making propositions to the citizens of Cicero, and that the Czech community of Berwyn is requesting to be made a part of Cicero, where taxes are much lower, and where the improvements made for money assessed are clearly seen.</p>
