   <p>Our boys are facing the Huns to prevent terrors such as are being experienced on Belgian and French soil from descending upon America.</p>
   <p>They are called on to meet the most cruel and cunning enemy ever faced by mankind.</p>
   <p>They need guns, food, care, and ships to transport them over 3,000 miles of waters infested with U-boats.</p>
   <p>Stand behind these boys, who risk their lives to insure your safety! Lend the Government part of the money you have saved, to enable it to provide food, clothes, and ammunition for them.</p>
   <p>W. S. S.--War Savings Stamps issued by the United States Government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Place your savings into United States War Savings Stamps.</p>
   <p>Let our soldiers know that you are with them. Buy War Savings Stamps, and try to induce others to do likewise! Lend your surplus savings to the Government!</p>
   <p>Lend to our boys over there, so that you won't have to run away before enemies over here. One Savings Stamp costs 25 cents. Interest bearing Stamps cost $4.19 in August.</p>
   <p>Buy from your mail carrier, or a bank or store near your home.</p>
