   <p>The County Board of Commissioners will, in the next few days, publish a list of soldiers who laid down their lives for America in the Civil, Spanish-American, and World Wars. As this list will supposedly be a complete one, we advise our countrymen, who are relatives or parents of these, our heroes, to see to it that all Czechoslovak names be actually included in it.</p>
   <p>All that is necessary is to send the name and military record of the man in question to Captain Lewis who is compiling the list. He wishes the list to be as complete as possible.</p>
