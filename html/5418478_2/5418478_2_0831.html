   <p>Among the human hyenas we may count those who try to get rich from the war. They want to profit by the misery of their fellow beings, indeed, by the distress of the whole nation. This is the worst sin, the most dastardly crime imaginable. Although other delinquents are punished, these evil-doers escape unchastened. If other people would look upon these individuals with disdain and would refuse to associate with them, perhaps that would partly satisfy the demands of justice.</p>
