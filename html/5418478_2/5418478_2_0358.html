   <p>P.4--We have with us many reformers, but their work does not meet with much success. The reason for this is that people do not take much stock in the sincerity of their uplifting exhortations. Their activities comprise the suppression of "boodle," the exposure of scandals, and crusades against "grafters." They conduct this agitation to satisfy their own political ambitions, hoping to get publicity and recognition at the next election. As soon as they attain power, they prove to be no whit better, or only a little better, than those whose defeat has helped them to succeed. The name of reformer has of late acquired a more unsavory connotation than that of professional politician.</p>
