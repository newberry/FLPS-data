   <p>On Thursday evening, August 25th, 1921, at Pilsen Park, Chicago, there gathered about six hundred friends of Anton J. Cermak to welcome him from a visit to Europe, and particularly Czechoslovakia. The large hall was filled to overflowing in spite of the fact that the night was hot.</p>
   <p>Mr. Robert M. Sweitzer, the County Cleark of Cook County, acted as toastmaster. He extended a welcome to Mr. Cermak on his homecoming. He was followed by numerous representatives of the City Council and business men of the district.</p>
   <p>On behalf of the assembled friends a clasp watch chain was presented to the guest of honor. In thanking the audience, Mr. Cermak, emphasized his extreme pleasure with his trip and studies. It left a great impression upon him.</p>
   <p>The success of this notable affair was due to Mrs. Sedlacek and Mr. Sonnenschein, who arranged the entire program including moving pictures of the entire evening.</p>
