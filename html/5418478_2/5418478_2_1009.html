   <p>The school board has obstinately refused to take action on the matter of the "Kaiser Story" in the schoolbooks. The Czech National Alliance requested that the story be omitted in the next edition of the books. As no definite promise could be obtained from the authorities, the Alliance advises parents to tear the obnoxious page from the book and send it to the Alliance's office, 3625 W. 26th Street. Many thousands of pages are expected to arrive; they will be handed over to the school board together with a resolution condemning its attitude. The Polish National Alliance has promised cooperation.</p>
