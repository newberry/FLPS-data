   <p>.....We are glad to learn that the pernicious Barbour bill was defeated in the House of Representatives yesterday after it had passed in the Senate. It purports to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in dance halls where more than four persons are assembled, thus making our entertainments impossible, and undermine and hamper our social activities. Three other bills of prohibitionary nature also were rejected.....</p>
