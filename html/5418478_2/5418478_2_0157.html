   <p>A large number of our voters living in the Czechoslovak districts of Chicago registered their votes yesterday in spite of the bad weather; so many, indeed, that the results of registration may be called satisfactory. Everyone did his duty willingly, but many citizens complained against the action of the election commission which selected the places for registration. On the basis of the new reapportionment of wards, that is, the fixing of new ward boundaries, certain precincts have been reshuffled and new polling places established. In doing so the comfort of the citizens was disregarded almost entirely. In certain precincts which are almost four blocks long, the polling places were stuck away in the furthermost recesses of court buildings, making it necessary for the voters to walk from one end of his neighborhood to another to register. It certainly would be more correct and more just to have these polling places in the center of the precinct or as near the center as possible. This <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>happened in more than one instance, and what is remarkable here, is the fact that this discomfort was caused chiefly to the Czech and Polish voters and in the districts inhabited by them. Let us hope, however, that this kind of treatment did not scare anybody away from doing his duty as a citizen.</p>
