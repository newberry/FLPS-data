   <p>The Twelfth Ward may be proud that it has such a representative in the City Council and in the Democratic County Committee as is Anton J. Cermak. It is to the honor of the entire Czechoslovak population in our city that it is represented by a man whose word means something, who has influence and experience, and who is a dominant factor in those bodies of which he is a member.</p>
   <p>Therefore, there is no doubt that Democratic citizens of the Twelfth Ward will go to the ballot boxes and cast their votes for Mr. Cermak, who seeks re-election as Ward Committeeman. The Czechoslovak citizens of the Twelfth Ward may then rest assured that their wishes will be properly respected by leaders of the Democratic party, and that further representation in public <span class="page-break">2</span>office, to which we are entitled, will be given to us. "Merit deserves recognition"--that is a saying which at this time should hold special significance and interest for our community.</p>
