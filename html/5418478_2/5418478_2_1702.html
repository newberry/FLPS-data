   <p>p. 4. -Mr. Dodge, the federal food inspector, has given his views on the quality of meat before the congressional committee, referring to ex-President Theodore Roosevelt as authority.</p>
   <p>Old meat, says Dodge, is not nearly so bad as many people think; on the contrary, it is edible and even palatable.</p>
   <p>The household of the former President of the United States, has the custom, according to Mr. Dodge, of buying a whole side of beef and hanging it in the cellar to ripen till it acquires the odor which some call "game," "wild," or "high."</p>
   <p>When the goose hangs high, the President is ready to eat it. He enjoys no meat unless it has that flavor of maturity.</p>

   <p>In taking the ex-President's taste as an example, Mr. Dodge means to imply that what is good enough for an ex-President should be good enough for us, and that we should not grumble or be critical if the packers hand us a chunk of odorous meat once in a while. But Mr. Dodge is oblivious of the fact that human stomachs vary, and that Roosevelt's stomach has probably not its equal on this globe in its capacity for taking punishment. Our people believe in getting fresh meat when they pay for it.</p>
