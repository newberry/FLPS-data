   <p>Yesterday's issue of the Chicago Journal stands up sincerely for independence of the Czech lands. This newspaper has always shown a great interest in the Czech question. This time, again, it expatiates upon it, declaring that it must become one of the main and necessary issues of the World War.</p>
   <p>The introduction to the article deals with the declaration for independence by the Czech members of the Austrian parliament and the indignant refusal on the part of Premier Seydler, who declared that such a demand must be met with protest by every Austrian and every Austrian government.....</p>
   <p>The article closes as follows: The Czech land must be free. It is far away. We have heard but too little of it before. It is, nonetheless, a vanguard of our liberty, just as Belgium, Poland, and Alsace-Lorraine are. The Austrian government hopelessly chose the wrong path--President Wilson surely knew that it would do so--declining to accept the friendly counsel offered to her. It is now our diplomatic task to act over the head of the Austrian government. This will be done by means of propaganda and by help given to the oppressed nations, and among them, first to the Czechs.</p>
