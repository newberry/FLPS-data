   <p>Yesterday's Arbeiter Zeitung , among other things, says that in the 3rd Congressional District there is to be a contest for the office of Representative Leo Meilbek, who performed the duties of this office in the last session of the Legislature with ability and honesty. His influence on this law-making body was so beneficial, that there is no doubt but that the citizens of this district will give him a much larger vote as befits a man of the people.</p>
   <p>Standing removed from political partisanship, removed from the endeavors of the greedy or ambitious, Leo Meilbek has always been a representative standing up for the rights of an oppressed people, who also, have so few true representatives in their legislature. Anyone who casts his vote for Mr. Meilbek can rest assured that he has not thrown his ballot away, for he will have voted for a true atandard-bearer of freedom of the people and of progress, for a proven leader of the small but determined minority of the State Legislature. Meilbek has the daring and the ability to place himself, with success, in opposition to the representative of the capitalistic class.</p>
