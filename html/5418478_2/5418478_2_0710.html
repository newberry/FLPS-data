   <p>A large meeting of Czechoslovaks was held in the Pilsen Brewery Park, Albany Avenue and 26th Street, last night. Its sponsors were the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, and the Slovak League. Its purpose was twofold. First, it served to demonstrate our irreconcilable opposition to the Government of Austria; and second, to proclaim our loyalty to America, which has declared war on decayed Austria. We know what this means. It means the strengthening of our efforts to liberate our old homeland and to create an independent Czechoslovak state. This aim will be attained sooner or later, and the United States is helping us in that direction to a remarkable extent. It is evident from President Wilson's proclamation that this country has joined in the great struggle, with the liberation of the small nations in view. The Czechoslovaks are, therefore, included, for they are no less oppressed than others.</p>
   <p>The evening was devoted to the delivery of flaming speeches. Mr. Fr. J. <span class="page-break">2</span>Kubec, head of the district branch of the Czech National Alliance, opened the meeting. He introduced the first speaker, Mr. Joseph Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, whose address took about forty-five minutes. Mr. Tvrzicky declared that the declaration of war against Austria was the result of three years' activity in foreign affairs carried on by the Czechoslovaks. They may look with gratification upon the fact that a nation of one hundred millions has finally gone the way that had been shown them by the Slav nationalities three and a quarter years ago. This proves that what we felt years ago is now also felt by others. It is our duty to stand up firmly for President Wilson. In this we shall be fortified not only by our American patriotism, but also by the craving for retribution against the Hapsburgs, who have perpetrated the most shameful crimes against us for hundreds of years. The speaker emphasized the importance of the national tax [self-imposed by organizations and individuals of Czechoslovak descent]. The Czechoslovak Army in France needs means for its subsistence. The speaker further mentioned the President's proclamation, which is extremely favorable to our cause, although as an <span class="page-break">3</span>historic document it is forced, for good reasons, to leave out some details which we should like to read into it. Mr. Tvrzicky spoke in a highly appreciative tone of the Italian Army. The Italians, like us, want the destruction of Austria, and their army will accomplish this if they are given proper support by the Allies and the United States.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morton Johnson, an officer of the Alliance of Work and Democracy, pointed to the activities and attitude of certain politicians who cater to pro-Germans and pacifists in order to win election votes. He was fervently applauded.</p>
   <p>The Belgian consul, Dr. Cyril Vermaeren, was then presented as the official representative of Belgium by Dr. J. F. Smetanka. Dr. Vermaeren was enthusiastically greeted, and Rubringer's band played the Belgian anthem while the audience stood at attention.</p>
   <p>The Reverend F. Jodlicka, priest, patriot, and one of our foremost speakers, <span class="page-break">4</span>spoke of the early Americans as a shining example. They succeeded not only in building up a memorable document of independence, but by their unexampled courage, they have been able to preserve it to this day, a priceless gift to future generations. The speaker urged solidarity in action, for we all must be guided by one common purpose now and in the future, until the moment comes which we so eagerly anticipate--the negotiating of the peace treaty. He declared that the Czechoslovaks will have President Wilson as their spokesman. The Holy Father will also support them, as was promised to a Czech group on their visit to the delegate of the Holy See in Washington, D.C.</p>
   <p>Mr. Albert Mamates, president of the Slovak League, was to be the speaker for our brothers, the Slovaks. He could not appear, however, and Mr. Paul Jamarik of Pittsburgh took his place. He instantly won the sympathy of the audience when he began to picture the sufferings endured by the Slovaks under the rule of the rabid Magyars, who learned everything useful and worth knowing from the Slovaks and are repaying them with persecution. The same ingratitude toward the Slovaks was shown by the faithless <span class="page-break">5</span>Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria, whom they once helped against the Magyars, hoping that they [the Slovaks] would be rewarded with at least partial freedom. Instead, the treacherous monarch delivered them into the hands of the Magyars. Fear was expressed recently that some elements here would try to shield the Magyars and represent them as a chivalrous nation. However, such attempts proved futile the minute war was declared. America already knows the "Dutchmen". Now America will begin to know the Austrians and the Hungarians, their allies, the "gentlemen". These members of the "chivalrous nation" have denied the Slovaks every means of education. They have even robbed them of their most modest intellectual possession--their native language. As Slavs, we are united by common ideals. We have to stand and fight or else be doomed--and this is why this war has brought us nearer to each other than ever before. The speaker's fervent appeal was received with tumultuous acclaim.</p>
   <p>A no less fervent address was delivered by Dr. George Leontic, a Croatian and former student at Prague, who speaks the Czech language very well.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>He declared that Austria rules under the slogan Viribus Unitis, which means, "With United Efforts". It has nonetheless always tried to irritate the Slav nations and to disintegrate them in order to remove any possible danger. The Jugoslavs, also, are longing for liberty. They want Jugoslav state and are therefore attached to the Czechs and Slovaks by ties of sincerest friendship.</p>
   <p>The last speaker of the evening was Attorney Charles Pergler of Washington, D.C. He brought reliable information about the friendly sentiment entertained by influential Government circles toward the demands of the Czechoslovaks. He was assured that these demands will be given due prominence at the peace conference. The speaker also explained that the President's proclamation should not be interpreted incorrectly, since the President is too well known as a staunch protector of the small nations.</p>
   <p>A resolution was passed which best shows our attitude as sincere Americans, as a politically mature people. It voices our demands and will be submitted to the President.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"To the President of the United States:</p>
   <p>"The meeting of Czechs and Slovaks called by the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, and the Slovak League to celebrate the entrance of the United States into the war against Austria, has passed this manifesto addressed to you, the President of this great Republic and the moral leader of the united democracies of the entire world.</p>
   <p>"The Americans of Czechoslovak descent and Czechs and Slovaks of the United States reiterate their vow of loyalty to the President, the United States, and to the great cause of the united democracies of the world.</p>
   <p>"For hundreds of years the Czechoslovak nation has refused to be a slave of the German-Magyar oligarchy. For hundreds of years it has been carrying on its fight by legal means.</p>
   <p>"Today that same nation is not only rebelling against the tyrants, but it <span class="page-break">8</span>is also fighting for complete independence. The Czechs have refused to let the Austrian Emperor be crowned King of Bohemia. Czech representatives and the people themselves have refused to deal with the Vienna Government. They did not accept the promise of that government that independence will be granted to them, because the only forum to decide upon this century-old issue is the conference which will write the articles of peace after the World War.</p>
   <p>"The Czechs and Slovaks have manifested their loyalty by taking up arms against the German-Magyar and by battling on all fronts on the side of the Allies in order to prove their sincerity and devotion to democratic principles.</p>
   <p>"The United States, under your masterly guidance, declared war on Austria, and so proved its adherence to the cause of democracy. America has taken the lead in the struggle which is also our struggle. We promise joyfully to sacrifice all we possess to help toward ultimate victory.</p>
   <p>"Long live the President of our glorious and ever-victorious Republic!" <span class="page-break">9</span>The representatives of the Allied nations were sent telegrams in which assurance was given of the Czechoslovaks' devotion to the common cause.</p>
