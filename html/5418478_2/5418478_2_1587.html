   <p>Springfield, Illinois. May 4. Our Bohemian representatives in the State Legislature are sturdy fellows to be sure! They believe in self-government for the people, but that the people should have the right to vote on proposed laws, and frustrate the plans of the politicans that they do not like. The proposal for the initiative and referendum which the legislature discussed last night, was defeated. It needed nine more votes to pass. A two-thirds majority, or one hundred two votes were needed, and it received only ninety-three. Our Bohemian representatives aided greatly in its defeat. Representatives Blaha, Hrubec, Hruby, and Stoklasa, either deliberately left the session, or were present and did not vote, whereas Representative Smejkal voted against the bill.</p>
