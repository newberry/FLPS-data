   <p>One of the best known and most popular of our men who play a role in public life is Mr. Anton J. Cermák, alderman of the Twelfth Ward.....</p>
   <p>The ward may justly be proud of having him represent it in the City Council.....But his successful efforts are not limited to that ward; they spread throughout the city. His name is heard in connection with any important action undertaken in the City Hall, and it is he who gets the most difficult assignments from the mayor.....</p>
   <p>We see him taking part in all national undertakings, and his name is on the list of subscribers to all Bohemian charitable enterprises.....</p>
   <p>Urged by his many friends, Mr. Cermák agreed to run for the office of chief <span class="page-break">2</span>bailiff of the Municipal Court. He won the Democratic nomination for this office in the recent primaries, and he will be elected to this office two weeks from next Tuesday.....All good Bohemians who are interested in having men on whom our citizens can rely in every respect will see to it that election to the position of chief bailiff of the Municipal Court is assured for Mr. Cermák.</p>
