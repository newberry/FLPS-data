   <p>After all, Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst, the fighting British suffragette, will be admitted to the United States, although at the beginning it looked very much as if she would not escape deportation. For her good fortune the little lady from overseas has only the American women to thank. They took up her cause with such energy that even our determined immigration authorities were forced to capitulate. This means that American suffragettes won a complete victory in the very first serious encounter.</p>
   <p>But it must be admitted to their credit that throughout the battle they acted with consummate diplomacy and skill--something for Mrs. Pankhurst's book, and something she should underline at least three times. This topic should be worth a long series of very enlightening lectures in her own Old England.....</p>
