   <p>We are now entering the fourth week of the Third Liberty Loan campaign, and it is highly gratifying to state that the Czechs in the seventh federal district, chiefly, of course, in Chicago and suburbs, have fully grasped the meaning of their patriotic duty to the cause of our old homeland and to the sublime principle of democracy. A few exceptions cannot spoil the total effect.</p>
   <p>Up to last Saturday evening, the Czechs of the seventh district subscribed $1,900,000. Taking into account the fact that subscriptions have been made since, and that no accurate reports from the country districts have arrived, it is safe to claim that the Czechs will have exceeded $2,000,000 as their part of the investment in the Third Liberty bond issue. This certainly is an impressive figure. It could have been higher, but let us hope that it really will grow yet.</p>
   <p>There is one more week of work left. No one should cease putting every ounce of energy into his patriotic efforts. Everyone should consider the great <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>importance of the success of this campaign, for this third loan will be a decisive factor in the pursuit of the war. No one should forget for a moment that we are fighting for a just and honest cause which is dear to every man and woman. We are fighting for the liberty of nations and oppressed peoples, among which is numbered our own Czech nation.</p>
   <p>Is there any need more pressing and urgent? There should not be, and yet there is. It is true that most of our people are subscribing and doing the best they can--but alas, it is not true of all of them. In scanning our daily report, the "Roll of Honor," what do we find, or rather, what do we not find? The names of our prosperous and very rich countrymen are missing. They have subscribed such ridiculously small amounts that any plain workman earning scant wages would feel ashamed of them. The names of some of the well-to-do are not there at all. Both of these cases present a truly pitiful exhibition of the patriotic sentiment of some people, who on other occasions make a conspicuous showing of their loyalty and, beating their chests, proclaim, "We are what we are, and what are those below us?"</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>No, gentlemen, we are going to tell you what those "below you" are, the "small fry" who are, according to your opinion, insignificant compared with you. These small people have assumed the duties of everybody in this country. They did not wait for an invitation with a club, but hastened to give their coins until it hurt in order that their efforts might win due recognition. Those poor workingmen, poor mothers and widows whose sons gave their lives or are fighting on the battlefield now just as valiantly for you as they are battling for themselves--those poor people are veritable giants in comparison with you. With all your wealth and splendor, with all your luxury and haughtiness, you cannot reach their bootstraps.</p>
   <p>Do not, however, think that you will get away with it this time as easily as you did before. The Czech section for the Third Liberty bond issue, whose offices are at 3347 West 26th Street, near Homan Avenue, (Cermak and Serhant, realtors), keeps a close record of those who subscribed and the amounts given. These lists will be sent to the Government, so that it will be accurately informed about where to look for those "real patriots". Do not think that it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>is a pleasure to speak to you in this manner. We would prefer to write about you differently, more favorably. But you, with your behavior and incredible stubbornness toward your duties--duties that must be fulfilled under any circumstances at this critical time--you are to blame if we speak to you in a tone to which you are certainly not accustomed.</p>
   <p>The whole world is looking at us today. The whole world, do you hear? You surely cannot remain indifferent to the judgment passed upon us by the world and by history. Will you allow history to relate that the only ones who represented themselves in a dignified manner were the poor Czechs--and that if the Czechs did not do everything they could, it was the fault of the capitalists? Gentlemen, we are in the last week of the campaign. The eleventh hour has struck!</p>
   <p>Hasten to make good where you have failed and do what you should have done long ago. Spare us the bitter task of having to refer to you as people who <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>close their ears to the call of the homeland, who shirk their duties and shove them upon the shoulders of their poor fellow countrymen.</p>
   <p>We expect your substantial subscriptions this week, and we are confident that they will be generous. In this last week you will have to make up for what should already have been accomplished. Brace yourselves for new activity. We shall all do the same and the results will then be something we can be proud of!</p>
   <p>Squads will be sent out by our Czech section's headquarters to find windows that do not display the flag of the Third Liberty bond drive. Let us see to it that no such window is found in streets peopled by Czechs!</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the Czech section will be held in the hall of Sokol Chicago on Tuesday evening, and not, as was announced earlier, in Placek's hall. It will be a very important meeting, since special arrangements will be <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>discussed regarding Czech Day, which is to be the crowning effort of the Liberty bond campaign. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, Chairman of the Czech section, requests the presence of all members, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
