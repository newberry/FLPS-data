   <p>We were pleased to welcome Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, United States minister to Rumania and other Balkan States, who paid a visit to our office yesterday. He had left the battle-scarred scene of his activity sooner than was expected to take a well-deserved rest. It is, however, doubtful whether he will be able to properly enjoy the anticipated rest for there is a flood of invitations swamping him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vopicka is much in demand as a speaker. Scores of prominent American clubs and societies are eager to hear him discuss the European situation.</p>
