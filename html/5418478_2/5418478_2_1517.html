   <p>An irresponsible lad committed a deed in Sarajevo that must bring regrets and sorrow even to those who had no love for the late successor to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, Franz Ferdinand. An assassination is always a contemptible crime, even if committed for patriotic reasons. Since it surely will bring no good results either to the Serbs to the Slavs in Austria, and the anti-Serbian feeling in Austrian politics will remain unchanged because it will be taken up by others of the same mind as Franz Ferdinand, the deed is doubly regrettable. It has cost the lives of Franz Ferdinand and his wife; it will ruin the lives of both assassins; and it will take the lives of many more victims.</p>
