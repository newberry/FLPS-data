   <p>The Socialist alderman, Rodriguez, told his comrades last Sunday what he thinks of their action for "peace at any price." The Arbeiter-Zeitung refers to the meeting of the delegates from Cook County and prints in substance: "The German Socialists here condemn every comrade who joins the army, and threatens him with exclusion from the party. They abhor even those who work in ammunition factories, and advise every Socialist to shoot himself to death before he should join the Army and murder others. Alderman Rodriguez takes a different attitude. He acknowledges certain rights to liberty which he intends to defend with gun in hand, and is, therefore, against a "peace at any price." He used also an argument in the wrong place in favor of the European Socialists as an excuse for fighting in a capitalistic war by quoting Marx, who himself, said he would refuse to go to war under certain circumstances. Rodriguez further held it against the comrades that they are one sided by being international, theoretically, <span class="page-break">2</span>whereas in the organizations, national quarrels are rampant. He points to the applause drawn from German Socialists when the speaker happens to agree with the U-boat campaign."</p>
