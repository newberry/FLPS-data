   <p>....In addition to the main ballot [in the coming election], every voting citizen will also receive a so-called "small" ballot....concerning bond issues....most of which will benefit a small fraction of the public, but will add to the burdens of all.....The first concerns the widening of Twelfth Street....and we recommend that our countrymen vote "No" on that.</p>
   <p>The following three proposals concern....the building of a new detention hospital....an enlargement of the poorhouse in Oak Forest....and completion of the County Building. These should be approved.....</p>
   <p>There are three more proposals which will be voted upon by the entire state....These three should also be approved by the Bohemian voters.....</p>
