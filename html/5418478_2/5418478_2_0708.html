   <p>The dramatic branch of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs is continuing its performances for the benefit of our soldiers in France.</p>
   <p>The first battalion of the Czechoslovak Army is complete and fitted out. Three expeditions of American Czechs and Slovaks have arrived in France.</p>
   <p>The hearts of those boys are in the American homes of the Czechs and Slovaks. We who are here in security often let our thoughts wander across the ocean, especially now when Christmastime is here. When we enjoy our entertainments we should feel that our mirth and merriment will so bring a ray of happiness to our soldiers in France. Among the social affairs arranged for the benefit of our soldiers the theatrical performances of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs are outstanding and should be well patronized by our people.</p>
