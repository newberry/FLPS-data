   <p>Without fear of bursting shells and poison gas--forward with arduous straining of the muscles into the brunt of the battle--with one aim in mind</p>
   <p>To Fight and to Win!</p>
   <p>That is the way our boys fight. The moment the shrill sound of the whistle is heard, the call for advancing, then out, with the indomitable craving for the goal! No power in the world can down this spirit.</p>
   <p>Forward! The same sharp order confronts us at home. We have to respond to it just as our soldiers do,--the American way.</p>
   <p>We have to lend our money so that they can fight.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We have to prove to the Huns that the American nation is advancing in serried ranks toward victory.</p>
   <p>Let us work, save, and lend for one purpose only--to fight and win. Onward into the fight--wholeheartedly--buy bonds--as many as possible!</p>
   <p>Fourth Liberty Loan</p>
   <p>U. S. Government bonds.</p>
