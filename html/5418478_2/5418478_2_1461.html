   <p>A meeting of Bohemian women, which was to be a protest against the terrible bloodshed in Europe and a great manifestation for the growing movement for world peace, was held yesterday under the auspices of the Klub Ceskych Obcanek (Bohemian Women's Citizen Club) in the hall of Sokol Chicago. But the meeting achieved its aim only in part. The attendance was comparatively small and would have appeared weak even in a much smaller hall than the one in which it was held. The efforts of the Klub Ceskych Obcanek were frustrated by the indifference of our general public, and the poor attendance was so much more distressing because the meeting was visited by a number of prominent non-Bohemian people and well-known workers.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened shortly after 3 P. M. with a short address by Dr. Marie S. Schmidt, who explained the real purpose of the meeting and justly condemned the terrible bloodshed that amazes the whole world. She expressed the hope that this war would be the last in the history of the human race, because it should be expected that after the horrible experiences of this war, the nations will find a way to a peaceful solution of their differences in an international court of justice.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Assistant Corporation Counsel Craig, who came to the meeting in the company of the Chief Bailiff of the Municipal Court, Anton J. Cermak. He came as personal representative of Mayor Harrison, whose sudden illness prevented him from attending the meeting. Mayor Harrison was to be the principal speaker of the day, but in Mr. Craig he found a worthy substitute, for Mr. Craig is a speaker of great ability and his address was listened to with profound interest. He based his speech on the idea that America can do a great deal for peace because it has the power of popular conviction, the protests of which are being heard everywhere. It is to our women's credit, he said, that they stand in the first row of those whose efforts are directed toward peace.</p>
   <p>Beautiful and moving was the speech delivered by one of our most intelligent woman workers, Mrs. Klara Klaus. She took the point of view of a woman whose heart is firmly rooted in humaneness and love of mankind. The present war is not being waged for the sake of liberty; it is not necessary for the protection of homes; it does not have its origin in moral convictions, but in selfishness and greedy ambition. Therefore, it provokes every sane and sensitive person to protest, and all these cries unite in one powerful voice of condemnation. The Bohemian women, members of a nation which from time immemorial has been victimized by the furies of war, have the best reasons to work for the abolition of war and militarism in general.</p>
   <p>Equally effective was the speech delivered by Judge John A. Watson, the man to whom the greatest credit is due for the establishment of children's playgrounds on Chicago's West Side. Mr. Watson spoke as an experienced jurist who, during his forty years' practice of law has come to the conclusion that nine out of every ten lawsuits could be settled without litigation. What applies to individuals applies equally to nations. Also, international disputes could be settled peacefully, without resorting to such drastic measures as war and all the horrors, suffering, and destruction in its wake.</p>
   <p>Miss Mary McDowell, a prominent settlement worker and a lady of keen intellect who, next to Jane Addams, is among Chicago's most worthy women, discussed in a most sympathetic manner the experiences she encountered on her trip through Europe. She spent three months there, during which time she traveled through Germany, Belgium, France, and England. One whole day she spent on an inspection tour of the Krupp works in Essen. There, at a banquet, someone explained to her that war is indispensable, that it is a necessary part of the process of civilization. Soon thereafter, she participated in a meeting for peace on Trafalgar Square in London where, from the base of Admiral Nelson's monument, she listened to fiery words of speakers who were enthusiastically devoted to the ideal of world peace.</p>
   <p>On Trafalgar Square, everybody has complete freedom of speech. Here you hear both Socialists and suffragettes. Two hundred thousand people, all of whom applauded the speakers' arguments, participated in the meeting, and today--in spite of all that--England is sending a huge army into the war! A new era has to come; the people have to be re-educated, and in that, women will play the most important role. The speaker warned against the growth of militarism in America, and against the building of dreadnaughts. She concluded by requesting the organizers of the meeting to send President Wilson a telegram expressing full agreement with his policy of neutrality and his efforts for peace.</p>
   <p>Professor Jaroslav Zmrhal also made a very excellent speech. He touched upon the sad, stirring scenes that were taking place after the proclamation of mobilization in Bohemia, where at all, even the smallest depots, fathers were painfully parting with their families. Even here in America, the war inflicts pain. All we need is to visit families with friends and relatives in the old country who had to go to the war, and we realized what a terrible evil war is. He expressed the opinion that this war will be fought to the very end, because only in that way can the chain of causes which led to it be removed. But with all its horrors, the war has one good feature: It stirs up propaganda for its abolition and thus promotes and supports the still greater efforts of friends of international peace. The speaker suggested that this meeting should have, in addition to its moral effect, a practical result in the form of a collection for the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee). The collection was taken up, and in view of the spirit of the audience we suppose it resulted in a substantial contribution to the Vybor's funds.</p>
   <p>The final speech of the meeting was delivered by Mr. Melichar, the secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau). He discussed present conditions in Europe, about which he has very thorough information. His speech, too, was listened to most attentively and rewarded according to its merit.</p>
   <p>The program of yesterday's meeting was enriched by several violin selections presented by our virtuoso, Mr. Vaclav Machek, with the piano accompaniment by his wife, Mrs. Bozena Lestina-Machek.</p>
