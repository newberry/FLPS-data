   <p>In order to defend our honor and good reputation, we wish to inform the Czech public about the most recent events in regard to our boys who volunteered for service in the United States fighting force.</p>
   <p>Private individuals have received letters lately in which Czech volunteers who do not belong to our organization make accusations against volunteers who are members of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. In these violent attacks those men use language unfit to print. As we fear that the slurs contained in these letters might damage our reputation and place our organization in a distinctly unfavorable light, we entreat the Czech public to give the issue some thought and reduce the accusations to their proper value. It is our intention to present an outline of the apparent causes which aroused the wrath of the writers of said letters:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>In our sincere effort to make life in the Army more endurable, we decided to arrange a theatrical performance on May 20 of this year, the proceeds of which were to benefit our boys. What has been done in this direction up to the present was possible only through the goodheartedness of our people.</p>
   <p>A committee was hard at work publicizing the event. The cast consisted of amateur actors who willingly lent their time and energy to the good cause. They were given the thanks of the committee; the latter then published an account of the financial results of the performance, which netted eighty-three dollars. Judging from this figure, one may form an opinion about the size of the audience. It was pitifully small and consisted almost exclusively of members of the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs organization. They had come gladly to do their bit for thirty-five volunteers who were members of our organization, who were among the first to take up arms for Uncle Sam; and most of whom were without relatives or friends to remember them. We decided to spend the proceeds for the benefit of our members only, because the other <span class="page-break">3</span>organizations did not respond to our worthy cause. There were organizations that refused to buy even one single ticket, and individuals did not make any better showing.</p>
   <p>Added to the small proceeds of the theatrical performance were a few pennies contributed by friends, so that each of the thirty-five volunteers received two dollars and fifty cents. As the authorized writer of these lines, I declare that this is no time for petty grievances to be vented in insulting letters. It is to be hoped that the baseless accusations will cease, and that our boys will march in perfect accord towards their goal.</p>
