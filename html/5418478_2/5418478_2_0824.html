   <p>A meeting of the representatives of all the Catholic organizations was held in the Czech-American Auditorium, West 18th Street, last night. The purpose was to instill enthusiasm into all Chicago Czech Catholics and stir them into action in behalf of the Second Liberty Loan, which should become an important concern of every true and patriotic Czech. The idea to call the meeting originated with Mr. F. J. Adam, grand secretary of the Roman Catholic First Central Union. He conceived the idea of concerted Catholic action within a day or two after the official announcement of the new bond issue.</p>
   <p>At the meeting there were represented: Catholic Foresters, Catholic Working-men, Catholic Sokol societies, the Union of American Women, the women's branch of Catholic Foresters, and the Czech Catholic press (by Mr. Val. Kohlbek).</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Adam and Mr. Straka were the principal speakers. Both pointed repeatedly to the necessity of doing one's duty..... Messrs. Kopecky of the Lawndale State Bank and W. F. Kosobud of the American State Bank also spoke.....</p>
