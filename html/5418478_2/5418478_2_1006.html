   <p>The American Red Cross has set itself to the task of preventing or alleviating human suffering in times of War and of peace as well. The original purpose of its activities was to serve as a supplement to the health department and medical staff of an Army during War time....</p>
   <p>The American Red Cross will be thoroughly organized and will display its full activity when the time of hostile contact between our Army and the enemy has arrived. All men and women will attest to their good will by lending their support to the organization. Women will be prominent in the fulfillment of these Samaritan duties. Every Czech-American nurse is a member of the Red Cross, and so are many other women of our kind. We are sure to be well represented in the organization.</p>
