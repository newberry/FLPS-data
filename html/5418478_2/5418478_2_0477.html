   <p>Go to work, to important work, to the shipyards, anywhere. You have certainly heard the mighty splash of the wave on Independence Day, the splash that announces that the time of impending danger has passed, and that a better future is in sight. You have seen the American ships forming a bridge across the Ocean up to the very battlefields in France.</p>
   <p>In this gigantic work of shipbuilding, the United States Employment Service has taken a large part. In January of last year thousands of workers were needed, and asked for, by the Secretary of Labor. At that time, when help was needed so much, the United States Employment offices supplied twenty-five to twenty-eight thousand men per month.</p>
   <p>War industries are in full development. All sorts of devices are being <span class="page-break">\2</span>manufactured, and in good quality. It is the business of the U.S. Employment Service to get many good men for efficient work. This immense activity is the first step toward victory. It centers in the Employment office. It spreads over the entire land with five hundred branch offices. More than twenty thousand representatives of recruiting offices, and the Government reserves for public works, are scattered all over the States, and busy in towns and in the country districts. They are looking for men to do the work, and for work for the right men.</p>
   <p>War industries should hire their men through the United States Employment offices exclusively, lest they draw workers from places where they may be still more urgently needed.</p>
   <p>Men looking for work should address themselves to the United States Employment offices, which will send them where they are most needed.</p>
   <p>The United States Employment bureau knows where to get workmen, and where <span class="page-break">\3</span>to direct them. Whatever you may need--work or workmen--turn only to Uncle Sam's offices.</p>
   <p>Speak with the agent in your district, or write directly to the director in Washington.</p>
