   <p>There is no doubt that we stand on the threshold of a period of intensive arming. In a time when there is a Democratic President, and a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress, that is, when the Democratic party dominates the nation, a party that has always been opposed to excessive arming, things are happening which nobody would have thought possible a year or two ago. But it was not our President who gave the initiative to the arming. It seems to us that most of the credit for it goes to Kaiser Wilhelm and to the unfortunate skipper whose boat torpedoed the "Lusitania". Some credit goes also to Theodore Roosevelt, who travels all around the country, talks wherever he goes, and calls his countrymen "Chinamen" because they do not see the danger and do something to avert it. But we are inclined to believe that the American people can be much more easily swayed by events than by big talking.</p>
   
   <p>All that, however, is neither here nor there. The point is, that the program of our intensive arming has been worked out. It may not be quite ready yet, but most of it is, and as soon as the entire plan is finished, probably Congress will be called in special session and asked to approve it. The only step taken in an unofficial way was that of Secretary of the Navy Daniels, who asked a number of prominent American engineers, inventors, and manufacturers to become members of an advisory board for national defense. This board will doubtless be given an official character by Congress. Everything else is in a preparatory stage; but the opinion generally prevails that the whole program is fully outlined and will be submitted to Congress for approval.</p>
   <p>As far as the Navy is concerned, the plan is to build immediately four super-dreadnaughts and two battle cruisers after the latest British models. Such ships are being built by Great Britain at a cost of about ten million dollars apiece, but they will cost more in America. It is said that the United States is ten big battleships behind the program of the general Navy Council, as published in 1913. Besides the battleships, a large number of destroyers is to be built. According to the above-mentioned program, the United States is said to be short ninety-two torpedo boats--that is, in comparison to the number of large ships built and now building. The Navy Council reckons four torpedo boats for each large ship. Our Navy has now forty large ships and only sixty-eight torpedo boats. The plan calls also for one hundred or more submarines, fifty for each coast.</p>
   <p>A large air base with seaplane shops is to be built at Pensacola, Florida. Shipbuilding costs a lot of money, but our principal difficulty will be in manning the ships; hence the plan calls for an additional eighteen thousand marines. The number of our navy officers is not sufficient either, so the Naval academy at Annapolis will be enlarged. As it is now, we are nine hundred officers short, and when the ships now planned for are built, the deficiency will be proportionately greater. The Secretary of the Navy is expected to receive a large fund from which to buy any invention as soon as it is proved useful. Certainly a splendid program, but, thus far, it concerns only the Navy.</p>
   
   <p>The other part of the national defense, the Army, has still greater requirements. It is planned to greatly enlarge both the Federal Army and the state militias. In addition to this, large reserves are to be established, something we have not had at all so far. Both officers and men after leaving active service will from a certain body which can be called for service upon short notice. Having already been trained, they can be sent into active service without delay. The enactment of special laws which would provide for military training of all citizens, thus making them ready for immediate service if necessary, is proposed.</p>
   <p>How large the Federal Army and the state militias are to be is not yet known, but probably about 410,000 men, of which the Army will account for 140,000, and the militia for 270,000 men and officers. The recruiting system will be changed. There was a time when the term of enlistment in the Army was three years, and there were never enough recruits. Then somebody had the unfortunate idea of increasing the term to four years. The number of recruits dropped still more. Now a one-year term is being considered, with two years in reserves. In order to increase the number of officers, it is proposed to enlarge the West Point Academy and possibly establish a second academy on the Pacific Coast. The militia, which formerly was a state army, was being gradually put under the control of the General Staff in Washington, and this process is now to be intensified. The aversion to military service, which is undeniable in America, is to be overcome by various expedients. In the first place, the service will be short, and educated young men are to be given an opportunity for military studies with the prospect of being promoted to the rank of commissioned officers at the first opportunity.</p>
   <p>The next consideration is the arms. Congress will be asked to provide arms for one million men, although they would not all be bought at once, but gradually. For every man in the infantry and the cavalry there are to be five rifles, and for every one thousand men, twelve machine guns--that is, four times as many as there are now--six field guns and mortars--that is, twice as many as now--and five times as much ammunition as at present. All of this is to be placed in arsenals ready for immediate use.</p>
   
   <p>The third point is the fortification of our coasts. Our coast guns are considered antiquated and are to be replaced by new ones. The existing new guns are to be equipped with new carriages, making possible a higher elevation. These are twelve-inch guns, and are to be used for defense against war ships attacking the coast from distances too far for our old guns. In the port of New York, at least three sixteen-inch guns are to be placed. One of such guns is now in service in Panama.</p>
   <p>All this, no doubt, will cost a great deal of the taxpayers' money, but there will be hardly a Bohemian who will object to an expenditure which will make the United States strong, and to be feared in the present international situation.</p>
