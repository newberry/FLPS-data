   <p>The Bohemians in Chicago are not to have their own justice of peace.</p>
   <p>The result of Friday's conference of the judges, concerning the proposal for new justices of the peace is extremely surprising to the Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The judges have not proposed a single Bohemian for justice of peace, although we have many able and capable jurists, although there are in Chicago more than 30,000 Bohemians, and although we had last year a Bohemian judge, to our great benefit. The Bohemians in Chicago are entitled to have at least one judge, who understands and talks the language of more than 30,000 citizens of Chicago. We are equally as good citizens and taxpayers as Americans, Germans, in many respects better than Scandinavians, and, especially, better than the Frenchmen, who in comparison to the Bohemians are a very small number.</p>
   <p>We Bohemians in Chicago occupy third place, in numerical size coming immediately after the Germans, as the last census shows.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We have the right to claim representation in public services; right now we are represented in many offices and represented successfully.</p>
   <p>We have had in Chicago our own elected legislator, city clerk for two terms and city appraiser for two terms. We are now represented on the board of education and on the board of directors of the Chicago Public Library. But we were unable, until now, to have our own justice of the peace.</p>
   <p>During the term of Gov. Cullom, a Bohemian lawyer, E. A. Fisher, was nominated justice of the peace to finish the term of the deceased A. Miller. As we know, Mr. Fisher was "tops" in his position and we are convinced, that all Bohemians were grateful to the judges for the choice of an honest and able justice of the peace and to Gov. Cullom, who praised the choice and was glad that the Bohemians in Chicago were given a just and capable justice.</p>
   <p>The majority of the cases between the Bohemians was solved to the complete satisfaction of both parties. As we found out after special inquiry, the Bohemian <span class="page-break">3</span>justice, E. A. Fisher, had, last year, 1,800 cases on the calendar for trial, 1,200 of which were pure Bohemian cases. It is then superfluous to mention the benefits offered to the Bohemian citizens by a Bohemian judge.</p>
   <p>There is among the Chicago Bohemians, like among other nationalities a large number of citizens who do not know the English language, who do not speak English sufficiently well to be ableto explain all the circumstances in the case clearly and correctly, and it is not to be denied that it is a great facility for them, when the judge, who must apply the law justly, will understand their Bohemian language and will not depend exclusively on translated confessions, often times not too clear.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians of Chicago were full of hope, that the assembly of competent judges would propose again a Bohemian justice of the peace, but it happened differently.The Bohemians were not inert in their expectation, but showed a vivid activity in the nomination of the future justice of peace.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>All Bohemian political clubs, ten auxiliary Bohemian societies, Roman Catholic subsidiary societies, the society, "Beseda Ceska," all Bohemian notaries and lawyers, and all influential Bohemian businessmen and public magistrates, and about one hundred former police judges and justices of the peace, have joined in recommending the present justice of the peace, E. A. Fisher, to be retained on his temporary bench and to be nominated for the whole term. He has proved himself an able and just judge and his nomination would only show justifiable acknowledgment to the Chicago Bohemians.</p>
   <p>In spite of this E. A. Fisher was not reappointed to the bench, but somebody by the name of Francis E. Russel replaced him as the future justice of the peace. We are very sorry, but we hope that Gov. Hamilton will show justice to the Bohemians of Chicago as his predecessor, Mr. Cullom, did and that he will look into the matter so that the vacant position of Bohemian justice of the peace is again presented to a Bohemian citizen E. A. Fisher, who is already well acquainted with the whole procedure.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Gov. Hamilton certainly will wait with the nomination of a justice of the peace, as long as the Bohemians in Chicago are not suited with such candidate as the real necessity requires. In this we trust. The Bohemians will be thankful to him from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
   <p>The offices of our newspaper are frequently visited by our countrymen with the demand that we do something to the advantage of E. A. Fisher, but what can we do? We can do nothing more than excite public opinion and expect a just solution from Gov. Hamilton, hoping that our request will not be refused. In addition to this, the local Bohemians are making arduous preparations to call a great meeting for the coming Sunday to pass a suitable resolution in favor of their rights to obtain what they justifiably should have. Judging from the extended preparations we can say as well, today, that this special meeting will be not only a grand one, but an extremely important one.</p>
