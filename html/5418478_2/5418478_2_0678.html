   <p>Czechoslovak women, your old homeland calls for you! Your brothers in the Czechoslovak Army are looking to you--will you help them? The Vcelky (Little Bees[a ladies' auxiliary of the Czech National Alliance]) have promised to give comfort to our dear warriors, to help them to victory and the liberation of our beloved old homeland.</p>
   <p>Our valiant soldiers are going into the horrors of war by their own volition and for love of the old country. They will bring back to us the palm of victory and liberty for our nation.</p>
   <p>And we women? Is it not, indeed, the duty of all mothers, wives, sisters, and fiancees to contribute to success by their work? How much easier will our soldiers bear all the sufferings in war if they know that all the women in all of America stand by them!....</p>
   
   <p>How they will bless the Little Bees who saved the life of many a soldier! The consciousness of doing good gives us strength so that we do not feel tired. With how much joy we get together, how the eyes of every one of us sparkle, and how everyone is fortified by the knowledge that she is working for the homeland!</p>
   <p>The Little Bees are the Czech women's armada. Not one single Czechoslovak woman should be missing from our hive. Just as bees gather honey for their queen mother, we, also, are willing to perform any service for our dear mother, our beloved homeland. That is the slogan of the Little Bees, and I believe that no mother will fail to join us.</p>
   <p>Branches of the Little Bees are being organized at any place where the hearts of noble women beat. Nevertheless, many women have not enrolled as yet. This time is so critical that everything but highly important tasks should be put aside and postponed. Those men who are lucky enough not to be called for military service should go ahead and form a home defense with us. If all of them will march shoulder to shoulder with us as if they were one man, and will contribute by their deeds and not just by words, written or spoken, we shall be able to produce immense results. The whole world will know about us. The whole world will then speak of us as a nation worthy of liberty, because we are always ready to make any sacrifice at the altar of the old homeland.</p>
   <p>Woe unto us if we let this opportunity pass! I believe that we shall do our duty. Onward to our beehive, and victory must come to us!</p>
   <p>For the "Czech California" branch of the Little Bees of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Signed, Anna J. Novakova, President.</p>
