   <p>The gigantic parade by which Czechoslovaks will manifest their joy over President Wilson's declaration of independence for the Czechoslovak nation, and testify to their gratitude and loyalty to the United States Government, would not be complete without soldiers of Czech and Slovak descent. In view of this, Mr. Anton J. Cerm√°k has requested Congressman Adolph Sabath, who happens to be in Chicago these days, to use his influence to procure a furlough for our boys in Camp Grant and the Great Lakes Naval Training Station.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath felt it to be his duty to act in this matter. There was no time for personal interviews with the commanding officers, or for using the mail, and so the congressman employed his good offices by resorting to the telegraph. To the general in command of Camp Grant, and Captain Moffett, commander of the Great Lakes Station, he offered explicit reasons why the participation of the Czechoslovak military men is highly desirable, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and requested that everyone of Czech or Slovak descent be allowed to take part in the manifestation.</p>
   <p>This was granted. The congressman received a communication from both commanders that our boys will be excused from service today, Saturday, between 9 A.M. and 12 P.M., so that they can be with their fellow countrymen in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Since the telegrams containing this information arrived so late that officials of the Czech National Alliance could not be reached and notified, Congressman Sabath publishes the information through our paper. We are certain that the arrangements committee will assign our soldier boys a place of honor in the parade. They are going to fight for Czechoslovak independence, the declaration of which we are celebrating today!</p>
