   <p>The United States has entered a state of war with the German government, to do away with Prussian militarism and autocracy; it is not at war with the German people. Since the declaration of war we have been witnesses to interesting conditions which we do not hesitate to describe to the public. The latter is well aware that the United States, at whose head stands a persevering man, has not plunged into the war for predatory purposes or any other selfish motives. It has taken the step only to transplant a healthy, strong democracy into Europe, in the interest of independence of even the smaller nations. America has hurled itself into the fight for an ideal. For the very reason of the greatness and loftiness of this ideal, the whole nation, to the last man and woman, should stand behind the government which has sanctioned the movement.</p>

   <p>In asking ourselves whether the nation really backs the President in this portentous hour, we can, and must, answer in the negative. There are differences of opinion as to the way to create an army; members of Congress differ among themselves and with the President in regard to the solution of this question. Congress recommends a volunteer army, whereas President Wilson, his cabinet, and the General Staff of the army advocate compulsory service; they demand it, in fact with stern determination. Several clashes have occurred in Congress, and it is generally believed that the latter will not change its attitude within a short space of time.</p>
   <p>In the name of the entire country the President turned to the people. He asked only for the enlistment of young, strong men, by no means for his own personal protection, but for the defense of our homeland which must be prepared for the worst. And how did the President fare with his appeal? Poorly, very poorly. It makes one blush with shame to read the reports on the number of those who enlisted voluntarily for service since Congress ratified the President's proclamation of a state of war between Germany <span class="page-break">\3</span>and the United States.</p>
   <p>"No wonder then that the question intrudes upon one's mind what is the matter with all that American patriotism that is being flaunted before the world? Does it not appear to us as nothing but empty, bombastic phrases issuing mainly from the younger native generation? We know very well that the majority of those who enlisted, who responding to the appeal of the President, who joined voluntarily and enthusiastically, constitutes itself from immigrants, most of whom either are citizens or have applied for their first papers. We have had and opportunity to observe enlistment in Chicago; from available figures we can see that the immigrants were the most numerous to enlist. Where are the boys born in this country? Where is the boast and the pride of the American people who brags about his Americanism, his strength, and courage at prize fights and baseball games only?</p>

   <p>Last Monday we witnessed the departure of the Czech-American volunteers - almost all of them from the ranks of our Sokol gymnastic organizations, predominantly from the group Fuegner-Tyrs. Had the volunteers marched in the uniforms of their respective Sokol organizations, the column would have had the appearance of a flood of red color from the Sokol shirts of the group Fuegner Tyrs. Where did the boys from the other organizations remain with all their enthusiasm? Where did those linger who do not belong to the Sokols yet have a feeling not only for America but for the country of their parents and forefathers? Where do they stand with their patriotic convictions?</p>
   <p>At home behind the stove! They did no more than come out and stand upon the sidewalk to watch those who decided to depart out of sincere sentiment and true patriotism, who have started on a way which may end with a crippled leg or even with death, and who are assailed with improper remarks and smirks on the faces of the slackers. We felt grief in our hearts. There <span class="page-break">\5</span>was eager sacrifice and pride as an answer to the appeal of the motherland for which one's own life must not be spared. On the other side we observed indifference and indolence in the ranks of our own children. American youth! Where is they enthusiasm, where is thy patriotism?"</p>
   <p>We would rejoice if we found out that we err in our judgment, or that conditions have changed for the better after a certain time. We fear, however, that the number of those who are willing to fight for the United States and for the freedom of the Czechs will ever be on the decrease so that Congress will be compelled to enact drastic measures for compulsory service which will not exempt even those who dread to do their duty and who, to dodge it, scamper to the County Building to get a marriage license and hide behind a woman's skirts in order not to expose their cowardice.</p>
   <p>We have never been for war. When, however, our country finds itself in a war for human rights which have been trodden upon by that scoundrelly <span class="page-break">\6</span>Germany, which has ever been the deadliest enemy of all the Slavonic peoples, then we, loyal sons of our new homeland, do not want to know anything else but duty.</p>
