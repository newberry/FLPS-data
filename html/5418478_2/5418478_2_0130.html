   <p>p. 2.. A delegation of the Bohemian Taxpayers Association in the 34th Ward appeared in the office of the commissioner of public works yesterday, and complained that their ward is being neglected by the government of this city; inasmuch as the streets are poorly paved, nobody takes care of the removal of garbage, and the sewer system is out of order.</p>
   <p>From that office the group proceeded to the offices of the Board of Local Improvements and from there to the department for the maintenance of streets and sewers. The delegation was headed by Cyril R. Jandus. The complaint most justified comes from Hamlin Avenue between Twenty-Sixth and Twenty-Eighth streets.</p>
   <p>In the fall the streets were torn up, as if a new paving had been intended, and then left open, so that when they are frozen, traffic can move over them only with great danger; the gasoline lamp posts were removed, thus heightening the risk, as no electric service was substituted; the streets are enveloped in impenetrable darkness.</p>

   <p>The property owners are also grieving about the unduly high assessments for the paving. As already mentioned, the streets are in a worse condition than ever, yet the property owners will have to pay, beginning Nov. 4th, the interest on $160 assessed on a twenty-five foot front lot.</p>
