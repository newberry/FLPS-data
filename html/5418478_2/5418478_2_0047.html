   <p>Bohemian Citizens, fulfill your duties. Don't be confounded by the Germans. It looks like all nationalities in our city start to show more vital dictorial activities, and it seems that the Bohemians will not be behind others, and will participate in the forthcoming election with as much energy. Not long ago there was founded a Republican club in "Pilsen" Hall and yesterday, the Bohemian citizens were called again with the purpose of organizing a club in the 8th Ward. The object of this club should be the election of our own candidates for the coming election and to put a decisive end to the rule of certain Aldermen, who are taking care of everything in the world, but the welfare of their community.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called for 8 P.M. but opened at 9 P. M. It is impossible to pass in silence, the carelessness of the local Bohemians on almost all occasions in which they should manifest their consciousness of the duties of a good citizen. But they show plenty of wisdom at home and in the saloons. They discuss there all events of our political life, what is right or wrong, which Aldermen are taking care only of their pockets,--and so forth.</p>
   <p>When it comes to the point, of being invited to a meeting to take part in the <span class="page-break">2</span>discussion, and to help with their votes to root out all dishonosty and mischief, they neglect their citizens' duties and stay at home or, when they appear at the meeting, they are as silent as fish.</p>
   <p>Yesterday a similar situation occured. The invitation to the meeting was mailed many days ago and there were present in the "Houdkov" Hall as many as seventeen Bohemian citizens from the whole 8th Ward.</p>
   <p>At the meeting were present the delegates of the "German Club", which was founded in the 8th Ward not long ago for the same purpose. The meeting was opened by M. Patera. In a few words he explained the purpose of the meeting and suggested the election of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman and the Secretary for today's meeting. L. W. Kadlec opposed and suggested the election of only two, the Chairman and the Secretary. The result of the voting was as follow: Chairman--M. Patera, Secretary--J. Benes. The Chairman immediately explained the purpose of today's meeting and called for a speech from the German delegates, that they declare themselves and lay the foundation for the mutual work. The German delegate Karl Finkensieper explained what the idea was of the newly organized club of German citizens of the 8th Ward, and that it is a well known principle, that in unity is power. That is why the "German Club" intends to <span class="page-break">3</span>join the Bohemian Citizens of the 8th Ward. This will make the introduction to the City-Council of an honest and decisive German or Bohemian candidate, much easier.</p>
   <p>As the German delegate was speaking German, our Ad. Chladek answered in German and in his applauded speech referred to the previous elections pointing, especially, to the fact, that we don't want to know or to talk at all about the Republicans, the Democrats, the Socialists and so forth, but only about ourselves and to help our common program.</p>
   <p>He advised harmony and unity, the manlike action, not childish, and finished his speech with the statement, that it is impossible to be unable to bring into office in the coming election, a Bohemian or German candidate for Alderman of the 8th Ward. Two Irish candidates would only help to scatter the votes. The speaker promised his highest cooperation and proposed to elect a special committee to be present at today's German meeting, held at 8 P.M. at 311 S. Canal St. It was decided that everybody, time permitting, should be there.</p>
