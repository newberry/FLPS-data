   <p>P.4--In April last year the Illinois legislature passed a resolution requesting Congress to support a motion made by Congressman Lubin for the enactment of a law similar to the old-age-pension laws in operation in several European countries. The measure provided that the Speaker of the House should name a committee of seven member whose task should be to study the diverse European systems, select elements from them, and formulate a proposition for the law best suited to our conditions. This committee was then to submit its findings to Congress not later than January, 1911.</p>
   <p>Lubin's motion was referred to the committee on commerce, but after that no trace of it could be found, although it is nigh time for the United States to step in line with other civilized countries and satisfy an urgent need. Although the idea of an old-age-pension law is almost entirely new in the United States, other countries have long overcome the initial difficulties naturally encountered in establishing such an institution.</p>

   <p>The first country to try this experiment, which is worthy of emulation, was Germany, where in the year 1889 a law was enacted which established the pension system. The system was put on a broader basis by laws enacted in 1891 and 1899 These German old-age-pension laws affect twenty-five per cent of the population and require the state, the employers, and the employees to contribute to the pension fund. All working-men ever seventy years old and working-men unable for certain reasons to earn their livelihood are entitled to receive pensions.</p>
   <p>The next country to enact a pension law was Denmark, which allows a pension to men who have reached the age of sixty. New Zealand's law, enacted in 1897, directs that a pension of $2.50 shall be paid weekly to a man over sixty-five years old who has led a law-abiding life for the last twenty-five years. Many other countries have followed these examples. Belgium enacted a pension law in 1900 making the extent of the benefit dependent on the age of the recipient, the amount of duet which he has paid, and his actual need. Similarly, Austria, France, and Italy have absorbed the idea, improving their respective laws year by year. England in establishing its old-age pension granted to all men over seventy years old, according to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>circumstances, twenty-five cents to $1.25 per week. Canada passed its law in 1908, and Sweden and Norway are about to follow. Australia experimented till 1909, when it joined the other countries in establishing an old-age pension, with excellent results, as attested by American consuls.</p>
   <p>Why, then, should the United States lag behind others? We are proud of the pension which we allot to soldiers whether they need it or not, but we have no regard for the working-man, who is as necessary as the soldier for the common welfare, and who, like the soldier, jeopardizes his life in the performance of his duty.</p>
   <p>The objection raised on account of the easy way in which immigrants can obtain American citizenship does not appear to be well grounded. Nobody demands that every newcomer shall be entitled to draw a pension immediately after he has become a citizen nor at the moment when he has attained the required ago. It is not necessary that the benefit shall involve the question of citizenship at all; it should depend on the time which the immigrant has spent in the United States as a wage-earner or an otherwise usefully active member of the community. The requisite number of years of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>activity in the United States ought to be fixed first, and a clause should be included stating that only men with a clean past shall be eligible. This limitation would be bound to bear fruit in compelling many a man of mischievous tendencies to take thought and turn over a new leaf. Thus a contemplated decrease in crime would be another reason for the enactment of a pension law.</p>
