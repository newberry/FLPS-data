   <p>To us, one thing seems to be as clear as sunlight. If the mischievous activities of the German spies are to be stopped, or at least kept within certain limits, the same means will have to be employed as are used against enemy scouts and traitors throughout the world. Gunpowder and lead, as well as the noose, will have to function as the necessary paraphernalia.</p>
   <p>It is generally known that the German spy system is spread all over the United States; where it is not obvious, it can be guessed at. One of the unexampled cases of this is the betrayal of the secret guarding the route of the American destroyers which are to be sent across the ocean. Extreme watchfulness defeated the plan of the Germans to waylay our fleet, and a terrible disaster was avoided. The enemy failed to succeed <span class="page-break">2</span>this time, but he may realize his design in the near future, when American soldiers will be transported to Europe.</p>
   <p>The life of a single American soldier is of more value than the worthless existence of a whole pack of German spies. Congress should be the first to take cognizance of this matter. It appears, however, that it is still dillydallying, unable to decide what kind of gloves it should put on when handling this bunch of scoundrels.</p>
