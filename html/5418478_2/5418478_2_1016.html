   <p>In these turbulent times when the drill grounds of our Sokol gymnastic societies are gradually becoming empty, because the members are taking to arms to prove to the Czech people that they have not staked their hopes in us in vain, the Sokol Slavoj shall not stand behind. More than one-half of the members of the Sokol Slavoj have departed and the other half is going to leave Monday night. Thus the entire Sokol Slavoj has enlisted to a man, and this has occurred in view of the nearing tenth anniversary of the first drill of their group.</p>
   <p>I herewith urge the parents of our pupils to continue to send their children to our gymnastic drills, even if most of the instructors have gone to where their energies can be made still better use of. All drills will be from now on under the care of Sokol brother F. Liska, assisted by some fellow members who are not in a position to depart with us. I am, therefore, leaving in the hope, and fully assured, that there will be no interruption in the drills. For the instructors' squad of the Sokol Slavoj.</p>
   <p>Vasek Balaban, chief instructor.</p>
