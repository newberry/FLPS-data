   <p>It seems that it is necessary to explain certain things to people who are surprised to see that we sympathize with the Russians in this war in spite of the fact that the Russians are fighting against Bohemian soldiers. It should be made clear that our brothers in the old country have gone into war, with very few exceptions, very unwillingly; that they did not approve of the war declaration; and that they do not agree with the motives which have led to the war; that, in fact they have condemned these motives. War was not declared by the people of Austria or by their representatives in the Diet of Vienna. The Vienna government, in starting this wholesale carnage, did not consult anybody except its evil spirit in Berlin, in whose services it has been for many years.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that the majority of Bohemian regiments would immediately <span class="page-break">2</span>go over to the Russians side if this were possible and if such a step would not constitute the greatest potential danger to the whole nation in the old country, to all these old men and women who stayed at home. As long as the Vienna government and the Germans are not completely defeated, as long as they are not absolutely impotent, such a revolt against them is unthinkable, because they would be sure to use the last remnant of power to wreak vengeance on the Bohemians, and this would be the most terrible kind of revenge.</p>
   <p>Anybody who is somewhat acquainted with conditions will know that this gigantic war is nothing more than a culmination of the eternal struggle between Slavdom and the Germanism, a struggle in which only the Bohemians were called upon to endure the greatest sacrifices. A cruel fate now forces them to fight in this decisive phase of the struggle for the German cause. That they cannot be enthusiastic about it, everybody will agree. We, who have full liberty to express our opinion, to give way to our sympathies, would be committing the worst kind of treason against the Bohemian and Slavic cause if we did not <span class="page-break">3</span>tell ourselves and the whole world that we are placing all our hopes for the existence and the future of the nation of which we are members in a victory for Russia, and that we dread the possibility of Austria's and Germany's victory as perhaps the most terrible catastrophe not only to all of Slavdom, and the Austrian Slavs in particular, but also to the whole of Europe, and even to all humanity. We are happy, therefore, that the Bohemian-Slavonic press in the United States fully shares this opinion, and that there is not a single Bohemian or Slovak newspaper in this country that would side with Austria. That there are a few individuals who are imbued with Hungarian or Austrian patriotism is not suprising. The hundreds of years of oppression under which our Bohemian and Slovak nation has suffered at the hands of the Germans on one side and the Hungarians on the other were bound to leave marks which are not easily erased. But the fact that these Austro-Hungarian patriots among us are so few and so far between that they are such a weak minority of those who think and act as Slavs and sensible humans is proof that our nation has a good, strong, and healthy core, that it cherishes its ideals, and that it is worthy of their realization. Let us <span class="page-break">4</span>hope that their realization will come about with the help of Russia, France, and England. The Germans and the Austrians have always marred our ideals and desires, and they want to destroy them completely in this war.</p>
