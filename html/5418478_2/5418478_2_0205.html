   <p>Our countrymen at the Springfield Convention apparently are not merely listeners, as they formerly were, for several of them have been named to important committees. We have been informed that L.W. Kadlec was elected chairman of the delegates of the first Congressional District; Alderman Dvorak was named a member of the Committee on Credentials. J. Kostner, was nominated for the Committee on Organization, however, he declined the honor.</p>
