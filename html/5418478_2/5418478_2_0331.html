   <p>It seems that, at the city hall, there rules the motto "Spinave Politiky" (Dirty Politics), judging from the yelling done by some of the aldermanic candidates because their names have not been placed at the top of the ballot.</p>
   <p>These men also accuse City Clerk Siman of giving preference to petitions of favored candidates and of pushing aside the petitions of others less favored.</p>
   <p>If the candidates knew the city clerk as our Sokols (Gymnasts) know him, they would behave as real men should.</p>
   <p>To be sure, there may be something more behind all this hue and cry than the the public is supposed to know; usually, when so much noise is made about trivialities, there is something of much graver moment hidden which a certain clique may be trying to keep under cover.</p>
