   <p>The longer the series of diplomatic notes, answers, and replications becomes in the controversy between the United States and Germany, the clearer it must appear to everybody that all these negotiations are in vain, a sheer waste of time and ink, and, as in all diplomatic plottings, they threaten to produce a situation which may easily become impossible of resolving by peaceful means. When the views of two parties are so diametrically opposed as is the case with the United States and Germany, there is no likelihood that they can be reconciled. Ever since the declaration of a war zone in British waters by Germany on February 17, 1915, our Republic has been deep in a controversy with Germany concerning the rights of American and neutral citizens, and the rights of non-belligerents upon the seas. If we take it for granted that both of these parties are sincerely trying to reach a common ground, we must come to the conclusion that there is a fundamental difference in viewpoint and in interests <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which cannot be overcome, since the negotiations have been going on almost half a year and are no nearer a solution than they were when they started.</p>
   <p>The Government of the United States is being guided or it seems that it is guided by two principal considerations: First by the insistence on the rights of the country and its citizens; second, by a moral obligation to uphold the principles of humaneness, which last principle it has been emphasizing in its more recent arguments.</p>
   <p>Since we approve the viewpoint of the United States, we shall be doing nothing more than our duty if we listen, as nearly without bias as we can, to the arguments advanced by Germany, try to see all the circumstances as Germany sees them, and thus understand why Germany is taking the stand she does. Germany maintains that she was attacked that the war was forced upon her, and that she fights for her own existence. She claims that at the very beginning of the war she was ready to abide by the provisions of the London Declaration, according to which food stuffs are not contraband, but that England refused <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>to abide by that Declaration. Germany claims that submarines are unable to operate according to rules established in times when there were no submarines, that is, according to rules requiring a visit and an inspection as well as measures necessary to safeguard the lives of nonbelligerents on the ship. Germany claims that she has always been governed by the principle of humaneness. (In that case the fate of Belgium must be accepted as bloody irony.)</p>
   <p>Basing her arguments on the above reasons, Germany finds the sinking of the Lusitania justified; she feels justified in refusing the request of the United States for a guarantee that submarines will operate according to recognized international laws, and that the lives of American citizens will be safeguarded no matter whether they travel on a ship belonging to a neutral or a belligerent country. In order to understand Germany's logic, it is necessary to bear constantly in mind Germany's belief in her destiny and mission in human history, her megalomanic endeavors and dreams which demand not only a place in the sun, but that heavenly body itself, and the right to distribute, graciously and according to her own ideas, its beneficial radiation among the lesser, inferior, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and less favored races.</p>
   <p>The view of the German people has been expressed with remarkable arrogance and surprising clearness already by the notorious General Bernardi, who said: "It is our duty to enlarge, in the interest of humanity, Germany's colonial empire. Only in that way shall we be able to unite politically, or at least nationally, all Germans in the world, because only then will it be recognized that the German civilization is the most necessary agent in the progress of humanity. Finally it must be recognized that the struggle for higher ideals, the desire for action--briefly, war itself--is a necessary instrument of cultural progress."</p>
   <p>With such ideas, it is hardly surprising that the Germans consider the use of any weapon which may help in enlarging the sphere of German civilization much more important than laws concerning the protection of neutrals and nonbelligerents.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>At the very beginning, America adopted the standpoint that she cannot accept any limitation of her own rights because of the fact that war has been declared, and that international laws provide for the immunity of American citizens who in the pursuit of their legitimate business travel on any ship. Furthermore, our Government has taken the stand that the limitations inherent in the nature of submarines do not excuse them from the necessity of following international rules, quite regardless of the exceptional situation of Germany. The United States holds the view that the blockade of Germany is a situation resulting from the advantageous position of one of the belligerents, that is, England, and that the United States has no share in the creation of that situation. The United States is not trying to put any new obstacles in Germany's way of conducting the war. These obstacles, the provisions of international law, were in existence during the time when Germany was building her submarine fleet. Germany went into the war aware of these limitations. America has done nothing but to demand that these law-imposed limitations be respected and enforced in the interest of humanity and the rights of her citizens.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Germany simply refuses, or evades, the demands of the United States. She denies the right of American citizens to travel wherever they please in pursuit of their business, on merchantmen of belligerent nations; she denies their right to travel safely on merchantmen of neutral nations if there is no previously established guarantee that such vessel carries no contraband. Germany ignores the urgent demand of the United States that the submarines comply with regulations regarding visit and inspection. Instead, she offers, in her latest note, to recognize the immunity of neutral merchantmen not carrying any ammunition, and, if necessary, of four merchantmen of a warring nation, provided that the United States Government guarantees that these merchantmen carry no contraband and notifies the German government in advance of their sailing. This means that America would have to relinquish practically all her foreign trade and that she would designate as lawful booty of the submarines all ships leaving this country without such guarantee. That is the situation at this time. The controversy has narrowed down to a smaller number of points, but it is as far from solution as it was at the very beginning.</p>
