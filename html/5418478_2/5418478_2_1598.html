   <p>P.4--When all is said and done, it is still interesting to meditate on our system of justice. Some things seem to have been ordered in a strange way. Take, for instance, the case of this man Hoch, condemned to die on the gallows. Hoch pleaded not guilty. Let us suppose that the is innocent. He has the right to appeal to the highest court, which he intends to do, asserting that his innocence will be proved, and that he will regain his liberty. The Governor has granted him a stay of sentence to file his appeal. This sounds like very good news for him; but he lacks the funds required for filing an appeal, and if he cannot produce the money, he will be hanged, as the prosecution states, even though he is innocent. For whom, then, does this Supreme Court really exist?</p>
