   <p>The battle against Alderman Novak is deserving of rejection for the reason that it is not being carried on in the interests of the citizens, but in the interests of Svornost and young Geringer. The independent candidate is, in reality, a put up candidate for the renowned "Geringer" family.</p>
   <p>Young Geringer does not want to confine himself to the newspaper business, but would like to go into politics, and the capable Ed. J. Novak is for him a greater obstacle than any one else. That is the reason for all the baiting and lying in Svornost; that is the reason for the energetic agitation, in order to cause the Bohemians of that ward to split their vote so as to permit the election of an Irishman. We hope, however, that the citizens of the 10th Ward will give these Jehus thoroughly to understand what they think of them.</p>
