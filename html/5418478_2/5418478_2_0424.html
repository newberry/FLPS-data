   <p>Anxious suspense reigned over relatives of our American sailors who had embarked on the Buena Ventura, which was torpedoed September 16. Our fellow countryman, Anton Drzka, was one of the crew. His widowed mother, who lives at 2836 West 21st Street, received a telegram that her son was safe. Drzka enlisted as a volunteer on June 1 of this year, and was assigned to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. After three weeks he was transferred to the training station in Philadelphia, and he embarked from that port without being given the opportunity to visit his mother.</p>
   <p>His father, Anton Drzka, was well-known as an active worker in local Czech societies.</p>
