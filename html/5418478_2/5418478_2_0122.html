   <p>A meeting of the Tenth Ward Taxpayers was held in the hall of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Society on 18th Street. Under discussion was the program of widening Twelfth Street, as advocated by those who are concerned either with beautification, fame, or profit. To be sure, this project would be carried out at public expense and would certainly be detrimental to all property owners on streets other than the one to be improved. The widening of this street from Michigan Avenue to Ashland Avenue would cost many millions of dollars. No one can or will tell us today exactly how much this would cost, because such a gigantic sum would enrage all taxpayers, and by taking steps in time, they might spoil the plans of these politicians and promoters (as happened to a similar plan for the widening of Halsted Street about six years ago).</p>
   <p>Let no one think that, if the taxpayers allow this work to be carried out on Twelfth Street, it will mean a cessation of the waste of public money. This would only be the beginning of the politicians' extensive plans. The laying <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>out of a large park at Congress and Halsted Streets is to follow. Here they would want to build luxurious and large city and county buildings. They would want to widen Congress Street from the lake to the park, making it a long, beautiful road. They also want to build in this park monumental public buildings which would surpass in magnificence all other public buildings on earth. The tower of the City Hall which they would build there is to be high enough so that it can be seen for several miles outside of Chicago.</p>
   <p>For whom are we building the present palatial County Building and City Hall at a cost of over ten million dollars? These men also want to widen Halsted Street, repave it, and make it into one of the best business streets of the city. In addition, they are preparing to build subways for passenger and freight transportation between the depots of railroad companies, which are to build railroad tracks and are already buying property for that purpose. All costs for carrying out this fabulous plan are to be borne by the taxpayers, and who will dare to tell you how many millions of dollars will be required to fulfill this dream?</p>

   <p>How do you like it, you taxpayers who sit comfortably at home while your neighbors attend a meeting and discuss and shudder over so heavy a burden? You will be told that you will pay only twenty-five per cent, the city will pay fifty per cent, and bonds will be issued for twenty-five per cent; but the city is the taxpayers, and the bonds will also have to be paid off by the taxpayers. Will you allow yourselves to be caught by such trickery? Who is it that really wants to make these enormous expenditures? When the widening of Halsted Street was previously being considered, it was the politicians and several wealthy speculators who wanted to enrich themselves and feather their nests, and thus they advocated this plan. They were defeated only because the taxpayers were organized and the press was with them.</p>
   <p>For building and repairing damaged bridges, removing garbage, and keeping alleys and streets clean, there is no money, there never was, and perhaps there never will be.</p>
   <p>That is what was said in this meeting of the Tenth Ward taxpayers. The meeting <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>was attended by a committee from the Eleventh Ward, and it was resolved that a committee should find out how far the plan has progressed and then, jointly with neighboring Wards, it should be decided how to proceed. The taxpayers can repulse this attack upon the public treasury if they show community interest, if they organize, and if the majority does not depend upon a few individuals.</p>
