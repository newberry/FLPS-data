   <p>At this time when the recruiting stations are completing their work, a report regarding the stations located in predominantly Czech districts may be opportune.</p>
   <p>Recruiting division number eighty-three is almost exclusively managed by Czech-Americans. The chairman of its recruiting commission is Anton Vaňek, well-known businessman living in the district called Czech California. The clerk, Anton Razim, and the physician, Doctor Žábokrtský, also are Czechs. Three assisting physicians belong to the same nationality. The division covers the southern part of the Twenty-Fourth Ward, which was to yield 306 men to the Army as the first quota. These were drawn from 1,690 registered men. Of the first 600 men examined, 114 were found fit; none of them asked exemption..... Of the total number of men called before the commission, seven per cent claimed exemption.</p>
