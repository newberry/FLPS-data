   <p>The election on April 2 is of great importance to all liberal elements and friends of personal liberty. The trustees of the Cesko-Slovanská Americká Sín (Czecho-Slav American Auditorium), 1436-1440 West 18th Street, request all members of our organizations to appear at the polls; not only that, but also that they take along those members of their families and friends who are registered voters.</p>
   <p>Prohibitionists are attempting to "dry up" Chicago. They even want to do away with the legal sale of light alcoholic beverages, such as wine and beer, which are dispensed at our entertainments and festivals. Should they succeed, it would mean a mortal blow to our social gatherings and our halls. It would also impose unbearable taxes on tradesmen, businessmen, and workingmen.</p>
   <p>The more of our people who vote on April 2, the harder it will be for the drys <span class="page-break">2</span>to obtain signatures for their next petition, which they will surely circulate again at the first opportunity. It is necessary to forestall this proposed violation of personal liberty of the population of our city, and it should be done by the vote.</p>
   <p>For the trustees of the Czecho-Slav American Auditorium.</p>
   <p>J. Štepán, president;</p>
   <p>J. Teplý, secretary.</p>
