   <p>Almost all of our aid societies are buying various bonds for their funds, because it is a safe way to create reserves. Our government's Liberty bonds are an excellent investment, and their purchase constitutes a patriotic act. They bear only three per cent interest, it is true, but other four per cent bonds bought by many of the aid societies will easily make up for that. The loss of one per cent can be borne without undue hardship.</p>
