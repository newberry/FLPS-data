   <p>We value highly every sincere manifestation of good will, and we therefore doubly rejoice over the interest which the University of Chicago is showing in our cause. When President Harry Pratt Judson proclaimed that the Czechs and the Slovaks are well deserving of a liberated homeland, and that the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state should be one of the conditions for peace; then there is more to the contact made with the University then is apparent at the first glance.</p>
   <p>The University of Chicago is one of the foremost seats of higher learning in America. There are four hundred faculty members and more than ten thousand students. As one of the great intellectual centers, it can successfully accomplish many things for the Slavonic element in general, and especially for us since up to the present we have been systematically ignored. Herein lies the great significance of the memorable meeting on last Monday which <span class="page-break">2</span>will surely bear fruit in the near future. The situation will be remarkably improved for us if, as reported, the propaganda for the liberation of the small countries should spread to other prominent American educational institutions. We hear that this extension of propaganda is being regarded favorably by the Government itself. It is well known to everybody that President Wilson is a "university man," and that he never attempted to conceal his pronounced liking for the Slavonic peoples.</p>
