   <p>The enthusiasm of volunteering for the duration of the war is not lagging behind the sense of duty which has been awakened by entreaty. Now it is not necessary any more to remind our men of the duty they owe, for the Czech-American men know by now that theirs is a double-duty - towards their adopted country and towards the land of their ancestors as well. Everybody has grasped this, especially our young men who have not slackened in their ardor after the first outburst of emotions as was predicted by some doubters.</p>
   <p>The total number of enlisted Czech-Americans is two hundred and fifty. [List of names follows.]</p>
   
   <p>In the midst of praise for these men we must not forget the valiant small group of our boys who have departed to Canada, there to join the ranks of the neighboring state and to get into action abroad as soon as possible; they are bound for the battlefields of France where Czech blood has been shed for liberty before. Most of these young heroes hail from Chicago.</p>
