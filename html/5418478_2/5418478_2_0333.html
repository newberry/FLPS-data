   <p>City Clerk Joseph Šiman yesterday answered the Chicago Civil Service Commission which is trying to accuse him of being unfair in the placing of names of aldermanic candidates on primary lists for the next aldermanic election.</p>
   <p>The Civil Service Commission examined Mr. Šiman's office employees, and expects to continue with the examination next Monday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Šiman asserts that he acted equitably and within the law, and said: "Two of the Thompson candidates for aldermen, who are yelling that frauds were committed, came to me before their petitions were entered and asked me to tell them how it would be possible to fix things so that their names would be printed at the top of the primary ticket. One of these men came in person and the other sent his representative."</p>
   <p>Mr. Šiman will reveal the names of these men when he deems the time propitious.</p>
