   <p>Otto Zeman, a registered pharmacist, owns a drug store at 3002 South Central Park Avenue in the Czech district called Czech California. He was drafted for service in the Thirty-third Division, but requested the Recruiting Commission to exempt him on the ground that he is the only druggist in the neighborhood, and that, therefore, his activity cannot be dispensed with, without detriment to the populace. The Commission denied the request as not being founded on valid reasons. Whereupon the druggist sent an appeal directly to President Wilson. He pleads that he does not want a complete exemption, but only a stay of ninety days, during which he hopes to sell his store and settle the affairs connected with his business. And further, that up to date he has vainly tried to sell out, but he is unable to find a Czech druggist who could manage the business during his absence without causing irretrievable losses to himself. The decision of the President is expected with intense interest.</p>
