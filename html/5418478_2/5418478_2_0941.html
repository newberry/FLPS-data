   <p>We are facing the most powerful, and pitiless enemy with whom any nation ever had to contend.....If we win, we will have assured safety for our beautiful country - if not, the entire world will become the servant of the victorious Teutons.</p>
   <p>The great masses of our population are strangely apathetic in the face of this great crisis. If you ride on the street car, you will hear people talking about everything under the sun except the war.</p>
   <p>More excitement was manifested when the European war broke out than now, when America is involved....Neither the introduction of compulsory service, nor the war taxes, nor even the war loan awakened our people from their lethargy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The only ones who indicate any awareness are those who are swamping Washington with protests against war taxes, and those who are profiteering by the war, and are anxious to gain as much as possible from it.</p>
   <p>A local German paper, known to be pro-German, declares that the war cannot last much longer since Germany cannot take the risk of a still more prolonged struggle. The opinion of the German paper indicates clearly that the next battles will be decisive.</p>
   <p>The only danger that threatens us is our own indifference. Everyone of us must become fully aware of the responsibility taken by the United States.</p>
