   <p>Our "fine Mayor" has again shown himself in the true light. In order not to spoil his career, meaning, not to incur the displeasure of the Germans of Chicago, he refused to extend an invitation to the French General, Joffre, who defeated the Germans on the battlefields on the Marne. He also refused to invite a French and British delegation, though their desire to visit the City had been expressed.</p>
   <p>Joffre, however, will come to Chicago, no matter whether Mr. Thompson does or does not want to be present at the reception. The aldermen of the 34th Ward, Mr. Toman and Mr. Kostner, Czech-Americans, have <span class="page-break">\2</span>signed a call for a special meeting of the City Council tomorrow. The city clerk, James T. Igoe, is to notify the members of the City Council. Every effort will be made to get the necessary number of signatures for the meeting. There is no doubt but that General Joffre, as well as the French and the English delegations, will receive a most hearty welcome, enough to put Mayor Thompson to shame.</p>
