   <p>The mere babbling of patriotic phrases does not count now. Do not believe a man who tells you that he is a true Czech but does not contribute to our cause. If a man brags about his American patriotism but does not buy a single bond, even though he is financially able to do so, he is nothing but a bag of lies.</p>
