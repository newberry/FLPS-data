   <p>As we know our countryman, Jaroslav Schlessinger, applied for the position of a postmaster in a south-west post office, located on Blue Island and 18th Street. Two other prominent politicians also applied for the position, but the chief postmaster of Chicago, Judd, nominated the Bohemian, J. Schlessinger, who will be installed into office this afternoon at 4 P. M. We hope our new Bohemian postmaster will see to it, that more Bohemian officials receive the appointments and that all those, who are already working there will remain on their jobs.</p>
