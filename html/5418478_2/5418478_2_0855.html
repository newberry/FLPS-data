   <p>Moaning cries for help are reaching us from our Czech brethren who are fighting in the ranks of the French army, in whose service they enlisted as volunteers to prove their attachment for the French nation, and to help destroy the murderers of our nation, the Germans. The majority of the Czech legionnaires are dead now. But those men fell, convinced that their dear old motherland would be liberated. They might be considered lucky in comparison to those who were wounded only, and are now exposed to direst misery. Not being French citizens, and not considered soldiers of the regular French Army, they are not entitled to state aid. Even had France tried to come to their succor, the French republic could not do so, as it had the enormous problem on hand of taking care of its own men. There are many Czech families in France who have lost their breadwinners on the battlefields. These poor fellow-countrymen are now destitute, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>need quick and effective relief. Who ought to be the first to extend a helping hand to them if not the Czechs in the United States!</p>
   <p>We have heard many of our fellow-countrymen say that they would be willing to contribute if direct aid were needed for our soldiers. They reiterated their assurance when they were approached by the Czech National Alliance, which is in charge of the relief movement. Those people have an opportunity now to help the most deserving and the best sons of our nation, those who have become the most pitied after they had fought for the interests of mankind. Come to their aid quickly, and with all in your power!</p>
