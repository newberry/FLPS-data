   <p>A meeting of members of the various committees of the Third Liberty Loan campaign was held in the Morrison Hotel, and all nationalities were represented. The Czech section was represented by Anton J. Cermak, chairman; J. J. Salat, secretary; Frank Hajicek, treasurer; John A. Cervenka, and William K. Pflaum. The Czech press was also represented.</p>
   <p>Reports showed that 900,000 persons subscribed to the Third Liberty Loan in Chicago. Of these, 350,000 belonged to the "foreign-language" division. We Czechs may well be proud of our record, for 60,000 of our fellow countrymen have invested $5,000,000 of their savings in the Third Liberty Loan issue.</p>
