   <p>Joseph O. Kostner, alderman of the predominantly Czech Thirty-fourth Ward, was sworn in as captain in the United States Army yesterday morning. Federal Judge Alshuler administered the oath. Alderman Kostner's excellent knowledge of military drill brought about his appointment to the Army from Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kostner is going to discharge his aldermanic duties until the time when he is called for actual service, which is expected to be in about one month. For a time his colleague, Alderman John Toman, will take over his duties. Mr. Kostner intends to send in his resignation as alderman somewhat later so that his successor may have time enough to make preparations for the election.</p>
