   <p>The American Germans have become more cautious of late, though they have not changed a bit, intrinsically. Their courageous hearts have only become a little afraid of spreading propaganda openly, and, therefore, with a part of the Irish, they contain themselves for arranging peace meetings. They attack Americans as the real instigators of a war scare in the United States. The German papers in their editorials refrain from criticizing certain measures of the President and of the government, satisfied with the reprint of speeches from peace meetings and comments "from the people," in which the Germans relieve themselves of their opinion about the fact that it is people to whom America owes so much, and how the Germans should act now in these critical times.</p>
   <p>An article such as this, which blabbers much, and insinuates still more, is printed in the Sonntagspost. It came from the pen of that paper's <span class="page-break">\2</span>permanent contributor, F. F. Matenaers. We do not mean to waste any time to describe the process of thinking by which the German arrives at the conclusion that the United States without the Germans could not be what they are now, and that it is the mission of the Germans to win liberty for this country and preserve it. It finally calls on his fellow-countrymen to remain faithful until death. Faithful, of course, not to the American government, but to their own German mission, to German sentiment, which at this moment means "peace at any price." We want to take issue with excerpts only from the "voice of the people" of which we are convinced that it comes right from the hearts of the millions of Germans living here.</p>
   <p>It depicts how the English language papers here serve the Anglo-American interests and capital, which draw the noose tighter, in order to choke to death American independence and liberty. It then says: "Woe to the American German who dares to point to these shameful raids, and at the <span class="page-break">\3</span>danger underlying these conditions. He is instantly branded a "German spy," first by the papers and then by the people, who cannot discern the duplicity of the press.</p>
   <p>The Germans in America have completely forgotten their mission under these conditions of the last days and weeks. When, by the disruption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany, the internal antagonism took on more acute forms, the German "leaders" lost their heads. Fear, and unbelievable panic beset all of them, and they were unable to find themselves. In this manner, many German-Americans became traitors to the mission of the Germans and to this country at the same time. They became traitors to the Star-Spangled Banner. All those prominent Germans became traitors. All of those who had loved so to shine as "leaders" could not pack up their baggage fast enough to get into places less conspicuous or more solitary. The traitors have become weaklings. There is, however, the great multitute of German-Americans who have preserved their <span class="page-break">\4</span>loyalty to this country and they are those on whom we must rely for the future of our land. It is high time, now, that this loyalty of the German-Americans be incorporated into actions which bear fruit. We have not yet entered the War on the side of the English. There is still a struggle going on in this country between the right American sentiment on the one side, and the Anglo-American capitalism on the other. The individual does not count, but the attitude of millions of the most orderly and best citizens of our country is to be considered. It is necessary that able men make the deciding steps for the protection of the interests of the United States, which are also the most cherished interests of the German-Americans. If the millions of the right thinking Germans in America would start determined action politically and economically against the "friends of peace," then a real peace could still be won for our country. Nothing can be accomplished by remaining weak-kneed and giving assurances of "loyalty," and of pride of fighting for the Star-Spangled Banner, even if it be done for the English.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Why not do away with all this false shame? We live and die for the inheritance of our predecessors, as the German-Americans have done for their forbears, and as our forefathers have done for the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that the Star-Spangled Banner fits the German patriots like the mailed fist. In short: The German interests can be served by "peace at any price" only, because the war would hit nothing but Germany, and therefore, the Germans of America must stand shoulder to shoulder to prevent the outbreak of war. If there were a call to the arms against England, the German-Americans would pull strings very differently.</p>
   <p>But we are not surprised at the Germans here. They are too thoroughly impregnated with the spirit of mother Germania to acknowledge rights other than their own. We marvel, however, at people who are born of Czech mothers, and yet pull on the side of the assassins of the Czech nation, <span class="page-break">\6</span>and with elements antagonistic toward the American people. We are dumbfounded at the brazenness of people who are attempting to defend their attitude before our fellow-countrymen. Their sophistication rivals that of the Germans who talk of a revolution while professing loyalty to the Star Spangled Banner.</p>
