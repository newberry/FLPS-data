   <p>approved by the State Building Commission, which also issues permits for starting construction.</p>
   <p>Another interesting phase of the building of the state house is the fact that another Bohemian-American will lend his services in the decoration of this edifice. He is the well-known artist-sculptor, Jan Maria Korbel, to whom all the statuary work on this building was assigned.</p>
   <p>This art work will consist principally of large bas-reliefs above the entrance to the building and will present a group of allegorical figures representing art, science, commerce, business, etc. [A description of the interior and exterior of the building is presented in detail.]</p>
   <p>According to the present specifications and plans, this state building of ours will be one of the finest, and therefore will reflect honor upon the Bohemians, because the initiative came from Mr. James B. Dibelka, under <span class="page-break">3</span>whose direction the building will soon be completed. He will certainly inspire gratitude for the service he has performed, and we may be proud that he is our countryman.</p>
