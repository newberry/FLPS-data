   <p>The Czech section of the Committee of Public Information addressed itself to Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, president of the Czech National Council, requesting him to direct an appeal to the Czechoslovak people in America to support the Fourth Liberty Loan drive. President Masaryk, ever devoted to our common cause, graciously consented. This manifesto, an event of historic import, is going to be sent out in the form of a letter. It will represent the first official utterance from the head of the provisional government of the Czechoslovak Republic which is at present in Washington, D. C. It will be the first words spoken by the president of the republic to its people. A facsimile of the letter will be placed at the disposal of all Czechoslovak newspapers for reprint.</p>

   <p>Let all Czechoslovaks show that they stand behind President Masaryk, just as they stand behind President Wilson in the struggle for the rights of humanity.</p>
