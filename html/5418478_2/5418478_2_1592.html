   <p>P.4--The high cost of living is now being investigated by Congress and will probably be studied in the State legislature and the city hall. How much value can be assigned to all this work remains a question. Researches into the matter of high prices have been conducted by newspapers in more thorough fashion than by official bodies. Neither one of these groups has had much success in discovering the real causes of the phenomenon and in fixing the responsibility therefore on the right persons. Every one of the witnesses called on the stand by Congress denies and connection with the price-controlling element and winds up with the halo of innocence around his head.</p>
   <p>It is, by the way, rather easy to establish the truth. Most of the dealers in victuals are not engaged in other activities. Their income is derived solely from the sale of food-stuffs. Consequently one has only to observe the increase in their wealth to get at the bottom of the whole matter. In other words, it is a case of keeping still and watching, it grow.</p>
   <p>Certain "economists, people who write books but know nothing about real life, assign the blame for rising prices to the huge amount of gold produced. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>The more gold there is, say these people, the less the value of money is. This kind of reasoning is preposterous. Deflation would cause everything to rise in price, including human labor. The working-man's wages, however, hover constantly below a certain variable minimum. Other groups of people, notably those who write for our American newspapers, accuse the public, charging them with wastefulness and prodigality. People are too fastidious, they say; they want only the most expensive articles and throw away half the things which they buy, whereas if they were thrifty, prices would go down. Against this theory we can set the fact, that high prices prevail in other countries as well as in America, in countries where waste is out of the question; for example, in Germany, where people eat horse-meat and dog-meat, or in France and England, where the populace has had to lower its standard of living, and also in Bohemia, from which many complaints are reaching us daily.</p>
   <p>The conclusion reached by the newspapers appears to be incorrect for another reason, namely, that the rise in prices has been very rapid, especially in the last few years, and it is hardly possible that all the people have become Sybarites and epicures within that short time.</p>

   <p>The meat-barons and the kings of the corn exchange have tried recently to shift the burden of responsibility to the shoulders of the farmers "who grow fat on the rising prices." It is therefore only proper to hear the farmers' opinion. One of them gives a detailed account of the cost of raising an animal up to the time, when it becomes marketable and proves that the prices are raised the moment it gets into the stockyards. All the cattle in the markets of St. Louis, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Omaha, Sioux City, and Chicago are bought by four big packing concerns, who within a few years have each accumulated property worth from thirty million to a hundred million dollars. These data speak for themselves. The rich men are the packers, not the farmers; among farmers there is only one millionaire and that is David Rankin of Tarkin, Missouri, who became wealthy by speculating in real estate.</p>
