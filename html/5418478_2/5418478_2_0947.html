   <p>The directorate of the Česká Dobročinná Společnost (Czech Benevolent Society) held a meeting last Friday evening. Mr. Anton J. Čermák presiding. The group decided to initiate immediately an intensive and extensive campaign for the benefit of the Red Cross..... The Society considers this decision in the light of a sacred duty in view of the war which has been forced upon America by rapacious Germany..... A committee of seven was formed which is to contact the Czech National Alliance for the purpose of cooperating with them. The campaign will be inaugurated at a mass-meeting in Pilsen Park. This gathering will be addressed by the Hon. Charles Vopička, United States minister to Roumania, Doctor Rudiš Jičinský, and Doctor Cunat. The latter two are members of the medical delegation to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Serbia; they also represent the Red Cross headquarters. The mass meeting probably will be called for next Thursday.</p>
