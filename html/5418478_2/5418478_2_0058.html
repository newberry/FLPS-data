   <p>Last Tuesday night a meeting was called in the Pilsen Park pavilion by the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) for the purpose of protesting the proposed revision of the state constitution. The revision is to be placed before the Illinois voters on December 12 [1922] for their decision. The attendance at this meeting was not great, a situation brought about by the public interest in the closing important political campaign. Interest of the people has been diverted from other issues and concentrated on the possible outcome of the elections to take place next Tuesday. One of the speakers was also Mr. Karel J. Michal who, though he was a member of the constitutional convention, voted against the proposed revision, and in the meeting [called by the Svaz] gave reasons why it should be defeated. The program also contained some musical numbers.</p>
