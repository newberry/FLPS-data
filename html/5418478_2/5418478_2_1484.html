   <p>The members of the delegation sent by the Belgian nation to the President of the United States with a protest against the cruelties and wanton policy of destruction by the Germans in the occupied parts of Belgium arrived in Chicago yesterday at 10 A. M. Its members are: Minister of justice, Mr. Henry Carton De Viart; secretary to King Albert, Count Lichtervelde; minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Emil Vandervelde; and one of the world's foremost workers in the Free Thought movement, Mr. Paul Hymans.</p>
   <p>Immediately after their arrival in Chicago, the commission was besieged by newspaper reporters who were trying to learn something about the war, the possibilities of peace, and the delegates' opinions on these questions. But the commission definitely refused to enter into any discussion on topics which could be designated as unneutral, and they limited their remarks to their admiration of America in general and Chicago in particular.</p>
