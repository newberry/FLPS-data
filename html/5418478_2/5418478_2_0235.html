   <p>A meeting will be held by city teamsters tonight, at which they will first take under consideration the earnest request of Alderman Anton J. Cermák made to their business agent, Alexander McGregor. Alderman Cermák spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Every day that you stay on strike, rubbish will be accumulating in our alleys so fast that it will be difficult to catch up with its disposal. Spring is here and if warm weather comes the rubbish will decay, which might be a cause of much sickness. You will gain favor with the City Council if you return to work and wait until the time when we will be able to dispose of this matter." In Chicago it is necessary to carry away 1,230 loads of rubbish and 103 loads of kitchen waste.</p>
