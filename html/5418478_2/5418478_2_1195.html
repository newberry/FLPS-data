   <p>Germany is longing for peace--there is no doubt about that. This statement is by no means based upon indefinite rumors and various fantastic cablegrams, but it is based on facts published even in Germany's own newspapers. Until recently, German papers were simply forbidden to discuss possibilities and conditions of peace; now they are not only permitted to do so, but they are, apparently, being encouraged to do it, since the Berlin government, is, at the present time, exercising such strict control over the press that it is difficult to tell when a paper propounds the opinion of the editor and when that of the Kaiser. The Vorwaerts, which was recently suppressed because it made peace propaganda, is now permitted to print the following sentence: "The economic situation of our poorer classes is getting more unbearable every week." Another daring statement was made recently by the Hamburg Volkszeitung, which declared publicly: "There is no doubt that all nations, Germany included, are longing for peace. If Germany had to negotiate with England and France only, a peace based on exchanges and indemnities, and without the danger of future <span class="page-break">2</span>difficulties, would not be impossible. But Russia, in spite of her great losses, has recovered with astounding rapidity. Germany should take advantage of the present favorable situation and start peace negotiations. If she passes up this opportunity, it will be too late." And right here, there is a concise indication of the reasons that give rise to the longing for peace in Germany.</p>
   <p>The so-called peace conferences of Count Buelow in Switzerland may be safely left out of the discussion. These conferences have absolutely nothing to do with the peace movement. Ever since their beginning it has been quite clear that Count Buelow has been acting in the capacity of the Kaiser's emissary to the Pope. The presence in Berne of the Archbishop of Cologne, who is on his way to a conclave in Rome, confirms this theory. The establishment of an independent Poland, which would naturally be a Catholic state, is a part of the price offered the pope for his undisputably powerful influence upon the future peace conference. The news about the conversion of the Bulgarian people from the Greek Church to Roman Catholicism sounds somewhat fantastic, but we have <span class="page-break">3</span>seen the Kaiser doing still more outlandish things. And it is Wilhelm, not Ferdinand, who now rules in Sophia.</p>
   <p>Germany is longing for peace now more than her opponents are not perhaps because it might be threatened with a catastrophe. That is out of question; but because it is now in a better position to get favorable conditions than it has been up to this time and can ever be in the future. The German armies have achieved great successes over foes who, prior to the outbreak of the war, had been devoting their energies principally to purposes other than feverish preparations for attacking their neighbors. Germany holds practically the whole of Belgium with huge industrial resources, and a large part of Northern France with sixty per cent of the coal and iron industries. According to their own estimate, the Germans have taken out of French mines only two billion dollars' worth of coal and iron ore during the war. In the East, the Kaiser's hordes are holding in their claws practically the whole industrial region of Russia and the better part of the Baltic coast. Four fifths of Serbia are now in German and Bulgarian hands and in the hands of their allies; Greece and <span class="page-break">4</span>Rumania, formerly probable enemies, are now intimidated, corrupted, and fully in the power of their Germanophile rulers; Turkey is defending herself successfully both in Gallipoli and in the Caucasus; there is excitement in Persia. Small wonder that an observer looking at the situation through German glasses has many reasons for the assertion that Germany has won the war already. Under such conditions it may really seem an anachronism (sic) that it is Germany and not the Allies, who is making peace overtures, but it is an indisputable fact which can be logically explained.</p>
   <p>Paris is no safer from Germany than it was at the beginning of the war. Russia is invincible. This historical truth has dawned upon Germany only recently. Kitchener's claim that Great Britain will be in a position to equip six million Russian soldiers by next March must be taken with a grain of salt; it was made for its effect upon the Greek government. But even so, it is certain that Russia's resources of human material have barely been scratched on the surface. Japan allowed herself be heard saying that she will finish the work on equipment of new Russian armies within three months. By way of countering the threat <span class="page-break">5</span>of this ocean of men, Hindenburg cannot do more than tell his inferior home-defence forces [Translator's note: Military units composed of older men and only expected to defend the homeland against an invasion, and not to fight outside of their own country in a war] that he hopes to maintain the present positions against attacks of the enemy. What poor consolation! Great Britain's influence upon the course of the war is frequently underestimated because the war, due to the cowardly--or rather cunning--hiding of the Germany navy, is being waged for the most part on land where Great Britain really has not done a great deal, principally because of incompetent leadership but this world empire also will finally be compelled to use a greater portion of its latent powers to defeat a dangerous foe. This is coming, particularly now, since the Suez Canal, one of the pillars of the world-wide realm of proud Albion, is in danger, no matter whether real or only apparent.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, Germany's peace wooings are falling upon deaf ears, because even in her peace proposals Germany is suffering from megalomania, an old disease, indeed. If even Scheidemann, the leader of the Social Democrats, <span class="page-break">6</span>talks about conquests, what may be expected from the Junkers? To keep Belgium and Northern France, the Baltic States, to separate Poland from Russia, to divide Serbia between Austria and Bulgaria, and--last but not least--to collect an enormous indemnity whose principal burden will be carried by France, are hardly conditions that will be likely to find a willing ear of the Allies. They [the Allies] see that the Central Powers are gradually getting weaker while they themselves develop their strength; they find that Germany will soon reach the point where she will no longer be able to replenish the losses in her army. In the meantime, the blockade by the Allies' hegemony on the seas is getting more and more complete; the arms works of the Central Powers are day by day more concerned about the diminishing stocks of copper and tin; their population is gradually forgetting what coffee, tea, cocoa, and spices are, and it is complaining with increasing loudness of the terribly high cost of living--a cost that is constantly rising without a prospect of betterment as long as the war lasts.</p>
   <p>A peace concluded at this time would mean a complete victory for Germany and her satelites; but for such a peace there is no hope.</p>
