   <p>Chicago must exert its efforts during the next four days when the Liberty Loan drive will come to a close. We Czechs, especially, must show that Chicago is not a "German city" (as Mayor Thompson said). Chicago Czechs, more than any other group, should subscribe, for this war is being carried on by us not only for the sake of the United States, but for the good of our motherland across the ocean as well.</p>
   <p>In order to create a genuine wartime atmosphere, there was a parade arranged which led to the Pilsen Brewery Park yesterday. It consisted of Czech members of the Liberty Bond drive committee, of members of the Sokol societies, and of the Boy Scouts. Mr. Brousek's band led the parade.</p>
   <p>The meeting in the Pilsen Park was opened by Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who then <span class="page-break">2</span>surrendered the chairman's seat to Mr. Charles Pavlicek. The latter, in a short speech, acquainted the gathering with the purpose of the meeting. Mr. Joseph Salat was elected secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph J. Janda, treasurer of the Lawndale State Bank and one of our best workers in the field of aid societies, spoke about the Czech aid societies in relation to the Liberty Loan. He said: "The aid societies are neither patriotic nor charitable organizations; they are simply pecuniary institutions, conducted by the people and for the people. They have hundreds of members who would be glad to buy a bond if their financial position would permit. Yet they can, through the aid societies as intermediator, become participants in this great patriotic action.....The law permits us to buy the bonds, and we are under obligation to the government to support it. We should be grateful to our government for everything we derive from it.....</p>
   <p>"Some aid societies use excuses, e. g., that they do not have enough money. This sounds flimsy, for even the smallest among them can muster one hundred <span class="page-break">3</span>or two hundred dollars for the best investment in the world....."</p>
   <p>Doctor Pecival then appealed to those aid societies with tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars in the treasury to buy bonds. Mr. Henry Hanson spoke in the English language, giving details on the war loan.</p>
   <p>The Delnicky Pevecky Sbor [Workingmen's Singing Society] sang two beautiful choruses, "Bojovnici V Noci" [Fighters in the Night] and "O, Vlasti Ma Ty Milena" [Thou Beloved Homeland of Mine]..</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Cervenka then read a letter by Charles Vopicka, addressed to Mr. Anton J. Cermak. It says: "...Please inform my fellow countrymen that they are counted among the most intelligent of our fellow citizens and are admired for their self-devotion to the cause by all Americans....The more this loan is oversubscribed, the clearer the Germans will see that our people stand behind the President....."</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Mr. Straka spoke for the Catholic societies. Mr. Otto Kerner pointed to the impression which vigorous recruiting here will make upon Germany. The president of the Lawndale State Bank spoke about the efforts made by the Germans to prevent a success of the loan drive....</p>
