   <p>The Allied bazaar is now our battlefield upon which we can demonstrate how enthusiastic and generous we are, where we can show to what degree we deserve of the recognition given to us by the Allies and the sacrifices they are willing to bring for the cause of the liberation of the Czech nation. Our brethren over the ocean are forced, be it ever so much against their own will, to sacrifice on the altar of the German side their fortunes and their lives. We, who can freely manifest our sentiments for the Czech nation, must by all possible means support the Allies, and at this time we can make the first step in the Allied bazaar.</p>
