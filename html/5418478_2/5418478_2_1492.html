   <p>In the next few days, Chicago will welcome a commission composed of a few of the most prominent citizens of Belgium who were sent to the United States in order to present a protest here against the vandalism of the German soldiery in the occupied parts of the kingdom.</p>
   <p>As our readers know, the commission was received by President Wilson, and they presented him with documents pertaining to the deeds of the Germans, against which the Belgian nation and the whole civilized world must protest. The German delegation from Chicago that went to Washington to "protest against the protest" and refute the Belgians' accusations has not been received by the President.</p>
   <p>This very tactful and considerate action of the President toward the overseas <span class="page-break">2</span>guests will be reciprocated by the delegation's avoidance of all public manifestations and everything that might seem to deflect the people of the United States from the strict neutrality advocated so strongly by the President.</p>
   <p>For this reason, the whole program of the delegation was changed and all public meetings, speeches, and other manifestations have been deleted from the itinerary. In Chicago, where they planned to stay for several days, one day of which had been promised to our local Bohemian colony, the delegation will spend only one day. That day's program has not yet been made public, but it is known that it will contain nothing that might give the appearance of a public manifestation. The delegation will not even visit the Chicago colony of its own countrymen in the neighborhood of Logan Square.</p>
   <p>There will be, however, an official welcome, and the Bohemians have been notified that their representatives are welcome to take part in it.</p>
