   <p>The Independent Democratic Club in the 6th ward proposed at yesterday's meeting our countryman John Kalal for the City Council.</p>
   <p>It was done to have our own representative in the City Council. There are in the 6th ward 1,700 Bohemian votes, which will be deposited for Mr. Kalal. As Mr. Kalal was not present at the meeting, there was sent to him a committee to notify him of the nomination. He was thankful for the honor, which was shown him and promised to answer, tonight, if he would accept the candidacy.</p>
   <p>John Kalal is a foreman in the Harvey lumberyard.</p>
