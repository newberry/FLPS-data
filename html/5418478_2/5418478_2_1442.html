   <p>An influential Chicago newspaper, The Daily News, which has at other times published a number of articles favorable, even flattering, to the Bohemians, recently published a report from Budapest in which the behavior of Bohemian and other Slavic soldiers in this war is considered from an absolutely erroneous point of view.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar refuted this report by a letter from its secretary, which The Daily News published under the title "Conditions in Austria" and which reads [in translation] as follows:</p>
   <p>"Many articles dealing with the war are appearing nowadays in American <span class="page-break">2</span>newspapers. One of these was written by Dr. Ernst A. Loewinger, army physician in a Budapest hospital. Mr. R. H. Swing, special correspondent of The Daily News in Berlin, sent this article to Chicago for publication.</p>
   <p>"In his article, Dr. Loewinger quotes statements of sick and wounded Bohemian soldiers to the effect that they would rather die under the Austrian flag than become Russian or Serbian subjects. He further states that the Bohemian and Polish regiments have been fighting 'like lions,' and that a Prague businessman has denied reports that the Bohemians are 'unreliable'. They enjoy so many liberties and such wonderful prosperity under the Austrian government!</p>
   <p>"If Dr. Loewinger's statements concerning Bohemian and Polish soldiers are authentic, it is certain that his informers were not Bohemians. The nonsense about liberty and prosperity comes from an entirely different source. There is just one explanation that can account for it: fear of political stool <span class="page-break">3</span>pigeons. Such fear is common in Austria even in peace times, and it is general at this moment. Thus, Miss Alice Itch, an American correspondent in Vienna, writes as follows: 'Arrests of the Viennese are very frequent whenever they mention something about Austrian failures. There are stool pigeons all over. The other day I was sitting in a coffee house on Praterstrasse in a group of very nervous people. I saw refugees from Galicia swapping experiences, cautiously, carefully, and in a whispering voice. Suddenly, I noticed that a young man, whose thin, sallow face bore witness of recent suffering, was left standing alone. He had been deserted by his friend, whom I saw whispering something to a man standing at the door, and then leaving the place. The refugee was instantly arrested. He had talked to a stool pigeon!'</p>
   <p>"The soldiers, however, are being spied on to an even greater degree, because they know more than those who have not been in the war. It is certain that the soldiers do not trust even the physicians who treat them. There is not <span class="page-break">4</span>a single Bohemian, or Pole, or Ruthenian, or Croatian who would gladly die for Austria or the Austrian government. The fact is that thousands of them would be happy to die if their death would liberate their country from Austria!</p>
   <p>"It is absurd to say that the Bohemians are unreliable. They are absolutely reliable, but on the other side of the fence. Even should Bohemian soldiers turn their rifles against the officers who lead them, it would not be treason. True enough, they have sworn to be true and obedient to the Emperor, but this was the forced oath of a recruit who could not help himself. Some years ago, a Bohemian recruit refused to take the oath. He was put in jail and kept there much longer than he would have had to stay in the army. Can a man who betrays an oath of this kind be called a traitor?</p>
   <p>"We Bohemians in America know how our soldiers in this war feel. Their letters do not say a great deal. They know that every line is first read <span class="page-break">5</span>by a censor. But in spite of this, enough trickles through to show the true feeling of Slavic soldiers in the Austrian army. A soldier of the 30th Home Defense [Zemebranecky] Regiment, who was wounded near Tomasov in Russian Poland, writes: When we were crossing the Russian border on our terrible march, our officers urged us to shout "Hurrah!" They are watching us all the time, and woe to those who arouse their suspicions!'</p>
   <p>"At that, what Dr. Loewinger says about the lionlike bravery of Bohemian and Polish soldiers may be quite true. But it is easy to explain. At the beginning of the war, the Austrian government spread rumors about terrible atrocities which, it was alleged, were being perpetrated by Russians and Serbs on the Austrian wounded. It is quite probable that these rumors were largely believed at the start, because the soldiers did not, at the time, have any opportunity to find out otherwise. Therefore, they fought like lions in order not to fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
   <p>"During the mobilization of the Austrian army, there were many soldiers <span class="page-break">6</span>brave enough to give expression to their own true opinion about this war, but they were immediately shot. Slavic soldiers are much more careful now.</p>
   <p>"If there is anything certain, it is the fact that millions of the oppressed Slavs in Austria have not forgotten the hundreds of years of injustice they had to take from the German and Austrian governments. We do not wish that they be annexed by Russia or Serbia, but we do look forward to the day when German overlordship in Austria will be a matter of history."</p>
