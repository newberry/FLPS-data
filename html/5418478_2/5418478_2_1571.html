   <p>The license committee of the city council headed by Alderman Toman will take a trip to Boston, and then to New York, to study the conditions under which the saloon business is carried on in those cities. The observations made are to be utilized in a bill to be prepared and adapted to Chicago requirements. The particular care of the committee will be directed towards omitting in the bill any point which might be taken advantage of by the prohibition fanatics to prevent its passage. The Boston saloons are considered the best regulated in the country. Alderman Toman is going to request Mayor Thompson to send his representative along with the committee.</p>
