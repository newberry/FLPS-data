   <p>The Poles in America are spending a great deal of money on the publication of a new weekly, Free Poland, which is being sent free of charge to all newspapers, as well as to prominent and influential persons in America. In this way, the Poles acquaint the public with their desires, teach the Americans to appreciate the Polish contributions to American culture and civilization.</p>
   <p>The publication costs a great deal of money, but the advantages which it will some day bring the Poles will be more than worth it. The peace negotiations will most likely be conducted in the United States, just as they were in the case of the Russo-Japanese War. America will be duly acquainted with such questions as who the Poles are, what their desires are, and how these desires are justified. When one of the warring nations evinces a willingness to grant independence to the Poles, the proposal will find a strong supporter in the American mediator, whether he be President Wilson or anybody else.</p>
   <p>Action of this or a similar kind should be undertaken by the American Bohemians also. But among us, nothing can be done without much ado, a great deal of discussion, considerable strife and contention. There are suspicions here, partisan interests there, and when we finally get together it is usually--too late.</p>
