   <p>In these serious, historically significant times, when the American people are preparing to help the Allies morally and materially to beat down the hydra of German, Austrian, Hungarian, and Turkish militarism, and to contribute to victory for the sake of democracy and humanity, towards the ideals so nobly expressed by President Woodrow Wilson, it is the most sacred duty of the Czechs and Slovaks, of unmarried, healthy patriots, to report to the last man for enlistment in the Czech Sokol Legion and to join as volunteers the ranks of the soldiers.</p>
   <p>There is a meeting to be called for this purpose; the time is set for March 28, at 8 P. M., the place is the hall of the Sokol Havlicek Tyrs. The issue is going to be discussed thoroughly in a debate in which all single, able-bodied patriots are expected to take part, and so demonstrate their patriotism and Sokol ideals. Brothers Kosar, Klepal, and others will also be present.</p>
   <p>Be sure to come, all of you, and help make the meeting huge and worthwhile!</p>
