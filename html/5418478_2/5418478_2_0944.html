   <p>The undersigned members of the accounting committee, acting upon request of the Ustřední Výbor (Central Committee) and of the Cleveland Conference of the Czech National Alliance, have examined all the books and notes relating to the financial aspect of the Central Committee's activities.</p>
   <p>The bookkeeper's records have been inspected five times per year by the bookkeeping branch of the Central Committee. Our committee has gone over the accounts for the year 1916, and for the first three months of 1917. We declare that we have found them in the best of order. The treasurer, Mr. J. F. Štĕpina, the bookkeeper, Mr. Adolph Lonek, and the assistant-bookkeeper, Mr. J. V. Votava, deserve full recognition for <span class="page-break">2</span>their honest and painstaking work.</p>
   <p>For certain reasons, it is not advisable to publish the financial report before the end of the war. We, therefore, are submitting here only a few figures, from which the members of the Czech National Alliance who have made contributions for the work of the Alliance may be able to judge whether their monies have been used in a judicious manner.</p>
   <p>Of the amount received by the Ustredna (Central Committee) in 1916, service required 2.4 per cent, hall rents took 1.2 per cent, rent and supplies for the office .5 per cent, traveling expenses .45 per cent, printing .75 per cent, postage .1 per cent.</p>
   <p>In compliance with the request of the Central Committee we are willing to examine the accounts every three months and to present the results to the public.</p>
