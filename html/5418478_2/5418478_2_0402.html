   <p>A service star is evidence that some one of your family is fighting under the Stars and Stripes, for liberty of the world and liberation of our nation.</p>
   <p>A Liberty Loan button is also a symbol of service, and shows that we are fighting in conjunction with our boys, if not on the battlefield, then with our money, to help toward a speedy victory for humanity and justice.</p>
   <p>If we are eager to see fewer gold stars on the service flags, and wish for an early return of our boys, then let our money fight for us, and let us buy as many Liberty bonds as our circumstances will permit.</p>
   <p>You owe it to your homeland, to our brave boys, and to yourself!</p>
   <p>4th Liberty Loan, U.S. Government Bonds. Donated by Denni Hlasatel Publishing Company, 1545 West 18th Street, Chicago.</p>
