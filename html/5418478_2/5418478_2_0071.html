   <p>Our countryman, Mr. George J. Zrust, who was running for the office of alderman of the Tenth Ward, gave up his candidacy in favor of Alderman Frank Klaus, and his action will surely be approved by our Bohemian citizens. Mr. Zrust advised us about his move in the following communication, in which he says:</p>
   <p>"After thorough consideration, I have decided not to run for the office of alderman of the Tenth Ward, and I hereby urge all my friends and other good citizens of the Tenth Ward not to vote for me next Tuesday, but to go to the polling places and vote for Alderman Frank Klaus. Were it not for the fact that the ballots are already printed, I would ask the election commission to throw my name out. But it is too late to do this now. I cannot understand why the Tenth Ward should not have two aldermen, just like any other ward in the city, especially when so many important questions are to <span class="page-break">2</span>be decided by the City Council in the near future. I give up my candidacy in order that all voters of the Tenth Ward who wish to be represented by two aldermen can concentrate their support upon one candidate.</p>
   <p>"Alderman James McNichols was elected last year for a term of two years, that is, until April, 1922. Alderman Klaus' term will expire next April. If Alderman Klaus is defeated next Tuesday, then the Tenth Ward is going to be represented by only one alderman during the period of one or probably two years. But if Alderman McNichols is defeated by Alderman Klaus, then McNichols will still be an alderman for the remaining fourteen months of his term, to which he was elected a year ago. After the expiration of this term, he can again run for the office, as is customary for aldermen of other wards.</p>
   <p>"Why is Alderman McNichols running for the office this year when his term <span class="page-break">3</span>does not expire until a year from now? Is it only because he and his friends think that there is a good chance of reducing the representation of Bohemians in the City Council? Or is it merely proof of his gratitude for the support given to him by Alderman Klaus and our countrymen in every one of his campaigns? Alderman Klaus supported Alderman McNichols at every opportunity.</p>
   <p>"The record achieved by Alderman Klaus is excellent. He deserves the support of the people, and his acitvity should be recognized.</p>
   <p>"In my opinion, it would be a great mistake if he were not elected.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"George J. Zrust."</p>
