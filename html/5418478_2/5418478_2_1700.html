   <p>One of the most important, and in its consequences, the most far-reaching laws passed by Congress in its last session was the Harrison law, prohibiting the illicit sale of narcotic medicines, and severely punishing the seller. If this were a state law, it would be inconsequential, but federal laws are always very effective. Pharmaceutical circles report that the law has greatly reduced the sale of narcotics. They are being exported in large quantities to Europe these days, where they are badly needed on the battlefields, but even so the sale of narcotics in the United States has not increased, but has rather decreased a full third since the law went into effect.
