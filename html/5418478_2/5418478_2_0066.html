   <p>....The most important thing in the primary election next Tuesday will be the choice of such candidates as would be of use to our Bohemian President [of the County Board of Commissioners], provided he be elected to that office. Why we should elect him was made sufficiently clear to us in the newspapers and in meetings, but all that could have been said was not made public.... Thus, for instance, the building of a large athletic stadium in one of the county forest preserves is an excellent idea which surely will please our Sokols and the managers of large athletic festivals.....</p>
