   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spoleonost (Czech-Slavonic Aid Society) intends to contribute $1,000 to the cause of the liberation of their people in the old homeland, in addition to the $1,000 which they paid out before. There is still $1,515.95 left in the treasury for similar purposes. The assent of all the members of the Aid Society will be required before the contribution can be made.....Besides this, every member will be assessed ten cents for relief in the old homeland. The New York branch has issued the slogan: One million dollars for the move to liberate our homeland, as directed and propagated by the Czech National Alliance....</p>
   <p>The Czech-Slavonic Aid Society, citing its bylaws, declares that none of its members enlisted in the Army or Navy shall lose their membership. To do otherwise, the Society feels, would be considered woefully lacking in patriotism.</p>
