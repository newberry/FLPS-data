   <p>Volunteers for the next contingent to be sent abroad will report in New York on March 14. They can obtain railroad tickets from the authorized agent of our committee on military affairs, or from the railroad agent. Volunteers who have not hitherto reported are advised to call immediately at our office, or to apply in writing for a ticket. Men who have not yet enlisted but who have decided to do so at the last minute may come to New York at their own expense. The cost of transportation will be refunded to them in New York.</p>
