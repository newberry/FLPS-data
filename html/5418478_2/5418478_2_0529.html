   <p>The executive committee of the Czech section of the Third Liberty Bond Committee met last night in Mr. Schnabl's place, 26th Street and Trumbull Avenue, to render an account of the drive which they conducted together with the Slovaks. It appears that the Czechs and the Slovaks take the first place among immigrant nationalities in regard to subscriptions. Through the efforts of the Czechs almost six million dollars were subscribed in Chicago and suburbs. Taking into consideration that other nationalities are represented in much larger numbers, as for instance the Germans, this fact must be regarded as a brilliant proof of the patriotic sentiment of our people. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, chief bailiff of the municipal court, acted as chairman of the meeting.</p>
   <p>After a lavish dinner had been served to the committee, Mr. J. J. Salat, secretary of the Czech section, rose to submit the eagerly anticipated financial report, which embraced the results of the activities of the workers in every subdivision of the Czech settlement.....[A list of subdivisions follows, with the amounts subscribed.]</p>
   <p>Besides these subscriptions, the Czechs employed by the Western Electric Company, by Sears, Roebuck and Company, by the Crane Company, by the Union Stockyards, and by various tailoring, iron, steel, and real-estate concerns subscribed a total of $1,500,000.</p>
   <p>There were 61,473 subscribers, and $5,758,300 was subscribed all together. These are truly gratifying results, indeed, but the United States Treasury will receive much more from the Czechs, since money is pouring into the central collecting station from Czech settlements all over the States. Small Czech villages and cities where the Czechs constitute only a very small part of the population have rendered a good account of themselves.</p>
   
   <p>Members of the Ceska Beseda (Czech Club) subscribed $25,000; the Lawndale Masonic Lodge $30,000; the Bohemia Lodge $85,000; the settlement of St. Ludmila's parish $35,000; and the settlement of St. Anezka's (St. Agnes) $38,000. Employees of the Pilsen Brewery Company bought $87,000 [worth of bonds] according to Mr. John Cervenka, president of that concern. The report was received with enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Mr. Salat stated that Congressman A. J. Sabath, now in Washington, D. C., expressed great satisfaction when he received reports that the efficient work done by the Czech section had won for Czechs and Slovaks first place as bond buyers among all foreign-language nationalities here. Influential circles in Washington will, no doubt, be properly informed about our creditable work. Our Czech-American Congressman and the Czech section will see to that. The first step toward this end will be a telegram to President Wilson. Alderman John Toman in making the suggestion recommends that emphasis shall be laid in the message on the valuable work of the Czech-American press, without the persistent efforts of which our outstanding success in loan subscriptions could not have been achieved. Mr. J. F. Stepina supplemented the motion by proposing that mention should be made in the telegram of the fact that Czech-American journals and Slavonic-American papers in general have always maintained their loyal pro-American attitude, and that neither during the war nor before it has there appeared a single item in their columns which might be called objectionable or unpatriotic. In view of the movement promoted by certain circles to effect the total abolition of all foreign-language papers the mention of the merits of our Czech press may have a wholesome dampening effect upon the spirit of suppression.</p>
   <p>It is proper to point out to our readers that the Czech section is considered the best and the most nearly perfect organization of its kind in Chicago, and that, as Mr. Cermak stated, the organizations of other nationalities will have to adopt its methods if they really wish to emulate the successes achieved by the Czechs.</p>
   <p>A decision of major importance in its possible consequences was reached at yesterday's session, i. e., to make the Czech section a permanent institution, at least for the duration of the war. The Czech section has offered to the Government its services for any purpose whatsoever, and accordingly it laid the foundations [for its continuance] at yesterday's meeting. As a result of this decision, the Czech section is now, since the Third Loan drive is over, at the disposal of the Government for the Savings Stamps campaign, and it proposes to perform its duty with the same energy and ardor with which it has done so on former occasions. The means employed in this task will be ward organizations, the daily press, societies, brotherhoods, and last but not least, the papers of their specific organization, as well as columns in other publications. Just as was done during the Third Loan drive, so now again there will be a series of meetings, and in general, everything will be undertaken that may help the Czechs and the Slovaks to come out of the enterprise with first honors.</p>
   <p>The third item of discussion was the way in which the Czech section should assert itself and give an account of itself in the impending campaign for the Red Cross. After various suggestions had been made, a system was decided on in which the bulk of the populace is to be divided into groups according to occupation and then approached and canvassed by members of special committees. The latter have already been named. This method was partially put into practice yesterday in the meeting of the Czech section. The members of the committee, as a group, collected contributions for the Red Cross from themselves. Some of the amounts follow: Messrs. Anton J. Cermak, J. F. Stepina, and John A. Cervenka, $100 each; Alderman Joseph O. Kostner and Mr. John Toman, $50 each.</p>
