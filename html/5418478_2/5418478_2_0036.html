   <p>Yesterday a meeting was held in the hall of the Bohemian-American Sokol. The meeting was called by the Bohemian Independent Club and had an exceptionally large attendance. About sixty Bohemian citizens were present and the majority of them joined the club. The meeting was opened by the chairman, Mr. Patera, who expressed his satisfaction at the large attendance and encouraged persistence. "We must open our eyes and look forward before we will vote for a German or an Irishman."</p>
   <p>Mr. Valis said, "This is the only way to organize if we are to support and elect a Bohemian. I don't trust the Germans and unless we unite ourselves firmly, our Bohemian candidate will be ashamed of the number of our votes."</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Mr. Patera approved of this idea but was of the opinion that in case the club members decided that it would be impossible to elect a Bohemian candidate, the support of a German would be more prudent than the support of an Irishman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mracek agreed with the idea and said that the Irishmen are insolent and selfish, supporting only themselves and absolutely indifferent to the needs of other nationalities, that's why every Bohemian citizen should agitate among his friends and neighbors to vote for a Bohemian candidate.</p>
   <p>Mr. Novak reminded us how convenient it is when we can use our mother language in public office and it would be really a shame should the Bohemians show their indifference in the coming election.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benes stated that many of the present citizens are not acquainted <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with our relation to the German electors. He explained all important relations we ever had with the Germans and concluded his speech with the statement that since the Germans are willing to support us, why should we antagonize them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Valis expressed his confidence in the Bohemians. "They should understand that they must be victorious," he said. "We have a Bohemian on the Board of Education and in the Public Library, both chairmen, respectively. Why should we not have a Bohemian alderman?"</p>
   <p>Mr. Chladek spoke next, "It is important to elect a Bohemian alderman who would be honest and take the greatest care of the interests of his ward." He mentioned that he had information that the Germans are not thinking so favorably of us, that the Germans intended to cooperate with us only temporarily, and that they have organized themselves only for our interests. Four of their committees will support someone named Nagel, an Irishman, and the Bohemians will be persuaded to vote for him. The speaker said <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>that such a German program would give us no privileges at all. He supposed that the Germans would keep faith with us but he was in doubt about it. The Bohemian committee should act very carefully, because some of the Germans will vote for Nagel and others for Feldman, consequently it would be wise for Bohemians to have a candidate of their own, one that possesses the fullest confidence of the people. Such a one is Vaclav Kaspar.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vaclav Kaspar then took the floor and said, "I am elected as a candidate for alderman in the 8th ward, but it is not so easy to win the election as it looks. We have very many Irishmen in our ward. It is possible that in this part of the ward a Bohemian could be elected, but in the west part of the ward the Irish majority is considerable, and as the Irish voters remain united, everything does not look so promising. What relates to me , my family and my business, does not permit me to accept the nomination, because I would be forced to neglect my business."</p>
   <p>Mr. Geringer then spoke: "Today's meeting was called for the purpose of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>finding out if we Bohemians are sufficiently strong in voting power."</p>
   <p>His advice was not to undertake the forcing of our candidate, but to delay in this for the future, and to support this time anybody rather than Lawler. Our first attention should be directed to the removal of Lawler from office, and this could be achieved only by setting against him a very strong candidate, worthy of general confidence. It may be a Bohemian or a German. Bohemian or German we don't want him to lose to an Irishman.</p>
   <p>It would be even more advisable to elect this time a good, honest Irishman if only to defeat Lawler, who is running on the Independent ticket. The question before us should be, should we elect a Bohemian candidate at this meeting or support the German candidate?</p>
   <p>Mr. Chladek could be very useful in helping us to decide this question by telling us, approximately, the number of voters in our ward that are <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Bohemians, Germans, and Irish respectively. Ad. Chladek answered: "In the west part of the ward there are many Americans and only a few Irishmen and they would unite against the Irish candidate, because they dislike the Irish methods of administration. The total number of voters in our ward is about 3,000. Should all the Americans, the better class of Irishmen, the Bohemians and the Germans, unite in our ward, there would be about 1,300 votes for the Bohemian or German candidate. This number of votes would enable the Bohemian or German candidate to win because there would be more candidates in the field and none of them would be able to poll this number of votes. The Bohemian votes amount to about 300."</p>
   <p>Frant Kaspar insisted that the members should not retreat from putting a candidate in the field, but should appoint him at once and at the meeting that was then going on.</p>
   <p>Mr. Patera again asked whether it would be absolutely impossible for Vaclav Kaspar to accept the nomination.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Mr. Chladek brought out the fact of the jealousy that exists between the Irishmen. "There is no doubt," said Mr. Chladek, "that the Irish will have two, three or maybe four candidates in the field. Consequently, we should be able to win with our candidate. This is possible, but it demands hard work. We should canvass from house to house, talk to the voters and persuade them to go to the polls and vote for our Bohemian candidate." Mr. Chladek further contended that Bohemian votes could not be bought for money and that there were no Bohemians of bad character that could be diverted from the Bohemian candidate.</p>
   <p>J. Kralovec said that the committee had done everything that could be done according to its promise and that all Bohemians would be very pleased if their candidate would accept the nomination. The committee was advised to turn its attention to the fact that the whole procedure of election and <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>nomination should not be made public before the suitable time. We have considered Vaclav Kaspar as the only person among us Bohemians to be worthy of representing us honorably in the City Council, and to be supported not only by Bohemians but by other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Vaclav Kaspar took the floor and said: "The committee fulfilled its duty in visiting me. At that time my answer was that it would be impossible for me to accept the nomination. However, since then my countrymen have insisted that I do their will, and since their will is law for me I accept the candidacy. (Stormy and long applause.) I demand, however, that the committee takes care to see that we have numerous and better attended meetings and to find means by which a more serious interest in future election may be instilled in our Bohemian citizens."</p>
   <p>Mr. Geringer pointed out that the Germans were divided into two factions and some of their votes would undoubtedly pass to us, which would make our problem easier. He was of the opinion, however, that it would be <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>a question as to whether we are supported by others.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kostner then said: "We will make a big step forward when we elect today our candidate, even in case he should be defeated. There are very many voters among the different parties and nationalities who would vote for anybody, so long as it was not Lawler. We have gained very much since Vac. Kaspar accepted the candidacy, because he is known as an exceptionally honest man, not only among the Bohemians, but among the Germans and the Irish.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kaspar will gain many German and Irish votes, consequently he has the best chance to be elected."</p>
   <p>Mr. Kralovec paid attention to the fact that we can expect victory if there will be seven candidates on the ticket. He warned the audience that this coming Thursday there would be a joint meeting with the Germans and we must be represented very strongly if we wish our candidate to defeat <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>the German candidate. Everyone should be present. There are always around one hundred Germans at their meeting, and our maximum today is sixty members.</p>
   <p>Mr. Novak was given the floor and said: "We don't need thieves and men of leisure in the City Council. V. Kaspar could have been a member of the Council long ago, but he hesitated to accept the nomination because he is an honest man." (The speaker was reprimanded by some of the members many times because of his discouraging remarks against the candidate.)</p>
   <p>Mr. Svojze then said, "Why should we not nominate a candidate? There is no reason for it. Should our candidate win, it will be all right; should he be defeated, it will be all right too. Win or lose we will gain experience that will be of benefit to us in the future."</p>
   <p>Mr. Suesland thought it was a hard problem to get a candidate. A motion <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>was then passed that on the morrow (Wednesday) a meeting should be held again. Tomorrow's meeting would be a day before the general meeting of Bohemians and Germans. The purpose of the meeting of tomorrow was to gain new members and to be more strongly represented at the joint Bohemian-German meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting adjourned.</p>
