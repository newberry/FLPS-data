   <p>Our sons and brothers are dying upon the battlefields of France. Why? To preserve democratic principles and personal liberty for us and our posterity.</p>
   <p>We, who have stayed behind, should not think that we have done our full duty toward our homeland by buying war bonds and war stamps and by contributing a few dollars to the Red Cross. All this was necessary, but it shows us only from our materialistic side. If this war is to be won, our government must receive moral support also. This we can best accomplish by voting the Democratic ticket, so demonstrating to the German enemy that we stand firmly by our President, Woodrow Wilson.</p>
   <p>Czechs and Slovaks! This coming election is for the Czechoslovak element in this country of much greater significance than we may think. We are not concerned <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>merely with the election of Messrs. Anton J. Cermak and John A. Cervenka and a few state representatives. There is more at stake now: to be or not to be represented in public office in the future!</p>
   <p>This is the first time in the history of Chicago that Czechs have had the opportunity to elect a fellow countryman to the highest office of the County of Cook. No one should think that the ruling clique of the Democratic party recommended Messrs. Cermak and Cervenka out of sheer personal love; this recommendation was wrested from the party by the political strength revealed in the size of the Czech vote.</p>
   <p>Only by concerted action is it possible for us to remain at the crest of political power. Are we capable of doing it now when the opportunity beckons? We have earned this recognition, and it is our duty as citizens to show [that we deserve it] to the other nationalistic groups. Every Czech and every Slovak should, for this reason, appear at the demonstration meeting in the Pilsen Brewery Park pavilion on August 30 at 7:30 P.M. Do not offer the excuse that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the meeting can be held without your being present. If your sons, now in the Army, had spoken like that, we should have been in the Hun's clutches long ago.</p>
