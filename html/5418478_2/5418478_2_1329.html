   <p>There is very little we can talk about today but the enormous losses of human life and national property, and the great disappointments felt by everybody--except people engaged in war-supply business. The war shows no winners and no losers, and it is impossible to foresee what will develop in the near or distant future. That, so far, is the result of a year of murdering, of spilling rivers of precious human blood, and turning human beings into wild beasts....</p>
   <p>What had been the pride of human talent industry, and skill for long centuries has been destroyed by the hand of the modern man in the century of culture and the noblest slogans! What, then, is the lie? The past, or the present? What, then, is the substance of true culture? Yesterday, or today? A question difficult to answer. But one thing is certain: That orgy of destruction that we witness today, and that painfully penetrates all our lives and the lives of all our families, is not and cannot be a manifestation of the creative civilization which the whole human race in general, and our nation in particular, had been <span class="page-break">\2</span>expecting for long centuries.</p>
   <p>Thus, overcome with pain and fully aware of the insecurity, the incalculability of the future, we stand on the threshold of the second year of the war which, we had been assured, could not be long, even must be very short, because of its intrinsic cruelty and technical perfection. In this, the judgment of "experts," the predictions of all the best "prophets," have failed. They have failed us who, being accustomed to depend and rely upon the judgment of great military, and nonmilitary, authorities, were glad to believe that "it cannot last very long".</p>
   <p>Today, after a year, we seem to be farther away from the fulfillment of our dreams than we were a year ago, and it may be possible that we shall have to give them up altogether.</p>
   <p>It does not pay to try to be a prophet in one's own country, but even outside <span class="page-break">\3</span>of one's own country it is impossible to give even a rough indication of when the human race will become sated with the sight of millions of crippled lives of the finest of its youths--its hope, and the foundation of all nations.</p>
   <p>It has been said that the modern man is unable to stand the sight of the gruesomeness of a war without losing his mind. Although the number of those who have lost their minds is growing from day to day, we do not seem to have had enough of the horrors of the war, and there appears to be no hope--not now, at any rate--that the point of our saturation with the sight of hot, red human blood is anywhere in view.</p>
   <p>But one thing has changed during that one year, and that is the situation of our nation. Our nation, naturally, is suffering from the results of this terrible war, but there is one more source of suffering for her; she suffers because of her being Bohemian!</p>
   <p>The lot of Poland, divided among three nations engaged in the war, is truly an <span class="page-break">\4</span>unusual example of a cup of sorrow that has to be drained to the very dregs. There, brother fights brother, father fights son, members of the same family stand against one another with bayonets pressing against one another's hearts in the unfortunate land, over which armies of all colors went from east to west, from north to south, all of them plundering, pillaging, burning and destroying whatever was in their way.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to say, however, that the situation of the Bohemian nation is any better, although it is not now being ruined by passing armies, but who can tell? What is not now, may, God forbid, come tomorrow. Today, after a full year of sacrifice, after having seen the flower of her youth become the target of cannon, after having seen some of her best sons, loath to betray their highest ideals, executed before their admirers and friends, the Bohemian nation is being deprived of her political leaders, who are being shot like worthless animals, or dragged from prison to prison like the worst of criminals.</p>
   <p>Her newspapers, the only true mirror of a nation, are being prostituted by the <span class="page-break">\5</span>old Emperor's censors, and thus show to her own people a perverted, distorted picture of the nation, a perverted distorted portrait of themselves, before their own eyes. Such cruel skillfully executed humiliation is the lot of our nation, fettered hand and foot, after just one year of the war!</p>
   <p>All that, however, is seemingly not enough to make our Bohemian-Americans realize the fatefulness and greatness of these times; all that seems to be not enough to make them realize their duties to their nation, and by the same token to themselves, their families, their children. On the contrary, these times seem to offer to them the proper excuse for their fatuousness, laxity, and inertia.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, this year has shown that there are still some characters of steel in the old country, and that there are still some hearts of gold in Bohemian America. Our people, our small, insignificant people, have proved, quietly and without any personal pomp, that they know how to make sacrifices <span class="page-break">\6</span>for the Bohemian cause, and have made them. Our collections are growing, and even if they are not quite sufficient, they are nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
   <p>But that is really the only pleasant feature of a year of war.</p>
