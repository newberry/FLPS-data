   <p>Rivers of Czech blood have been shed already. Much of this was spilled on the wrong side--in the service of the most vicious enemy of the Czech people. A large amount of it, true enough, has been sacrificed for the best interests of our people and mankind as well.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the blood that sons of the Czech nation had to shed, even against their own better convictions, has not flowed in vain. It will produce new resistance against the German tyrants and murderers, and so help toward the ultimate liberation of our people.</p>
