   <p>It is evident according to the official canvass of votes, that many election judges committed punishable offenses. For instance the official canvas of votes gives Citizen Meilbek 7006 instead of 4200 as turned in by election judges. The election Commissioners left it up to Mr. Meilbek whether he will prosecute the offending judges. According to law this offense is punishable by a fine of One Thousand Dollars and two years imprisonment.</p>
