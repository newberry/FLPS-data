   <p>I have for sale my own lands in Liberty County, Texas, near the City of Houston, on the Frisco [the St. Louis and San Francisco] Railroad. It is prairie land, or rich black soil--ready for the farmer's plow. Countrymen may turn with confidence to a Czech company, which not only helps in the selection of land but can also offer good terms. The Company also has lands in the State of Michigan. Consult the agent, Karel Musil, 2849 West 22nd Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
