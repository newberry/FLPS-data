   <p>Captain Kenney, United States Army, chief recruiting officer of the Chicago area, was indignant about a suggestion made by Josef Siman, warden of the Bridewell. The latter proposes to set free those inmates who are willing to enlist for service in the Army or Navy.</p>
   <p>There are two ways to look at this question. Many a young man was unfortunate enough to land in the "Workhouse" to atone for a minor offense. We can see no harm in his presence in the Army. On the other hand, it might mean a salubrious experience for some worse offender to go through the rigorous drills and regulations of the military service. The service is the main thing, the soldier's civilian record is of secondary importance. Several judges of the Municipal and Criminal Courts have made it a practice <span class="page-break">\2</span>to let off defendants if they promised to enlist.</p>
   <p>One man, who joined the Navy in the manner described above, lost his life in Vera Cruz. His body was brought back with an imposing display of military pomp. Civilian authorities took part in the funeral. Nobody bothered about the dead man's record.</p>
