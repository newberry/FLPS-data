   <p>Any man of sound reason knows and understands that the bloody battles in Europe are not being fought against the German people, but against the mad Kaiser, who has become an acute danger to the entire civilized world. Perhaps, even the German soldiers on the diverse fighting fronts are aware of this as well as their starving relatives at home. If the immigrant Germans, particularly the German-Americans, could grasp this truth they would suddenly become better adherents of their nation and, at the same time, better citizens of their adopted countries. Will they ever arrive at this conclusion? Hardly so. At least the behavior of the German-Americans gives the impression that they see in the Kaiser the symbol of the most beautiful characteristics. Naturally, they do not dare to come out in the open with their opinions, but nevertheless they smell of Kaiserism so that one can scent them from a long distance.</p>
