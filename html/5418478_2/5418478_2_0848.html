   <p>A huge mass meeting is going to be held at the Coliseum tonight. A large number of the people of this city will be there to protest against the pro-German tendencies of the present city administration.....Our great Republic is at war for the rights of the small nations.....</p>
   <p>All Czechs and Slovaks should appear;....our women should come in national costumes.....We Czechs and Slovaks are being relied upon to do our duty, just like other nationalities.....Our sentiment is known, yet we should attest to it again tonight.....</p>
