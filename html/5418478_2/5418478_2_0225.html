   <p>We read in all the newspapers accounts of meetings of the members of the various nationalities, Irish, German, French, Scandinavian, Polish and so on-- but to look for an account of some activity of the Bohemians is useless. The political movement among Chicago Bohemians was never very active, but such careless, suicidal, disinterest as prevails this year we have never yet witnessed. Even though it is high time, we have not had a single Bohemian political meeting thus far, whether Socialists, Democratic or Republican. Then we expect other nationalities to take notice of us, respect us and themselves force us into some office.</p>
   <p>No one takes notice of a vegetative corpse such as we are in regards to politics.</p>
