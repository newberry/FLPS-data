   <p>I am the first Czech farmer to settle here and I have been here for more than twenty-five years. If you come here I will show you my farm. Here I have planted all kinds of grain and vegetables. This will prove to you that nowhere else will you gain so much for your labor as you will here. This is a country for the poor man with little money to help himself to a home. Prices of land are from $7.50 per acre upwards, on ten year payments. Write to John Schauer, representative of Bohemian-American Land Company, Phillips, Wisconsin.</p>
