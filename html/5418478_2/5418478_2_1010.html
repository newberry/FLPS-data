   <p>Henry Ford, well-known apostle of peace, has arrived at the opinion that militarism can be downed by militarism only; he has followed up this change of mind by offering the vast spaces of his factories to England for the manufacture of tractors, without exacting any royalties for the use of his patents. He belongs among those who were for peace, but who are ready for sacrifices when war is on. He does not want to profit by war, as do hordes of greedy sharks who would not hesitate to hurl the populace of the country into a famine to gain fortunes for themselves.</p>
