   <p>There is no use for President Wilson's proclamation that the United States is not declaring War upon the German people, but upon the Kaiser and his henchmen, when the American Germans do not want to comprehend this. The Kaiser is still foremost in their minds. This is openly demonstrated by that local German writer of magnitude, Horace L. Brand, publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. The latter beats the American drum in loyal fashion, true enough, but sighs in between with grief over the declaration of War against Germany, behind which, the paper says, stands the German people just as faithfully as honest Americans stand behind their President and his administration. If editors, intelligent men, are unable to grasp the difference between a democracy and the absolutism of the Kaiser, what can be expected from the average "Dutchman"?</p>
