   <p>The American Agricultural Commission which scoured half of Europe this summer in order to see with its own eyes just how much more advanced than the United States the European nations are in their relations between the government and the farmer, came home a long time ago. Congress has passed a new tariff which was expected to lower the cost of necessities--in the first place, of course, of foodstuffs--to the consumer. Those living in the city were promised cheaper living, and the farmers were told that they would get higher prices for their products. Now we have the lower tariff, and Congress is working on a financial reform. Perhaps the whole winter session will be devoted to debates on ways and means of reforming American banks. All that is very fine indeed, except for the fact that it does not mean a thing to a poor man, or a poor farmer, who struggles because of lack <span class="page-break">2</span>of capital. The gentlemen disregard these two factors, and in spite of all that the Commission--so well wined and dined by everybody in Europe--saw there, not the least effort has been made to put any of what they saw into operation in the United States. The American farmer is still paying the highest interest on his loans, and he does not get a loan except on the best of security. His signature on a promissory note is completely worthless, while the signature of a Jewish peddler is honored.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the call "back to the soil" is heard more and more. No doubt, it sounds beautiful, but thousands of workingmen in overpopulated cities call back: "How can we go there without sufficient capital? Do you want us to starve?" True enough! And how about those farmers who own their land and would like to "grow two ears where one grew before"; who recognize the value of improvements based on the results of agricultural research; who see the way to larger profits, to better service to society by providing it with more and better bread; and whose hands are tied by <span class="page-break">3</span>the lack of capital? How can they undertake anything; how can they try to improve their methods or to eliminate what they have learned to be mistakes, if they have not the necessary capital? A manufacturer or a businessman can buy on credit; his note has a commercial value. A farmer, too, can get credit in his bank, but first he has to have enough with which to buy the credit, because his credit in America is the worst of all. Should he need a somewhat larger amount, he is required to put a long-term mortgage on the whole farm and to pay from six to eight per cent interest on the borrowed money.</p>
   <p>As long as these fetters are on our farming people, all the agricultural schools, magazines, bulletins, and lectures are nothing but wasted efforts. True enough, they do awaken in farmers the desire for improvements, for reforms; but as soon as the farmer tries to take the first step in the right direction, he is stopped by an insurmountable obstacle: lack of the necessary capital.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>What good is it to lure workingmen from cities to vacant land in the country, if they have not the money necessary for farming? Where and how could they have saved any in these days of high living, high rents, high-priced clothes, coal, and every other commodity? In order to live, a workingman has to spend all that he earns. Who is going to lend him enough to get a solid start in farming? Nobody! Supposing, now, that he sticks it out in the country long enough to own his homestead, to be able to put in some improvements, and to keep the most essential machinery in good repair. He may then be offered a loan up to one fifth of the estimated value of his farm. If he accepts the offer, his cares and worries start again. Should there be unfavorable weather and his crops fail, he loses everything--including the farm.</p>
   <p>The American nation has an abundance of land; in fact, it has too much of it. There is sufficient capital with which to buy the land, but there is no working capital. Without that, even the capital that would be available <span class="page-break">5</span>for the purchase of the land must remain idle.</p>
   <p>When, from time to time, voices are heard favoring loans to those who are willing to try to make a start on a piece of new, free homestead land, immediately other voices are raised to the effect that it would be making it too easy for the new farmer--giving him machinery in addition to free land. What of it? That in itself, will not make him rich. He will have to work hard just the same. It is necessary to realize, finally, that a farmer is a workingman whom society has entrusted with the task of raising its bread. The soil as such has no value; its value is commensurate with the work required for its tilling plus the efforts expended to make it productive land.</p>
   <p>Idle land, and land producing, perhaps, only one fourth of what it could grow if properly worked, in accordance with modern agricultural principles, do not make a foundation for prosperity. Prosperity is rapidly disappearing <span class="page-break">6</span>in America, because the equilibrium between producers and consumers has been destroyed, and this relationship is getting worse every day. When the majority of the people were on farms, everything was cheap, in spite of meager crops. Of course, there were also less mouths to feed. But now, with the majority of the people in cities waiting to be fed by the minority out in the country, scarcity of farm produce is natural, and high prices necessarily follow, both here and in Europe. Conditions are much worse in Europe than here; but conditions are bad in Europe simply because nothing else is possible, while here in America the situation could and should be much better than it is. Most of our soil is still unproductive. The United States could feed the whole world if our soil were as efficiently and intensively tilled as that in Germany or in France. But that, of course, under present conditions is quite impossible.</p>
   <p>Our experts are studying the question of how to help the new farmer, the farmer starting on new, virgin soil. We have a few suggestions. In the <span class="page-break">7</span>first place, our government should change its attitude toward the new farmer. So far, the government has felt that it loses by giving away this land; therefore, it has made new settlement difficult, as though the salvation of the country depended on the government's being able to show that it owned so many millions of acres of land. That, of course, is absurd. Only tilled land, land which helps to feed the people, represents real value. The government should, therefore, be helping those who want to undertake the task of feeding the nation, instead of tying down the homesteader so that he is absolutely in its hands. The government holds the whip hand, while the homesteader risks years of hard work on the land together with all his savings he brought from the city.</p>
   <p>A prospector always finds people who will grubstake him. He may find a gold mine. But a man who takes government land and wants to raise food for the people, gets not only no help, but not even credit. Still, he goes after something sure, while the prospector goes after a gamble. The prospector can, and frequently does, run out on his creditor, but let the settler try it!</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Why does the government not use its credit to help settlers? Our capitalists are lending the government hundreds of millions of dollars with which to build canals. They could lend about one hundred million dollars to be used for settling vacant land--land which encompasses most all of our Northwest, running westward from the Mississippi River, and from Canada to Puget Sound. They do it in Canada, and it pays. Think how many Poles have been lured from Galicia to farms in Canada's Northwest! All of them say that from the very start they have been better off than at home in Galicia. In a few years they will be independent, owners of good, well-equipped farms, without debts. If our government would take hold of immigrants coming from agricultural regions of Europe, rights in the port and help them to get nettled on government land in our Northwest--the railroads would be glad to co-operate--we would soon have in America bread, and meat, too, as cheap as it was fifty years ago. We could have in America four times as many cattle as we have now if they were kept as they are in Europe.</p>
   <p>How many immigrants drown, perish every year in the misery of the slums of <span class="page-break">9</span>large cities, in cities where they increase the proletariat and take work away from local workingmen, and spoil their wages. Little wonder they are unpopular and persecuted. Such immigrants are detrimental to America. They just eke out a pitiful existence, and frequently meet with a still more pitiful end. It is just such people as these, from Europe's agricultural areas, on whom the government could build a splendid future for our great empty spaces, and for the whole great American commonwealth. These people would repay every cent loaned them for their start. They could not run away with that money, since they would not get it in cash. It would be put to their credit in banks, to pay for farming machinery, livestock for breeding purposes, seed, grain, etc.</p>
   <p>Some such procedure seems, however, quite impossible in America. After much ado we finally succeeded in forming and sending to Europe a large commission which has come back home. Its members, as long as they live, will keep telling their children what wonderful times they had in Europe; will make learned--and well-paid--speeches about what they saw there; and will write <span class="page-break">10</span>long articles about what they think should be changed and improved in America. That is all that is going to happen...Therefore, all calls "back to the soil," all calls to farmers to start efficient agricultural methods according to European ways, will remain a voice calling in the desert....Everybody knows how to give, and is free with advice, but nobody cares to help.</p>
