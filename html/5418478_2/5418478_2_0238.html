   <p>E. J. Davis, who is one of the leaders of the Illinois Anti-Saloon League, was branded a liar by Alderman Anton J. Cermák in the meeting of the City Council, held yesterday. Alderman Cermák declared: "E. J. Davis lied about me and others. At the last election he sent letters to the voters of the 26th Ward, warning them against radicals who, it is said, are trying to overthrow our government. Mr. Davis should appear here and tell us who these radicals are, otherwise leave this hall as a convicted liar."</p>
   <p>Alderman Cermák spoke these words as the introduction to his resolution asking the appearance of Mr. Davis before the City Council, and there to prove that the statements in his letters are true.</p>
