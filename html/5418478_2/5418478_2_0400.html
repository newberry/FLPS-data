   <p>A meeting, which was presided over by Mr. Anton J. Cermak, was held last Thursday, in which the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign, and other matters in connection with the World War and national activities, were discussed.</p>
   <p>A falling off in bond subscriptions, Mr. Cermak explained, makes it essential that people in our settlement be canvassed again, to find out whether each individual has done his duty one hundred per cent. This is absolutely necessary, to prevent our sinking below the level dictated by duty. Results thus far point to such a possibility.</p>
   <p>Our fellow countrymen should be prepared for calls by our workers, to whom they should show their receipts. If the amount of their subscription corresponds to their financial standing, they will be given a ticket on which 100 per cent is printed in large letters. This will save them from being visited again.</p>
   <p>Those who are still behind in the fulfillment of their duty are invited to appear at the main campaign office of the Czechoslovak section for the Fourth Liberty Loan drive, 3342 West 26th Street, instead of waiting for this call. This is serious business, and we intend to conduct it accordingly.</p>
   <p>Workers were urged to do their utmost to induce people of our settlement to take part in the Liberty Day parade in the largest possible numbers, so that the Czechoslovak section be the largest and most impressive.</p>
