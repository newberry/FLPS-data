   <p>The Czech Milk Dealers' Association filed suit for an injunction against Health Commissioner, Dr. John Dill Robertson, to prevent him from enforcing certain rules concerning the milk business. The bill contends that these rules have no validity since they have not been passed by the City Council, but are of Doctor Robertson's own make. An ordinance passed by the City Council some time ago, the bill reads, regulates the distribution of milk in regard to sanitary requirements sufficiently well so that the health commissioner need not invent regulations of his own, which are nothing but "his hobbies."</p>
   <p>The suit was filed by Attorney Charles A. Churaň in the name of seventy-five complaining Czech Chicago milk dealers, for whom Jaroslav Vítek, <span class="page-break">\2</span>owner of a milk depot, 2644 South Springfield Avenue, signed.</p>
   <p>The system of inspection established by the city ordinance in 1912 provided for strictly sanitary distribution, the milk dealers say. The health commissioner later demanded pasteurization, which is too costly.</p>
