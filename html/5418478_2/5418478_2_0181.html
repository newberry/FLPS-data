   <p>P.1.--Congressman Sabath who is back in Chicago, Congress having adjourned until January 6th, informs us that he has been named on the committee for the regulation of interstate liquor traffic, and also on the committee of immigration and naturalization. He can be of considerable use to our countrymen, and surely no Czech's complaint, of whatever nature, shall be passed up by him now, when he can take almost direct action before the two committees.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath, the only Czech representative in Washington, has taken vigorous steps in the investigation of the plight of our own fellow countrymen who, together with immigrants of other nationalities, are held in bondage by American enterprises in the South. The Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Strauss, himself in a conference, gave the congressman every assurance of his support in this matter.</p>

   <p>During his sojourn in Chicago, the congressman will devote most of his time to the hearing of complaints.</p>
