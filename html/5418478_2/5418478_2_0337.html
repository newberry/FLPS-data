   <p>Chairman Percy B. Coffin of the Civil Service Commission, while making the announcement yesterday that the Commission has not found anything that would justify its discharge of the Bohemian police captain, Jan Ptacek (although this was precisely its aim and purpose) launched an attack on Anton J. Cermak, and the Bohemian aldermen [John] Toman and [Otto] Kerner, and also made disparaging remarks about Bohemian citizens. Mr. Cermak made an immediate reply to this attack yesterday, using the energetic and snappy way so characteristic of his methods. At the same time, he made new accusations maintaining that collections among policemen began to be made immediately after Thompson's induction into office and his administration came into power. Cermak openly suggested that a sign with the inscription "Come Across" should be put above the doors of the City Hall.</p>
   <p>Among other things, Mr. Cermak said: "All I have to say in reply to Percy Coffin, the chairman of the Civil Service Commission, whose slogan is "Pay as <span class="page-break">\2</span>You Enter,' is that he has mentioned not one single fact in support of his statement that I have tried to influence the decision of the commission in the Ptacek case.</p>
   <p>"A few weeks ago, one of the theatrical companies playing downtown put over the entrance to the theater a sign saying 'Come Across'. Since that company has now left town, I propose that the sign be secured and placed over the doors of the City Hall.</p>
   <p>"Yes, the slogan 'Come Across' is the chief characteristic of the Civil Service Commission and the whole City Administration.</p>
   <p>"You can read every day in the newspapers that somebody is trying to bribe somebody else in order to be put on the list of those who have passed successfully the civil service examination. There could be no buyers if such accomodation were not on the market.</p>
   <p>"I should like to ask Chief of Police Healy whether the order 'Come Across' <span class="page-break">\3</span>had been sent to all members of the Police Department when the present administration started, and whether the individual contributions were from fifty cents up.</p>
   <p>"It may help in refreshing the Police Chief's memory when I say that the avowed purpose of these 'voluntary' contributions was to boost the police pension fund in Springfield. Three delegates went to Springfield with $10,000. Where did the money go? The old tale about lawyers' fees it is impossible to use for two reasons: There are no receipts which would prove the payment of such fees, and the City would have used its own lawyers if legal services had been necessary. What has happened to all that money? According to Deputy Chief of Police Schuettler,there is just a little over $700 in the fund now. Where is the balance? It is hard to believe that it could have been spent in Springfield by three men even if they had been living on the very best the country can offer. And, something else: Did not the Fire Department 'Come Across' about the same time?</p>
   <p>"It has been said that Thompson has closed Chicago saloons on Sundays. I <span class="page-break">\4</span>challenge Percy Coffin or anybody he may appoint in his own stead, to accompany me on a tour through Chicago next Sunday, or any other Sunday. I shall show Coffin or his representative more than a thousand saloons which are doing better business on Sunday than they ever did before Thompson closed the saloons."</p>
   <p>When all these accusations made by Mr. Cermak against the City Administration were repeated to Mayor Thompson, a violent attack on Cermak started rolling off his lips, but he stopped dead in the middle of the sentence, thought for a while, and said: "The proper thing for Cermak to do would be for him to make such statements under oath. If he does so, he will see a rapid and ample action. If he does not do so under oath as a public official, he may do so as a private citizen."</p>
   <p>Chief of Police Healey has explained that to help toward the passing of a law beneficial to their pension fund much less than $10,000 has been collected among the policemen. Also, that not three, but nine or ten members of the Department went to Springfield, and that they made several trips to that city.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>He declared that he had no idea of keeping secret anything in connection with that matter because there was nothing in it that would have to be kept secret.</p>
