   <p>The representatives of the heroic brotherly Serbian nation are sojourning in America! They will come to Chicago, the greatest center of Slavs outside of Europe!</p>
   <p>A magnificent reception will be given for them on Sunday, January 27, at the Auditorium, on Wabash Avenue, at 2 P.M. The Governor of the State of Illinois will preside.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vesic, leader of the Serbian delegation, is one of the foremost diplomats of the Allied nations. One of the members of the group is Dr. Sima Lazanic, once a professor at the University of Belgrade. Still another member is General Rasic, famous during the war with Turkey in 1912, and no less renowned in the present war. It was his regiments in particular which struck the hardest blow against the Austrian Army.</p>
   
   <p>It is our duty to appear at the reception in the largest possible numbers in order to prove that we uphold the idea of Slav solidarity, and that we are conscious of our kinship with the valiant Jugoslavs.</p>
   <p>For the central Sokol group:</p>
   <p>Dr. Anton Mueller, Chairman</p>
   <p>M. Brichta, Manager</p>
