   <p>The Czecho-Slav-American Hall was the scene of a lively meeting yesterday of workers for the Red Cross campaign. Mr. O. Kaspar presided. The mood of the gathering reflected that vigorous enterprise which guarantees success. Attorney Otto F. Ring and County Judge Thomas F. Scully were present, besides prominent citizens from the Tenth Ward.....It is to be hoped that still more ladies will enroll as workers and so help our Czech Pilsen district to win a distinguished place in the drive. Apply at the Kaspar State Bank, 19th Street and Blue Island Avenue.</p>
