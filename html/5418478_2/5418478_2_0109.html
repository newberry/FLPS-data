   <p>All expectations of the organizers of the great Democratic demonstration in the Cesko-Slovanska Americka Sin (Bohemian-Slavonic American Hall) were not only fulfilled, but greatly surpassed. It was one of the most successful political meetings of this campaign held in our wards. The huge hall could hardly accommodate the large number of [men and women] voters of the Tenth Ward who came to hear Mr. Robert M. Sweitzer (German) , our candidate for the office of Mayor of Chicago, and a number of other speakers.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Sweitzer....talked about his own past, telling that he is a son of a poor immigrant, and as everybody who was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he had to make a hard fight to keep body and soul together.....He promised to start huge public works in Chicago which will give employment to at least fifty thousand people, and thus help in improving working conditions in this city and speed up the return of prosperity.....</p>
