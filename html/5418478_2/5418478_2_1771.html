   <p>The society of Dental Surgeons of Northwestern University, held their annual clinic, at which, our well-known dentist, Dr. J. Tichy of 1039 S. Kedzie Avenue, played an important part. He lectured on the treatment of tumors and inflammations of the mouth with ozone derived by means of Roentgen rays, accompanying his lecture with practical demonstrations. He also lectured on the treatment of neuralgia, fistula of the gums, and bone decay with ozone. He accompanied his statements with practical demonstrations. Dr. Tichy then demonstrated how it is possible with the use of Roentgen rays to find parts of teeth left in the gums, or broken teeth, thereby simplifying the operation of extraction.</p>
   <p>The lecturer achieved a great success, because his lecture and practical demonstrations were the chief points of interest around which everything else was gathered.</p>
   <p>The clinic was attended by about a thousand dentists from Chicago and other cities.</p>
