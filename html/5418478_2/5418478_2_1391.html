   <p>A peace conference or peace convention was held in our city last Sunday at which many beautiful, enthusiastic, but, alas, so useless, speeches were delivered. It was attended by representatives of some two hundred organizations which are working for the great ideal of peace--permanent peace. In addition to these, there were present some two thousand unattached individuals who were in accord with the program of the sponsors. The meeting adopted, unanimously, several resolutions urging the President to call a conference of neutral nations which would find means to end the terrible bloodshed in Europe. Some of the resolutions contain proposals whose realization is expected to assure permanent peace: The formation of an international court of arbitration for settling all disputes between nations; the establishment of an international congress vested with legislative and administrative powers; the formation of an international police force; partial disarmament, and others. All this is most beautiful indeed. It is worthy of the most ardent co-operation of all those who have the welfare of humanity at heart. But, we are convinced that not even those who delivered the most enthusiastic speeches at the conference, believe that such measures would be in the least effective.</p>
   <p>Human society is sick, it is going through a crisis, and there is nobody who could tell today what turn that crisis will take tomorrow. Today we are neutral; Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, the Scandinavian countries, all are neutral; but all may take to arms and participate in the general massacre tomorrow, the United States not excepted. The European countries seem to have decided which side they would join in case they should participate in the war, while we in this great Republic are not sure which side could compel us to plunge into the mad struggle, the struggle which some believe marks the end of our civilization, and others go so far as to see in it the end of mankind and of the whole world.</p>
   <p>The President of the United States and his administration are trying most sincerely to preserve our neutrality, as well as to bring about peace and assure its duration. But how can they work for peace in Europe when at any moment a situation may arise which would, against our own will, drag us into the war?</p>
   <p>At this time we are in serious entanglements with both warring groups. Either would love to see Uncle Sam fighting with it, but at the same time, both have found it necessary to take steps which may compel him to side against the group which has the greatest need of his friendship and desires it most ardently. It is the craving for profits, it is our capitalists that endanger the success of the peaceful policies of the American Government much more than any pan-Germanic or anti-British tendencies and trends of our population, our public, or our press. In order to be able to sell their goods to the warring nations with a profit greater than they would make in times of peace, our capitalists would think nothing of creating a situation which would lead to a war in which thousands, perhaps millions of American young men would have to risk their lives. Why should American ships be sailing into countries where they are in danger, into countries under blockade, or otherwise unsafe? If one or the other of the warring nations needs something we have and can sell it without a violation of international laws, it should be shipped at that country's own risk. Ships under the American flag should be seeking new trade in South America or Asia, where they now need our goods and where we could open new permanent markets. Germany and Great Britain, after they settle their present affairs, will never need our goods and will again become our chief competitors.</p>
   <p>At the Sunday meeting of our "peacemakers" one of the finest and most enthusiastic speeches was delivered by Hillquit, a New York member of the national committee of the Socialist Party. He said in part that this war cannot be considered a war of patriots, that it is nothing more or less than a war of businessmen. But how does this statement of his tally with the stand taken by German Socialists, that is, those who are considered the most powerful and progressive element in the Socialist movement? We cannot be made to believe that the German Socialist movement (with the possible exception of a few individuals) could become so deluded by the capitalists that it would defend, against its own interests and principles, the interests of those whom, before the war, it considered its archenemy; that it would help kill off its own people, brother proletarians of other countries, if this war were being waged only for business reasons, for the capitalists. By the facts that Belgium has gone to war in defense of its independence; that the Serbians fight only to preserve their liberty and eventually unite all who speak their language, into one nation; that in France the national question has played a more important role than business considerations; that Russia--if it did not bear in mind its own patriotism, the Russian and Slavic interests--would always be looking for friendship in Germany and Austria rather than in England and France, we are convinced that this war is being waged because of greater considerations than business. This is the reason why this war is so cruel, ruthless; why it will go on to the bitter end; why all resolutions and protests of our "peacemakers" are idle talk, and why the most beautiful speeches are wasted breath. If capitalists alone were running this war, they would have seen long ago that they had gone a bit too far, and that it is necessary to turn back before all that made capital what it is, and that made its profits possible, are destroyed; but there is something else here, something that cements all classes of a nation into one whole body and fills them with a passionate determination to continue the fight to the very last.</p>
   <p>There are only two nations in which patriotism has nothing to do with the present war. It is England and Austria-Hungary. Great Britain's existence as a nation has not been threatened. She took advantage of this opportunity to get rid, forever, of her most dangerous business rival, Germany. Austria-Hungary provoked this terrible war against the will of her people and forces them to be slaughtered only to serve the interests of Germany's capitalists and to pave the way to pan-Germanic ends. For that reason there is very little enthusiasm for the war among England's workingmen, and a definite, though still forcefully suppressed, opposition to it in Austria-Hungary.</p>
   
   <p>It is necessary to study most carefully all the motives and interests in this war, before any attempts for peace can be made. Otherwise all the fine speeches and beautiful plans are in vain. For the time being let us stop our capitalists and jingoes from dragging us into situations which are most dangerously threatening, and let us wait with our peace efforts for the time when they will be wanted and needed.</p>
