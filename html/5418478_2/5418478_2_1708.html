   <p>As is known, the Chicago Daily Tribune intends to erect a magnificent building. Plans have been projected and an announcement made for a prize-winning contest. The contest ends October 1. Of the submitted plans which will reach [the judges], the best ones will earn the prizes of $50,000, and $20,000, and $10,000. This competition is an international one, and ten of the best architects in the United States will be asked to submit their plans; each of these ten men will receive a reward of $2,000. Besides the ten plans mentioned, attention will be given to ten others, but the latter will not be permitted to be signed or to have any distinguishable traits by means of which the five-man jury which will pass judgment on the merit of the plans will be able to tell whose work is being judged.....[Translator's note: Mr. Jaroslav Fisher, as secretary of the Jednota Ceskoslobenskych Inzenyru Chicagu (Czechoslovak Engineers Union of Chicago) then gives the various details of the contest as published by the Chicago Daily Tribune.]</p>

   <p>This....ought to stimulate the Jednota, which pays close attention to all such matters as will lead to a sympathetic contact between the Czechoslovak techno-logical circles and the American ones. The Jednota has, therefore, procured all the necessary specifications, photographs, plans, and other needed materials [relative to the above contest], and sent them to the architects of Czechoslovakia, enclosing its own full information concerning the contest. We may there-fore expect to be surprised by seeing among the competing architects some well-known names of our Czechoslovak architects from the old homeland.</p>
   <p>For the Jednota.....</p>
