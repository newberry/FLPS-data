   <p>The Poles of the Fifteenth Ward held a meeting yesterday at A. Nowak's Hall, 1112 North Robey Street. I. B. Palasz, president of the Central Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward, acted as chairman.</p>
   <p>So large was the number of people that came, that many could not get into the hall and had to be turned away. Despite the big crowd, there was order in the hall.</p>
   <p>From the opinions expressed by some in the audience, and from their attitude we are convinced that the Poles of the Fifteenth Ward cannot be deceived by the agitators of the Republican party, a party controlled by monopolists, the A. P. A. [American Protective Association], and other enemies of the people.</p>
