   <p>The Polish Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward is going to participate with all other Polish Democratic organizations in the political parade to be staged tonight in the Fifteenth Ward. This Club will start from Albert Nowak's Hall, 265 West Webster Street, at 7:30 P. M., marching to Milwaukee Avenue and then to Rockwell Street, where it will join the major unit.</p>
   <p>Once again I urge all citizens to take part in this Democratic political demonstration; I am certain that this is not too much to ask. Let us show other nationalities that we are alive and take an active part in politics; the more work we accomplish in this direction, the sooner shall we be able to realize our aims.</p>
   <p>John Krajecki, president</p>
