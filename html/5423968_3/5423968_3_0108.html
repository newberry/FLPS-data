   <p>The strike at the factory of the Monarch Bicycle Company, which was reported in our paper a few days ago, has been settled. The company compromised by agreeing to one-half of the strikers' demands, granting a ten per cent increase in wages instead of the twenty per cent demanded. The strikers have accepted these terms.</p>
   <p>A strike has also been called in the great Aaron tailor establishment, 548 Robey Street, where many Polish girls are employed. The cause of the strike is a recent fifty-cent cut in the girls' wages. Polish girls are warned not to accept employment here in the place of the girls who are striking.</p>
