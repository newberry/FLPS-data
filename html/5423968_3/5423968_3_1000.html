   <p>For the last time before elections, we recommend all the Polish candidates to our countrymen. Mr. Stanley Kunz, of the 16th Ward, should receive every Polish vote. On this one day, the Poles should lay aside all petty hates and prejudices, and help the Polish candidates win.</p>
   <p>In the 33rd Ward, every Polish vote should be given to Mr. Koziczynski. We recommend also the Polish candidates for constable. Vote for a Pole!</p>
