   <p>The Cadets of St. George Society, Group 402 of the Polish Roman Catholic Union of St. John Cantius Parish, at its regular meeting unanimously endorsed Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward and appointed a committee to draw up the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Mr. S. Adamkiewicz is a real American citizen and a true Pole; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the Seventeenth Ward is for the most part inhabited by Poles and therefore its alderman should be a Pole and not a kinsman of our oppressors, who are waiting watchfully for the downfall of the Polish nation; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, in Europe our people are striving for and winning freedom, while here in the land of the free a man of another nationality wants to be our Czar;</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Resolved, That it is time to put an end to the influence of these foreigners and condemn all false Poles who, living at the expense of the Polish workers, betray their own people. We know who they are--we know their names--and later we shall point them out. We promise to help with all our might to elect our countryman, Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz, and we are sure that beginning April 3 we will have two Polish aldermen in a Polish ward.</p>
