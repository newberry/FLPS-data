   <p>Mr. Alex H. Sikorski has been indorsed for the candidacy of Park Commissioner of Portage Park district, by the 39th ward Democratic organization, located at Milwaukee and Crawford Ave. The 39th ward organization is under the leadership of Mr. Leon J. Winiecki, commissioner of Public Works.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alex H. Sikorski is seeking to fill the vacancy on the Park Board which is at present held by Mr. M. S. Szymczak, who is aspiring to the office of Country Treasurer. The Poles in the vicinity of Portage Park have the opportunity to elect this prominent candidate to represent them as Park Commissioner of their district, by combining forces and voting for Alex H. Sikorski.</p>
   <p>The Poles of our district should follow the example set by the Poles of the 39th ward, who indorse Polish candidates for various offices, for instance Szymczak, Orlikowski, Ringa and Sikorski. Since the election of Edmund K. Jarecki to the important office of County Judge, the Poles should realize that this is the ripe and opportune time to take interest in politics.</p>
   
   <p>We Poles have often complained of the poor representation we have. Now it is time to awaken, and join forces with our candidates, as other nationalities do. Let us show them that we also are capable of developing political leadership.</p>
