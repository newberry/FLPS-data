   <p>The Democratic aldermanic convention took place in the Sixteenth Ward yesterday. Although there were certain misunderstandings at the caucus, the convention met without mishap, nominating the incumbent, Mr. Stanley Kunz. This nomination seems to comply with the wishes of a majority of Polish citizens in our ward. Proof of this was the enthusiasm with which the nominee was greeted at the mass meeting last night.</p>
