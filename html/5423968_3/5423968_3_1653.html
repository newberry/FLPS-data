   <p>A meeting sponsored by the regular Republican party of the Seventeenth Ward will be held today, August 29, 1918, at its ward headquarters, Noble Street and Milwaukee Avenue. All local organizations are cordially invited to attend.</p>
   <p>The following candidates will be there to present their platforms: Carl Ringer, candidate for county assessor; Bernard I. Barasa, candidate for judge; Emil Jenish, candidate for county commissioner; John A. Pelka, candidate for clerk of the municipal court; Max L. Kaczmarek, candidate for representative to Congress; and Albert Rostenkowski, candidate for State senator.</p>
   <p>It is expected that in view of the fact that as many as three Polish candidates will speak, the Polish voters will gather en masse and will thus demonstrate that they are deeply concerned over the results of the forthcoming primary election.</p>
