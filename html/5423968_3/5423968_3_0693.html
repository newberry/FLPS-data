   <p>This is an exact copy of the ballot which Mr. Lewis D. Sitts, Republican candidate for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward has been sending to citizens of Polish extraction in this ward for the purpose of gaining their support.</p>
   <p>Citizens! Here you have actual evidence of the depth to which one who has been praised as one of the model aldermen of Chicago can descend. Here you have proof of how low an opinion Mr. Sitts has of the intelligence of the Poles.</p>
   <p>This is not a sample ballot in that it is not an exact copy of the official one, in which the name of Stanley Adamkiewicz is listed. In Mr. Sitts' sample ballot the name of Joseph B. Mc Donough, an Irishman from another ward, is substituted for that of Adamkiewicz, this clearly shows Sitts' intention of befuddling the Polish voters. This is incontestable proof of how ignorant Sitts considers the Poles. To cause further confusion, he inserted in the Socialist column of the ballot a name which is not given in the official ballot.</p>
   <p>Men and women of the Seventeenth Ward! It is up to you to condemn this action the way it deserves to be condemned, that is, by casting your votes tomorrow for Stanley Adamkiewicz and removing Sitts forever from public office.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The article ends by giving an exact copy of the official ballot.]</p>
