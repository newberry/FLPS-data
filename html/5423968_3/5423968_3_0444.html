   <p>Although Dziennik Zwiazkowy is not partial to any political party, and we, its editors are not interested in politics, yet we feel that it is our duty to express our opinion on important matters. In this particular instance we will take up the unjust attacks on President Roosevelt, by politicians of the different political parties, for his cautious and resolute attitude toward the big corporations, and his promise of a square deal for labor unions and the exploited workingmen. In so far as President Roosevelt will not run again for office, no one can accuse us of doing this for the purpose of getting any favors; however, justice demands that we support the man who stands for a good cause and defends it bravely.</p>
   <p>Since Abraham Lincoln and Garfield, we have had no President who would dare to fight so valiantly and so persistently for the rights, of the people, against heartless exploiters of the working class and supporters of modern slavery. President Roosevelt, as a citizen of noble character, did not hesitate to challenge the powerful trust magnates, and for this reason he is so ferociously assailed.</p>

   <p>The thunderbolts are striking from all sides. His former enemies and alleged friends, especially the candidates for Presidential office are accusing him shamefully of plunging the country into financial ruin by his politics and antitrust measures. They are charging him with giving protection to labor unions, which are lowering the morale of the working classes who dare to demand from their employers an equal share of the profits. These malicious accusations are falsehoods spread consciously by American magnates and political demagagues. The public feels that an injustice has been done because of the concentration of great wealth into a select few powerful trusts. The public knows very well that the financial crashes are not caused by President Roosevelt, but by the big stock speculators and bankers; therefore, the workingman has a perfect right to demand an equal share of the profits which he helped to create. The millions created by working men are acquired by clever speculators.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt is not propagating anarchy, neither is he instigating the animosity of the ignorant masses against the rich as he is accused of doing by the politicians, but is desirous of giving all, labor unions, corporations and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>private citizens a square deal; he does not want people to rob themselves. Only a good citizen, not a politician or a grafter, is capable of such noble deeds. His adversaries are trying to blacken his good character in the eyes of the people, but they will not succeed, for the majority of the people see him in the true light, and praise him very highly for the righteousness and courage he displays whenever necessary, for the good of the people. President Roosevelt will go into history as one of the finest and most noble man.</p>
