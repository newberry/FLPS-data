   <p>They typesetters who left the printing firm of the old exploiter Dyniewicz talk about the conditions which are going on in this dark hole. For many years Dyniewicz has steadily held back several weeks' pay, so that in this manner he could have on hand a greater circulating capital without paying any interest for money borrowed from the typesetters. When they asked for their pay he answered: "Who cannot wait, can look for work somewhere else."</p>
   <p>But for all of that, Mr. Dyniewicz is very religious. He edits a Catholic newspaper, goes to Church, whether it is necessary or not, and occupies himself by inculcating principles of the holy faith into his employees</p>
   <p>Only one Catholic principle he does not know anything about, namely, the one which speaks about "holding back the pay of servants and workers." Dyniewicz would rather roast in the hell he likes to talk <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>about so much rather than agree to the above mentioned principle of Christianity. When yesterday he espied the strikers, he called upon God to punish those "rogues who, by his good heart had been made into men and are now showing their gratitude towards him by downing their tools during hard times."</p>
   <p>Whether Mr. D. made men out of them we do not know. We only know that from their hard work he collected a considerable fortune for himself, which he is steadily increasing, placing it on a mortgage of nonsense in the Gazeta Polska.</p>
