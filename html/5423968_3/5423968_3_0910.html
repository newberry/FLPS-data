   <p>We expect that our Sergeant Ludwig Kroll shall receive the position of police lieutenant; and the present lieutenant Jos. Potczynski, who plays an active part in various Polish affairs, such as bringing about the erection of the Kosciuszko monument and others, may receive the rank of captain.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kopyto, captain of the city fire department should become fire-marshall. Shall our hopes be disappointed? That wholly depends on <span class="page-break">2</span>Judge La Buy, Mr. Kowalski, Kiolbassa, etc.</p>
   <p>If they shall achieve anything for the Poles, it will aid them and it will be of some advantage to us; but if not - then they and their political party shall be forgotten at the time of election.</p>
