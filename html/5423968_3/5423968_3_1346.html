   <p>The first Polish political club is now being organized in the vicinity of Main St. Citizens, hearing of this, went there and were told by well known speakers of fine reputation they would make themselves and their magistrates known. Every one present was glad to hear it and willing to do his share.</p>
   <p>This way we shall be able to have this political club organized. Every Pole living in this neighborhood is invited to our large meeting which is held frequently.</p>
