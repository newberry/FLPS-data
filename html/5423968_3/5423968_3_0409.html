   <p>Capitalism has driven thousands of women into houses of ill-fame and thousands of men to vagrancy.</p>
   <p>Capitalism has violently murdered millions of people in order to fill the pockets of private persons with money, because they did not even install safety devices.</p>
   <p>Capitalism changed the independent farmers into renters of farms which are controlled by large corporations, and the working man it changed into slaves of work which they cannot find.</p>
   <p>Capitalism has forced millions of frail children into the cotton mills in order to grind their young years of life into the profits of some parasite, just because the children are forced to work for small wages.</p>
   <p>Capitalism has forced all nations into debt, out of which they cannot <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>extricate themselves. It did that for the sole purpose of keeping armies with which it could conquer foreign lands for the profit of the captains of industry, or industrialists.</p>
   <p>Capitalism has caused the premature death of millions of men, women, and children, and compelled them to lead a hopeless life in the struggle for the daily bread.</p>
   <p>Capitalism has forced into work six million American women and left six million men in poverty, because the women work for less, which, of course, brings more profit to the capitalist.</p>
   <p>Out of these profits the capitalist later pays for the degradation of women who do not have enough money to support themselves and must sell their love.</p>

   <p>Capitalism has stripped life of its beauty and pleasure. Capitalism has brought up many people in ignorance and superstition. Capitalism destroyed the vital sap of the earth, has filled nature with sickness and filled her with ugliness.</p>
