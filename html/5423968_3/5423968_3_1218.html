   <p>The newly organized Bryan and Altgeld Silver Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward held its second meeting on Sunday, September 6.</p>
   <p>Over one hundred new members joined at this meeting. The secretary elected at the first meeting resigned, so Mr. Thomas Malinger was elected secretary in his place.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the Club will be held on Thursday, September 10, in Mr. S. Sniegocki's Hall, at the corner of Leavitt and Hamburg Streets. All Polish voters in the Fifteenth Ward are invited to this meeting, as there is much work for us before the elections.</p>
