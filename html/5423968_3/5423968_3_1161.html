   <p>The St. Chester's Young Men's Fraternal Aid Society, numbering almost three hundred members, unanimously endorsed endorsed Stanley Adamkiewicz for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward and appointed a committee to draw up the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, political harmony has been established in the Seventeenth Ward, where in spite of the fact that the population is almost entirely Polish a man of another nationality has been alderman long enough; and,</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Mr. S. Adamkiewicz is a real American citizen, a real Pole, and a member of our organization who has helped us at every step.</p>
   <p>"We, members of the St. Chester's Fraternal Aid Society, unanimously resolve to endorse Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward and promise to help him to the best of our ability in order that this Polish ward may have a Polish alderman instead of some man of another nationality. We express our scorn <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for those who are working for a stranger rather than for their own man.</p>
   <p>Committee: J. Smoczynsk, W. Podgorski,</p>
   <p>S. Pitera, F. Zmarzlinski, J. Pociask,</p>
   <p>P. Kaszluga, W. Szyrszen, J. Korczynski,</p>
