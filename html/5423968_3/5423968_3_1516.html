   <p>Among the Polish candidates seeking election, two were defeated and three were victorious.</p>
   <p>The two defeated candidates were Mr. Kiolbassa and Mr. Czekala; the two candidates elected to the State Legislature were Mr. J. Helminiak and Mr. M. J. Novicki, while Mr. F. Palt was elected county commissioner. These last three are members of the Z. N. P.</p>
   <p>We are wishing Mr. Helminiak, Mr. Novicki and Mr. Palt success in their new offices, and we feel sure that they will remember their fellow brothers in the future as they have before they were elected.</p>
