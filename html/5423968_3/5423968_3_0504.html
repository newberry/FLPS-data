   <p>Every public servant, every individual who is of good will and wishes his society success and happiness should have as his one aim the propagation of propaganda for common peace within his own group.</p>
   <p>This kind of propaganda should be carried out above all by every true journalist who is concerned about common good.</p>
   <p>The person who looks upon our activity with an unbiased point of view must admit that we have accomplished as much as others in the direction of quieting the struggles within our society through earnest work, peacefulness, gentleness and temperance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>However, it is apparent that the decisive hour for the culmination of this peace has not arrived.</p>
   <p>After a period of relative peace amid our ranks, the Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily) brought an end to it, and now with each passing day stormy clouds are beginning to appear on our horizon.</p>
   <p>Bad forces and social enemies, concealed at the bottom of our society, began their underground work and shortly afterwards appeared on the surface. Unhealthy symptoms in the womb of our society began to germinate; brawls became triumphant; partisan disputes began to be sowed here and there. Like toadstools, satirical and dynamic papers began to sprout from the ground to combat religion and social order.</p>
   <p>All these enemies are not truly in a position to wreck or even to move from its place the pillars built by St. Peter [reference to the Roman Catholic <span class="page-break">3</span>Church]; they will find with each passing day that their arrogance will force the most loving guardians of peace to fight. Patience and forbearance are virtues only to a certain degree.</p>
   <p>Evil once and for always must be branded as evil in order not to permit it to pass in a quackish way as something good. Offensiveness must be removed; the boils must be cauterized with a hot iron. Therefore, in view of the present day unbridling of the polemic and the dynamic press, there should be freedom in organizing more energetically, and a sharper stand should be taken against this scandalous attitude of our enemies.</p>
   <p>Through constant condemnation of these scuffles we will ultimately arrive at common peace. But in the present instance we must arrive at this point through a struggle.</p>
   <p>Under certain circumstances a struggle is a necessity. Peoples loving peace <span class="page-break">4</span>the most must be prepared, as in the past, to fight for their welfare. The same holds true in national principles. When these maxims are threatened all else must be forsaken in order to defend them.</p>
   <p>In our small political society such a struggle is more necessary than anywhere else. Loud talk always seems to make an impression with us. The masses are more apt to believe the one who harangues the loudest.</p>
   <p>Because of this it is not always safe for us to shut ourselves off from the most loathsome, slovenly and stupid persons and remain silent. Some, in the presence of brutality and scandalous clamor of our enemies, would consider this silence a weakness.</p>
   <p>These few words should clarify our position in this direction; if need arises, as in the past so in the future, we must earnestly step out against the defamers of the people and the destroyers of the society we are building.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The time has arrived to suppress this subversive activity by judicious words and by words of condemnation.</p>
   <p>The anarchy of word and thought must be branded; chaos of comprehension should be untwisted; false prophets must be unmasked.</p>
   <p>The quintessence of our people's existence is: its faith, its morals, and its nationality.</p>
   <p>We will always stand in defense of these principles, as we have in the past. The wild attacks of the agitators against our society, the enemies of our religious and national ideals will be handled sternly through our faith and by force, without pompous ceremony and sans the aid of lies and distortion of facts as is practiced by our foes.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we are of the hope that evil, as has always existed, will be <span class="page-break">6</span>done away with....The surge of scandal must subside. Checked by the rock of religion and love for the fatherland, the undesirable currents will withdraw from our shores. The light of peace will begin to glisten, and after these gloomy apparitions of evil will have disappeared only a memory will remain.</p>
