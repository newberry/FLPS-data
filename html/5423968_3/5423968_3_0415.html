   <p>Hell exists in every working man's home because misery and hunger lead to dissension, quarrels and crime.</p>
   <p>Heaven exists in the homes of the capitalists and the priests because there is abundance and luxury.</p>
   <p>People! Look at the bees and see how equally they share the fruits of their labors after delivering their honey into one beehive. When winter comes they do not suffer want, for there is an abundance of food for all of them, because the wings of the drones, who did not care to work in summer time, have been clipped and they have been thrown out. Can we not follow the example of the bees by throwing out at the election the drones who eat the honey collected by us and who let us suffer hunger?</p>

   <p>Therefore, I am asking you, working people, Are drones more numerous than bees? Let the bees clip the wings of the drones at the election box and they will be exterminated forever. They will lose forever the heaven created by the hard labor and the sweat of the working man's brow.</p>
