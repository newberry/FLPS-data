   <p>"If that Pole beats me next Tuesday, I'll move out of the county," Righeimer.</p>
   <p>Francis Borrelli, candidate for municipal judge, and Frank Righeimer, candidate for county judge, met a certain gathering of lawyers in downtown Chicago. They were discussing politics, and in the course of the conversation County Judge Righeimer expressed himself to Borrelli in these words: "If that Pole beats me next Tuesday, I'll move out of the county. I don't want to live here then." Not a bad thought at all of Mister Judge and we advise you to prepare now for "moving" and not wait until tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Righeimer expressed himself in these same words to Congressman Kunz when they met in a downtown hospital. Only while speaking to Kunz Righeimer did not call Jarecki a "Pollack," knowing that there is no "foolin'" with "Stanley." Kunz just like Borrelli, advised Righeimer to "shove off" further today and not wait for tomorrow's election results.</p>
