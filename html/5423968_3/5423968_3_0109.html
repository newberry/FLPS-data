   <p>Two Poles, F. Chylinski and A. Zaglinski, visited our editorial rooms this morning and asked us to announce that a strike has been called at the Monarch Bicycle Company factory, Halsted and Fulton Streets.</p>
   <p>About two hundred workers, among whom there are about eighty Poles, have gone on a strike.</p>
   <p>The strike has been called because the management of the factory refuses to agree to the just demands of the workers, who ask for a return to the old scale of pay, which was reduced in July, 1895, at the end of the season.</p>
   <p>We bring this to the attention of the Poles in order to warn them not to accept employment from this company, if they do not wish to suffer and earn the shameful name of scabs.</p>
