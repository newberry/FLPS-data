   <p>Our citizen Vincent J. Jozwiakowski is seeking re-election for the aldermanic office, an office which he has held faithfully for the last two years. During his term he built himself a good name as a man of social standing, trustworthy and one of integrity. Even the organizations of other nationalities are supporting him in the coming election.</p>
   <p>He was a reliable member of the Choir of St. Stanislaus for many years, at present he is an honorary member of this organization.</p>
   <p>He was a great help to the youngsters of this parish, while an honorary member he approved of sports, athletics and different kinds of amusement, and was liked by them all.</p>
