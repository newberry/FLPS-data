   <p>In a house at 484 Noble Street can be found a nest of Polish anarchists and the printing shop of the Socialist rag, The Worker.</p>
   <p>Just what these Polish Socialists want, they probably do not know themselves. They will not discover another America, nor create an empire with their perverted ideas, they can only bring disgrace on all the Poles.</p>
   <p>Instead of playing at Socialism they should turn to honest labor, for such brotherhood and division of property as they dream of will never be possible.</p>
   <p>God did not give the pig horns.</p>
   <p>There are the poor and the rich; the wise and the ignorant and it will remain thus to the end of the world. There is no lack of fools and ne'er do wells. The police were watching the workers' quarters and wanted to be present at the meeting, but they were turned away. Why?</p>
   <p>If the things discussed were regarding the welfare of the working man, it would not be necessary to turn them away. To discuss one's welfare or poverty is no disgrace and need cause no fear of the police.</p>
   <p>It is evident that these gentlemen wanted to discuss forbidden fruit, therefore, the police were not welcome. It would be better for our community if all the Polish Socialists and anarchists were herded together on some unpopulated island, there to create their kingdom.</p>
