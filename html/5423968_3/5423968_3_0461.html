   <p>Yesterday there was a meeting of the socialistic groups, in the Settlement Hall, at which plans were discussed cohering celebrating the labor holiday. After the discussion it was decided to call a mass meeting on the evening of May 21st in the University Settlement Hall, located at the corner of Noble and Augusta Streets. Songs declamations and music will be rendered. Every Polish comrade who works on May Day should donate his pay for that day to the Dziennik-Ludowy as this paper is opposed to capitalism.</p>
