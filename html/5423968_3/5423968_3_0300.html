   <p>The state and federal authorities have started this year wholesale arrests of bolsheviks lurking in our large and small cities. Evidently, the American bolsheviks were not aware of the drive against them because thousands of them fell into the hands of justice. This drive reveals very interesting particulars.</p>
   <p>The authorities have found our from the names and the addresses of those arrested, that the herds of the bolshevist movement in America are Russian and Polish Jews. A reprinted photo, with an inscription at the top reading, "Types caught in the raids," gives the names of Bessie Liavoski and Paul Montenski, arrested last night by federal agents on the Northwest Side.</p>
   <p>An American not well acquainted with the European situation and not knowing how to tell nationalities from the physiognomy, would think that they are Poles, because their names end in "ski" In reality they are typical Jews from Poland or Russia.</p>

   <p>You cannot find any better Jewish faces than the ones presented in the above illustration.</p>
   <p>Evidently, the Jews take is for granted that the Americans are very naive, because Mr. Maclay Hoyne, the state's attorney, has informed the American public through the Chicago Tribune that most of the arrested bolsheviks are Russians and Poles. Mr. Hoyne is an American of Jewish descent, who protected the Jews at the cost of the Poles. We all know that the Poles are not inclined towards Bolshevism and most probably Mr. Hoyne knows all about it; yet, he is covering up the fact that the majority of the arrested bolsheviks are Jews from Russia or Poland. This is can be proved by the above illustration.</p>
   <p>All Polish organizations should protect very energetically against such abuse of Poles. Such a man as Mr. Hoyne, occupying a high public office, should not be allowed to lie publicly.</p>
