   <p>Through the efforts of Mr. Peter H. Schwaba, Mr. Michael Dominowski, and several other citizens of the Avondale district the Milwaukee Avenue streetcars now stop at Central Park Avenue. Prior to the passage of the new city ordinance the above-mentioned streetcars had failed to stop at the most important street in Avondale. This failure forced near-by residents to walk either to Monticello Avenue or to Allen Avenue. Attorney Schwaba, the present candidate for the office of representative in the Illinois legislature, and Mr. Dominowski, candidate for State senator, working in co-operation with the city council transportation committee, succeeded in bringing about this necessary change in the operation of the surface lines. They were aided considerably in this by Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz of the Seventeenth Ward and by Mr. Max Adamowski of the Twenty-eighth Ward.</p>
