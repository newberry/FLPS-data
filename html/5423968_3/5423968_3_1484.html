   <p>Of the Polish candidates, those for the state legislature were most successful in yesterday's election. Three were elected: Mr. A. Rostenkowski, J. A. Trandel, and J. Remus. We shall therefore have four Poles in the legislature.</p>
   <p>Polish candidates had a worse time of it in the municipal and county elections, in which the Democrats were victorious. Only four Polish candidates were successful; E. K. Jarecki and S. S. Walkowiak were elected municipal judges and A. Nowak and T. Kasperski were elected county commissioners, the latter having served before.</p>
   <p>In congratulating those elected yesterday on their victory, it is difficult for us not to express the hope that these citizens and countrymen will remember they owe their success chiefly to the Poles and should therefore look after our affairs first.</p>
   <p>To the defeated candidates we send, instead of expressions of condolence, the wish that although they were not successful yesterday they may be successful tomorrow. Politics is like war, one day this side attacks, the next day the other side.</p>
