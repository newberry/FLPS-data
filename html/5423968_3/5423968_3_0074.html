   <p>The newspapers of Boston Mass. lack adequate words of praise, when complimenting Mr. John Romaszkiewicz past commissioner of the Polish National Alliance, and Mr. Andrew Sadowski for - their voluntary intervention, and final solution, of the textile workers strike at Ludlow Mass.</p>
   <p>These two gentlemen were prompted to intercede only, because of the great suffering of the striker's families. At first, they appealed to the Governor, then to the owners of the mills. A settlement was finally agreed upon, after both parties were prevailed upon to peacefully arbitrate.</p>
   <p>Mr.Romaszkiewicz and Mr. Sadowski have crystallized a settlement, and brought to a peaceful end a strike which might otherwise have ended in bloodshed and economic ruin. These men are deserving of great praise.</p>
