   <p>Lemont, June 13. A coroner's inquest was held today into the murder of Gregory Kiszka by persons employed by the contractors. According to the testimony of witnesses, it was undoubtedly a cold-blooded murder, entirely unprovoked by the strikers.</p>
   <p>Coroner McHale of Cook County presided....</p>
   <p>Witnesses testified that Kiszka and a few other strikers were walking toward Romeo, there to meet with other strikers to discuss possibilities of returning to work. As they passed the place at which subcontractor Locker's men were working, fifteen or twenty men, armed with rifles, fired at them. The strikers were unarmed, and it must. be added, were several hundred yards away from the place at which the work was being done. As the strikers fled, their attackers, mostly Negroes, pursued them, killing and wounding those within range of their rifles. Kiszka hid in some bushes. One of the pursuers, evidently their leader, ran up to the hidden man and fired from a distance <span class="page-break">\2</span>of not more than four feet. Anthony Kozminski, a witness, testified that the man fired at Kiszka from a distance of only a few feet. Upon request, he described the murderer as a powerfully built man with red hair and whiskers. As Kozminski described him, a murmur arose in the room; a number of people knew such a man. Someone wrote his name on a piece of paper and handed it to the coroner. After reading it, the coroner conferred for a moment with Supervisor Weimar and then resumed the hearing. Among the other witnesses who testified were Mrs. Kiszka, and Hettinger, another striker. Martin Dorch, a deputy sheriff of Will County, whose duty it had been to keep watch on the strikers, was also called to the stand. While his testimony showed that he desired to defend the contractors, he made several compromising statements. He said that he warned the strikers to stay away, for the contractors had armed their men. He admitted also that Matthews and the contractor Locker, carried guns, and had a band of armed men. As the strikers passed, the band attacked them. Dorch himself remained on the sidelines, but Attenhouse, another deputy sheriff, assisted the attackers and even figured in the arrest of forty-seven striking workmen.</p>

   <p>The coroner continued the inquest until Friday, on which day the persons accused of the crime will be called to the stand. Anyone who fails to appear will be arrested.</p>
   <p>It is certain now that the name of Kiszka's murderer is known. The evidence against him is so clear that he should be arrested any day.</p>
