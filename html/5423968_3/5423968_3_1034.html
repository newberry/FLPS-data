   <p>Citizens! Last year the Democratic party suffered defeat. The party split, and those who caused it are responsible for the defeat of the Democratic candidates.</p>
   <p>This defeat has been especially felt by the Poles of the 16th Ward. How much did the Poles lose in the city as a result of this? Who were elected because of this division in ranks, and who was the principal factor in this break? Every Pole of the 16th Ward knows that it was John J. Dahlmann, the same person who last year supported a German candidate and calls himself a German.</p>
   <p>Who opposed the candidacy of Stanley Kunz for alderman, and who blackened his character before the eyes of all Chicago Poles? Everyone knows that it was John J. Dahlmann!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Last year he wore a German robe upon his shoulders; this year he has donned a Polish one. Yes, this same John J. Dahlmann! Today he dares to appeal to the Polish people to support him, in spite of the fact that he did them the most harm last year, when he tried various methods, both good and bad, to defeat the Polish candidate for alderman.</p>
   <p>Does he deserve the support of the Poles whom he tries to wheedle by fine words? He deserves such an exemplary lesson for his two-faced front that both sides should refrain from giving him their votes!</p>
   <p>He is running as an independent candidate for alderman. Take heed, dear Poles, lest this be another of his maneuvers to split the vote of the Democratic party. On the regular Democratic ticket there appears the name of a Polish Candidate for a higher office, that of West Town Collector. This name is that of the honorable citizen August J. Kowalski whom the Poles of this section should elect. If all of you do not vote the regular Democratic ticket, another cloud of uncertainty will prevail and the Democratic party will suffer the stigma of defeat, as it did last year. On this regular Democratic ticket, the name of Peter J. Ellert who is <span class="page-break">\3</span>running as a candidate for alderman, will also be found. He says, "Peter J. Ellert is my name. I do not wish to make the claim that I am a Pole among the Poles and a German among the Germans. I openly say to both groups that I am German; however, I believe in equal rights to all citizens. I acknowledge and support the demands of the Poles to support their candidate and fellow countryman, August J. Kowalski, to be elected to the aldermanic chair, for which the Democratic party has nominated him. I ask, in good will, both the Poles and Germans to support the regular Democratic ticket in the coming election."</p>
   <p>"Do you Poles judge that the Democratic party will deny your demands if you will not support the regular candidate? Do you judge that your benefits will be denied if you will support such independent candidates as wish to create another split in the Democratic ranks? Certainly not! If you wish to share the benefits of the Democratic party, then you should support the regular Democratic ticket to make certain the election of your fellow countryman for West Town Collector. In this respect, your vote will perform a twofold purpose: victory for the Democrats and defeat for the one <span class="page-break">\4</span>who has worked against our interest and yours in the last election. Polish citizens, I ask you to make this possible by placing a cross in the circle preceding the word Democratic, and in this respect you will be voting a Regular Democratic Ticket upon which is found the names of August Kowalski for West Town Collector, and Peter J. Ellert for Alderman."</p>
   <p>Signed by Peter J. Ellert.</p>
