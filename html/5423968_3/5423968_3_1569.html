   <p>The unanimous victory of the Republican party in yesterday's city election has become an established fact. (sic) Swift and the entire Republican ticket are enjoying an unexpected victory with a plurality of 41,000 votes. In the city council the Democrats lost eight posts while the Republicans gained the same number. This defeat is very injurious to the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>From the general point of view, it is not necessary to grieve over this matter to any extent, nor is it necessary to go into detail about the cause of this defeat.</p>
   <p>In politics, as in life, one is on top today and on the bottom tomorrow. Dominance in the political arena is not so much decided by the success of gaining office as by the value of the cause that is being fought for. The two recent defeats of the Democrats can be easily discounted by recollecting the not-so-distant victories of 1893 and 1892, and there is hope of another victory in the near future. The cause of this and the previous defeat was the false assumption by the masses that the prevailing hard times have been caused by the Democratic administration.</p>
   <p>The misconception of this outlook has been touched upon many times. But from time to time facts are necessary in order to convince the masses that it is their mistake, and that they have taken the wrong road.</p>
   <p>For our part, untouched by the momentary misconceptions, we will support the Democratic party as always, including its platform, which greatly favors the people and the needs and desires of those seeking freedom.</p>
   <p>The thing that really hurts us is the fact that some of our compatriots have leaned toward the Republican party. This movement is injurious to us and interferes with Polish interests. This is especially true in Chicago, for the Poles will lose many city offices and city jobs, not to mention the loss of political influence. Every Pole who voted for the Republicans yesterday has helped to whip himself--and his fellow countrymen. This loss will be evidenced within the near future, and then our eyes will be opened--but it will be too late.</p>
   <p>The second sad revelation is the lack of our national solidarity. The Polish candidate in the Sixteenth Ward did not get all the Polish votes--that is why he was defeated. The German candidate got all the votes from his side and was victorious. Result: loss of a Polish alderman. This loss was caused by the Poles alone, and we are filled with shame.</p>
   <p>In another ward, numbering less than a thousand Polish votes among the eight or nine thousand in the ward, a Polish Populist aldermanic candidate, who did not have the slightest possibility of winning, took away a few hundred Polish votes from the Democratic party which would have been very beneficial to the Poles; in this way we have helped along the Republican victory, although we would like to believe it was through involuntary action on the part of our own countrymen.</p>
   
   <p>These are the results of our immaturity in city politics, for which we will pay dearly in the near future.</p>
   <p>So much for the election results. Besides this, the civil service reform bill passed. A special article covered both sides of this issue recently. Once again we wish to point out that for the time being this resolution is also disadvantageous to the Poles.</p>
