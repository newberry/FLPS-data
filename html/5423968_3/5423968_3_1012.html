   <p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, is the last day and the last opportunity to register. Those who have not as yet registered are urged to do so tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Attention is called to the citizens that the Republicans are resorting to various tricks in order to hinder registration, for they are aware of the grave defeat they are facing if everyone takes part in the election.</p>
   <p>Last week, at many registration offices, the election officials (judges and clerks) conducted themselves contrary to the law. Undoubtedly, they will try to make things as difficult tomorrow. It is not necessary to be duped by their tactics. We beg everyone that has not as yet registered to do so and to pay particular attention to the following information.</p>
   <p>Here and there an election judge may demand to see the citizenship papers of the person who wishes to register, and if the person has lost the papers and cannot produce them, he is sent home. This is illegal. According to the law, a person losing his papers can register if he takes an oath that he is a citizen and gives the name of the place where he received his papers. According to this law, every citizen has a right to register, regardless of what the judge may say.</p>
   <p>Another important thing to bear in mind is that, according to the law, if a person enters a place of registration before 9 P.M., he must be registered, even if the place is crowded and he has to wait until after nine o'clock. The election judges have no right to turn away the people who are already in because it is past nine o'clock; they must accommodate everyone, even if it takes half an hour or one hour longer.</p>
   <p>Some of the registration officers say that when they asked many Poles where they came from and whether they spoke Polish, they invariably said that they were from Prussia and spoke Prussian. This would be hard to believe, had it not come from reliable sources. It is certainly deplorable. A Pole who calls his beautiful Polish language Prussian, disgraces himself. It is to be hoped that this will not happen again.</p>
