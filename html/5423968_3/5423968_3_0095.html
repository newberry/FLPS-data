   <p>The following is a report of collections made in the Bridgeport district for the strike victims of Hazleton, Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>S. Buszkiewicz and C. Pacholski collected $31.52; Kuffel and Konczol, $26.59; and Jacob Zimny, $22.75. A collection taken at a meeting held on September 15 brought $12.50. This makes a total of $93.36 collected thus far.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to the public for its co-operation.</p>
   <p>Apologies are made for not submitting this report sooner; however, one of the collectors brought in donations only this morning.</p>
   <p>Since the list of donors is too long it would be awkward to have it submitted for publication in Dziennik Chicagoski. The names of all contributors are <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>kept on file and may be seen at the Adam Mickiewicz Library, 906 West 32nd Street. The books are open for inspection at any time. In the event contributions are not registered in the books, the collector or collectors will be tried by the courts.</p>
   <p>All the money collected thus far will be turned over to the Central Committee of Hazleton, Pennsylvania.</p>
