   <p>It is not surprising that we have our enemies. Everyone who defends goodness and truth, everyone who has certain principles, fights in their behalf and does not know how to favor all factions nor how to sit upon two chairs, must have enemies; and it did not surprise us in the least that we also have them. But we know how to respect an enemy who, in his support of opposing principles, fights honorably and does not seek refuge in childlike and immature underhandedness, and especially the one who, according to his understanding, fights pro publico bono (for the general welfare) and does not endanger public affairs by his battle. On the other hand, we shrug our shoulders in sympathy when we note that someone, in order to spite us, pays no heed to whether he acts justly, and consider that he does not really serve the public cause as he should.</p>
   <p>In last Friday's Telegraf and in Saturday's New Life we read a statement which we print here verbatim:</p>
   
   <p>"A Call to the Polish Political Clubs in Chicago</p>
   <p>"Prompted by the idea of consolidating the political strength of the Poles toward a single purpose and with a conscious plan of action, the undersigned temporary committee turns to the worthy clubs with the following statement:</p>
   <p>"Taught by experience we are aware that as long as our strength is not consolidated, is not welded into one single unity, we will be unable to develop toward anything. Nothing further that the best and easiest means of promoting recognition and significance for our nationality is by sincere interest in the politics of this country which has accepted us so hospitably, the undersigned committee has decided to propose the creation of a National Political League. This league is to be composed of individual political clubs, in the city of Chicago as well as throughout the State of Illinois. Wishing to effect this unity, the undersigned committee asks the presidents and secretaries of the individual clubs to call special meetings of these clubs during the forthcoming week and to select delegates at this special meeting, at the ratio of one to every twenty-five members. These delegates should come on Sunday, July 24, 1892, at six o'clock in the afternoon, to 137 Monroe Street (corner of Clark).</p>
   <p>"The secretaries will please forward to the secretary of the committee, Mr. M. J. Szameit, 137 Monroe Street, the lists of the delegates, before Wednesday, July 20, of this year. At this meeting a permanent committee will be chosen and the organization will become recognized as permanent.</p>
   <p>"The undersigned committee sincerely hopes that the esteemed compatriots will not stand aloof from this co-operative and honorable work, and is certain that the Polish Political Clubs will respond to this summons with a large delegation.</p>
   <p>"All further information will be given by the secretary of the temporary committee, Mr. M. J. Szameit, 137 Monroe Street."</p>
   <p>"Peter Kiolbassa,</p>
   <p>"M. J. Szameit,</p>
   <p>President.</p>
   <p>Secretary.</p>
   
   <p>"G. Kozlowski, Adam Blaszczynski, Joseph Kozlowski, Michael Gryszczynski, Michalski, Theodore Wikaryasz, Marlewski, Bernard Donajski, Max Kaczmarek."</p>
   <p>We admit that it surprised us that the secretary had not sent this statement to Dziennik Chicagoski, the only Polish newspaper in Chicago that is seriously concerned with politics, and what is more, a paper which, undoubtedly, has the greatest number of readers among the Poles in Chicago. Consequently, we went to the president for an answer from the committee, to ask him for an explanation of this strange incident. Unfortunately, Mr. Kiolbassa was out of town at that time, and, although we were told that the name of Mr. Kiolbassa was used in this statement without his consent, we did not make use of this information last Saturday, because it did not seem probable to us.</p>
   <p>On the following day, however, Mr. Kiolbassa returned. When we asked him about this statement, we told him what had occurred. Mr. Kiolbassa assured us that they had acted without his knowledge or desire when they neglected to have this statement printed in Dziennik, and he himself was indignant that they had acted thus.</p>
