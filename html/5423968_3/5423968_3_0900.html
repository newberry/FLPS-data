   <p>The Zgoda, during every election, does not meddle personally in politics, with the exception that it urges all Polish citizens to support and vote for Polish candidates, regardless of party.</p>
   <p>We cannot overstep our privileges. We can print the names of candidates and the party they stand for, but this is the best we can do for any Polish citizen in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We are listing all Polish candidates seeking office at this coming election.</p>
   <p>The candidate for county commissioner is John Czekala. He is a regular Democratic candidate, and the people will have an opportunity to vote for him in Chicago and the towns in Cook County.</p>
   <p>Candidates seeking office as representatives to the State Legislature are: Stanley P. Popek, Polish Independent candidate, from the 10th District. He is well known and liked by all Poles. He has been a citizen many years; also a member of the Z. N. P., and the members of all Z. N. P. groups should support and elect him.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>S.Haremeski, of the Republican Party, from the 15th District. He, like Mr. Popek, is also a member of the Z. N. P., and is well known in the neighborhood of St. Adelbert's Parish.</p>
   <p>Clemens J. Belinski, Democratic candidate, from the 9th District, is well known to the Poles.</p>

   <p>F. J. Kavcz is candidate for state senator from the 9th District, to which belongs St. Adelbert, Bridgeport, and Town of Lake; also a Z. N. P. member and a school member. He is well liked by the Poles in the neighborhoods mentioned, and he cannot see any possibility of defeat for this list of Polish candidates if all the Polish citizens support them.</p>
