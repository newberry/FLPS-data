   <p>A special meeting of the Polish-American Democratic Club of the 16th Ward took place on Sunday, March 12. The president, A. Rudnicki, discussed the slanders directed at Alderman Stanley Kunz by some of the American papers. He claimed that it was nothing more than a campaign against Kunz by his political enemies. Mr. Kunz himself went to some detail in explaining that intrigues were directed against him by his Republican opponent. Further, Mr. J. Gieszkiewicz, who was present at the incident in question, stated positively that the claims of the American newspapers were entirely groundless.</p>
   <p>Mr. August J. Kowalski spoke on the matter of preparation for the coming elections. He explained that as soon as it will be possible to obtain citizenship papers during evening hours, a suitable notice would appear in Dziennik Chicagoski designating the time at which and the place where prospective citizens are to present themselves.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. F. Bieszki reminded the audience that any citizen who changed his address must re-register on March 21, else he will not be permitted to vote. He urged those not having their second papers to procure them.</p>
   <p>As the meeting closed, Alderman Kunz announced a mass meeting to be held at the school auditorium, at which all of the Democratic candidates would be present, including Carter H. Harrison.</p>
