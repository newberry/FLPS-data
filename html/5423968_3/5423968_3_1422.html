   <p>Mr. Albert J. Danisch, who resides in the vicinity of St. Wenoeslaus Parish, 3919 Eddy Street, received a personal letter from Mayor Dever, in which he thanks him for the favors granted him.</p>
   <p>The Mayor also requested that Mr. Danisch thank the many Polish friends who had so strongly supported him in the election. It appears that our present Mayor is greatly pleased with the energetic support rendered him by the voting Plonia in Chicago. We have faith and hope that our Mayor will repay the Poles in the future.</p>
