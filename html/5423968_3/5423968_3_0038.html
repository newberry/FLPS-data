   <p>"Every employee of Armour and Company who goes out on strike will immediately lose his job." This was the ultimatum that was adopted yesterday at a conference held by the so-called counsel committee, consisting of representatives of the Chicago packing house industry and members of Armour and Company. Twenty-four members of various packing houses made up the committee, including many representatives of workers.</p>
   <p>The resolution adopted states further that any worker that listens to a strike leader who tries to incite him to strike, will also be discharged. It was also revealed at the meeting that the present rate of pay, after a thorough investigation and much deliberation, was compulsory. Consequently, the reduction in the hourly rate was necessary.</p>

   <p>There is no grave danger that there will be a shortage of meat for public use. The officials of the packing house industry contended that operations of the plants will continue in the event of a strike being called.</p>
