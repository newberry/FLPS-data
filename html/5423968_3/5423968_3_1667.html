   <p>The news has been spread through our press that Mr. John Smulski, known for his honorable political activities, is desired as the future mayor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>On one side, we would like to see such honor bestowed on one of our fellow-countrymen, but on the other side, we would not gladly see him in this position, on account of the conditions that now prevail in the city administration.</p>
   <p>The all-powerful local politicians, and robbers of public funds, would besmirch his great future, so it is better that the leading control over local dirt and rotten morals is in the hands of one who does not know how to rule honorably.</p>
