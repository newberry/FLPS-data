   <p>We consider it proper to return once more to the subject discussed so eloquently in Park Commissioner E. Z. Brodowski's letter, published yesterday in Dziennik[Chicagoski]. There are among us, we are informed, Republican agents who seek to destroy that solidarity upon which our strength depends; Polish Republican clubs are being formed--organized, perhaps, for the sole purpose of creating disunion among us, thus to deprive us of that significance and influence we have so laboriously striven for.</p>
   <p>Let us not permit ourselves to be misled. What good have the Republicans ever done us? When have they shown themselves our friends? In truth, they have always been nice to us before elections, but after elections they have never done us any good. On the contrary, they have treated us with contempt. We have more than enough proof of what Republican policies lead to in the whole country, as well as in the state, county, or city. The Democratic administration, to whose victory we Poles contributed, had to begin its work by finding a means to end the hard times which Republican policies brought upon the country. Only now does the country begin to breathe more freely as, one by one, the harmful measures passed by the Republican administration are being repealed. Will any one of us now desert that party which is saving the country from catastrophes and destruction, at a time when that party needs our support most?</p>
   <p>The Republican strategy of at least destroying solidarity there where it cannot expect support, is old. By the creation of Republican clubs among us, or at least by convincing us to vote for this or that Republican candidate, they hope to divide us, they hope to prove we do not constitute a political power, that we cannot attain any political significance, for we can be influenced by anyone. Are they to succeed in these intrigues? We owe our gratitude to the Democrats for the consideration and appreciation received at their hands. Are we to desert their ranks now and prove faithless to them? Are we again to believe those who have made hundreds of promises only to break them, and remove from office those to whom we owe more than one consideration, those who have kept their promises?</p>
   <p>After a great many years, the state of Illinois finally achieved a Democratic majority and elected a Democratic governor. That the Poles profited by the fact that they supported the Democratic party was shown in Mr. Brodowski's letter.</p>
   <p>We can expect such benefits in Cook County also if, when the elections are over, it develops that the Poles contributed to the party's victory. If it is shown, however, that a split occurred among us, that many of us crossed over to the opposite camp, that we cannot be counted on as a solid unit, then, of course, we cannot expect benefits.</p>
   <p>Let us not be misled by the Republican clubs organized by our enemies. Let us not allow ourselves to be deceived after so many similar experiences.</p>
   
   <p>Let us go to the polls on Tuesday, and all of us who have the right to vote, without exception, give our votes to the entire Democratic ticket. Let us give our votes to the Democratic party, the only party which can bring us, the Poles, any benefit.</p>
   <p>Let us show that we are a unit and, by a heavy vote, that we are a power which must be taken into consideration and which may be counted upon!</p>
