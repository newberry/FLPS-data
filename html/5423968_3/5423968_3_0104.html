   <p>We have just received the following report about the strike at the Ames and Frost Bicycle Factory (on Goose Island):</p>
   <p>"The strikers are victorious.....The factory has acceded to their demands and will sign a written contract to fulfill the agreements.</p>
   <p>"The strikers returned to work yesterday morning.</p>
   <p>"It was a tragic and comic sight to see the 'scabs' leaving the factory. They were sent on their way with outbursts of sarcastic laughter. The factory had agreed to dismiss all 'scabs'. That is what usually happens to 'scabs'!</p>
