   <p>Many speakers appeared on the rostrum. Mr. Nowak spoke to the youth and urged it to take more interest in politics. Before he closed his speech he told the Polish youth to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered in the city, for without education we will not be able to compete with the Irish, German, and other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Felix Lama spoke about the necessity of organizing clubs of uniting in one solid group. To make his point clear he referred to the work being done among the other nationalities along these lines. Mr. Lama said that only through a strong organization will we avoid being taken advantage of. The speaker urged the businessmen and national as well as church societies to support the political clubs.</p>
   <p>Many other speeches were made, and many questions relative to the coming campaign were discussed.</p>
