   <p>The citizens of Chicago and Cook County shall again take part in an election. It will mean the nomination of fourteen regular Circuit Court Judges and one Judge for the Superior Court.</p>
   <p>This election will mean much to the City of Chicago and Cook County also for the working people and Poles. It is so important to select the best, sincere and capable Judges that the first citizens of Illinois in arranging the constitution decided that the election be separate from all other elections, County and local. It should be the duty of every Polish citizen at this election, to cast his vote those are his obligations as a citizen.</p>
   <p>The election campaign for Judges is starting. The election will be Monday July 1st. For results it will depend a great deal upon the Poles this time. Even though the two parties, Democratic and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Republicans have selected 18 candidates apiece, none of them, however, expect to have their whole party ticket nominated. At the present it does not concern a victory of the party, but the selection of the best Judges.</p>
   <p>If we had a Pole to vote for on a Republican or Democratic ticket, we would then consider to vote for him. Not having any, we shall then select among those candidates who do not think the emmigrants injurious to the public.</p>
