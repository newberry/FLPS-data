   <p>A meeting of all four Polish Republican clubs in the Sixteenth Ward was held yesterday in Szykowny's Hall, at the corner of Noble Street and Milwaukee Avenue. The Young Men's Republican Club, the Kosciusko Club, the Polish-American Club and the Swita (Sunrise) Club were represented.</p>
   <p>The matter of the candidate for the Republican nomination for Alderman of the Sixteenth Ward was discussed. Finally all those present unanimously indorsed a young Polish attorney, Mr. John F. Smulski, as their candidate.</p>
   <p>There seems to be not doubt that Mr. Smulski will receive the nomination. The primaries and the Republican convention will take place shortly.</p>
