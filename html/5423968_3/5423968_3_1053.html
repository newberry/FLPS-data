   <p>The Poles of the Fifteenth Ward have chosen Joseph Kowaczek to represent them in the aldermanic elections next April. We have great hopes that he will follow in the footsteps of our well-liked city treasurer, Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>The support Mr. Kowaczek has received at the present time indicates that he has a good chance of becoming victorious in the spring elections. It is hoped that every Pole in that Ward will support him in the coming elections.</p>
