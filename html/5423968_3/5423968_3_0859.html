   <p>Miss Caroline Grote is a candidate for state superintendent of public schools on the Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>Miss Grote was born in the year of 1863 in Perry, Illinois. From early womanhood she devoted herself to the education of youth. She first started as a teacher in public schools. Later she was chosen by the Democratic party as a county superintendent of public schools in Pike county. This office she held for eight years. At the present time she is a teacher at Normal school in Macombe, Illinois. She is widely known in educational circles. She is a secretary of the organized teachers in the state of Illinois, cashier of county superintendents in the state of Illinois, also a member of the National Organized Educational Committee.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that this woman possesses an extraordinary character and has unusual qualification for this office. This is why the Democratic party has nominated her for such an important office.</p>
   <p>This is the first time in this state that a woman is running for such an office. The statistics show that ninety-five per cent of the teachers in this state are women, so it would only be fair and sensible that we nominate a woman for this office.</p>

   <p>The women of this country play a larger role in the affairs of education, than in any other country.</p>
   <p>Miss Grote has many relative and friends in the state of Illinois, with whose aid she supports our countrymen, Mr. Piotrowski, a candidate on the same ticket for state treasurer. Poles, vote for Mr. Piotrowski and Miss Grote, the two deserving candidates.</p>
