   <p>Our fellow countryman, Judge Edmund K. Jarecki placed such and article in the columns of Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>The Poles have gained a new political office. A few days ago the Sanitary Board of the city of Chicago appointed Mr. Joseph Ruszkiewicz a trustee of the Sanitary Board to fill the vacancy caused by the death of a member of the board, Mr. Edward Kane.</p>
   <p>It is an honor for us Poles that one of our fellow men has taken over an office never before occupied by one of our own. The position of Mr. Ruszkiewicz is of short duration now because it is only for a few months, unless Mr. Ruszkiewicz will be fortunate enough to be elected in the fall election for the next six years. The position is important to us Poles because one of our countrymen has gained it.</p>

   <p>The elevation of Mr. Ruszkiewicz points out that the politicians are coming to the conviction that representation is due the Poles in the various departments of government.</p>
   <p>Discussing the appointment of Mr. Ruszkiewicz, the weekly Public Safety devoted to municipal affairs and the organ of the Democratic Party of the 1st Ward, on May 29th, 1916, writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"The appointment is a recognition of the Polish Democrats of Chicago who have long insisted that they be given recognition on the Drainage Board.</p>
   <p>"Some years ago a Pole was slated by the Democratic managers for one of the trusteeship nominations, but Mr. Kane broke the slate, was nominated and was elected. Since that time the Polish element has been growing more and more insistent upon obtaining recognition, and this time the demand has been answered."</p>
