   <p>A few days ago, Dr. J. A. Ryan, professor at Catholic University in Washington and a prominent and well-known economist, delivered a speech at the conference of the Catholic Welfare Association. In his opinion the most effective remedy for unemployment is the increase of the worker's purchasing power through the establishment of a minimum wage scale for all employees, and the enactment of a five-day working week.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ryan said that the most pressing problem today is the adjustment of consumption to production. This phrase may have too technical a sound, but this adjustment offers the only solution to the problems which are uppermost in our minds. It is true that the working class is not responsible for the existing state of affairs, and neither is it in a position to change them. However, it can accomplish much in this direction by striving for a better adjustment of production--which is greater in this country than anywhere else.</p>

   <p>The problem now before the working class and the whole industrial organization is contrary to the one which industry faced in its earliest stages. One hundred years ago, the Reverend Thomas H. Malthus advocated the theory that the population increases faster than its means of subsistence. During that period his fear was not completely groundless.</p>
   <p>Since that time, however, machinery has completely changed the world's productive system. Today, in the United States, crops greatly exceed the demand, and soon a great number of farmers will be forced to abandon the soil. However, it is not only the farmer who is confronted with this problem but every other important branch of industry as well.</p>
   <p>With the introduction of new machinery, 1922 to 1926, production increased thirty-three per cent. The extent of this overproduction is best shown in the amount of money expended in an effort to sell the goods.</p>
   <p>If consumption were equal to production it would not be necessary to spend even one-fourth of the amount now spent on advertising and other means of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>selling these products. The tendency to produce more than can be used or sold is dangerous to all classes of society.</p>
   <p>From all indications the capital invested by manufacturers, farmers, and buyers will not bring the anticipated profits; workers are finding it very difficult to find employment even in prosperous times. Today, in the United States, we have between three and four million unemployed people, with no view of a decrease in this number in the very near future. It even seems likely that with perfected machinery usurping the places of more and more people in industry, unemployment will continually increase.</p>
   <p>A bad feature of the present system is that it does not provide suitable purchasing power. Those who would like to buy have no money, and those who can afford to buy are not in a position to purchase the present surplus.</p>
   <p>In our industrial organization there is no immediate exchange of products; they are exchanged for money and it is easy to understand that the masses of people who would willingly purchase the surplus products of all branches <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of industry do not have enough money. On the other hand, the capitalists and buyers have enough of everything and do not need to purchase more commodities. Their tendency is to produce more, to purchase more machinery and other essentials to increase their capital.</p>
   <p>Each year Americans invest over one billion dollars in foreign countries. If, instead of exporting this capital they would divide it among ten million of the lowest-salaried employees, the income of these poorly paid workers would increase on an average of over one hundred dollars annually. Let us consider how much greater the demands for our products would be under such circumstances.</p>
   <p>It is difficult for the average person to understand that a nation can possess too much wealth and too much capital. "Wealth," says an old adage, "contributes to the welfare of the thrifty and assures him capital with which he can replace old tools with new ones. That is why it is impossible to have too many of the good things."</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>However, after due consideration it will be easy to understand the inconsistency of this argument. If, for example, we saved one fourth of all we now pay for clothing and other necessities, and with this money built new factories, opened new stores, and added other instruments of production, what would happen to industry and its products for which there would be no demand? What would happen to the new instrument of production, the products of which no one would want to buy? Society,therefore, has too much capital.</p>
   <p>"Since it is necessary to increase consumption if our industry is to prevent a depression, I make this motion," concluded Dr. Ryan. "Overproduction can be decreased by a universal agreement to uphold high wages. The minimum-wage law would be a noteworthy step toward the solution of the problem of overproduction and low consumption."</p>
