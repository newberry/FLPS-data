   <p>The socialistic groups met yesterday in the Settlement hall to formulate plans for the celebration of the Labor holiday. After some discussion it was decided to call a mass-meeting for the evening of May 1, to convene in the University Settlement hall, located at the corner of Noble and Augusta streets.</p>
   <p>The program will consist of speeches, songs, and instrumental music. Our Polish comrades welcomed the suggestion made in yesterday's meeting that every worker who is unable to secure leave of absence on May Day should donate that day's earnings either to Dziennik Ludowy or to the fund intended for use in formenting the revolution against capitalism.</p>
