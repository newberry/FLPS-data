   <p>The results of the last local elections taught the Poles in the United States and especially those in Chicago an important lesson.</p>
   <p>It is a very pleasant lesson and at the same time a very bitter one. The results of the last election in Chicago have both benefited and injured the Poles of our metropolis. [The Polish voters and their system of voting are responsible for this situation.] The Poles are greatly honored by and will benefit from the election of their countryman, Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, as city treasurer. The Poles assured his victory by giving him all of their votes; had they not, he probably would have been defeated.</p>
   <p>However the Polish votes were split in the mayoralty contest since some voted for Cregier and others for Harrison.</p>
   <p>It may be said that out of approximately ten thousand Polish votes, Cregier received most of them, Harrison, about a thousand and Washburne, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>only a few. Cregier lost by three hundred and sixty-nine votes. Had he received all the Polish votes he would have been elected--there is no question about that. And what are the consequences of splitting Polish votes? The consequences are: a Republican candidate was elected, Polish influence will be weakened during the next city administration, and the Poles lost the opportunity of gaining many offices to which they would have been entitled by a Democratic victory.</p>
   <p>This is a significant lesson for us. Last election proved that the Poles in Chicago have the power to turn the tide of victory to the side they favor, or in other words that they possess the "Balance of Power." Not to profit by this situation would be imprudent; to profit by it is the duty of every citizen of Polish extraction. We can profit by our political influence if we take an active part in politics and work harmoniously wherever it is to our interest to do so.</p>
   <p>It is impractical to expect everyone to belong to the same political <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>party, though this would be very desirable and may be possible when the Poles, after careful consideration, have decided which political party [most completely represents their interests and convictions.] However some individuals will belong to other organizations because of a difference of opinions. Wherever such a matter as a city election is concerned when national politics [are not involved] and [the support of one or another party] may bring benefit or injury to the people, there should be unanimity and solidarity.</p>
   <p>For this reason the Poles should hold a conference before every election at which time they should pick suitable candidates [for their support.]</p>
   <p>Thus the Poles will gain the "Balance of Power;" by this means they will gain political prestige [which will merit the consideration of the political parties and ensure the growth of their influence and strength.]</p>
   <p>As long as the Poles are misled by every kind of politician and the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>[paid political advertisements appearing in newspapers,]so long will their "Balance of Power" be either worthless or of very little benefit to them.</p>
