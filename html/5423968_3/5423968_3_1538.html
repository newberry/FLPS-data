   <p>A committee of five, namely, John Czekala, Albert Zwiewka, Jacob Mucha, Edmund Szajkowski, and John Nering, was chosen to protest against the executive committee [of the Democratic Club] on the grounds that the section south of Milwaukee Avenue has thirteen members on the committee, whereas the section north of Milwaukee Avenue has only eight. The Polish Democratic Club sees in this an injustice done to the Poles. We will know what to do when election comes. The north side of Milwaukee Avenue has sixteen precincts and the south side has eighteen, but what of that, since our section has practically all Democratic precincts while there are only about thirty-five votes in each precinct on the other side. This is the cause of the dissatisfaction.</p>
   <p>If twenty-five Irish votes were to be found in our section we would not be afraid of any trouble because our organization numbers over 1300 members.</p>
