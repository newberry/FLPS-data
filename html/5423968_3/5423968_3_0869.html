   <p>The recent election in the City of Chicago gives us a reason and a subject for very unhappy reflections. Not only was our Polish candidate for judge of the Superior Court defeated, but we must admit that this candidate was defeated by a very large majority of votes, and what is the saddest part of this history, is that this can be attributed to nothing and nobody else but to ourselves and our own lack of solidarity and our negligence.</p>
   <p>The Poles have almost fifty thousand registered voters in Chicago, if all of them had cast their vote for their countryman in the last election, he would have had to win - he would be elected without the least doubt. Meanwhile how did these fifty thousand Polish voters behave during the last election and why was the Polish candidate defeated? Without a doubt the Poles must have voted against him? But it was not so: The Poles in a marked majority did not vote at all! Why? - God only knows.</p>
   <p>How weak was the participation in voting by the Poles, entitled to vote, let an authentic fact prove, that in one of our largest societies (whose name <span class="page-break">2</span>out of consideration we omit), out of sixty voters eligible to vote, only one voted.</p>
   <p>This is outright shocking! This is unjustified, not explainable, preposterous, thoughtless, awakward, punishable disregard of not only duties, rights but the privileges of citizens, this is a sad picture of a lack of intelligence on the part of citizens, it is ignorance of and unwillingness to know one's own strength and benefits which can be derived from a sane use of such power!</p>
   <p>It is a shame to say that the Poles relatively were the weakest in the support of their countryman. Much better and with much more solidarity had acted for example the Czechs who with much solidarity voted for the Pole, and from whom we can take a good example, how to carry on and act harmoniously and wisely in politics.</p>
   <p>Because of our negligence, such proof of which we saw, in the last campaign, because of this heavy reaction, it will indeed be different to acquire for ourselves some sort of political representation.</p>
   <p>When will we at last and finally "make ourselves," when will we generally <span class="page-break">3</span>mature and grow up intellectually to a sense and acquirement of our own rights? It is difficult to judge this, it is disagreeable to think about this because always our own mistakes seem continually to push far away from us the time of realization and consciousness.</p>
