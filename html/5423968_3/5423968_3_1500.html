   <p>A correspondent reveals that we have too many non-citizens among the Poles. The question is, have we 60,000 voting citizens of Polish birth?</p>
   <p>The reply is, yes. In the 8th, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 27th, and 29th wards reside a large number of Polish citizens, and besides, there are some Polish votes in every ward. We do not contend there are that many Polish votes in Chicago alone, but that there is that many in all of the towns in Cook County. Correct figures cannot be obtained from registrations because not al register, and many keep moving from place to place. But from all indications, it is possible we will reach the 60,000 figure of Polish voting citizens. Naturally, this number has been enormously increased by the American-born Poles ,for it is positive there is not enough citizens among the old immigrants from Europe.</p>
   <p>We acknowledge that our correspondent is altogether right, for many of the new arrivals from Europe, after living here many years, fail to become citizens of the country that gave them freedom, bread, and to many, even wealth.</p>

   <p>American citizenship will harm no one, especially those who for some special reason, will never return to their native country, and for some unknown reason refuse to become citizens of this country However, such conservation of patriotism is not even requested by our Fatherland, for when we take the oath of citizenship of the United Sates, we do not renounce Poland or its government, for at the present time it does not exist; instead we renounce the tyrannical governments that exist in our Fatherland. We commit not national treason, for in the event of Poland's regaining its own government and independence, then those wishing to return could do so without fear of persecution.</p>
   <p>Being a citizen of this country, not only gives us the same rights and privileges enjoyed by the native-born, but in addition elevates our nation to a higher social level, and give efficient aid to our oppressed Fatherland. We probably have 60,000 Polish citizens in Cook County, but we should have three times that many in proportion to our numbers. We personally know hundreds of families, residing in Chicago many years, accumulated property, raised large families, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>grew old here, and never became citizens of this country, thus remaining insignificant in the political government of our country.</p>
   <p>By having more Polish voters we can accomplish more good for our race in the way of attaining high official positions. Our fellow-men are doing wrong in neglecting American citizenship, since this country welcomed them on its soil and give them a chance for development.</p>
