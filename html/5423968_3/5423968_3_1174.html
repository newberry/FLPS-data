   <p>The first meeting of the Citizens Club will be held Sunday, April 21st, at 2: P.M. in the parish hall. We invite all citizen members of this Association to attend, because there are many matters to be disposed of.</p>
   <p>We also ask all of our countrymen, who desire to become citizens of this country, to join. The Citizens Club not only assists you in obtaining your naturalization papers, but it gives lectures in the English language, as well as other aid; such as trying to reduce taxes. Therefore, every countryman who is interested should be affiliated. B. F. Kowalski, president; Adam A. Bialecki, secretary; 4848 So. Centre Ave., Chicago, Ill.</p>
