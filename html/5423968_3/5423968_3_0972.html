   <p>A large Democratic mass meeting was held yesterday at the Polish Hall on Bradley Street. Over six thousand persons attended the meeting and welcomed the political guest speakers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bieszka [no first name given] acted as chairman and F. Fuhl as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The first speech was delivered by the chairman, who urged the entire audience to support the Democratic ticket in the coming elections. Details on the rules of registration were also explained for the benefit of all present.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Kunz was the second speaker to take the stand. He supported Frank Wenter as the mayoralty candidate, and he also urged support of the entire Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>At this stage of the political meeting, Mr. Wenter entered the hall and was <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>greeted with warm applause. Mr. Wenter addressed the audience as follows:</p>
   <p>"I would like to make my address to you, fellow citizens, in your own language, but I must speak to you in English and in German. There is one important thing that I wish to convey to you: the large turnout in this hall should be an indication of my victory in the coming election. (Applause and shouts.) I know now that I can look forward to the support of the Sixteenth Ward." (Shouts.)</p>
   <p>In his address Mr. Wenter pointed to his past record, and said that he not only wishes to better it but also hopes to make himself the best mayor the city of Chicago ever had, the best for the worker as well as the middle-class citizen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wenter's speech was sympathetically received by the audience. He left the impression that he is an honest and upright citizen, as indeed he is.</p>

   <p>After this speech the following took the rostrum: Mr. Hoechler, who spoke in German; Peter Kiolbassa and August Kowalski, who spoke in Polish; S. Cook and A. S. Trude, who spoke in English.</p>
   <p>This meeting was the greatest success in the history of the Polish Democratic party in the Sixteenth Ward. The crowd was the largest that ever attended a political mass meeting at the Polish Hall. It surpassed the one that gathered to hear Carter H. Harrison and John P. Hopkins, two popular candidates who ran for mayor a few; years ago, and were both victorious. If this is any indication of victory for the Democratic candidate for mayor, them Mr. Wenter should be the next mayor of Chicago. It has been estimated that over 2,500 votes have been pledged to Mr. Wenter from the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
