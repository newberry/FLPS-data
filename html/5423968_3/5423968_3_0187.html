   <p>In comparing European nations with the United States, it is difficult to obtain exact figures about the unemployed; the truth is that responsible persons, who should aid in this situation, display no interest. Therefore, the slogan: "Help yourself," is decidedly too ambiguous. We have millions who are unable to help themselves, and casting them upon a nation's fate, does not help their country. What then is needed to carry on suitable unemployment statistics? The best answer for this problem is to define the exact number. The Secretary of Labor, Mr. Davis announced that at present there are 2,000,000 unemployed people in the United States. Senator Shipstead, of the United States Congress, asserts that over 8,000,000 persons are looking in vain for an opportunity to earn a livelihood. The assertion of said senator, however, does not uphold the report of the National Manufacturers Association, which,according to the situation of the markets, has increased its employment in the past few months.</p>
   <p>In the 1,078 industries in the thirty-nine states, it was reported that at present 663,015 people are employed; as for the same period, last year, 655,015 people were employed. Figures submitted by the industries concerned, show, that the present percentage of employment in factories is eighty-seven and five-tenths percent; compared with the same period, last year, the percentage was only eighty-one, <span class="page-break">2</span>In pre-election periods observers usually exaggerate conditions, whether they refer to the stagnation of commerce and industry or general prosperity. As a matter of fact, the number of unemployed, as submitted by representatives of the present administration, is 2,000,000; it is also a fact, that nothing, of a constructive nature, has been done to avert these conditions of unemployment.</p>
   <p>The Reverend F. J. Haas says in his article in the Catholic Charity Review: "There is a lack of organized effort in assuring for employees a steady means of earning a livelihood and a total disregard for the need of this co-operation by industry. This condition was also prevalent during the depression of 1921, when the aggregate number of unemployed reached the staggering total of 6,000,000. A very commendable program is the unemployment fund established by some manufacturers in colaboration with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, who, by united effort, created this fund for the benefit of employees during the layoffs."</p>
   <p>In our opinion it would be of material benefit, if the friends of American labor analyze this condition thoroughly. The result of this analysis would be a basis on which employees and manufacturers could establish a plan and program for elevating the social standard of living, and, at the same time, afford mutual understanding between employee and employer. It is a known fact that the United States is far advanced in every phase of enterprise, as compared with Europe; she lags, however, in this important phase of social understanding.</p>
