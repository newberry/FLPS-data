   <p>Events in the war are at present developing with unprecedented rapidity. The devastating battle now raging incessently on the western front definitely indicates that the German forces are at the point of exhaustion. This can mean but one thing, and that is that perhaps in the near future the hour of peace will strike on the clock of history.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately we Poles seem to be entirely indifferent to the importance of the situation. Our people seem to manifest a strange coolness in political matters. The United States will have a decisive voice in events that will pertain to Poland's fate. It will largely depend upon the type of spokesman that Poland has to represent it in Washington whether the fate of our native land will be felicitous.</p>
   <p>The question now is: Whom are we to place as our spokesman in Washington? Who is to raise his voice in defense of our rights? Are we Poles to relegate this power to some stranger, not a Pole, or are we to give it to some one sympathetic to our cause, some one who is a true Pole, who knows and understands our needs--a person who knows how to defend Polish interests in this country?</p>
   <p>The question of selecting a Congressman is not a question of party or faction. It is a question of primary importance. This is especially true in this critical time. Whoever is unwilling to sacrifice his personal prejudices, his insignificant ambitions, and the like upon the altar of the general welfare is not unlike a criminal. He would deny to our people the opportunity of having an energetic representation of our most vital interests.</p>
   <p>The forthcoming Congress will have many matters [before it] closely related to the fate of Poland. The presence of a Pole in Congress when Polish interests are discussed will be indispensable. The Eighth Congressional District of Illinois is predominantly Polish. If the citizens of Polish extraction were to unite and act as a solid bloc during the coming election campaign, it is a foregone conclusion that no other nationality would have a chance. The reason why we have been unsuccessful thus far in electing a Pole to Congress is that some wretched politicians, utterly devoid of character, through ignorance or through malice or because of bribes have caused confusion in the Polish ranks. These self-centered individuals have paved the way to victory not for a Pole but for some one of another nationality. Because of these dissensions the Poles in America have not been properly represented. On the contrary, it has not been uncommon to find men in Congress who are unsympathetic to Poles, and who have placed our people in a false and unfavorable light. The lamentable and shameful feature of it all is that these antagonistically inclined Congressmen have been put in office by Polish votes.</p>
   <p>The dissension in the Polish ranks has been possible simply because our voters have been asleep. They have considered the question of a Congressman and his election as something purely partisan and political in its nature. Our people have not thought of the office as something of the utmost national importance.</p>
   
   <p>At present what is perhaps the last chance for our people easily to elect a Pole to Congress has appeared. The Congressional districts are to be revised. The election of a Pole at this time might cause such a grouping of our wards that it would permanently assure the election of Polish candidates.</p>
   <p>To accomplish this, it is necessary and imperative that our people remain on guard, so that our national interests will remain protected. We should not allow the good work, once started, to be ruined by the ill will of some self-centered individuals. Consequently, if our people wish to have a Pole in Congress, they must awaken from their lethargic indifference. They must organize and be cautious lest some traitor betray us again. If the Poles conduct their work properly, then a Polish voice will reverberate for the first time in the largest Republic in the world. It will strengthen the significance and the importance of Polish immigration not only here, in America but in other countries as well.</p>
   <p>And so let us all work diligently toward that goal. It is desirable that Polish leaders, be they in the field of politics or in other spheres, shall express their views from the standpoint of national politics on having a Polish representative in Congress. The Dziennik Zwiazkowy promises to publish these views in its columns which are devoted to political matters. In this way it will give to our people an opportunity to become better acquainted with national affairs that are of primary importance to all Poles.</p>
