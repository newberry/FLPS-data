   <p>To-morrow's Democratic caucus will most probably be very active. The most important office of the city, the office of the mayor, has two strong candidates. One of them is Mr. Cregier, the present Mayor of Chicago, and the other former Mayor Carter H. Harrison. This will be quite a fight, because both candidates have many supporters. Caucuses will be held in many wards for the purpose of finding the strength of the aldermanic candidates, and some wards have a few strong candidates.</p>
   <p>In the 8th Ward, Alderman Bunker has two opponents, Martin Morrison and J. J. McMahon, but the caucus will be held on Monday. In the 9th Ward there are two aldermanic candidates, John Denver and Max Kirchmann; in the 15th Ward, Michael Ryan and Otto Huelsman; in the 16th a Pole, Stanley Kunz, and two Germans, R. H. Sigmund and Peter Mueller are running for the aldermancy.</p>

   <p>Personal Rights Advocate publishes an article about Carter H. Harrison, candidate of the Personal Rights League, saying that he stands a good chance to get the nomination for mayor on the Democratic ticket. The article goes on to give the reason why the Personal Liberty League considers Mr. Harrison a better candidate than Cregier.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday's registration brought unusual results, as it disclosed 45,826 new voters. Last fall there were 50,000 new voters. It is very strange that in so short a time so many citizens changed their minds and decided to vote.</p>
   <p>It is reported that the Democrats have gained many supporters at the last registration.</p>
