   <p>If you did not register prior to the primary election, do so today, so that you may be able to vote in April at the general city election. The right to vote is our most effective weapon in this country. We should therefore take advantage, by voting intelligently. Our voting strength will be seriously considered, and respected only accord in- to the interest we display in exercising our citizenship rights, and thus, we are able to take advantage of same.</p>
   <p>Political influences do not take into account the total number of our people, but consider only those who are registered to vote. It is true that we are here in great numbers; but that fact will not elevate our importance, if we do not display our strength on election day.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that many of the Polish people who possess citizenship papers neglect their duty to vote, thereby hurting themselves as well as the entire Polish element in America. Among the candidates who are aspiring to thigh political positions, we find our fellow man Mr. Szymczak, who is a candidate for City Treasurer. In view of this, it should be the ambition of all Poles in Chicago to give him their whole hearted and loyal support.</p>
