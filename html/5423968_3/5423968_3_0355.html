   <p>The striking tailors have finally seen who is their friend and how little they profit from the teaching of uninvited and unsolicited leaders, who use the occasion to foist themselves upon the workers, but who are interested exclusively in their own welfare. As the English newspapers claimed, and the reporter of Dziennik Zwiazkowy ascertained, the striking tailors, on the order of their union leaders, have thrown out socialist agitators from several down town halls. These extreme socialists are purposely endeavoring to continue the strike as long as possible because strike conditions are favorable to them--they get the opportunity to rave at meetings, praise their party, sell newspapers and pamphlets, and, at the same time, attack everyone not a socialist. Under labor's guise, the so-called socialists have cooked their party's goose. They were not so much interested in the welfare of the poor strikers as they were in their own party matters. By their ravings and <span class="page-break">2</span>demagoguery they have succeeded temporarily in befuddling the minds of the strikers. This agitation has acted as a narcotic which beclouds the mind. But after the effects wear off, the victim becomes sober and reflects upon the value of the narcotic.</p>
   <p>The tailors have already become sober and have turned away from the so-called socialists. They are following their proper union leaders, who certainly know what the strikers need, how the strike can be won, and upon what terms. The strikers at first rejected the counsels of their union leaders, because they allowed themselves to be misled by the ravers of the red banner. But now they see that only their union leaders desire the workers' welfare. These representatives encourage an honest agreement, out of which the strikers can honorably emerge victorious. No one is greatly surprised that the strikers at first gave ear to the demagogues. Enraged by the prolonged struggle and the stubbornness of the employers, tortured by hunger and want, they were like a powder keg, which can be exploded by a spark. Influenced by the speeches of agitators--supposedly socialists--the strikers erupted. They hoped to gain help in their battle. The so-called socialists profited shamefully from this, <span class="page-break">3</span>exploiting the strike to demonstrate their prowess in raving. These individuals agitated everywhere, not to end the strike, but to enroll volunteers for their international party. Every soapbox orator knows how to rail at meetings. Such phrases as "Continue the fight!" "Don't give in!" "Shame!" "Away with capitalists, bourgeoise, Democrats, Republicans, clergy, businessmen!" are not uncommon. But it is another thing to bring true active assistance to those who are fighting, and to conduct and terminate the strike victoriously.</p>
   <p>Then, again, what can the socialist demagogues know about conditions among workers of a given branch of work and how a strike can be won there? A majority of those agitators are people who during their entire life have never as much as looked into the darkened mine pits, never witnessed the factory hells, never cut down forests, never erected railroads or bridges, never paved streets, never loaded materials on transports, and never even worked with a needle. What can these individuals know of labor conditions when they themselves abhor any type of work? Preparing their throats well, they go among working people to mislead them. Then they come to the surface, as <span class="page-break">4</span>toads come out of mud, when any struggle between labor and capital arises and workers demand their rights. It is then that these agitators force their way into the lines of labor and, by carelessly casting aspersions in all directions, attempt to teach workers how to win strikes. When peace reigns among workers, these "saviors of the workingmen" limit themselves to....the sale of pamphlets, orations from soapboxes on street corners, where they denounce the most respectable and best citizens if these are not in accord with the agitators' views or do not wish to recognize their type of socialism.</p>
   <p>These local so-called socialists are not in the least friendly to labor unions. They even fight with unions because the unions always reject their motions to have organized labor support and recognize socialism. They are avowed enemies of the president of the American Federation of Labor and other prominent leaders of labor unions. These true leaders take definite steps to keep socialistic propaganda out of the ranks of their Federation. Whence then the sudden love of the so-called socialists for labor unions? The only possible explanation of this is that they endeavor to enmesh workers in their (socialist) trap <span class="page-break">5</span>and to compel labor unions to carry out their party purposes. This, after all, is so evident and clear that every union leader can explain it to his brethren in the unions.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the tailors' union ordered the socialistic demagogues thrown out of the halls where the strikers were holding their meeting on December 11, 1910, because they saw through their dastardly plans. The union leaders are well aware of the fact that the agitators prefer to have the strike prolonged, even though there is a loss to the strikers, so that they will have more time for their propaganda and their nonsensical speeches which mislead the strikers. The committee, chosen from the members of the tailors' union, has decided that hereafter whoever does not belong to the union and is not on strike has no right to make speeches or even to be in the hall where strikers consult about their fate. And justly so. After all, who knows the situation and needs better than those who participate in the struggle? Who can conduct the entire business better than those who know their own needs? After all, there are enough capable and conscientious people in as large a group as the striking tailors who know how to conduct a strike; they do not need the assistance of socialists who do <span class="page-break">6</span>not belong to any labor union. The union leaders acted wisely and properly when they ordered the eviction of the so-called socialists from their group. These agitators have done more to cause disturbance than they have done to assure victory for labor.</p>
