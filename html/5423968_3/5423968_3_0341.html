   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span>decisions are authoritative, nothing remains for the worker but despair or giving in to the wish of the capitalists so the latter may further continue to exploit them.</p>
   <p>Truly, we do not understand what in this country of rich exploiters is constitutional and what is unconstitutional, because the courts of our country interpret the constitution in the same manner in which various sections of the Bible are explained by disagreeing theologians. Every judge has a different opinion a out the constitutionality or the unconstitutionality of this matter.</p>
   <p>The state law defending the exploited worker is unconstitutional; but it may be constitutional for the police to break the heads of the innocent workers.</p>
   <p>An eight or ten-hour day is considered unconstitutional; but to cut the working-man's wages for his hard labor, which brings the capitalists hundreds of millions of dollars, is constitutional. It is considered unconstitutional to force a factory or mine owner to pay an accident compensation or death benefit to a family of which a bread-winner has been killed; but criminal neglect on the part of these factory or mine owners which causes many workers to die or to become permanently disabled, is constitutional.</p>
   <p>The verdict given the oil trust--a fine of twenty nine million dollars for unlawful manipulations--was considered unconstitutional; yet under the veil of the constitution, it is permissible here for a capitalist to cheat and rob the poor working masses.</p>
   <p>What an unfair constitution! It is good for one side and very bad for the other.</p>
