   <p>The state of Massachusetts has passed a law protecting a textile worker from the unjust system of punishment for material spoiled by the machinery operated by the worker. For a damaged piece of material textile factory owners deducted a certain amount of money from the very small salary of the textile worker, deriving thereby some profit both from the work and by the worker and also from the piece of damaged material.</p>
   <p>After this law had been passed by the legislature, these textile factory owners decided to fight it at all costs. They were victorious.</p>
   <p>They took their case to the supreme court of the United States; this court found the law passed by the Massachusetts legislature unconstitutional, giving thereby the unscrupulous textile factory owners again the opportunity <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to further exploit the textile worker.</p>
   <p>When these employees were informed that beginning July 1, 1912, the textile industry will renew the old system of charging for damaged material, the workers decided to call a strike of July 15, throughout the entire textile industry.</p>
   <p>The workers of Polish descent, while informing us of this fact, complained that not only does capital harm them, not only do the courts refuse them any protection, but the union leaders go riding in automobiles with the factory owners, smoke aromatic cigars, and eat delicious dinners, while thousands of textile workers with families are stricken with poverty, and starvation is tearing at their vitals.</p>
   <p>We do not know whether such conditions exist; however, if the union leaders really treat this important matter in such a manner, they are not worth being <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>leaders and should be removed from their positions immediately.</p>
   <p>Poverty again reigns among the thousands of unlucky textile workers, because the factory owners of this industry closed twelve large factories for an indefinite period, leaving twelve thousand workers with families destitute.</p>
   <p>We must add, that the police department is enjoying itself in its own way, beating innocent textile workers with police clubs, and arresting many of them for no reason at all. May workers have been sentenced to prison for 1 year and fined, even though they did commit any crime.</p>
   <p>Therefore, struggle and poverty combined oppress the working masses who cannot expect justice or help from anyone. As a reward for their hard labor in creating wealth for certain individuals they get poverty, police clubs, and a one year jail sentence.</p>
   <p>Because the Supreme Court of this country is the last resort, and its <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>decisions are authoritative, nothing remains for the worker but despair or giving in to the wish of the capitalists so the latter may further continue to exploit them.</p>
   <p>Truly, we do not understand what in this country of rich exploiters is constitutional and what is unconstitutional, because the courts of our country interpret the constitution in the same manner in which various sections of the Bible are explained by disagreeing theologians. Every judge has a different opinion a out the constitutionality or the unconstitutionality of this matter.</p>
   <p>The state law defending the exploited worker is unconstitutional; but it may be constitutional for the police to break the heads of the innocent workers.</p>
   <p>An eight or ten-hour day is considered unconstitutional; but to cut the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>working-man's wages for his hard labor, which brings the capitalists hundreds of millions of dollars, is constitutional. It is considered unconstitutional to force a factory or mine owner to pay an accident compensation or death benefit to a family of which a bread-winner has been killed; but criminal neglect on the part of these factory or mine owners which causes many workers to die or to become permanently disabled, is constitutional.</p>
   <p>The verdict given the oil trust--a fine of twenty nine million dollars for unlawful manipulations--was considered unconstitutional; yet under the veil of the constitution, it is permissible here for a capitalist to cheat and rob the poor working masses.</p>
   <p>What an unfair constitution! It is good for one side and very bad for the other.</p>
