   <p>When the thirty workers who replaced the strikers of the Iroquois Furnace Company of South Chicago left their place of employment last night, a band of men and boys attacked them. Several were struck down, and others were wounded with stones.</p>
   <p>The South Chicago police were informed of the trouble. Officers rushed to the scene and arrested nine of the attackers.</p>
   <p>Those hurt are as follows:</p>

   <p>Those arrested for creating a disturbance are as follows: James Margret, Toni Rossi, Luther Rusmac, G. Dunik, Frank Mank, Mike Russ, Nick Rich, Anthony Meligan, and John Figla.</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned factory is located at 96th Street, along the Calumet River. Until last Wednesday over four hundred men and boys were employed, but because of low wages they went out on strike. The company replaced the strikers with others, and since then several small fights have occurred, culminating in last night's riot.</p>
