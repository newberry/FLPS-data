   <p>Treasurer Kiolbassa declared that the Poles will not be appeased and will decline the offer of the Democrats who suggested that the Poles might select one of their own men to become a member of the Tax Equalization Board. They insist that the two Irish members of the County-Central Committee, both from the 16th Ward, resign.</p>
   <p>This Ward has 3,000 Poles, 1,000 Germans and only about 150 Irish inhabitants, therefore, it is only fair and just, that the Poles send their representatives to the County Central Committee. On Thursday a Protest meeting will be held at Walsh's Hall.</p>
