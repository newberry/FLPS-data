   <p>A meeting was held last night in M. Derengowski's Hall by the committee of Polish Democrats of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Mr. Jacob Tomaszewski, who called on Mr. Frank Jankowski to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Mr. John Kondziorski. He explained the purpose of the meeting and urged the people to support the only genuine people's party-- the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>He then said: "The ballot, which every citizen has the privilege of casting on election day, is our weapon; let us use it to fight for our rights. On the Democratic ticket is a name well known to all of us, not only in the Sixteenth Ward but all over Chicago. This name is Peter Kiolbassa, candidate for alderman of the Sixteenth Ward. We should elect him to that office by a <span class="page-break">2</span>tremendous plurality."</p>
   <p>This speech was greeted with intense enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The next speakers were Mr. John Czekala, Mr. August J. Kowalski, and Mr. Peter Mazurkiewicz.</p>
   <p>They urged all to take advantage of the rights granted by virtue of their citizenship, and to vote for the Democratic party, for it is the only party favoring the people and fighting the millionaire money-grabbers. What did the Republicans do for us Poles during their tenure in office? They raised the taxes thirty-three and one-third per cent, and fired the Poles from their jobs. They are the cause of unbelievable filth in our city--and particularly in Polish localities....Here are the mountains of gold they have promised us.</p>
   <p>All of the speeches were wildly applauded. The hurrahs, and cries of "Long live Peter Kiolbassa, our next alderman," were continuous.</p>
   <p>Jacob Tomaszewski, president,</p>
   <p>Frank G. Jankowski, secretary.</p>
