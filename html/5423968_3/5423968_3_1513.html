   <p>Mr. Szuminski is the only Polish candidate seeking the highest office in Chicago, County of Cook, at the coming election. He was born in 1859 in the town of Orze Lek, county of Ziotow.</p>
   <p>After graduating from grammar school, his parents sent him to the Chojnacki gymnasium, which has the same classification as our colleges. In the year 1877, he went to Bydgoszoz to act as manager of a magazine, where he was employed until 1882. Part of the following year he spent with Simon Ascher in Warbzenie. At the close of 1883 he emigrated to America and settled in Chicago. He was hired as assistant manager at Pavlicki's concern, located at Milwaukee Avenue near Noble Street, and later worked for Mr. E. Ahlswede, where he stayed until 1896. In February 1896 he opened his own business at 604 Noble Street, where he carried a complete line of silk wares and silk materials. The great concern of Marshall Field and Farwell gave him credit, and showed him the utmost consideration as a business man.</p>
