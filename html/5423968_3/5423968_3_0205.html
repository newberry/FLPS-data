   <p>Tomorrow the voters will decide not only who will be in office and which party will be "the party in power" until the next election, but they will also decide whether hundreds of thousands of unemployed will continue to walk the streets of the city of Chicago, or whether the municipal administration will give aid in the form of work to the people without resources. Whether this action is begun will depend on the results of the voting on the "little ballot".</p>
   <p>The proposals on the "little ballot" relate in general to the improvement of sidewalks, the widening of streets, the building of bridges, etc.</p>
   <p>We believe that citizens, both men and women, should vote "yes" on the proposed projects, for the following reasons:</p>
   <p>(1) The projects are necessary and will be worth a great deal more than their cost.</p>
   <p>(2) These projects will decrease the number of unemployed and will thus at least partially solve the very difficult problem of unemployment.</p>
   <p>(3) They will help bring about a relative improvement in economic conditions in all parts of the city.</p>
   <p>(4) They will help reduce the cost of maintaining guards to regulate the traffic on the streets.</p>
   <p>(5) If these projects are not begun now their cost will increase.</p>
   <p>(6) They will help improve the sanitary condition of the city.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy is convinced that voting for one proposed projects in the "little ballot" will help bring about necessary improvements, and therefore urges its readers to vote "yes".</p>
   <p>Both men and women can vote on the "little ballot".</p>
