   <p>Our paper will be published the day of election, but we cannot help or harm any of the candidates running for office. In the next issue will be published the results of this election.</p>
   <p>We would like to impress on your mind one curious fact about the character of a candidate. A Pole, Mr. J.J. Dahlman, received the Democratic nomination for Alderman. He is running for office, as is Mr. August Kowalski, one of his fellow countrymen. We should remember that the answer is that the Polish citizens should not vote in any way that may harm them, but vote for the Polish candidates, regardless of the party or the opponents. We should bear in mind that we should elect more Polish candidates, and not worry about the other nationalities.</p>
   <p>We impress upon you the fact that Mr. Dahlman, who is asking the support of all Poles, lives and thrives among them; has had his circulars printed by Simon Levy - a Jewish printing concern, while in his neighborhood are many Polish printers, dealing in Polish and English printing of any amount or size. Can we call this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>"solidarity"? This is the class of people that are seeking our support, so that they may become political figures.</p>
   <p>Maybe Kowalski or Dahlman will win in their respective localities, but we are seeking more than ever the election of Mr. Kowalski, a true Pole.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dahlman, who gave his work to the Jews, shouldn't expect much support from the Poles.</p>
