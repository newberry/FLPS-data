   <p>The "Citizens Club of General Casimir Pulaski" in Holy Trinity Parish, at its quarterly meeting, through the initiative of the Most Reverend Father Casimir Sztuczko, endorsed unanimously our citizen Mr. Phillip Ksycki, a member of this club and of the Holy Trinity Parish, as a candidate for the office of congressman.</p>
   <p>Because Mr. P. Ksycki is a gentleman of good character, he received the nomination of the Republican Party for this high office. Therefore, we, as members of the General Casimir Pulaski Club, are begging the dear Polish public to support Mr. P. Ksycki during the present primary campaign and give him your vote at the regular election.</p>
   <p>We are firmly convinced that if Mr. P. Ksycki is elected congressman, our confidence in him will not be shaken, and for us Poles it will be an honor to send our first Polish congressman to Washington.</p>
   <p>Therefore, dear Polish brothers, we should take pains to see that our brother Mr. P. Ksycki receives all the Polish votes in Chicago.</p>
   <p>J. Nawrot, President.</p>
   <p>J. Wronski, Secretary.</p>
