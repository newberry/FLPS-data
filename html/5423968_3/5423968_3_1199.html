   <p>Today, Dec. 5th, at 8 P.M., the first important meeting of representatives of Polish Democratic clubs will be held in rooms 301-302, Schiller Building, 10 W.Randolph street, to organize the central organization of Polish Democrats in Cook County.</p>
   <p>Every ward in Chicago, and each town outside the city limits but in Cook County, has the right to be represented through courtesy of their club committee.
