   <p>The Municipal Voters' League, an organization which has for its purpose the instilling of greater purity in municipal political affairs, has endorsed just a few of the group of over one hundred candidates for alderman in the city of Chicago; men whom they consider honest and faithful.</p>
   <p>Among the few that were endorsed we note with pride that both of the Sixteenth Ward candidates, Mr. Peter Kiolbassa and Mr. John F. Smulski, were included. The Municipal Voters' League considered both of them qualified, but added, "On account of his age and greater political experience, Mr. Kiolbassa should have preference".</p>
