   <p>In view of the approaching primary election the Dziennik Zwiazkowy judges this the proper time to give certain valuable information to our Polish-American citizens. This information may be of priceless value during this present campaign.</p>
   <p>In the first place, the Eighth Congressional District is composed of a hundred and thirteen precincts. Of these sixty-six precincts are overwhelmingly Polish, and the remainder, forty-seven, are cosmopolitan. In view of this one might say that Polish votes alone should be sufficient to give the nomination to a Polish candidate.</p>
   <p>A Pole could not help winning if the Sixteenth Ward, having forty-four precincts, gave him 2,500 votes, the Seventeenth Ward, composed of twenty-four precincts, supported him with its 2,000 votes, and the Fifteenth Ward of <span class="page-break">\2</span>twenty-nine precincts gave him 1,000 votes. One can readily see that 5,500 votes cast in a primary election in favor of a Polish candidate would certainly assure his nomination and his subsequent election to Congress.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Koralewski aspires to the nomination as candidate for Congress from the Eighth Congressional District. His name will be found on the Democratic ticket. Only Democratic voters can cast their ballot in his behalf. If anyone wishes to vote the Republican ticket and still support a Pole, then there is Mr. Max Kaczmarek, also a candidate for Congress of the same District. At primary elections a voter may cast his ballot for one ticket alone. This he receives at the polling place, and he then proceeds to vote for his choice of candidates of that particular political party. Mr. Koralewski's opponent on the Democratic ticket is Mr. P. Gallagher, while Mr. Kaczmarek's adversary on the Republican ticket is Mr. Porelli. It is between these gentlemen that the party war is being waged. The reason <span class="page-break">\3</span>why the Polish Democrats should stand united in favor of Mr. Koralewski, and the Polish Republicans for Mr. Kaczmarek is that the fight on each of these tickets is waged between a Pole and a candidate of another nationality.</p>
   <p>A similar situation exists in the nomination for another very important political position, namely, that of clerk of the municipal court. Its importance may be considered as next after that of the Congressman. On the Democratic ticket we find the name of Mr. Francis Rydzewski, while on the Republican ticket we have Mr. Joseph Pelka. Their opponents are not Poles. Polish Democrats should therefore vote for Mr. Rydzewski, and Polish Republicans should support the nomination of Mr. Pelka. It might be worth while to mention here that the Irish are resorting to their old political tricks. In order to defeat Mr. Rydzewski, the Irish have placed another Pole on the ballot [as candidate for clerk of the municipal court]. They are fully aware that Polish people will vote for Poles, and so they decided that if our people in casting their ballot for the nomination of a <span class="page-break">\4</span>candidate for clerk of the municipal court voted for Mr. Rydzewski and for the other Pole besides, such ballots would be spoiled and not counted. As a result of this the only one benefiting by the confusion would be the Irish candidate. Consequently, to prevent any such disqualification [of ballots], it is imperatively necessary that the Democratic Poles vote as one man for Mr. Francis Rydzewski for clerk of the municipal court. That is the only way by which we can assure the nomination of a Pole.</p>
   <p>As to the judges of the municipal court, ten candidates are to be nominated. Polish Democrats must necessarily vote for Joseph S. LaBuy and for the present Alderman, Stanley Walkowiak, to assure their nomination. Polish citizens may also cast their votes for Mr. John Prystalski, who is likewise a candidate for the municipal bench on the Democratic ticket. In that event it will be necessary to cross out the name of a non-Polish candidate for that office and to be careful to vote for only ten candidates. Above all the voters should remember to vote for Joseph LaBuy and Stanley Walkowiak.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>With respect to the office of county commissioner, there will be two Polish candidates for that office on the Democratic ticket. These are Messrs. Thomas Kasperski and Albert Nowak. Polish citizens are urged to follow the same process here as in all the previously mentioned instances, namely, to choose only Polish candidates.</p>
