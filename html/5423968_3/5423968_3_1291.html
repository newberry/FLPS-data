   <p>The Polish Democratic League of Illinois deems it its duty to bring to the attention of the Poles certain points of importance relative to the present election campaign. The Polish Democratic League is not stepping to the fore with a partisan (sic) point of view. This declaration is made because it wishes to protect its and the Polish people's interest. Upon the consideration of these interests, the Polish Democratic League must condemn the party which is not only perpetrating acts of violence but is trying to deprive of their rights not only the Polish people but the poor people at large and all those not of the millionaire class. Yes, this party is trying to make all of us blind tools in their hands--to mold us into slaves of the capitalistic system, dominated by millionaires. These are the efforts that are being expended by the Republican party.</p>
   <p>One of the first points which must be brought out is called the "Force Bill," which states that if two citizens in any city over 20,000 population declare <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>before the district marshal that they do not believe that the election in this or that precinct can be carried out to the fullest extent of the law, then the said marshal can appoint two so-called special deputies to inspect the votes, deny the right to vote, count the ballots, and give a full report on the results.</p>
   <p>This law was created by the Republican party, and in the present campaign the party has decided to take advantage of it. At present the Republican District Marshal Hitchock has appointed two thousand such special deputies.</p>
   <p>Our citizens should not pay any attention to these special deputies, should ignore their idle talk and should vote as they desire. These so-called special deputies do not have any right to intimidate or influence any of the voters. In the event that such a special deputy denies anyone the right to vote, he must at the same time make and swear out an affidavit before the election judge. When such an affidavit is executed against one of the Polish voters, he should not sign it, for these special deputies are apt to do most anything to prevent one from voting. If some of the Polish voters do not <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>know how to speak English they can get an interpreter.</p>
   <p>The second point of importance in this state is the school question. A law proposed and supported by the Republicans declares that: A school which is not recognized by the director of public schools will not be considered as legitimate, and parents who send their children to such a school, and not to a public school, will be subject to a fine of from two to twenty dollars.</p>
   <p>This proposal is a direct blow at the parochial schools, which the Republican party, composed of Methodists, Baptists and representatives of other sects not of the Roman Catholic faith, wishes to see destroyed. We know only too well the position and significance of our schools, for the public schools do not give religious instruction. We know that in our schools the children are able to learn the Polish language and receive instruction in the Roman Catholic religion. This is why we should protect our schools!</p>
   <p>These are the facts which the Polish Democratic League of Illinois wishes to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>bring to light and careful consideration.</p>
   <p>Brochures and circulars relative to these matters may be had upon writing to the secretary of the Polish Democratic League; they will be sent without charge.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, president</p>
   <p>M. J. Szameit, secretary</p>
