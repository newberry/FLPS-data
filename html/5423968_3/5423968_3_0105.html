   <p>We have received the following information about the strike at the Ames and Frost bicycle factory on Goose Island:</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as the factory has refused to accede to the demands of the strikers, the Metal Trades Council has ordered a complete strike. The machinists and polishers will discontinue work also. Night workers will strike tonight and the day workers tomorrow morning. Anybody appearing for work at this factory after seven o'clock in the morning will be considered a scab by the pickets.</p>
   <p>We wish, therefore, to warn our Polish workers not to expose themselves unnecessarily to danger.</p>
