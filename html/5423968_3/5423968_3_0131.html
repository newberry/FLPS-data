   <p>Three members of the executive committee chosen at last Monday's meeting--E. Z. Brodowski, T. Krolik, and J. Mucha--went to Lemont yesterday to determine the exact conditions prevailing there among the strike victims. They visited the pastor of the Polish parish in Lemont, the Reverend K. Kozlowski, they spoke to the Polish alderman, Markiewicz, and other Polish citizens, and they visited the homes of several wounded Poles. The general impression upon the delegates corroborated all that has thus far been said and written about the attack and about the conditions in which its victims are now living. The committee will present a detailed report at the mass meeting scheduled for Sunday, June 25. This meeting will be attended by a delegation from Lemont, including Markiewicz, Madaj, and others, who will describe the whole affair to the gathering. Father Kozlowski, who cannot attend personally, will send a memorandum.</p>
   <p>Our delegates also investigated living conditions among the strikers' families and, in conjunction with the local pastor, rendered financial assistance to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>following: The families of Jaskulski and Wostanowicz each received $15; the widow of the slain Gregory Kiszka, also $15; the parents of Kluga (who died of wounds), $10; Wawrzyniec Lewandowski, $10; and Anthony Wesolowski, $5. Altogether, the delegates distributed $70.</p>
   <p>Thus, everything possible has been done so far; the relief work has definitely begun. Further steps to be taken depend upon Sunday's mass meeting.</p>
