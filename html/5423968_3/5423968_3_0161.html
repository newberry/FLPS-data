   <p>We are constantly writing and talking about the high cost of living, about the constant increase in price of the bare necessities of life. Many reasons are advanced for the cause of these conditions. Some blame it on the trusts, on the new tariff laws, the middle man, etc., but regardless of this the consumer is the one who pays.</p>
   <p>As a result, there is a movement at present to form co-operative organizations, which would check or curb abuses of these speculators and price manipulators.</p>
   <p>For example: a Michigan farmer receives from $1.00 to $1.20 for a barrel of apples at the Chicago market but by the time these apples finally reach the consumer the cost is about five cents for each apple. Now let us see what profit this farmer made on this barrel of apples at $1.20. The cost of the barrel is 30 cents, freight by boat 20 cents per barrel, the balance must cover taxes, production, packing and general overhead. From these figures it is evident that the producers' profit is insignificant.</p>
   <p>Immense profits are realized on farm products before they finally reach the consumer. The speculator and price manipulator always get their profit first. Some people think high prices are due to a shortage of apples in the United States. This, however, is not true, because Europe considers the United States the source of the finest apples. It is one of our best customers.</p>

   <p>To combat these evils, there is a movement on foot to organize co-operatives. These organizations will buy in large quantities direct from the producer and resell to the ultimate consumer at a great saving, for the profits of these middle men will be eliminated.</p>
   <p>The cooperative idea is not a new one. In Europe there are a great many of these organizations. They are functioning profitably, to the advantage of both the organization and the consumer.</p>
   <p>Very few of our people are engaged in this produce business, therefore, we do not realize any of the profits of these middle men. We are the consumers; that is why it would be wise on our part to organize a co-operative system. Our people would save hundreds of thousands of dollars on all purchases. Throughout Europe, co-operatives of this nature have been formed, in both the smaller, and the larger cities. Products of the farm and factory go directly to the consumer at a great saving. Products of the farm reach the consumer without stopping off at the cold storage warehouse.</p>
