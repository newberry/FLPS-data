   <p>A problem arose last night for the election officials in the Sixteenth Ward, when two aldermanic candidates were chosen by two Democratic factions.</p>
   <p>Stanley H. Kunz was unanimously endorsed by a group that met at 803 Milwaukee Avenue. This meeting was originally scheduled to be held at 809 Milwaukee Avenue, as announced by the convention, but there was not sufficient room there.</p>
   <p>Another Democratic faction met at 869 Milwaukee Avenue and endorsed Ludolph for alderman.</p>
