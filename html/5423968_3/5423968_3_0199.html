   <p>American newspaper syndicates, representing capital, are filled with articles of a complimentary nature-expounding the merits of the existing general prosperity in the United States. This prosperity is not a barometer of general distribution of profits, and jobs; it's only a yardstick by which we can determine the net profits and earnings of large corporations. A very good example of this misrepresentation by the American press, is the large profit earned by Mr. Gary, the Steel King; whereas, at the same time, we find many thousands unemployed and in dire need of food, clothing and shelter. It is therefore evident, that in spite of the presence of this prosperity, it cannot be classified as general.</p>
   <p>Within the last year, following the after - war crisis, England has reduced its total number of unemployed by hundreds of thousands, thus creating a truly general prosperity. Many European nations are becoming vitally interested in the cause of unemployment, and cannot forget those who seek work in vain. However, in the "Land of the Dollar" where the slogan "Help Yourself" prevails, there is the least amount of interest in the unfortunate individual who has lost his job, the source of his livelihood. This individual is forgotten by the Government which is more concerned about what it may do with the <span class="page-break">\2</span>increase of the balance in the Treasury Department. American Government and Democracy show very little interest in the people who are in these terrible straits, because of unemployment. In addition, the unemployed are forbidden to express their views, or the cause and reason for their misfortune, but, as a correlative, they are expected to marvel at the existing prosperity and wise management of our Government. In view of the great increase in personal wealth of such men as Mr. Gary, we can see no logical reason why any condition of unemployment should exist in a land of plenty.</p>
