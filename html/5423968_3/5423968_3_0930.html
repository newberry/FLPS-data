   <p>The candidacy of the well-known Mr. Peter Kiolbassa for Alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, unanimously accepted by the Democratic organization of our ward, was promptly approved the next day by the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>No primaries or any other formalities are necessary to make him a candidate in the coming election.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee, in deciding on Mr. Kiolbassa, acted wisely and well. Mr. Kiolbassa is not an ordinary candidate for office. He does not in the least desire the office; on the other hand all the people, all the Democrats of this ward, want him in this office.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa did not accept the nomination because of any personal motive or ambition or because of any desire to profit by it. He accepted it as a duty of <span class="page-break">2</span>citizenship, because he was unanimously chosen for it, and because through it he will better be able to serve his brothers and fellow citizens--which is his goal in life.</p>
   <p>It is not a question of seeking the honor of such a position, for Mr. Kiolbassa has held higher and more honorable positions in the past. He was city treasurer-one of the most honest of them all.</p>
   <p>He is known by all people in Chicago as an honorable man without a blot on his character and that is surely the highest honor.</p>
   <p>If it were a question of money, then let us understand that the salary of an alderman in the city of Chicago is only $150 a year (this amounts to less than three dollars for each session). This sum is about one third of the actual expenses incurred by each alderman participating in the sessions of the City Council, Committee meetings, etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>And if we add to this even the minimum amount of pre-election campaign expenses, there will be a decided deficit. Of course it is rumored that some of our city fathers make up this deficit and some even are able to amass a fortune by graft. We will not dwell on these insinuations, whether they are the truth or mere gossip. But everyone will agree that this is not the way our Mr. Kiolbassa, the next alderman, a man by no means wealthy, would choose to travel. He is an honest man. That his whole life is as clear as crystal is evidence of his character. Remember also the forty odd thousands of dollars of interest money which he turned over to the city when he was city treasurer. This was the first time such a thing had been done in the annals of the city of Chicago. Hence, everybody can readily understand that, regardless of what it would mean to anybody else to hold the office of alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, to Mr. Kiolbassa it would only mean more work, more trouble, and loss of time; and, in addition, it will cost him a few hundred dollars out of his own pocket.</p>
   <p>Hence, neither money nor a desire for honor has influenced Mr. Kiolbassa in <span class="page-break">4</span>accepting this candidacy.</p>
   <p>Why, then, did he accept the nomination?</p>
   <p>It was a desire to serve his fellow countrymen, work for them and be useful to them.</p>
   <p>In this case, it can truthfully be said that it is not that the candidate desires the office, but that the electorate has requested him to accept it.</p>
   <p>We felt obliged to write these few lines so as to make Mr. Kiolbassa's position clear.</p>
   <p>Some People, and there are a few, especially in the opposing political party, laugh at Mr. Kiolbassa, and say that he is being demoted from his former office as city treasurer to that of a mere alderman....The above explanation should convince these people that Mr. Kiolbassa, on the contrary, is rising to the <span class="page-break">5</span>high ideal of a true democrat, citizen, and public official, whose sole aim is to serve the people.</p>
   <p>It surely is unnecessary to remind the Polish Democratic voters of the Sixteenth Ward to support and vote for Mr. Kiolbassa. He will receive all our votes and also those of the Democrats of other nationalities. Very likely some voters belonging to other parties will vote for him because he is an honest man.</p>
   <p>We desire something more than this: We want that all Poles in the Sixteenth Ward, without, regard to their personal convictions or party affiliations to cast their votes for Mr. Kiolbassa. This should be done. All the Polish votes, as one, without exception, should be cast for Mr. Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>If this does happen, it will be positive proof that we are able properly to evaluate and honor our respected countryman and fellow citizen; that we can be proud, not only or our maturity, but also of our sensible, national unity.</p>
