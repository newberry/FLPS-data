   <p>The result of the city election here in Chicago was very advantageous to our Polonia; it has brought it great honor and esteem. There remains only one ward that hasn't supported a Pole for an office, but aside from this Polonia in general is pleased and completely satisfied with the election of Mr. John F. Smulski, as city advocate, which is in order of importance the third greatest position in our city.</p>
   <p>The excellent and great services rendered by Mr. J. F. Smulski to the general public is known to us as well as his genial sincerity and his energy. Not only have the Poles supported him, but everyone in general, that is the Americans, Irish, Italians, even the Germans.</p>
   <p>Today many write about the electoral result of our elected fellow countryman, that is every newspaper editorial, congratulating him upon his election and wishing him an everlasting success for the future; we also add our greetings and wishes to the wishes mentioned above, to one of the greatest men the Polonia has ever known of in the city of Chicago.</p>
