   <p>We hear these words almost every Sunday, thrown at us from the pulpit by people who never practice what they preach.</p>
   <p>Here in America we have Catholic priests divided in two groups, the Resurrectionists and the worldly priests, who would as soon drown themselves in a glass of water. On one side we have Dziennik Chicagoski (the Polish Daily News), while on the other Kuryer-Polski (the Polish Courier) who are not taking sides in this struggle for a better and much more comfortable life.</p>
   <p>There is one fact which we submit as an example of injustice done by one of these groups. The Resurrectionists desired to subdue their priestly adversaries, and in attempting to do this they compelled Archbishop Messmer to forbid Reverend Father Kruszka to write any further to the Kuryer Polski (The Polish Courier) while they themselves have no thought of withdrawing from this battle.</p>
   <p>This procedure, although of no value to us, is a great wrong done to Reverend Father Kruszka by the Resurrectionists and the Archbishop.</p>
   <p>Wittier and richer Resurrectionists have not been victorious.</p>
