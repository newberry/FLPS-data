   <p>At the last convention held by the so-called Gold Democrats the delegates began to mix in matters in which they were sadly defeated in the last fall elections. They wanted to foist upon the Democrats some kind of "Goldbug" for mayor. Despite the fact that all Democratic clubs of various nationalities and the ward organizations unanimously endorsed Carter H. Harrison as candidate for mayor, the left-wing Democrats did not stop their intrigues to prevent this to the very day of the convention. On the day of the convention [primary] they posted their own candidates for delegates to the city, town, and aldermanic conventions, and made strong attempts to get them elected. Persons who were candidates for delegate on their ticket thought no harm of it, for they did not know the strategy of the "Goldbugs"; only their agents knew this. Despite their schemes and tricks, however, not one of their delegates was chosen in any of the wards.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Some of the "Goldbugs" had played an important role in the Democratic party and had been nominated and elected to important positions in the city administration, but they sold out the people who had helped to keep them in their lucrative positions with their votes at the last election. They presented and supported Palmer as candidate for President of the United States not to elect him but to aid in defeating the Democratic candidate, W. J. Bryan, that McKinley might be elected instead.</p>
   <p>After the last election the eyes of many of the "Goldbugs" were opened, and their reason was illumined; they admitted their error and returned to the regular Democratic party. Yet there are some that still carry on blindly and at present have decided to continue their dishonorable and treacherous work--to sow discord in the ranks of the Democrats, to set one against the other, and to disturb and excite the Democratic organization, especially where unity and harmony prevail, and racial differences do not exist and have no place in political life. They set up independent candidates for various offices for the sole purpose of weakening the forces of the Democrats in order that they may assure victory for their <span class="page-break">\3</span>confederates, the Republicans. In [less than] two years, that is, in 1898, the election of congressmen and representatives to the State legislature will take place. It is only natural that the "Goldbugs" should fear the election of a Democratic legislature which would take up the financial question; consequently they are already assisting the Republicans as much as possible.</p>
   <p>Where do the "Goldbugs" get the money to carry on these intrigues? They get it from the same source from which they got it in the previous Republican campaign. They still wish to be considered Democrats so that they may more easily dupe the people, as they successfully did in the last November election.</p>
   <p>And even our Sixteenth Ward is not free from the agitations of the "Goldbugs". A week before the last local Democratic convention the independent aldermanic candidate began to agitate for a "Goldbug" for mayor, although he was well aware that all the Democratic clubs of the Sixteenth Ward unanimously endorsed C. H. Harrison as candidate. Four days before the convention we read in the local American press that the Sixteenth Ward had declared at least half its delegation <span class="page-break">\4</span>for the "Goldbug" candidate; nevertheless the entire independent ticket was defeated. The same thing occurred in other wards. The "Goldbugs" are working harder than ever to defeat the Democratic candidates, and under the guise of Independent Democrats they are working to effect the fall and the ruination of the Democratic party. The "Goldbugs" were and are enemies of labor, for they are agents of the capitalists, of various trusts and monopolies, and they work for their interests because the capitalists pay them for doing so.</p>
   <p>The citizens should be cautious and should not lend an ear to the Independent Democrats; many of them do not know that they are working for the "Goldbugs", and that the "Goldbugs" work for the Republicans, just as they worked for McKinley during the fall campaign. He who has not partaken enough of the golden days promised by the "Goldbugs" should vote for the independent candidates, while those who are sorry that they voted for McKinley or Palmer should vote the straight Democratic ticket. This is the only way to defeat the "Goldbugs" and the Republicans, who are working together for the defeat of the Democratic party.</p>
