   <p>Last night a political meeting was held at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. The mass meeting was sponsored by the Polish-American Democratic Club of the Sixteenth Ward. The chairman for the evening was Anthony Rudnicki and the secretary was Frank Fuhl.</p>
   <p>Although over three thousand persons attended the meeting, the younger Polish set was not well represented. This fact was pointed out in a speech by Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The stage was occupied by several priests, candidates, public officials, and guest speakers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rudnicki officially opened the meeting. He called the attention of the audience to the circulars that were recently passed out. According to these <span class="page-break">2</span>announcements, the registration day was to be Thursday, October 18; it should have been Tuesday, October 18. This error, or planned scheme, was revealed by the Dziennik Chicagoski last Saturday, the chairman concluded.</p>
   <p>The first speaker of the evening was Albert Tomasik. Other speakers took the stand in the following order: J. J. Dahlman, John Kwasigroch, A. J. Kowalski, Peter Kiolbassa, Anthony Rudnicki, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, and Alderman Stanislaus Kunz.</p>
   <p>All speakers urged everyone qualified to register to do so on Tuesday, October 18, for he who does not register will not be able to vote. It was also explained who should register and vote.</p>
   <p>The old citizens were urged to see that every member of their families eligible to register and vote should fulfill his duty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Anyone who has lost his citizenship papers should apply for a duplicate copy; this can be easily secured. These duplicate copies, however, are not essential, for an oath before the election judge will suffice in order to register.</p>
   <p>Reasons were given why the Democratic party should be supported. Mr. Kiolbassa spoke about the speech of McVeagh, who was Attorney General during Garfield's time. Reference was made to the fact that the Republicans are striving toward the centralization of authority, which is nothing but a monarchical desire on their part. Along with this, they work for the benefit of the millionaire class and the subjugation of the working class.</p>
   <p>The particulars of the speeches are not given, because all these points were touched upon in recent articles in the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>The Republicans have large campaign reserves because the millionaires willingly fill the coffers in order to be in power. There are also, unfortunately, some <span class="page-break">4</span>Polish papers that receive Republican dollars to support the principles of the Republican party. These papers are not concerned by the fact that they are supporting principles that run counter to the workers' welfare. Among these Polish papers is Nowe Zycie (New Life), which pretends to show great sympathy for the worker. The Democrats have very little money--for they are supported by the poor class of people. However, the party receives support from the loyal press. We will see which will be victorious, money or loyalty. Everyone who is interested in the victory of the party that supports the common good of the people, especially the poor, should remember to register tomorrow and then vote later.</p>
