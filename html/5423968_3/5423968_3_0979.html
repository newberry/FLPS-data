   <p>What is the most important question today?</p>
   <p>The elections.</p>
   <p>When?</p>
   <p>Tuesday, November 6.</p>
   <p>What should every sensible, honest Pole, citizen of the United States, do on that day?</p>
   <p>He should vote.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>For whom should the Poles vote?</p>
   <p>For the Democrats.</p>
   <p>And whom else should they vote for?</p>
   <p>For Polish candidates, regardless of Political party.</p>
   <p>Why should we vote for the Democratic party?</p>
   <p>Because in reality it is the people's party and it stands for freedom.</p>
   <p>Who opposes all restrictions?</p>
   <p>The Democratic party.</p>
   <p>Who are the true friends of the working people?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who condemn Pullman so severely?</p>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who abolished McKinley's Tariff Bill, which was ruining the country?</p>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who are restraining millionaires and exploiters?</p>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who give every person in America the right to pray and speak in his own language at school?</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who condemn the wicked A.P.A. [American Protective Association] ?</p>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who will assure our country a happy future?</p>
   <p>The Democrats.</p>
   <p>Who are ruining and endangering out county?</p>
   <p>The Republicans.</p>
   <p>Why should we not vote for the People's party? Because it is a young party, not yet tried, which cannot yet win a general election. Every vote</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>given to the People's party is one vote lost to the Democrats and one gained by the Republicans.</p>
   <p>And the Populists?</p>
   <p>They will not gain anything.</p>
   <p>Who will really benefit if we vote for the People's party?</p>
   <p>The enemies of the working people--the Republicans.</p>
   <p>Then, for whom should the workingman vote if he desires to better himself?</p>
   <p>He should vote only and exclusively for the Democrats.</p>
   <p>And if he will not do this?</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Then he will only help Pullman and his associates.</p>
   <p>Which party did the most good for the Poles?</p>
   <p>The Democratic party.</p>
   <p>What are the proofs?</p>
   <p>The Democratic administration employs hundreds of Poles, and more than a score of them are officials.</p>
   <p>And the Republicans?</p>
   <p>They always turned their back on us, or tried to buy us as if we were cattle.</p>
   <p>Did they succeed?</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>No, they did not succeed and never will.</p>
   <p>Are there any Polish candidates on the Republican ticket?</p>
   <p>No, there are none.</p>
   <p>Why?</p>
   <p>Because, when a Pole tried to run for county commissioner, the Republicans placed a Negro on their ballot. Therefore, let the Negroes vote for them.</p>
   <p>And who else?</p>
   <p>The Pullmans.....</p>
