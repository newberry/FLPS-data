   <p>Not so long ago, a certain Republican alderman referred to the Poles as "voting cattle," and this seems to be the view held by all members of the Republican political machine.</p>
   <p>We have additional proof of this. The State Republican convention will convene tomorrow in Springfield. How Many of the two hundred delegates from Cook County are Poles?</p>
   <p>You would think, at least twenty or more.....If you do, you are badly mistaken. There are exactly three.</p>
   <p>Of the Sixteenth Ward's seven delegates, two are Poles-Mr. John F. Smulski and Mr. J. J. Dahlman. The third Polish delegate, Mr. S. Budzbanowski, is from the Minth ward. And that is all.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It must be admitted that, in proportion to the number of votes cast for the Republican candidates at the last election, the representation is rather too little.</p>
   <p>We have said many times and repeat it now again: Our greatest misfortune has been the desertion of our Polish voters from the Democratic party....They have lost the respect of the Democrats, while the Republicans call them names.</p>
