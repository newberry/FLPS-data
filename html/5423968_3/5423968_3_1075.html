   <p>"Poles", please support Mr.Satalecki as candidate for state senator from the 9th district, with the strong support of the Poles he should be elected - he must be elected; and you Polish citizens of the 9th district support him as one as if he was the one and only Polish candidate on the ticket.</p>
   <p>In our city we have besides Mr. Satalecki two other Polish candidates; Mr. Peter Kiolbassa a Democrat, and Mr.Konstanty Lachajczyk, a very popular Polish Democrat. Both are seeking the office as county commissioners. Our city elects ten commissioners. The Polish citizens should and can, elect Mr.Kiolbassa and Mr.Lachajczyk if we show Polish solidarity. If we do not help ourselves, we can rest assured that we will not receive any help from the Swedes or the Irish. It is best that we make a note of the fact that all those Polish candidates are members of some Z.N.P. group. There are no other Polish candidates on either of the party tickets.</p>
   <p>Now is the time for us Polish citizens to open our eyes and see, that of all the candidates seeking office, there are only three Poles, "Can't we, with all the Polish citizens massed as one man elect at least three of our own countrymen?</p>
