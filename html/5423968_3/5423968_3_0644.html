   <p>We the undersigned, successful candidates in the Democratic primary election, wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all our compatriots who contributed to our nomination during the recent primary election. We now urgently request that you also honor us with your votes on election day, to be held on November 5, 1918. Poles who for various reasons voted on the Republican ticket during the primary election can cast their votes in our behalf in the November election, when every citizen can vote in favor of his candidate, regardless of party.</p>
   <p>The Republican party failed to nominate a single candidate for municipal or county office. It is therefore important to our people not only to elect us Poles but to elect us by an overwhelming majority. By so doing the Polish element will manifest its power and solidarity.</p>
   <p>Honorable Judge Joseph LaBuy, incumbent</p>
   <p>Alderman S. Walkowiak, candidate for municipal judge <span class="page-break">\2</span>Election Commissioner F. X. Rydzewski, candidate for clerk of the municipal court</p>
   <p>County Commissioners Thos. Kasperski and A. Nowak, incumbents</p>
