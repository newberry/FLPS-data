   <p>A mass meeting was held at the School Hall near Bradley Street yesterday in protest against the cold-blooded attack upon Polish strikers by the contractors in Lemont, Illinois. Less people attended than was expected, but in any case, several hundred Poles were present.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by A. W. Rudnicki; J. Arkuszewski was named chairman, and H. Nagiel secretary. The platform was occupied by members of the executive committee and a delegation from Lemont: Alderman L. Markiewicz, K. Buszkiewicz, P. Madaj, J. Katzban, and W. Groszkiewicz.</p>
   <p>E. Z. Brodowski, a member of the executive committee, reported on his trip, in company with T. Krolik and J. Mucha, to Lemont. As has already been reported, the committee distributed seventy dollars there among the strike victims. Mr. Brodowski said the visit convinced him that the matter was entirely as represented, and that the Poles were really victims of an unprovoked attack......</p>

   <p>Following this report, a letter from the Reverend R. Kozlowski, pastor of the Polish church in Lemont, was read. The pastor wrote that parish duties prevented him from coming to Chicago, but that he delegated in his stead trustworthy men who were eyewitnesses to the occurrence.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, the chairman called upon Madaj Groszkiewicz, and Markiewicz, who gave detailed accounts of the attack and of living conditions among the strikers' families. A. W. Rudnicki, J. Kamek, and others spoke on the necessity of bringing the enemies of Lemont Poles to justice and of putting an end to lawlessness.</p>
   <p>H. Nagiel read the following resolutions, which were prepared beforehand by the committee:</p>
   <p>"Since the contractor Locker and other contractors, after gathering together an armed band of white men and negroes imported from the south, criminally attacked a group of striking canal workers, among whose number were a great many Poles, firing upon them and pursuing them and thereby wounding many, of whom two are already dead; since the attack was directed not only against the strikers but <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>against individuals who had nothing in common with the strike and who were present at the place of occurrence only accidentally, as in the case of John Kluga, an employee of the Santa Fe Railroad, who died of wounds received at the hands of attackers; since such an act, the character of which has been established by eyewitnesses, by a coroner's investigation, and by Governor Altgeld's proclamation to the state legislature, is a violation of the rights of citizens of this country as well as a criminal act deserving the maximun penalty in this state; since thus far, justice has moved so slowly against the criminals that not one of them has been jailed nor brought before a court of justice; since such a deplorable state of affairs must be ended in the name of justice, and the American citizens of Polish descent feel it their duty to defend their own rights and the rights of their brethren in Lemont; and since Governor Altgeld, in his first public discussion of the case, as well as in his proclamation to the legislature, has exposed the exact state of affairs, thereby earning the acknowledgment of all justice-loving citizens for his noble support of truth; therefore, we, a gathering of American citizens of Polish descent, having met at the School Hall in St. Stanislaus Kostka parish on this twenty-fifth day of June, 1893, have decided:</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"To protest publicly against the criminal violence, lawlessness, and wrongs perpetrated upon innocent workmen on June 9 of this year;</p>
   <p>"To do everything within our power that the perpetrators be punished to the fullest extent of the law, and that the victims receive indemnity, moral and material, as far as the law allows;</p>
   <p>"To give public thanks to Governor Altgeld for his noble and impartial investigation of the matter and for his defense of the victims; and finally, to entrust the accomplishment of these resolutions to a committee of seven."</p>
   <p>On a motion by Judge [M. A.]La Buy, the above resolutions were approved unanimously. The committee of seven will act upon them by submitting a copy for publication in American newspapers, presenting a copy to Governor Altgeld and other state officials, and finally, by arranging for prosecution of the contractors and gaining indemnity for their victims.</p>

   <p>Toward the end of the meeting, the Reverend Vincent Barzynski arose to speak. The honorable speaker emphasized the need for national solidarity and a closer organization of the Polish element in America. While urging union, Father Barzynski at the same time cautioned against self-appointed leaders who take advantage of circumstances even as unfortunate as these to spread anarchy. The only proper way to accomplish anything in this or in any other case is by legal action. Father Barzynski's speech was applauded vigorously.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting closed, a voluntary collection was taken up which netted forty dollars and seventy-five cents. Mr. Maciontek added to this sum the five dollars pledged by the Polish Carpenters' Union. Owing to a composing room accident, we are compelled to delay the publishing of a complete list of contributors until tomorrow.</p>
