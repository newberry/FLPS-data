   <p>Delegates representing 16,000 Republican voters yesterday gathered at St. Stanislaus school hall, Noble and Bradley Streets, to pledge their hearty support to the Republican state, county, congressional and city tickets.</p>
   <p>Incidentally they took occasion to repudiate the efforts of N. L. Piotrowski, Democratic candidate for state treasurer, to make it appear that they were opposed by John F. Smulski, then candidate for state treasurer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Piotrowski's attack upon Smulski, made at the recent meeting of the Democratic state committee, was replied to by half a dozen speakers and Piotrowski was roundly scored. It was claimed that Piotrowski had made the attack for the purpose of diverting attention from his own record.</p>
   <p>There were present at the meeting more than 300 delegates representing the Polish American Republicans of the city. A new constitution was adopted, new officers elected and special indorsements given to all Polish candidates on the Republican ticket. Speeches were made by Walter Sehrojda, Philip Ksychi, Mal. L. Kasmar, Andrew J. Schultz, Stephen Gorechi and Stanley Popek. Victor Pijanowski was chairman of the convention and Joseph T. Spiker and S. J. Dudek secretaries.</p>
