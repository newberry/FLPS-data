   <p>We wrote in our yesterday's <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that much work is waiting President Wilson upon is return, and he will be forced by circumstances to roll up his sleeves and start a general bleaning of this country from the red element, threatening not only the League of Nations, created by Mr. Wilson, but our own country as well. The investigation conducted by the U. S. Senate corroborated our opinion by finding that Bolshevism in America is not only existing, but is growing rapidly, and is a real menace. The well known fact is that for a long period of time this Bolshevism movement was receiving moral and financial help from America. After the downfall of tsarism in Russia a group of 4000 Jews from New York left for Petrograd where they helped to overthrow Kerensky's government. They were Trotzky's and Lenin's advance-guard and, aided by thousands of their racial brothers in Russia, they resorted to terrorism and established in that unlucky country the Bolshevik regime.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>It is obvious that a country which has sent to Russia many Bolshevik half-wits and has <span class="gap">[gap]</span> them with <span class="gap">[gap]</span> collected in New York, Chicago and other Jewish centers, cannot be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> from this red plague. It is evident that <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in this country is conducted a cording to orders from the Soviets.</p>
   <p>Dr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> testimony before the Senate <span class="gap">[gap]</span> proved that Communism is more <span class="gap">[gap]</span> rooted than was supposed and for some time was laying low, being secreted in many labor and political organizations, and was <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for opportunity <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
   <p>is conducted in this country by traveling <span class="gap">[gap]</span> agitators, and by mass distribution of printed literature, such as <span class="gap">[gap]</span> newspapers, and magazines. All this destructive work is conducted by the Jews from the East Side of New York, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are the brains of this movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Further Dr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> proved that known American writers, such as John Reed and Albert R. Williams, are closely connected with the Soviet government. He pointed to the Bolshevik literature in America as the chief means of propaganda, such literature being published by the Rand School of Social Science, New York; Chas <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Co., of Chicago; the Socialist Literature, New York, and the Russian Daily Novyi Mir, New York, where Trotzky was employed some time ago as a co-editor. Another witness, called by the Senate Investigation Communists, was former Russian Consular agent for the United States, Ralph Dennis. He testified that, according to is observation for a period of two years, Russian people are not confirmed Communists, but Jews forced the idea upon them by terror. The terror was used to such an extent that whoever refused to adopt the Bolshevik doctrine was murdered. He further testified that funds used for propaganda in America were collected in this country and partially were received from the Soviets. Major Hume proved with the records that Lenin's government, on December 17, 1917, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> two million dollars for Bolshevik propaganda, especially in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Professor Dennis further testified that upon his return to America he attended a mass meeting at the Coliseum in Chicago and was very much surprised when masses of workers applauded every mention of Trotzky's name and the words of the orator who openly told them that the next country ruled by Bolsheviks will be the United States.</p>
   <p>The Senate <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and all testimonials proved beyond a doubt that the Jews are the chief <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of that destructive <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and what they accomplished in poor Russia they are trying to do in America.</p>
   <p>The red plague is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> again that Mr. Wilson on his return should <span class="gap">[gap]</span> sleeves and start <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in order to prevent is ideals from being marred by the Communist Jewry.</p>
