   <p>The Polish <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Democratic <span class="gap">[gap]</span> was organized in 1916. There were very few wards organized at first, since it was only the beginning of women's interest in political affairs. In addition, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> had differing views about the political parties. This and other factors hindered the League's development.</p>
   <p>Everything changes with time, and this <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to Politics. The Polish women citizens have come to understand their task more <span class="gap">[gap]</span> They are exerting all efforts to organize their Democratic clubs in nearly every ward where Poles are found.</p>
   <p>In order to create a better understanding, to form a powerful political unit, and, at the same time, to aid our fellow Poles, the undersigned have devised the idea of organizing all Polish-American <span class="gap">[gap]</span> With this purpose in mind, they are calling a meeting of all Poles at the Democratic headquarters, the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> on <span class="gap">[gap]</span> February <span class="gap">[gap]</span> at 2:00 P. M., and all Polish women</p>
