   <p>A meeting of the special commission appointed by the president of the Polish Democratic League of Cook County was held last Tuesday in accordance with the decision made at the extraordinary session of delegates from various wards held last November at the Briggs Hotel. This special commission was instructed by the League to take charge of the candidacy of Poles for various city and county offices in the coming fall elections.</p>
   <p>The commission consists of the following members: Peter Jezierny, of the 12th Ward; Francis K. Derdzinski, 5th Ward; Michael Kiollassa, 17th Ward; Bruno S. Galecki, 29th Ward; Ignatius Frasz, 11th Ward; Walter Orlikowski, 16th Ward; Stanislaus Bloch, 8th Ward; Jacob Bzdek the Ward[Ward number Amissing]; and Theophilus Kwidzinski, 24th Ward. The president and secretary of the League also enter the commission as ex officio members.</p>
   <p>At Tuesday's meeting, the political situation of the present time was taken <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>under consideration, especially as it concerns the Polish candidates for the offices of municipal judge, county commissioner, sanitary district trustee, and so on. It developed during the discussion that some Poles have already announced their candidacy. Members of the commission urged F. Danisch to become a candidate for clerk of the municipal court again. Be insisted, however, that his original decision stands and that he will not be a candidate for this or any other office.</p>
   <p>The commission then turned its attention to discussion of the best way of preparing a list of candidates for various offices. After long debate, it was decided that the Polish Democratic League of Cook County, in existence for over twenty-six years and counting among its members Poles occupying some of the highest offices in Chicago and in Cook County, call upon all Poles who either are or wish to be candidates for public office to submit written notice of their candidacy to the Secretary of the League, Francis H. Landmesser, Room 814, City Hall.</p>

   <p>It was also decided to confer, if possible, with other committees or individuals working in this field in order to remove all barriers to possible compromises that would help to bring peace and harmony into Polish political circles. The commission named above purposely does not include candidates for office; it was decided, therefore, to treat only with similar committees, for if such a committee includes the candidates themselves, those candidates, as parties concerned, can easily upset plans for an agreement.</p>
   <p>The president of the League announced that the highest political figures in Chicago held a conference not long ago, at which were discussed far-reaching plans concerning the coming campaign. In the president's opinion, a struggle is brewing between two Democratic factions. This is a situation that must be considered in connection with the possibilities of Polish candidates. If the factions do not reach an agreement, the president advised that the Poles side with that faction which has done most for them, that is, with the Harrison faction.</p>
