   <p>Besides Mr. J. F. Smulski, who received the Republican aldermanic nomination in the 16th ward, we were informed that he will be opposed by a Pole, Mr. August Kowalski, Democratic candidate, seeking the same office.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Kiolbassa, a Democrat, is seeking the office of tax supervisor for West Town; Mr. Stanley Pulaski is also seeking the office of tax supervisor for Jefferson, on the Democratic ticket. Up to the present time the Democratic party has nominated three Polish candidates for offices, while the Republican has only one.</p>
   <p>All candidates have not been nominated for offices as yet, so we may see more Polish names on the ballot before election time.</p>
