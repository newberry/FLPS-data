   <p>In the municipal elections in Chicago the Poles gained an unusual victory.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the close cooperation of all Poles, we succeeded in electing five Polish aldermen.</p>
   <p>We may be very proud of this; but, as the Polish papers here emphasize, are these newly elected aldermen going to be a credit to our community, or rather a disgrace?</p>
   <p>This is a vital question. We have here Judge Jarecki, who through his honesty won a good name for himself and our community. We shall be very glad if we can say the same about the new aldermen.</p>
