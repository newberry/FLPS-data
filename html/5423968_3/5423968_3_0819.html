   <p>All Poles in Chicago can and should vote for Peter Rostenkowski for county commissioner.</p>
   <p>His name will be found on the Democratic ticket and because it is Polish and long it will be easy for every one to find and place an X in front of it.</p>
   <p>The county commissioner is the father of the poor, a guardian of the ill-treated and neglected, also master of public establishments.</p>
   <p>Peter Rostenkowski is known throughout all the Polish neighborhoods as kind-hearted, a hard worker and honest. It would be very good for us Poles if he is elected county commissioner.</p>

   <p>We can have him if all Poles in various sections of Chicago can remember that a good an reliable fellow citizen, Peter Rostenkowski, is seeking the votes of all Polish citizens so that he may be elected county commissioner.</p>
   <p>Remember, fellow citizens, that you were first a Pole before you became a Republican or a Democrat. Vote for your own fellow brother, that will be enough.</p>
