   <p>Here are several reasons why Stanley Adamkiewicz should be elected alderman of the Seventeenth Ward:</p>
   <p>1. Adamkiewicz is supported by the united Democratic factions.</p>
   <p>2. A majority of the people living in the Seventeenth Ward are Poles.</p>
   <p>3. It is an injustice that the same individual, a Republican at that--regardless of whether he be German, Dutch, or Danish--should be for fourteen years alderman of the Seventeenth Ward, where neither Republicansnor Dutchmen constitute a majority.</p>
   <p>4. Adamkiewicz has lived in this ward for twenty-five years. He is a sincere <span class="page-break">2</span>Pole and a good American citizen. He is known for his honesty and willingness to serve.</p>
   <p>5. Adamkiewicz has the support of the influential Poles of the Seventeenth Ward, such as Alderman S. Walkowiak, Ward Committeeman J. Ruszkiewicz, F. Wejna, Judge J. La Buy, Commissioner [M.] Kolassa, S. Gorecki, S. Kielczynski, and such Republicans as F. Ksycki, B. Dombrowski, F. Schweda, and others.</p>
   <p>6. In case of need it is much more pleasant for the Poles to turn to one of their own countrymen than to a stranger, for the latter would later keep reminding them of favors granted, thus making political capital out of them.</p>
   <p>7. Adamkiewicz will always be ready to serve all the citizens of the Seventeenth Ward, and he is known for his ability to appreciate any confidence placed in him.</p>
   <p>There are several questions for Mr. Sitts to answer in regard to his official record.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Will Mr. Sitts dare swear that he has never expressed himself to the effect that "Those Pollacks give me too much trouble"?</p>
   <p>Is it not true that he did only what he was absolutely forced to do for the Poles, in order not to alienate them completely?</p>
   <p>Why does he give himself all the credit for matters in which others participated?</p>
   <p>Does not Mr. Sitts feel embarrassed by the fact that he does not know that the building site of the Polish Roman Catholic Union was purchased from the streetcar company and not from the city?</p>
   <p>Is it not a fact that it was not he, but Alderman Walkowiak and Mr. Adamkiewicz, who managed to obtain this site from the streetcar company at a lower price?</p>
   <p>Is it not a fact that Alderman Walkowiak was a great deal more instrumental than</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Mr. Sitts in the purchasing of the public school at the corner of Division and Cleaver Streets?</p>
   <p>Is it not a fact that good lighting of the streets of the Seventeenth Ward was not brought into the ward until four years ago, and that this was due to the efforts of Alderman Walkowiak exclusively, while Mr. Sitts, who has held this office for fourteen years, has been unable to do anything?</p>
   <p>Why does Mr. Sitts not attend the meetings of the committees of the City Council? Why does he not try to have the dirt and mud removed from the streets and alleys of his ward?</p>
   <p>Why were Carpenter and May Streets closed while he was in office?</p>
   <p>Why is Augusta Street not paved yet?</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Finally, is it not a fact that he voted that the property of the Automatic Telephone Company, appraised at $6,000,000, be sold for $500,000?</p>
