   <p>April 1st is election day in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Until 6 o'clock, March 24th, we didn't receive any information as to the candidates selected to run on the Democratic ticket; according to rumors, we know of only one Polish candidate on the Democratic ticket, he is Mr. August Kovalski, seeking re-election as alderman of the 16th ward.</p>
   <p>Mr. August Kowalski has held the aldermanic office of the 16th ward for the past two years, and he elevated himself with his own efforts and he gave protection and assistance to his fellow comrades in all their undertakings, and did his utmost to help them in their hour of need.</p>
   <p>We can have complete confidence that if he is re-elected he will continue to show his good will and efficient work. In the 16th ward only one Democratic candidate will run for alderman. This is to make sure that Mr. A. Kowalski, a Polish candidate, will not meet any opposition, and be assured of the best possible chance of victory; by this move they are keeping all the votes of the Polish People on the Democratic side, thus avoiding a split in the party's vote.</p>

   <p>We are sure that all Polish Democratic voters of the 16th ward, without any exception, will give their support to Mr. August Kowalski. Candidates seeking other offices are asking all Polish voters for support. Because of the strength in Polish votes, I, Mr. Kowalski, a candidate for re-election am depending on Poles to carry me back into my office.</p>
