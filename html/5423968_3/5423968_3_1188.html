   <p>Last evening, after completing its business, the dramatic circle of St. Stanislaus Parish made known its support of Mr. J. Kondziorski in the informal resolution specially worked out by the committee.</p>
   <p>This dramatic circle of St. Stanislaus Parish never mixed in politics before, but this time it makes an exception, because it wishes to inform the general public that its members are proud of the fact that one of its most eminent members, Mr. J. Kondziorski, is seeking office as city counsellor.</p>
   <p>We know his capability and ideals as a citizen. We recommend him to our fellow countrymen of the 16th ward, and urge you with all sincerity to cast your vote for him, a vote for the good of all of us in general. We wish to have this resolution published in all Polish newspapers.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
   <p>Joseph Grabowiecki, President.</p>
