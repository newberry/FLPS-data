   <p>The Democrats of the Thirtieth Ward held a meeting last Monday evening in W. Piasecki's Hall at the corner of 48th and Wood Streets, in Town of Lake.</p>
   <p>After Mr. T. Szarkowski had called the meeting to order, Mr. Vincent Muszynski was made chairman and the undersigned was made secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Muszynski then spoke and urged those in the audience to give their heartiest support to our countryman, Mr. Michael Gryszczynski, who is a candidate for clerk of Town of Lake. Mr. Gryszczynski is a young man, universally known and liked. The fact that he received the Democratic nomination shows that he is highly respected by other nationalities. Every Pole should vote for him.</p>
   <p>Next,Mr. Gryszczynski, who was present in the hall, was called upon to speak.</p>

   <p>He spoke only briefly, but in his short speech he was able to gain the good will of the entire audience.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Mr. John Paczkowski, who contended that it was our sacred duty to elect a Pole to this important position.</p>
   <p>Mr. Martin Koscielniak, Mr. John Sawinski, Mr. W. Piasecki, and others, also spoke.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gryszczynski received the unanimous endorsement of all those present at the meeting, and they all promised that they would vote for him on election day regardless of party affiliation.</p>
   <p>W. Piasecki, secretary.</p>
