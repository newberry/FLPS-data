   <p>Yesterday evening there was held in the Bohemian-American hall a Democratic caucus, at which the Democrats, opposed to Sabath, resolved to slate I. F. Dankowski as a candidate for Congress from the fifth district.</p>
   <p>Dankowski is now assistant to the judge of the Probate Court and resides in the eleventh ward; is is the most powerful counter-candidate to Sabath, whose political career in that district, as regarded by many, is doomed since he recent school scandal, with which he was connected.</p>
   <p>With Mr. Jan Czekala, as candidate for Congress from the eight district we may cherish the hope that in the next Congress we will have two Polish congressmen from Chicago. In the interest of the Polish cause, those candidates should receive the support of all Poles, regardless of party differences or of particular factional programs.</p>
