   <p>A big political rally for Stanley Adamkiewicz, who is running for the office of alderman of the Seventeenth Ward, was held yesterday at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall. A record-breaking crowd came to the hall, which, together with the gallery, was jammed to capacity. Attorney William Young, Alderman Stanley Walkowiak, Stanley Kielczynski, and J. Ruszkiewicz were the main speakers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamkiewicz spoke also and was enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>Although the general opinion is that Adamkiewicz's election is assured, we must not step working for a moment. Let us see to it that our candidate wins by an overwhelming majority.</p>
