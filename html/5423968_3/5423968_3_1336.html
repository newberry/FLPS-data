   <p>Yesterday's election results, unfortunately, did not favor any of our candidates, although as a whole, the Democrats won more seats than the Republicans. The results have shown that in the Wards where the Polish population is small, their strength in other wards was not strong enough to offset other forces.</p>
   <p>Our candidate for West Town Collector, August J. Kowalski, polled a large plurality in the Polish wards. But this was not large enough to offset the votes of the Republican candidate polled in other wards.</p>
   <p>The same fate faced our Polish candidate for South Town Supervisor. Although he piled up a heavy vote in the first and sixth wards, he gave way to his Republican opponent in other wards.</p>
