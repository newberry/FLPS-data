   <p>Yesterday, Tuesday December 12, a number of citizens met at the Briggs House for the purpose of forming a Polish Republican League of Cook County. Among those present was John F. Smulski, J. E. Dudek, S. W. Haremski, Leon M. Wild, and S. Rokosz. Mr. John F. Smulski was chosen as temporary president.</p>
   <p>Personally, we judge--and say so openly--that organizing such a league is not timely at the moment. It leads to a split in the Polish strength and can only damage the Polish cause.</p>
