   <p>The Poles of the Fifteenth Ward have received good news. At the regular Democratic convention held at Wendell's Opera House, 1504 Milwaukee Avenue, Jacob B. Pallasch, a Pole, about whom articles have appeared in our paper, was nominated unanimously for alderman of the Fifteenth Ward, in spite of the fact that he had a strong opponent in the person of George M. Kramer. The Democrats of the Fifteenth Ward are united, and Mr. Pallasch will be elected alderman if the Poles will support him and if no Pole will neglect to vote. Only indifference of the Poles on election day might cause his defeat. We will take up this matter again.</p>
