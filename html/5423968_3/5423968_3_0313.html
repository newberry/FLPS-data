   <p>In that terrible overthrow caused by the World War, all those factors that go into the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of individual societies, give an account somehow before the entire humanity of their moral strength. In a well nigh general revolution a deliverance has been anticipated by the till now, the socialistic parties world avail themselves of such an exceptional opportunity and would show at last to humanity, tormented by war, the good fortune, so boisterously promised by them up to this time. Unfortunately, Socialism has disappointed humanity completely, and disappointed above all because it did not find in itself sufficient moral strength. It hid itself under the wings of that power, which it has fought <span class="gap">[gap]</span> now with utmost stubborn persistency, under the protectorate of Prussian <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of liberty.
