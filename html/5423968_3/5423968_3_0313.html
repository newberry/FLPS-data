   <p>In that terrible overthrow caused by the World War, all those factors that go into the composition of individual societies, give an account somehow before the entire humanity of their moral strength. In a well nigh general revolution a deliverance has been anticipated by the till now, the socialistic parties world avail themselves of such an exceptional opportunity and would show at last to humanity, tormented by war, the good fortune, so boisterously promised by them up to this time. Unfortunately, Socialism has disappointed humanity completely, and disappointed above all because it did not find in itself sufficient moral strength. It hid itself under the wings of that power, which it has fought till now with utmost stubborn persistency, under the protectorate of Prussian autocracy, the greatest foe of liberty. Not only in Germany, but in England, in France, and even in the United <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>States, Socialism has gone under the command of German pacifists, and instead of encouraging humanity against the pressure of Prussian autocracy, instead of making her conscious about the danger threatening her with social slavery, it has endeavored to restrain the hands of the people, so as to render then harmless in self-defence and let them be put in irons as soon as possible by the fellows of the Pan-German autocracy. Socialism, with its fatal mark: "Made in Germany." became the most fatal catastrophe for the awakened-to-liberty revolutionary Russia. It has crushed and broken her into many parts and turned her over to prey to the Germans, sold her for the silver of Judas, to the apostles of overthrow, Lenin and Trotzky. To accomplish its disaster, the overthrow started to cleanse its abominable paws in innocent blood, in violence, in murders, in destruction. Through this it has evoked against itself a most effective and most powerful reaction because it has opened the eyes of society and all of humanity, attesting to its infirmity and above all lack of moral strength.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>But beyond the borders of destruction, performed through anarchy, and through the dread of incessant wars, was still the life of millions of farm folk and the working class of people. Socialism, destroying means of production, has give life to misery and despair, and all other parties, seeing human property so terribly broken up, have withdrawn from the place of catastrophe and with the remains of their property have gone to places where there has not been any war, to rest and live. They left the people to the graces of the foe. So it was in Russian Poland and so it was in Galicia. The party leaders were disputing and arguing in Petrograd, Moscow, and Vienna, and the Polish people were suffering in underground tunnels, bogs, and dense forests.</p>
   <p>However, these people were not completely abandoned. There was one protector, fealess against the foe, who did not forsake those people, did not betry them or deceive them. That protector was the clergy, our bishops and priests. When everybody though about themselves, when <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>everybody was dreaming about some safe hiding place for himself, the Polish bishops and the Polish priests, thought only how they could save and give security to the people. When the Germans came into Warsaw, the found Archbishop Karowski there, and when the Russians invaded Lwow, Przemysl and Tarnow, they found there Rev. Archbishop Bilczewski, Rev. Bishohp Pelczar and Rev. Bishop Walega. In Cracow, imperiled to continuous intriques of the political and war authorities, Rev. Bishop Sapieha remained at his post as a good shepherd. Visiting the war devastated Fatherland, I have see all of them at work with the people and for the people. I saw tem as fearless apostles of the Lord and intercessors and guards of the Polish peasant and worker. That was the only factor, which pointed out and proved its moral power in that terrible catastrophe. Through this power it strengthened the life resistance of our people and to a high degree, lessened the disaster caused by the invaders, Imbrued in his own blood the Polish <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>peasant and the Polish laborer came to the conviction that Catholicism in this terrible moment was able to give him a hand and protection. This conviction I myself also gained, looking upon that devotion, worthiness, perseverance and nobility of the Polish clergy.</p>
   <p>Such apostles are out priests here in American under the leadership of our Most Rev. Bishop Rhode, Honorary Chaplain of our Union. I know perfectly that they also would never forsake the people. I know that if it came to that, they would lay down their own lives for the people entrusted to them. Why, a whole file of them took over posts as military chaplains in Polish-American regiments as well as in our army of Volunteers.</p>
   <p>It was show that our clergy is not Roman as is insidiously voiced by the Independents, but it is Polish in blood and spirit, just as are the people. It was shown also that those people did not cease to <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>be Polish by being Catholic. Those people did not go to plunder, pillage and murder the innocents, did not rush upon the inheritors, did not ruin and burn century-old property. The Polish people likewise did not abandon their farms, their own sacred land, but worked for it to the last breath, so as to save that nourisher of the nation. So worked and is working in the Fatherland the clergy and the people.</p>
   <p>But here with us everything is the same, but never the less different. Out of four million immigrants, only 100,000 belong to our Union. And the rest of them? They are Catholics from their religious practices, they take active part in the parish life, but externally, looking out on the world beyond their own parish, they have not the courage to demonstrate Catholicism in the fire of the fundamental campaign. They do not deny it in reality however in the alliance of Catholicism. They are not its first guard; they are not knights of the faith. This create continual coquetry with radical shadows as if trying to apologize before them because of Catholicism. This, from the nature of things, <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>weakens moral power; this opens up a breach in Polish families and this creates liberalism and fanaticism ending in bolshevism. This path, however does not lead to the salvation of Poland but turns her over as prey to foreign intriques. On this road, Russia and her in its power, making it easier for the Austrians to conquer us in Russian Poland. That road also presents to us Poles here the greatest danger. in order to escape it, we have to unite, we have to group ourselves in the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, we have to complete the character of the Poles with the character of Catholicism. Through Catholicism we will make firm for ourselves everything of Polish origin. Through Catholicism we will unite four million Poles in this country of freedom into one powerful mass, conscious of its aims. Through Catholicism the endeavors of Poland will take on a Polish character and will crystallize themselves in a great power of national <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>development. For that reason every good parishioner ought to belong to the Polish Roman-Catholic Union. There should not be a parishioner who does not belong to the Union. Let all the factors called upon vigorously endeavor to bring this about.</p>
