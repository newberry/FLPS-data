   <p>The following letter was received for publication in Dziennik [Chicagoski]:</p>
   <p>"We have the pleasure to announce that a new Democratic Club, consisting exclusively of Polish workingmen, has just been organized in the 16th Ward. Our aim is to protect the political interests of the workingman and to prevent the recurrence of such incidents as took place on the Lake Front, where, instigated by anarchists, a number of our brethern participated in riots, bringing disgrace to the Polish name.</p>
   <p>"It is also our desire to get the Polish people of Chicago to realize that they are being politically exploited by the Irish, the Germans, and sometimes by their own countrymen. Today, despite the fact that we have our own leaders, nothing is ever done for us, except, perhaps, for an occasional 'handout'.</p>
   <p>"We have named the new Democratic club after Washington; its executive committee has already been organized. The officers are as follows: F. Partyka, president; T. Szajkowski, secretary; Sikucinski, treasurer; and A. Zwiewka, P. Mazurkiewicz, and T. Wojtalewicz, directors. To date, the club has more than forty members.</p>
   <p>"The work has been begun and it now remains to continue it. We appeal to all the Polish workingmen in the 16th Ward for support. The next meeting, at which new members will be admitted, will be held on September 23, at Rudnik's Hall, corner of Dickson and Blackhawk Streets.</p>
   <p>"T. Szajkowski, secretary"</p>
