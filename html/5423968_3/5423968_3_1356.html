   <p>Certain American newspapers have begun an earnest campaign for the general installation of water meters in the city of Chicago. The first battle has already been fought in the city council, and the result was a vote of 22-29 (sic). Aldermen who opposed the installation of water meters, when asked the reasons for their opposition, said that they are not personally against the innovation, but that they are merely reflecting the sentiments of the people in their wards who are opposed to it; some workers' organizations have vigorously protested against the measure.</p>
   <p>Newspapers which are agitating for water meters do not present the matter clearly and exhaustively to the public, but try, in a general way, to convince the public that the measure is for the good of the poor people, that the rich who use a great deal of water will have to pay most, that something must be done because of the half-million-dollar summer deficit in the water department, and so on.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>However, these arguments do not seem to be enough to convince the poor people, who defend instinctively every new attack upon their purses, and who, behind the camouflage of arguments about "public good," something related to the gas situation.</p>
   <p>While the matter should concern all of us, very little is being said. It would be worth while to present it to our people in the proper light.</p>
   <p>One might ask, "To whom are these water meters so important, and who is paying for the campaign to install them?" A little thought and the question answers itself. Chicago has at present a population of over three million; let us ask now, how many residential buildings, and approximately how many homes, can such a large city have? Water meters, after all, are not made of paper or of wood, but of metal. How enormous would be the cost of manufacture and installation of these meters? Who will pay for all this? And the answer to that is: Everyone who lives in a house and uses water. The water department would have to be expanded, and water meter readers added to its staff. It is doubtful whether <span class="page-break">\3</span>the half-million-dollar water deficit would be enough to pay for the extra help.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, every dweller would have to pay for water, just as he is now paying for gas, and he would have to depend upon the "honesty" of the meter reader. In the event that the measure passes and meters are installed, will the owners of buildings lower rents? It is to be doubted. And the poor people, living in dark apartments and basement flats, will have to pay for water in the same proportion as the rich. And water, that one privilege of the poor, would become an article of luxury, for everyone would fear even to bathe his poor, dirty little children, most numerous among the poor, of course, in order not to raise the cost of living.</p>
   <p>The rich would pay? Ha, ha! A crow will not peck out the eyes of another crow, as the old saying goes. The rich will not allow themselves to be harmed, while to the poor, water will become as gas is today.</p>
   <p>This is why the working public opposes this innovation, not because it is an <span class="page-break">\4</span>innovation, but because it feels that water meters will become a new source of exploitation. I have seen and carefully studied the struggles over the water meter question in various other cities; the vigorous opposition of the working public defeated the attempts at installation of water meters, and I have hopes that it will be the same in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The city can find other means of covering the deficit in the water department.</p>
   <p>Away with water meters!</p>
