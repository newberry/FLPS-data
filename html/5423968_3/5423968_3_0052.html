   <p>The parade held yesterday in Lawrence, Mass., was arranged by the organization of the Industrial Workers of the World. It came to an end with a battle between the police and the marching workers, on the busiest streets of Lawrence. In this battle knives, clubs, stones, and revolvers were used.</p>
   <p>Two policemen were badly wounded when several of the workers stabbed them with knives. One policeman was severely beaten and many of the workers were injured by the policemen's clubs and bullets.</p>
   <p>This conflict started when the police department wanted to halt the paraders and brutally attacked them under the pretext that they did not have a police permit for the parade.</p>
   
   <p>Eye-witnesses assert that the signal for this bloody fight was given by a policeman who fired the first shot at a girl who was participating in the parade, slightly wounding her. This incident made the workers very angry. They retaliated by attacking these brutal policemen with their clubs and guns, and a bloody battle started, with the above mentioned result.</p>
   <p>About 20,000 workers participated in yesterday's parade; of these, 700 came from Boston and a few thousand from other cities of the state.</p>
   <p>The indignation in the ranks of the workers is terrible, and it is greatly feared that the second parade which is to take place today will result in a more serious conflict than the one mentioned, if the policemen will continue to show their brutality to the workers, by attacking them with guns, clubs, and blackjacks.</p>
