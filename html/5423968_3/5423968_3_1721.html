   <p>On Saturday evening, a group of prominent Poles presented a beautiful golden star to E. Z. Brodowski, park commissioner, at a banquet held in his honor at Nalepinski's Hall on Noble Street.</p>
   <p>Readers of Dziennik Chicagoski know that Mr. Brodowski has always used his influence for the good of his brethren, and that he has already found employment for many Poles; because of this, Brodowski's friends and acquaintances have long felt that he deserves acknowledgement.</p>
   <p>A committee was organized....and it was decided that a star be presented to Brodowski. Once organized, the committee went rapidly to work; several hundred dollars were collected, the beautiful memento was purchased, and the formal presentation made at Saturday's banquet.</p>
   <p>Nalepinski's Hall was well filled with representative Poles. [List omitted by translator].</p>
   <p>Mr. Brodowski was greeted enthusiastically when the committee escorted him into the hall. He was seated in the place of honor and formally presented with the gift. The star is of pure gold; at the top, it is inscribed with the name: "E. Z. Brodowski"; a laurel wreath and the words "Chicago Park Commissioner" appear in the center, while on the opposite side, the inscription "From Friends, June 17, 1893," in Polish, is engraved.</p>
   <p>Leon Szopinski made the presentation address in the committee's name. He lauded the park commissioner for his unflagging energy and his zeal for the welfare of his countrymen. He added that the deep gratitude expressed in the gift just presented was entirely earned. Mr. Brodowski replied to this address with emotion. He expressed his sincere thanks for the gift and explained that in taking his oath of office, he made an oath to himself. He swore that he would always strive his utmost for the welfare of his countrymen.....Not a golden star nor any gift can give him such pleasure as the hearts of his friends, in which was born the thought of honoring him with this fraternal offering, he said. Needless to say, Mr. Brodowski's speech was warmly applauded. The formalities of the occasion were concluded with these speeches. There followed a series of informal speeches and toasts, both in Polish and in English. Judge [M. A.] La Buy was an excellent toastmaster; he called upon and introduced speakers with inexhaustible humor. In his own speech, he spoke of how he happened to meet Mr. Brodowski, and how he immediately recognized political qualifications in him. The list of speakers who praised Mr. Brodowski in glowing terms, calling forth much merriment with apt witticisms, is a long one; we can mention only a few of the names. There were speeches and toasts by the engineer Marynski of California, a former schoolmate of Brodowski, M. Drzemala, H. Nagiel, and R. Kotlowski. W. Smulski, A. J. Kowalski, John F. Smulski, and Alderman Stanley Kunz also spoke. A. Sherman, one of Chicago's oldest residents, and Alderman Ellert spoke in English. The latter touched upon the recent honorable action of Mr. [Peter] Kiolbassa, and expressed his opinion that Brodowski, as a business partner of Kiolbassa, is a man of the same caliber.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa's speech was an extensive one. He spoke of old times when there were but few Poles in Chicago and pointed to the promising development of the colony. Such development could result only from hard work and unshaken honesty. We can move along various paths to a common goal, but we should always keep that goal in sight, he said. The speaker admitted that he had not always agreed with Mr. Brodowski, but he had always seen in him a man who is honest, capable, energetic, and sincere in his desire to help his brethren. Let us all follow this example of smoothing out disagreement, of broad-mindedness and harmony, and we will attain excellent results.</p>
   <p>The address by Doctor Casimir Midowicz is worthy of attention. He said that here in America we are all struggling with fate and that Mr. Brodowski has shown unusual strength in this struggle. Besides this, he has always been kindly, sincere, and ready to give help to anyone who needed it, with no regard for partisanship. Dr. Midowicz concluded his speech by calling for a collection for the Kosciusko Memorial Fund, of which Brodowski is president. The collection exceeded expectations, totaling $44.27. The merry gathering broke up at midnight.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brodowski was born in Poznan in 1852. He finished gymnasium in Szrem and later attended the university at Wroclaw. In 1876 he came to America, settling in New York, where he became editor of the Kuryer (Courier). Later, he migrated to California, where he was elected to public office. Brodowski came to Chicago in 1884. At one time, he was editor of Zgoda, both here and in Milwaukee. In 1889 he retired from journalism to enter business. Today, as a partner of Peter Kiolbassa, he is one of the foremost Polish businessmen in Chicago.</p>
