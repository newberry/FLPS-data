   <p>Chicago, Oct. 8, 1879.</p>
   <p>To the Editor of the Tribune:</p>
   <p>In your editorial of this morning, I see that you class the socialistic organization as being made up of know-nothings, Germans, Scandinavians, Bohemians, French-men, and Poles.</p>
   <p>Now, I do solemnly protest against you, or any other paper, slandering the Polish people as socialists. The Poles of this city, or of any other city or town in this union, have nothing to do with socialism, and challenge you to point out one Pole who has anything to do with that organization.</p>
   <p>Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
