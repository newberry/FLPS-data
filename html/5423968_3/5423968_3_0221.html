   <p>Frank Dombrowski, unemployed, living on Dickson St., left his home in despair to see the county agent in regard to relief for his wife and four children.</p>
   <p>In his absence his wife received a letter from him advising her he was going to commit suicide in the lake. He however, did not commit suicide and decided it would be better to die of hunger than to take his life.</p>
   <p>His wife was left destitute with the oldest child 9 years old, and the youngest nine months. Friends collected a sum of money which was turned over to her. Peter Kiolbassa, a city official, stated there were many such cases.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dombrowski returned home and, when informed of state of affairs, left again. He reached a small town in Indiana, 34 miles from Chicago, and received temporary work. He worked ten days and with his earnings returned to his family. He thanked all who helped his family.</p>
