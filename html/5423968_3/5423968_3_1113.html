   <p>Alderman S. Adamkiewicz of the 31st ward, appeared at Mayor Dever's office as a representative of the newly formed organization, The Polish American Club. This club represents all Polish clubs in Cook County. The alderman demanded that one Pole be indorsed of the eight who are aspiring for the office of County Treasurer. He believes the candidate, the Polish American Club Committee prefers, is Mr. August J. Kowalski, vice president of the Northwestern Bank.</p>
   <p>In 20 wards the Poles have a total of 160,000 votes,of which 90 per cent will cast their vote for the Democratic party. Each Pole who is aspiring for the office of County Treasurer, is anxious to be indorsed by the Democratic organization, because they realize it would mean a victory. On the other hand the Poles are entitled to better representation.</p>
   <p>Mayor Dever, always friendly to the Poles, promised to give his opinion on the matter as soon as possible.</p>
