   <p>At the political meeting of the Democratic club of the 16th Ward, which was held on July 3, it was found that thirty-four new members enrolled. The club now numbers seventy-four members. It was decided that funds necessary for the club be collected by means of voluntary contributions. The next meeting will be held this coming Sunday. We will have the opportunity to remind the citizens concerning this matter during this week.</p>
