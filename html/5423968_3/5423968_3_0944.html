   <p>We are reliably informed, that Attorney N. L. Piotrowski, well known in Bridgeport, intends to be a candidate for alderman of the Sixth Ward. Mr. Piotrowski will probably receive the nomination on the Democratic ticket; if this does not happen, he intends to run on an independent ticket.</p>
   <p>We wish him success!</p>
