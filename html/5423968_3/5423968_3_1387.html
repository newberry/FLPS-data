   <p>Right now, since our State Legislature has adjourned its sessions, is the time to review its accomplishments.</p>
   <p>Were we favored with many beneficial laws? What political party had the strongest influence in making new laws? Which of these laws are most beneficial?</p>
   <p>Every citizen of the State of Illinois ought to be interested in this important matter. The Poles in Chicago, never before were so keenly interested in politics as this year. Never before have they tried to understand so thoroughly city, state, and national politics as at present. Not long ago these Poles attracted the attention of all nationalities on account of taking a great part in political activities. They had their representative in the State Legislature, (J. Kwasigroch) and two representatives in the City Council, <span class="page-break">\2</span>(Kunz and Dahlman, Aldermen). And in the City Hall (P. Kiolbassa, City Treasurer), and on the County Board (W. Bardonski, a county commissioner). They would certainly like to learn and memorize the most important of these laws, and are certain that Dziennik Chicagoski will publish their review.</p>
   <p>We will do this though we cannot go into details. Attention is called to articles which have already appeared in our journal. Those who read our paper carefully do know that there was no shortage of these articles during the last half year. However, we are willing to supply any one with better information on this or any other issue in the future numbers of our paper, if some one demands it.</p>
   <p>The Dominating Party</p>
   <p>The dominating and victorious group during the last Illinois State Legislature was the Democratic party. It enacted many practical laws, and gave impulse <span class="page-break">\3</span>to those which could not be passed on account of a strong opposition, so that they would be passed in the future. The opposition, the Republican party, limited its activities to objecting, interfering, and opposing democratic principles, and hindering the propositions presented by the Democrats. It was a hard fight, but it would not have been so hard if the Democrats had had a decisive majority. This year, however, our State Legislature was in such a condition that in reality, no party had a decisive majority. The Democrats had one hundred and one members, the Republicans had one hundred. The so-called farmers, who leaned to either side, which of course, made that party victorious, had three members. Furthermore, the Republicans had a decisive majority in the Senate, for they had twenty-six members, and the Democrats had twenty-four, but the Democrats had the decisive majority in the House of Representatives. They had seventy-seven members, and the Republicans seventy-three. The three farmers were also members of the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>Before any measure becomes a law it must pass both houses, that is, the House <span class="page-break">\4</span>of Representatives and the Senate. Besides, it must be signed by the Governor of the State. It was easy, therefore, for the Republicans in the Senate to reject any measure adopted by the House of Representatives. This happened to many measures.</p>
   <p>Consequently, the fight was very hard, and the plurality of one member which the Democrats had, did not help very much. It was necessary to fight with convincing argumentations by the gaining of public opinion, and winning over the stubborn farmers. It was necessary to fight by intelligent reasoning and not by the majority. For this reason, victory brings a great credit, and the Democrats should be proud because they have defeated their opponents in many fights.</p>
   <p>What did the Democrats accomplish at the thirty-seventh State Assembly? In brief: they elected Mr. John M. Palmer to the United States Senate; it gave the State a practical and honest system of voting; established more protective <span class="page-break">\5</span>laws for miners and out-of-door laborers than have been made in the last thirty years. They abolished Merrit's Conspiracy Law. The Democrats secured for the citizens the right to appoint railroad commissioners. In the House of Representatives, they were instrumental in passing a measure forbidding child labor, and although it was killed in the Senate by the Republicans, it was not the fault of the Democrats, but the Republicans. The eight-hour working day proposition also met its fate in the same way. The Republicans prevented the passing of the Banking Law which provided that all State funds should be deposited in State funds should be deposited in State banks, and accrued interest should belong to the State. Besides these measures, the Democrats confirmed the principle that the United States senators should be elected directly by the people and not by their representatives. Finally, they distinguished themselves by adopting measures of economy, thus reducing the expenses of the session to a minimum.</p>
   <p>They accomplished much, as much as it was possible under difficult circumstances, <span class="page-break">\6</span>and for this they deserve the approval of all citizens. We will explain some of the new laws more fully.</p>
   <p>Senatorial Issue</p>
   <p>The United States senators are elected in the following manner: In reality, the citizens of the State do not vote for the United States senators, but they elect the State senators and representatives who nominate and elect them. If there are two candidates, then the one who receives the majority of the votes is elected, but if there are more than two, then the winner must have an absolute majority, that is, more than a half of all votes. For example: If there are two hundred and four votes, (one hundred and one Democratic, one hundred Republican, and three Farmer's votes,) the candidate must receive one hundred and three votes in order to be elected.</p>
   <p>It was a bitter fight. The Farmers would not vote for either Republican or Democratic candidate, and because of this, John M. Palmer, the Democratic <span class="page-break">\7</span>candidate for United States senator, could not get the necessary majority for some time. The Republicans did not support any particular candidate, but they opposed the election of Palmer. Therefore, they picked all kinds of candidates, one after another, but could not agree among themselves. Finally, in order to defeat Palmer, they nominated one of the three Farmers in order to get their support and elect him. But they were unsuccessful because some Republicans opposed this candidate. In the meantime, Palmer was getting his one hundred and one democratic votes every day. This condition lasted for two and a half months. Finally, the Republicans decided to elect Dr. Moore, one of the Farmers, and he, after several ballotings, received almost a hundred votes. The entire United States was watching this interesting fight, and waited with almost feverish fears as the opinion prevailed that this Republican farce would contribute to the defeat of the candidate who was favored by the majority of the United States citizens. They feared that a very little known man, who is supported by a small group, would be elected as a United States senator. But, fortunately, the Republicans could not agree, and two of the members of <span class="page-break">\8</span>the Farmers' party, (and one of them was Dr. Moore, the candidate himself) cast their votes for Palmer, and thereby elected him as United States senator.</p>
   <p>It was a great victory for the Democrats. The one hundred and one Democrats received great ovations for being faithful to their candidate. If any of them were ill, he asked to be carried to the meeting in order to cast a vote.</p>

   <p>Miners' Laws</p>
   <p>The legislature enacted many laws favoring workingmen, especially the protective measures for the miners, which were introduced by Senator O'Connor, a Democrat, and Representative Gill, also a Democrat. One of these laws provides that the officials of the mining industry must possess a thorough <span class="page-break">\9</span>knowledge of mining and prove it by examination. Another regulation reads that the owners of the mining industry must provide for the upkeep of a scaler appointed by the county, who will have a right to inspect the scales, and whose duty will be to report all irregularities to the proper authority. This Legislature increased the inspecting districts from five to six, and provides that each inspector small receive six hundred dollars from the State for expenses. One of the important regulations which was demanded by the miners for many years provides that: "All coal mined, including siftings, must be weighed carefully with scales, and an accurate weighing record of every coal care should be kept. Every miner or interested person shall have the privilege to examine such records. A person appointed and authorized for weighing coal and keeping such records must make an affidavit in the presence of a duly authorized person before accepting his duties and sign it. He will weigh accurately coal taken out of the mine and keep an accurate record of the same. Such affidavit must be displayed near the scale and in a conspicuous place."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>A measure, providing that remuneration for work should be made in legal tender, was also passed. A Bill providing for weekly pay which was introduced by Messrs. O'Connor and Gill also passed.</p>
   <p>Other Measures Beneficial to Workingmen</p>
   <p>The Legislature passed Tom Fern's Anti-Trust Bill and the so-called Trademark Bill, about which we will publish a special article. Wells' Labor Day Bill was also passed. The eight-hour Bill was killed, but the Republican Senate is responsible for that.</p>
   <p>City of Chicago</p>
   <p>The Chicago World's Fair was debated by the members of the State Legislature. However, the State of Illinois will participate in the Fair, and the Department of Agriculture will be in charge of it, for which a sum of $800,000 has been assigned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>The so-called "West Park Bill," introduced by Senator Mahoney, also became a law and will improve the city. This improvement will be effected by building parks and boulevards on the West Side of the city for which bonds will be issued in the amount of one million dollars. Out of this fund not even a penny will be used for Washington Boulevard, 12th Street, or Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>If it is necessary to use private property, the owners of such confiscated property will be notified within two years, according to Mahoney's Bill.</p>
   <p>Elections and Registration</p>
   <p>The Australian system of voting, which was fully explained in our journal, will become a law on July 1, and so will the regulation entitling the voters to register their names as voters fifteen days before the registration day.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>We wish to mention Noonan's Bill, which introduces new regulations for building tradesmen and contractors. This Bill was introduced for contractors, architects, supply men and labor unions of Chicago, and was supported by Judges Tuley, Altgeld, and Tuthill.</p>
   <p>Building and Loan Associations</p>
   <p>These Associations will be controlled, at least in part, by the Government. According to the new regulation introduced by Senator Noonan, every building and loan association will be obliged to make a report every year of its condition to a Government inspector. Such report must be sworn to by the secretary of the Association, and accompanied by four dollars as a fee. If several members of such Association will make an affidavit that their Association is in poor condition, the inspector will have a right to examine the books and establish order. If such a report is false, the members making such affidavit must defray the expenses of the investigation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>Among the new laws passed by the last Legislature there is a very important measure respecting aliens who neglect their naturalization papers. They probably will not be allowed to buy real estate property after July 1, 1891, or become owners of such. This will be discussed by us more fully in the future. It is very important, therefore, to have naturalization papers or at least the first ones, in order to avoid embarrassment.</p>
   <p>The Democrats also tried to increase the number of the members of Cook County School Board from fifteen to twenty-one. All representatives of Cook County helped to pass this measure. The Governor will probably sign this bill in a few days. The mayor of our city, Mr. Washburne, has already appointed the new members, but unofficially because he is not allowed to do this without the Governor's signature.</p>
   <p>This year's Legislature was very economical, and led by the spirit of economy, the Senate reduced the original budget of the two houses to four million dollars.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>For this economy, they deserve praise for all work done with one exception. We believe they erred when they reduced the one million dollar allotment for participation of the State in the World's Fair to $800,000. Large appropriations were made for hospitals, schools, and other public institutions.</p>
