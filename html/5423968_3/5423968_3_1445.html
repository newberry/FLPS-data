   <p>Election Commissioner Frank Rydzewski and Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz are of the opinion that a recount of the ballots cast in the recent September primary election of 1918 may result in the victory of Mr. Frank Koralewski, the Democratic candidate for nomination for Congressman from the Eighth Illinois District. They base their hopes upon a careful recount of the votes cast in each individual precinct. It is sincerely hoped by all loyal Polish-American citizens that this expectation may be realized.</p>
