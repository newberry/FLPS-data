   <p>The number of Polish candidates for the various offices this year, in the City of Chicago far exceeds that of any previous year. Almost daily, candidates make their appearance like mushrooms after the rain. Friends of the candidates are overtaken with political fervor. We have the opportunity this year to display the strength and power of our organization in politics. If the Poles would now remain united, they could, in their unison, attain access to many political offices.</p>
   <p>For congressman of the 8th district, we have 3 candidates: Messrs Philip Ksycki, Stephen J. Napieralski and J. M. Sienkiewicz. Republican candidates for county commissioners are: W. Szrojda and Jozef Eliass; while on the Democratic ticket for the same office are: P. Rostenkowski, A. Krygowski, Ed. Kunowski, and J. Jarzembowski. For municipal judge the Democrats present: Mr. Julius Smietanka. Mr. K. B. Czarnecki, the well-known attorney is also in the race for congressman, on the independent ticket.</p>
   <p>The Polish voters, therefore, will have a number of candidates to select from, and have now the best opportunity to send our own congressmen to Washington as our representatives.</p>
