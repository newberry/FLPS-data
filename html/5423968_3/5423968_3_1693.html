   <p>My administration as a justice of the peace ended the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of June. In closing of my court of <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, I wish to thank my friends and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for their brotherly support that I have received for the past 24 years that I have been in office.</p>
   <p>I wish to say that while in office I tried <span class="gap">[gap]</span> best and most sincerely to serve all of you people.</p>
   <p>Our poor fellow-men, who must suffer so much, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> knowing the English language and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> advice, always have found in my court a free <span class="gap">[gap]</span>sulation. All the time and everywhere I tried to serve my nation sincerely. For the past 24 years of court service, I haven's benefited much financially, but to me today it means a great deal <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to have serve you for nothing, than to have received a steady financial in<span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   
   <p>During <span class="gap">[gap]</span> long term in office I have <span class="gap">[gap]</span> know what a great deal of annoyances and what big losses our Polish people suffered in other courts. I have known of affairs, where our Polish people were <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for the rest of their lives and could have secured <span class="gap">[gap]</span> thousand dollars as a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> but no, they settled for a few hundred, because they could not speak English, and they engaged <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
