   <p>My administration as a justice of the peace ended the 1st of June. In closing of my court of peace, I wish to thank my friends and fellow-men for their brotherly support that I have received for the past 24 years that I have been in office.</p>
   <p>I wish to say that while in office I tried my best and most sincerely to serve all of you people.</p>
   <p>Our poor fellow-men, who must suffer so much, not knowing the English language and needing a lawyer's advice, always have found in my court a free consultation. All the time and everywhere I tried to serve my nation sincerely. For the past 24 years of court service, I haven's benefited much financially, but to me today it means a great deal more to have served you for nothing, than to have received a steady financial income.</p>

   <p>During my long term in office I have come to know what a great deal of annoyances and what big losses our Polish people suffered in other courts. I have known of affairs, where our Polish people were crippled for the rest of their lives and could have secured from 10 to 15 thousand dollars as a compensation but no, they settled for a few hundred, because they could not speak English, and they engaged unscrupulous lawyers in these affairs.</p>
