   <p>Every democracy is as good as the people in it and no better. The Kingdom of Heaven, itself, would soon go to pieces, if left in the hands of the ignorant, selfish and wicked beings. Immigrants often complain that although the United States is a democracy, a land of the free and a refuge for these oppressed and ill-treated, they, nevertheless, have suffered at the hands of some people here, just as they suffered in the old country. There is a good deal of wrong done and altogether too much law violated, resulting in unnecessary suffering. Why? Because the citizens of this country are not doing their duty towards democracy. There is too much ignorance, too much indifference, and too much laziness. Things will not and cannot be better until there is an improvement in citizenship here and elsewhere.</p>
   <p>In the first place, there are too many people here from other lands who do not know the English language. They cannot function as citizens because they do not know how. Too many do not care to take the trouble to learn how, or to make use of their opportunities and influence things for the better. It must be your wish, and the wish of every man and woman who believes in common good, to assist those who do not know the language of the land, or how to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>perform their duties as citizens. You naturally ask, what can I do? The answer is simple: Learn these duties yourself, and see to it that your nearest neighbors learn them. Unless you do this you have no right to complain about the government.</p>
   <p>In the second lace, there are people who know the language, and know how to perform their duties as citizens, but dislike the work involved in doing their duties as citizens. Others do only that which brings them some immediate advantage. They are too blind to see that failing to do their duty well is bound to cause them a great deal of trouble eventually, and that to seek merely small favors, instead of honesty and efficiency in public service, is to deprive people of much good and many great advantages which come from efficient and honest management. Again, you ask perhaps: "What shall I do?" And again the answer is: "First do what is right, yourself, and then influence others to do the same."</p>
   <p>Lastly, there are people who use their influence as citizens for their own personal advantage at the expense of others. They do not only vote, but <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>do everything in their power to make others vote for them and their friends, because they expect a profit. These people do great harm very often. They are responsible, in a large measure, that public welfare is neglected and politics run to help those individuals, or cliques who try to grab power. If the citizens were to do their duties, it would be impossible for these people to get into power. And met would get in whose purposes are right and whose goal is the public good, your good. Are you asking again: What can I do? You can use your vote against the profiteer and for the honest, public-spirited man. You can influence others around you to do the same. You should be always on guard. One alert man, who does his duty like this, is worth a hundred of indifferent ones. You cannot realize of what great value you can be to the cause of democracy by acting upon these simple suggestions. Isn't it worth the effort? When you consider that your happiness and the happiness of your family and friends, and what is still more important, the safety and preservation of democracy depend on your doing this, it is worth your while.</p>
   <p>Do you realize that men like George Washington sacrificed their lives that democracy might live, and that you and I might be free? Do you realize that thousands have given their lives fighting for your freedom, which you are asked now to preserve? Do you realize that the way shown you is the only one which <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>leads towards better days? Do you realize how much depends upon what you can do?</p>
   <p>Begin today to learn to be an intelligent citizen, to be an active citizen and, lastly, to be a courageous citizen.</p>
