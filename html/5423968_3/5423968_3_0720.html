   <p>The morning English-language newspapers report that Mr. [Nicholas L.] Piotrowski will be a candidate in the November election, on an independent ticket, for Congressman from the Eighth Illinois District. Mr. Piotrowski will oppose the Democratic nominee, Mr. Gallagher. It is also said that friends of Mr. Piotrowski will collect some five thousand dollars to finance his campaign. This, however, is nothing more than rumor, and for that reason the Dziennik Zwiazkowy does not state it as a definite fact until more proof is obtained.</p>
   <p>After a recount of the ballots of the recent primary election it was found that the majority of Mr. Gallagher over that of Mr. Piotrowski was 804 votes.</p>
