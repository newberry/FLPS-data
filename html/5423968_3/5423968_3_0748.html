   <p>The present political regime is drawing to its close. Tomorrow we go to the polls to fulfill the duty which citizenship in this country places upon us. It is our duty to fulfill this obligation because only in this way can we show the strength and power which we undoubtedly already possess in the politics of this country. Our influence is not as great as it should be because of our negligence and our frequent undervaluation of the duty of voting. Let us console ourselves, however, with the thought that each year shows an improvement, and that the younger generation which has grown up here, conscious of the importance of this duty in the life of every citizen, is gradually beginning to fill the gaps left by the older people who ignored the necessity of voting.</p>

   <p>Our publication cannot openly declare itself for any specific political party of this country, because its basic principles do not permit this. Nevertheless, although remaining nonpartisan we must recommend two things to our readers:</p>
   <p>First, that all citizens voting tomorrow vote for those candidates who have already shown during their political careers that they know how to be first in evaluating the needs and worth of our nation, even if they are not favorably disposed or friendly toward us. We should all vote for such men regardless of party affiliations, if, of course, no Pole appears on the ticket as candidate for the same office.</p>
   <p>Second, that it is our duty, not political but national, to vote for a Pole wherever one appears on the ballot, because in this way we shall record our membership in one single powerful Polish family. We shall thus be able to count the political power which We have today, and in the future we can place <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>our demands before the proper tribunals in proportion to our political strength.</p>
   <p>When the leaders of specific parties convince themselves, pencil in hand, of the number of votes that the Poles possess in certain districts, when they are convinced that we represent a powerful united mass which can at a given moment decide the election of a certain candidate, they will take us into account. They will have to. It is a well-known fact that everywhere only the strong are taken into account, not the weak and divided.</p>
   <p>Therefore today we are taking the liberty of mentioning those candidates running for office in Chicago for whom our readers and friends will, and should, cast their votes at tomorrow's election.</p>
   <p>If all Poles, regardless of party affiliations, vote for the candidates listed below, if all Poles vote in a bloc at the present election and try <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to prove that they can unite for the purpose of electing Polish candidates, this in itself will be a worthwhile victory for us, even if here and there we do not show our supremacy and are unable to push our candidate through.</p>
   <p>You can do anything you want to if you want to badly enough, the old folks tell us. Therefore let us really want to do this, and surely We shall be able to do it.</p>
   <p>In particular we recommend that you vote for the following Polish candidates, who, in our opinion, certainly deserve your support: for congressman, Dr. E. F. Napieralski Progressive; for State Senator of the Ninth District, W. J. Susmarski, Republican, and for State Senator of the Fifteenth District, John S. Rybicki, Republican; for representatives to the state legislature, Albert Rostenkowski, Republican, and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Gieldzinski, Progressive; for municipal judges, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> K. Jarecki<span class="gap">[gap]</span> Democrats, and our fellow Slav, Judge Jeseph S. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Repualican; for county commissioners,</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Professor Thomas Siemiradzki, Progressive, Albert <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and Thomas <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Democrats, and Francis <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, Republican.</p>
