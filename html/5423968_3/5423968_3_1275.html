   <p>W. Tomasik informs us that a meeting of Polish Democrats from all parts of Chicago was held at the Central Democratic Committee's headquarters, 137 Monroe Street, last Thursday [October 19] evening. The meeting was opened by Stanley Kunz, alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, who told the gathering that it was absolutely indispensable that the Poles of Chicago unite into one central Democratic organization. His proposal was accepted enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>S. F. A. Satalecki, of the Ninth Ward, was named chairman of the meeting, and W. Tomasik, of the Sixteenth Ward, secretary.</p>
   <p>Alderman Kunz also urged the Poles to register in the greatest possible numbers for the coming elections; he asked that in giving their place of birth, Poles stress the fact that they were born in Poland, not Prussia, Austria, or Russia, and that they protest if the judges do not record <span class="page-break">\2</span>their place of birth properly. He encouraged Poles to take out citizenship papers, which will be given free on Monday, October 23. Tuesday, October 24, is Registration Day.</p>
