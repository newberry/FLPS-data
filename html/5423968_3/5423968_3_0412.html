   <p>Those who think that the old-time slave did not receive anything for his work are entirely wrong, as are those who think that our present-day free working men receive the full value of their production.</p>
   <p>The working men are reminded continually by the capitalist teachers that hard times existed only a long time ago, when there was slavery, that those conditions do not exist any more; today, they say, you are free and may work anywhere; that today you will receive pay for your work.</p>
   <p>The working man of today does not think about himself very deeply, and he knows still less about the old times.</p>
   <p>An old-time slave was usually supplied with wholesome food, good clothing and warm shelter, which kept him in good health and fit for work from day to day.</p>
   
   <p>An old-time slave was assured of that part of wealth which he produced himself, though he was cheated by his "owner" of a larger part of his labor.</p>
   <p>Today's employer does the same thing because he supplies his free slave with just enough cash with which he can procure food, clothing and shelter to keep himself fit for work when he is called.</p>
   <p>The whole value created by a working man, besides the part which he receives as his pay, is kept by his employer in the same way as the surplus created by former slaves was kept by their masters.</p>
   <p>In both cases the surplus created by a working man, which he does not get, constitutes the profit of the rich man and is a source of his prosperity and power.</p>
   <p>The capitalist class skins the working people, not by taking money from them or by selling them merchandise at a higher price than it is worth, but by robbing them steadily and ruthlessly, by paying them less for their work than it is worth because the system demands it.</p>
   <p>When the working people understand their position very clearly, then they will be ready to accomplish the work of their emancipation.</p>
   <p>As long as the working people do not understand that, so long will they be used as fools by Bryans, Hearsts, Roosevelts, Tafts and Gomperses.</p>
