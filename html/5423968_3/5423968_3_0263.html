   <p>The Socialists assert <span class="gap">[gap]</span> only ones who really really defend the worker and only they care organized labor. They are mistaken. One need not be a Socialist to recognize or <span class="gap">[gap]</span> labor as the most important factor for the workers. Every normal thinking prson is well aware of the fact. It is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> capitalists profit by us at every step. If organized unions were not present, our future and present time are full <span class="gap">[gap]</span> who think of nothing but maintaining their pockets filled with money by <span class="gap">[gap]</span> To many of the unions belong Poles. They pay their dues regularly, and still they don't seem to be making any headway. The Irish and the Jews always seem to be in the lead everywhere, with the aid of their various methods, later <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the respectable standing of the labor organizations. It isn't necessary, if you belong to a workers' organization , to be a red. A real Pole who loves his country will preserve the rights of a Polish workers, but not under an international cloak.</p>
