   <p>Yesterday, from the officials in Springfield, we were informed that Mr. John Smulski is to be appointed president of the South Park Board Commission, to succeed Mr. E. A. Eckhardt, who in the past two weeks informed the officials in Springfield of his intentions to resign, in order to devote more of his time to his private business.</p>
   <p>According to the information received by Governor Deneen of Mr. Eckhardt's resignation, the governor asked Mr. Smulski whether or not he would accept this position. The governor is sure Mr. Smulski is the best suited man for this responsible and reputable office. After inviting Mr. Smulski to Springfield, Governor Deneen, after a two-hour talk, persuaded him to accept this office.</p>
   <p>Today's newspapers show a portrait of Mr. Smulski, Chicago's best Polish political figure, and a brief story of his rise in the political field; his honorable and faultless work in behalf of all his followers.</p>

   <p>Mr. Deneen is convinced that under the leadership of Mr. Smulski, the South Park Board will continue its work of distinction.</p>
   <p>For this work Mr. Smulski will not receive any salary.</p>
