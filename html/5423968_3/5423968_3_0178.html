   <p>One of our greatest ailments in the past few years is the often repeated unemployment in our country. It appears that the President-elect, Herbert Hoover, did not wait until he enters his office, but concentrated on this problem and worked out a plan which can, if not completely, at least partly solve the situation. This plan was submitted to Governor Brewster, of Maine, with a plea that he present it at the Governors' Conference in New Orleans. There is nothing radical in this plan: it does not foresee any government centralization; it depends only on the voluntary co-operation of the states, cities, and country, in cases of existing or forthcoming periods of unemployment.</p>
   <p>In the plan of Mr. Hoover, we see the creation of a reserve fund of three billion dollars, which would be used for mobilizing public works on a large scale whenever a recession should occur in industry.</p>
   <p>As to the explanation by Governor Brewster, at the Governors' Conference, a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>plan like this, for stabilizing the labor market, could be what the Federal Reserve System is to finances to banks. In reality, it doe snot remedy the various economic ailments, however, in many cases it can be very helpful and decrease the usual suffering of unemployment.</p>
   <p>The United States are wealthy, powerful, and enterprising enough to be able to decide on the effective solving of the unemployment problem. This problem can be conquered, and this country is in a position to prepare itself for such a time when factory smoke ceases. Economists and level-minded people, looking at these affairs, do not doubt at all that everlasting prosperity in modern times, conditioned with modern surplus, is possible. The President-elect believes that the time has come when people will learn by previous experiences, as well as by practical facts, how to give an instructive example to private industry, as well as to other nations.</p>
   <p>The American Nation will most certainly accept this news, that the President-elect has sincerely taken up the unemployment problem and if he succeeds in this plan, then his name shall be inscribed in gold letters in the history of our country.</p>
