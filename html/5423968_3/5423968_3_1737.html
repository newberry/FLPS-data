   <p>Last night, Polish Democrats held a political meeting at the Polish hall on Bradley Street. Last Monday there was also a political meeting held by Polish Democrats at Walsh's Hall, located at Milwaukee Avenue and Noble Street. As we have already reported, the hall was only half filled. We thought that this happened because many persons were not aware of the meeting. For this reason, in the Saturday issue of our journal, we called the special attention of our readers to last night's meeting. In spite of this, the Polish hall at Bradley Street was only half filled. It is very sad that the Poles are so little interested in politics, in which they should take an active part, because it is for their own good and the good of the working class.</p>
   <p>Mr. August J. Kowalski opened the meeting by inviting Mr. Peter Kiolbassa to <span class="page-break">\2</span>speak; he was greeted by a storm of applause. The latter made a suggestion, which was accepted, that Francis Wleklinski be made secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbassa began his speech as follows: "Let us vote a straight Democratic ticket and show our strength. Let us remember that there are many intrigants in the Republican party; not only intrigants but also enemies of our faith. With these we must struggle, and we wish to conquer them. Every citizen of Chicago has his privileges, but he also has his obligations. It is the duty of every Pole to vote for a candidate friendly towards us and from whom the working class can expect some help later on. There are candidates on the Democratic ticket who are friendly towards us despite the fact that they belong to a different nationality. These candidates should get every Polish vote." Mr. Kiolbassa's speech was received with a great applause.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Alderman [Stanley] Kunz of the Sixteenth Ward. He made special reference to the election of aldermen and commissioners by stating <span class="page-break">\3</span>that five delegates are elected from every precinct and these later on nominate the candidates. Therefore, every Pole should know for whom he is going to vote. The next speaker was Mr. Cooley, who was followed by Mr. Bogle. As both were candidates for trustees of the Sanitary District, their speeches were alike. "All contagious diseases, such as typhoid fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, etc., are caused by contaminated water. We throw into the river all kinds of rubbish, which flows into the lake from which we drink water. If we construct a sanitary canal to the Mississippi River, the polluted water will be diverted into the river, and this will purify the drinking water and avert many diseases. Secondly, if we construct such a canal, commerce will increase, for the canal will be navigable, and, since transportation by water is cheaper than by railroad, trade would increase." Both candidates assured us that if we elect them drainage trustees, they will force through the provision which provides for the building of this canal.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa spoke once more. He said, "It is reported that someone by the <span class="page-break">\4</span>name of John P. Farwell is supposed to have said that no foreigner should hold a public office or be allowed to vote. And who made John P. Farwell rich? Foreigners, of course. Who are the biggest swindlers, foreigners or those who were born here? The latter, of course. Who fought for the independence of the United States if not the foreigners? Show us citizens more loyal than the Poles, of whom the majority were born in the old country. They pay their taxes without murmuring, elect their public officials honestly, and when it is necessary to defend the adopted country, a Pole is first to give a helping hand." These words penetrated very deeply into the hearts of the listeners, who expressed their approval at the end of the talk by hearty applause.</p>
   <p>The next speakers were John S. Cooper, candidate for president of the County Board; Mr. Wall, candidate for County Commissioner; Mr. Rolan, Mr. McDonald, and Mr. Kowalski.</p>
   <p>As one of the speakers attacked the Irish and carried it too far, Mr. Kiolbassa <span class="page-break">\5</span>took the liberty of defending them, for they were recently very friendly towards the Poles and proved it by furnishing a bond for Mr. Kiolbassa in the sum of seven million dollars [see note]. Therefore, we should respect and support the Irish as our friends.</p>
   <p>As it was quite late and neither Mr. De Witt C. Cregier nor Mr. Harrison had arrived, Mr. Kiolbassa adjourned the meeting.</p>
   <p>(Translator's note: According to Mr. Jozwiakowski, one of the editors [of Dziennik Chicagoski], who knew Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, the Irish Catholics--Democrats--wished to show the Republicans that they wanted Kiolbassa, a Catholic, and to prove it they signed a seven-million-dollar bond. It is understood that it was a real-estate bond.)</p>
