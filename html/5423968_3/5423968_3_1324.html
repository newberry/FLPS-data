   <p>The motion of citizen Roland was beneficial to the club. In the future, arrangements will be made in the nature of recitals or educational talks, primarily on parliamentary rules and then about the duties and task of the various national, state, country and municipal officials, beginning with the President of the United States to the city aldermen. Naturally, only then will these matters be discussed when the club will become finally organized.</p>
