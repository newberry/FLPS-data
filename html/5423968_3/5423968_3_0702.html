   <p>At their last meeting this month, the members of the St. Joseph's Brotherhood of Young Men, in St. John Cantius Parish, resolved to endorse their follow parishioner, Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz, for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward. The Brotherhood's resolution reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Since a man of another nationality has governed the Poles in the Seventeenth Ward for fourteen years, as a result of misunderstanding between the political parties of this ward, we members of the St. Joseph's Brotherhood of Young Men congratulate our Polish politicians in this ward on finally coming to an agreement. They can now show the Germans that the Poles will have Polish aldermen.</p>
   <p>"We challenge all Poles to show for once that they know how to preserve a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>solid bloc, that they will not allow anyone to bribe them, and that they will not betray a Pole for the miserable dollar. Let us show that, although living in this land of freedom and loving this country, we have not forgotten that we are Poles. Let us abandon all quarrels and disagreements and cast all our votes for a Pole, Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz, and we will see that on the day following the election his opponent will move out of our ward, to his residence, which he owns in the neighborhood where the millionaires live.</p>
