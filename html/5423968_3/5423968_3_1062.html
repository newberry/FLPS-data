   <p>Not long ago all Polish newspapers in America spread the news of the great political victory of our countrymen in Milwaukee, Wis. All Polish journals, with no exceptions, acclaimed the solidarity of the Poles in the city called the German capital of the United States. This solidarity gained the Poles a number of the highest offices in the city, county and state. There is no jealousy among the Poles because of this situation, but in Chicago it [has aroused a feeling of]depression. The real Poles and patriots are beginning to ask, What is wrong with us? There are 120,000 Poles in Chicago and yet--we are zero in politics. While other nationalities occupy high positions we are employed as drudges.</p>
   <p>The answer to this problem lies of course in our factionalism. We are ignored because we lack solidarity. Other nationalities [provoked this <span class="page-break">2</span>internal discord;] they succeeded in awakening petty, individual jealousies which weakened our forces and [debilitated our political strength.]</p>
   <p>This condition continued until the action taken by the Milwaukee Poles aroused us. The Poles in Chicago realized their potential strength, and when they showed it [in the sixteenth ward by uniting in support of Stanley Kunz, the other candidates withdrew.]</p>
   <p>Immediately our action created a reaction. All the politicians were surprised that after so many years of discord and jealousy, the Poles had opened their eyes. They came to the conclusion that the Polish element in Chicago represents a powerful factor in politics.</p>
   <p>If some one had declared a few months ago that one of the major political parties would offer us a high position in the City Hall no one would have <span class="page-break">3</span>believed it, but as a result of our unity, a citizen of Polish descent has been nominated for a high office in Chicago by the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>The great honor of representing the Chicago Poles in the City Hall has been bestowed upon our popular and greatly respected citizen, Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
