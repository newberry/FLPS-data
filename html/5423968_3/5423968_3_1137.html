   <p>A very important meeting of Polish-American citizens will be held on Friday, August 23, 1918, at eight o'clock in the evening, at the Briggs House, at Randolph and Wells Streets. The purpose of the meeting is to complete [the organization of] the Woodrow Wilson Polish-American League.</p>
   <p>The undersigned committee invites all Polish-American citizens from every ward, every neighboring town, and every county in Illinois. Regardless of whether a person belongs to some other league or to any political club, he is urged to be present at this meeting. The purpose of the League [in calling the meeting] is to afford to every right-thinking Polish-American citizen an opportunity to become well acquainted with its aims.</p>
   <p>The Woodrow Wilson League is not a merely temporary political organization. It is to be permanent. Therefore those Polish-American Democrats who have become disgusted with the inconsequential character and the inactivity of <span class="page-break">2</span>other leagues or political clubs may feel certain that by joining the Woodrow Wilson Polish-American League they will aid the Democratic cause as well as the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>The committee again invites all Polish-American citizens to be present at this very important meeting.</p>
