   <p>A new Polish society has been organized and held its first convention about a month ago. The main object of this society is to unite all Polish organizations in an endeavor to promote good citizens in the state of Illinois. Yesterday, at a meeting, the society resolved to engage itself in the campaign for Judge Jarecki for the office of county judge, and for attorneys Frank P. Danisch and John Prystalski as candidates for judges of the municipal court.</p>
   <p>At the great mass meeting which was held last Sunday at Pulaski Hall, the Polish Fellowship League, even though it is a non-partisan organization, endorsed the motion of a delegate who until the present time was a member of the Republican Party, to support the entire Democratic ticket. The delegate explained that this motion resulted from the fact that the Republican Party does not have one Polish candidate on the <span class="page-break">\2</span>ticket while the Democratic Party has offered three important offices to the Poles.</p>
   <p>The league will interest itself in the campaigns of Jarecki, Danisch, and Prystalski only among the Poles. Naturally, the league, through its special committee on development and political agitation will support the entire Democratic ticket, mindful of the resolution adopted at the special mass meeting held in Pulaski Hall.</p>
   <p>Large mass meetings of citizens will be held in the next two weeks in all the Polish parishes throughout Cook County. All Poles, regardless of their party affiliations, will be united in political work for the benefit of the Polish candidates and the ticket, which is favorable to the Poles, furthermore, the Polish Naturalization League, at whose head stand Mr. Kolanowski and Mr. Szymczak, will invite all students of the citizenship schools in Chicago to work for this cause. Every student will be <span class="page-break">\3</span>requested to share in and accomplish a victory in the fall election for the Polish candidates and their friends. There are at present over fifty such schools in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Polish Fellowship League has its quarters in the office of the Naturalization League, at 156 N. La Salle St., State 8295.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stephen L. Kolanowski and Prof. M. Szymczak, will conduct this campaign personally and will be found at this office at all times.</p>
   <p>This campaign is sponsored by the Polish Fellowship League.</p>
   <p>The first great mass meeting under the auspices of the league will be held in Walsh's Hall, Noble and Emma streets. Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz, president of the league, is especially interested in arranging this meeting.</p>
   <p>The speakers at this meeting will be Congressman Stanley Kunz, who is running for re-election, and has just returned from Poland, his native <span class="page-break">\4</span>land; the other speakers will be Judge Jarecki, attorney Danisch, and attorney Prystalski, I. Stankiewicz, W. Lipka, and J. Trandel, three democratic candidates for members of the state legislature; also Alderman John Piotrowski, candidate for state senator. We have several other aspiring candidates for office on the Democratic tickets who will be heard at this meeting.</p>
   <p>In every Polish section a similar meeting will be held for the cause of the Polish candidates and their friends. The program of these meetings will be announced in all Polish newspapers.</p>
   <p>The committee of the Jarecki campaign is composed of the following citizens: S. L. Kolanowski, president. Prof. M. S. Szymczak, Stanley Kuflewski, Alex Wisniewski, Alderman John Czekala, Joseph Spiker, Stanley Strzelecki, N. S. Budzban, W. Piotras, Frank Brodnicki and Medard Kunz.</p>
