   <p>Political activities in the 31st ward have already begun, but to date, the number of candidates for alderman is uncertain. It is said that two Poles will try to gain admission to this office.</p>
   <p>The democratic party, as everyone knows, supports alderman S. Walkowiak, well-known in political circles, who so energetically has guarded the interests of the citizens of this ward. The opposing party is strongly supporting another well-known Pole, Mr. S. Adamkiewicz, a former alderman. Naturally, we may expect a great battle between these rivals in the 31st ward. Alderman Walkowiak, who for the past twelve years represented our ward, is a lawyer. In him we place much confidence. We do not wish to detract from the good name of Adamkiewicz, but we do feel that Walkowiak is better qualified for this position than any other candidate running for office at this time.</p>
