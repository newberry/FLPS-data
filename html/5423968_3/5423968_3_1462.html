   <p>Yesterday the primaries for aldermen and other city officials were held. Some emerged victorious, others were vanquished, as always happens in the fight for political offices.</p>
   <p>Unexpectedly, Mayor Thompson's faction emerged victorious. Alderman C. E. Merriam of the Seventh Ward, who was running for office against Thompson's candidate, W. R. Fertzer, was defeated by a majority of 190 votes.</p>
   <p>Three other opponents of Thompson's faction, Aldermen Robert M. Buck, James H. Kearns, and Edward J. Wener, were also defeated by Mayor Thompson's friends.</p>
   <p>From among the Polish candidates, three received nominations. They are <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Stephen T. Thieda, a Republican candidate (Twelfth Ward), who won by a majority of 458 votes; Stanley H. Kunz, Democrat of the Sixteenth Ward, who defeated former Alderman Zwiefka by 570 votes; and Stanley Adamkiewicz, Democrat of the Seventeenth Ward, who was elected without any opposition.</p>
