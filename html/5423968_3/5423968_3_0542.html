   <p>Among the more important causes of our national and political stagnation in America the main one is the incorrect and improperly conceived notion of freedom, which we have noticed here among many Poles. In truth, we do not attribute this wrong conception to any conscious inclination to do evil among our compatricts. We rather look for its causes in our old sin, in our old domestic abomination: of obstinacy, impertinence and lack of discipline against everything that is, was or could be any type of seniority, and type of authority. To all the other injuries that we have suffered from the hands of our attackers in Europe this vast moral one is added that we have learned the more not to respect, not to love, not to listen willingly to our governors, because he was a Moscovite, German or Austrian, hence an enemy in each instance. We have considered it almost a patriotic obligation to look upon them as foes and enemies. And we have practiced this virtue with a defect after our arrival in America. From enslavement we have come to a nation of freedom, and have become drunk with this freedom. In the same way as a stomach exhausted <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>after a starvation of several days becomes sick if one immediately feeds it to the full, so do many of us ail here because of an excessiveness use of freedom. That use is a harmful abuse, and this freedom is at times wrongly construed.</p>
   <p>On what does American freedom depend? On the freedom of the voice of religion, press and convention. And yet this freedom is limited by law, constituting a punishment upon anyone who through an inconsiderate use of it would lead to upheavals and bloodsheds. Nor could it be otherwise. A freedom, however, cannot lead to the injury of any of our co-citizens. Every freedom ipsofacto becomes subject to the limitation of moral law. It does not lose its essence by this restriction, but it obtains its worth in it and even its true existence. Thus, for example, the freedom of murder, robbery, is no longer a freedom but a wilfullness, because it is not bound with moral law. There is a freedom in a family, although the father does not permit his children to do anything they desire. There is a freedom in a nation, although the citizens must be subject to the laws. Thus we see that freedom cannot be unlimited but that it <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is subject to moral restriction and compulsion. Thus we have sadly noted that this moral compulsion is unknown among our compatriots or at least that it is adopted very unwillingly by the Poles in America.</p>
   <p>We will cite several proofs of this. The Poles in Cleveland have revolted against the bishop because he removed a pastor and replaced him with another in his stead. It came to uprisings, casting a sad light upon the parishioners and hence upon all the Poles as well. These uprisings caused the bishop to state that such scandals do not occur among other nationalities. A certain press of doubtful value denied this assertion but it will not alter--because it is Polish--the conception of the Americans concerning us. It comes from that others disregard us, consider us as rioters, that in political affairs they abstain from us as unchastised elements, upon which it is impossible to depend.</p>
   <p>The cause of the revolt in Cleveland had its origin in this that the local parishioners did not consider a moral enforcement, obedience to the bishop as <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the head of the diocese.</p>
   <p>The same cause should be looked for in the sad affair of the Holy Trinity parish. The upstarts against the will of the Archbishop assert: "What is a bishop to us, here is a free country, we do not have to listen to the bishop." Yes, the country is free but the Poles are wanton. The government here does not enter into religious matters because it leaves it to a feeling of moral enforcement, which is a better foundation of its existence than the police, jails, army and cannons.</p>
   <p>Some of the Poles see a man higher than they in authority in education, in talents which he had proven, glory with which his name is covered, finally, in simplicity and noble silence with which he has steadily borne all the charges made against him for so many years. What do these Poles, brethren and friends of this man do? Instead of acknowledging the moral enforcement as a resultant of the Christian principles, and, hence, from the moral--Divine--law, commanding them to honor that man, heed his experienced and tried counsel, acknowledge <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>his merits and patience, they meet to conspire against him. They are not moved by love and justice but by hate and envy: They abuse the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and fall into petulance. The other, seeing this, either become infected with their virulent example, or will hold them in contempt. In one instance as well as the other it results in a harm to our nationality, it creates a division and hence it obstructs our political development. The Poles are wanton and therefore they have no freedom and are not deserving of it.</p>

   <p>Particularly do the American periodicals err in their ill-conceived notion of freedom. They pour out their venom at times for no reason whatsover upon individual personalities, on all corporations or states, and do not conduct a fight for principles, but fulfill their animosity. Whenever they do conduct a fight for principles then it occurs only then when they endeavor to inculcate the principles of immorality and social perversion in the place of moral principles and the principles of social order. These presses, being marked by a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>veritable punitive attacks, scandalize and disrupt the minds with their shameful styles, they pervert sound concepts in them, support discord in them, and incite to arguments. It is readily seen that they cause harm to our nationality and, hence, that they bring about our national stagnation and--which evolves from it--the political. As long as these presses do not undergo a radical change, as long as they do not become decent, so long is it impossible to even dream that they would contribute to the benefit of the Poles in the United States, which welfare they should have primarily as their goal, because the maintenance of oneself or the enrichment by favoring the low passions of discord, revolt, personal hatred, quarrelsomeness, as the papers often do, is a profession worthy of an extortioner or a thief. Although such actions are allowed by the freedom of press, because it is not limited by a moral law, it does not depend upon a true but on an ill-conceived freedom.</p>
   <p>An ill-conceived freedom is also seen in a great need of recognition of authority which could be noted among many Poles in America. The people here began to feel strong, the hard physical labor gave money into his hand, which <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>one Latin poet termed as being a stimulus to evil. And thus, what frequently happens, they show opposition to a bishop, insult the priest by reproadus that they feed him, vex the teacher, hold experience and education lightly, although these also are capitals. The code of law does not impose punishment upon all these things, but the moral idea will itself mete out a punishment for such behavior, because that idea is throded upon in him by the abuse of freedom.</p>
   <p>Our golden-voiced Skarga, seeing the misfortunes, with his prophetic spirit, that were to befall our Fatherland, called out: "These acute and insane words evolves from our obstinacy, insubordination and impertinence: "I was born a nobleman, hence, fear no one. Poland! The flower of your glory will wane! If this evolves from some written law or statute, such diabolic freedom and such law was accursed..."</p>
   <p>It was this frivolous freedom, unlimited by the enforcement of the moral law, which lead Poland to a fall. This same ill-conceived freedom brings upon us <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>our national and political stagnation in America. Only a well understood freedom will elevate us nationally and politically.</p>
