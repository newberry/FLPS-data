   <p>The Democrats held their convention last Saturday, and the caucus at which they chose their delegates for the convention was held last Friday. Every one knew what would be the result of the convention, because the number of delegates representing Cregier was the largest. However, the supporters of Harrison did not lose hope, notwithstanding the fact that they were denied a voice at the convention and were ridiculed. They separated themselves from the party, accused the Democrats of unfairness, left the convention, gathered at Uhlich's Hall, and nominated Harrison for mayor of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This split the Democratic party into two factions, one nominating Cregier and the other Harrison for the mayoralty. Such split is of no benefit to the Democratic Party, for if Elmer Washburn would renounce his candidacy in favor of Hempstead Washburn, about which we hear rumors, the Republicans could win this year. The Democrats belonging to the old party nominated <span class="page-break">\2</span>Mr. De Witt C. Cregier for mayor, George A. Weiss for city treasurer, Jacob J. Kern for city counsel, and James C. Strain for city clerk. The separatists, or faction which nominated Harrison for mayor, did not make any other nominations. This will be done later.</p>
   <p>We cannot discuss this matter in detail right now; however, we will have an opportunity to do so two weeks from now. This will give us time for a deep consideration, after which we will predict who will get the votes on the 7th of April.</p>
   <p>Here is some more information. Last Saturday the Democrats also held a special convention for the West Side of the city. The preliminary caucuses to nominate aldermen have already been held in many wards and will be held in others. The 16th Ward will have it to-morrow.</p>
   <p>The Poles held a political meeting last night at Schulz's hall, where <span class="page-break">\3</span>they had an opportunity to hear discussions about the primary elections. The speakers discussed the aldermanic caucus of the 16th Ward, which will be held to-morrow at 1 P.M. The voting will take place at 206 Center Avenue, near Milwaukee Avenue. Every one who declares himself a Democrat and states that he is registered will be allowed to vote. Short talks were delivered by Kozlowski, Kowal, Bardonski, and Kunz. The speakers recommended Kunz for alderman of the 16th Ward, and stated that he will be elected if all Poles will vote for him. Kunz is the only Polish candidate for alderman of the 16th Ward.</p>
   <p>All Polish voters will gather Tuesday, between 10 A.M. and 12 noon, at the appointed places, from where they will march to the strains of a band to the polling place at 206 Center Avenue, where they will cast their votes. At last night's meeting, the citizens of the 16th Ward nominated Kunz for alderman.</p>
