   <p>These Democratic headquarters were opened for the convenience of the citizens of the Sixteenth Ward by the president of the Sixteenth Ward Polish Democratic Club. All expenses were borne by him.</p>
   <p>The president of the Club is Peter Kiolbassa, city treasurer. Credit is due him for this generous contribution to the Polish people. He also arranged to have the office and hall decorated with American flags; a large banner with the name of the organization has been placed in a conspicuous place on the outside of the building.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa is leaving today for San Antonio, Texas, where he will stay eight days. The vice-president, Mr. Buxbaum, will take charge of the duties of the Club during his superior's absence.</p>
