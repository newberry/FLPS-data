   <p>We had this article printed to show the Polish people how well they supported our Polish candidates. The results of the primary elections are not complete, as the final count has not been given at the time this article went to press.</p>
   <p>For us Poles, the primary was a greater disappointment than we ever expected. Of the 22 Polish candidates on the Republican and Democratic tickets only a few received nominations. On the Republican ticket Mr. A. Michalek from the 5th district and Mr. P. M. Ksycki from the 8th district were victorious as candidates for congressmen; Mr. E. Kowalski from the 4th district won as a representative; Mr. W. Schrajda was victorious as county commissioner.</p>
   <p>On the Democratic ticket Mr. Edward J. Novak was victorious as a member of the Board of Equalization from the 5th district, as was Mr. Budzban, from the 8th district.</p>

   <p>Mr. J. S. Geskewicz from the 27th district was victorious as a representative; Mr. Martin Furman, as sanitary district trustee, was victorious; Mr. Peter Rostenkowski was victorious as county commissioner.</p>
   <p>Of all the Polish candidates only nine were victorious. Is this what the Polish people call support? If all Poles voted for these candidates, their votes alone would be almost enough to win. Where is the solidarity of the Polish people?</p>
   <p>One of the biggest surprises of this primary was the defeat of Mr. Szajkowski, Republican candidate for the office of recorder. He was decisively beaten by Mr. Davis. The best support given to Mr. Szajkowski was from the 27th ward, where he received 1,600 votes. In the 16th ward, which is inhabited mostly by Poles, Mr. Davis won by a great majority. In the 28th ward, where Mr. Smulski has a strong becking, Mr. Smulski was badly beaten. It is a proven fact that if Mr. Szajkowski did not win in the 16th ward, the biggest Polish ward in Chicago, what chance could he have in carrying the other wards. When will our Polish citizens learn the meaning of solidarity.</p>
