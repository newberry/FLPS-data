   <p>A week from today the primary election will take place in Chicago. This primary election will be the first one under the new law; all political parties will vote for their candidates on the same day, instead of every party having their own primary election day. At this primary every citizen, every candidate should take an active part and accustom themselves with this new ballots, so that on the regular election day there will be less confusion and misunderstanding of the new ballots and the election will run smoothly. The primary ballots are ready for distribution.</p>
   <p>Every ballot is very spacious and contains many names. People must observe how many crosses must be made for various offices.</p>
   <p>For example, there are six candidates seeking office, while only three should be marked. Many ballots will be spoiled because people will not pay much attention to just that sort of marking.</p>

   <p>The different parties will have ballots of different colors. The Democratic ballot is rose color. The Polish citizens should be greatly interested to know that not less than fifteen Polish names appear on this ballot.</p>
   <p>For members of Congress the Democrats have six candidates, but people can vote for only one. Among these six is our Polish candidate, Mr. K. B. Czarnecki, who should receive the support of all Poles.</p>
   <p>For the State Tax Commission are five candidates, only one to be elected. Of these five candidates two are Polish, Mr. Joseph Helminiak and Mr. N. S. Budzban. Mr. J. Helminiak openly stated that he will not seek election at this primary, so that all the Polish votes will be cast for Mr. Budzban.</p>
   <p>For members to the legislature from different districts we have in the 27th district, Mr. Joseph S. Geshkewich and W. J. Kozlowski; in the 25th district, Frank S. Landmesser, and in the 15th district, Thomas Kasperski.</p>
   <p>In the 27th senatorial district we have Mr. S. Kielczynski seeking the senatorial election.</p>

   <p>For the Sanitary District Commission the Democrats have eleven candidates, only three to be elected. Among these three we have our well known Polish candidate who served on the County Hospital staff, Mr. Stanley J. Kuflewski, who is best fitted for this office due to the experience he received serving on the hospital staff.</p>
   <p>The Democrats have 44 candidates seeking the office of county commissioners, of these 10 are to be elected. Among these are 4 Polish candidates, Mr. Peter Rostenkowski,Joseph Jarzembowski, Anthony Krygowski, and Stanley Adamkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The largest number of candidates on the Democratic ticket are seeking the office of municipal judges, in all there are 58 candidates, 9 to be elected. Among these is only one Pole, Mr. Frank P. Danisch. There isn't any reason why one Polish candidate cannot be victorious if all the Poles support him.</p>
   <p>The Republican Party so far has only 4 Polish candidates on their ballot;</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>they are Phillip Ksycki, candidate for Congress; Mr. Edmund Szajkowski, candidate for the Recorder's Office; Mr. P. Schrajda, for county commissioner, and Mr. Emil Kowalski, candidate to the State Legislature, from the 4th District.</p>
   <p>These four Polish candidates should receive enough votes from the Republicans, as they are the only four among all the others.</p>
