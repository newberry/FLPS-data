   <p>On the list of candidates for offices appointed by Mayor Busse not one Pole was placed.</p>
   <p>Why Mr. Busse?</p>
   <p>Do you judge the Poles are only good for voting, or do you think the Poles are only second in line as citizens and do not deserve the jobs?</p>
   <p>We remind our Polish representatives to tell Mr. Busse that there are 250,000 Poles in Chicago.</p>
