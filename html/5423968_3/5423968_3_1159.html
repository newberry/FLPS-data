   <p>The St. Joseph's Society, Group 185 of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, unanimously indorsed the candidacy of Stanley Adamkiewicz for alderman of the Seventeenth Ward. Several gentlemen called attention to the important fact that if all the Poles support the candidacy of Mr. S. Adamkiewicz with action and not just with empty words the victory of a Polish alderman is certain.</p>
   <p>But if those who say "Stanley, I'll go along with you to the end" are only filled with oratory while their hearts are filled with jealousy and deceit, the Polish candidate will be defeated, as we have already witnessed to our shame several times in the past.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we members of the St. Joseph's Society of St. John Cantius Parish appeal to all Poles to forget differences, forgive offenses, unite their strength, exert their best efforts, and reach a state of harmony at a time when we want to accomplish something, so that other nationalities may not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>laugh at us and say: "We can lead the Poles by the nose in any direction that we may want them to take."</p>
   <p>Let us return like for like. We see how other nationalities treat Polish candidates, as, for instance, the little fact of the distribution of pictures of both candidates illustrates. People of other nationalities refuse to display Adamkiewicz's picture in their windows. Should we not do the same in regard to other candidates? Let us rid ourselves of our inferiority complex and stand squarely and fearlessly behind our candidate, and our victory will be certain.</p>
