   <p>We are compelled to repeat our reply to the Polish political clubs and to call their attention to the fact that only by uniting and being aware of our aims can we be led to recognition and acknowledgment.</p>
   <p>There are approximately 300,000 Poles in Illinois, and yet how little recognition they have!</p>
   <p>In order to obtain this recognition and force it upon other national groups, it is essentially necessary to follow the road that leads to the goal, that is, we must show a sincere interest in the politics of this country, which has accepted us so hospitably.</p>
   <p>A group of well-thinking people have undertaken the task of organizing all our clubs into one unit--one large, strong State organization based on a <span class="page-break">\2</span>strictly delineated plan. Undoubtedly, such action will bring us significance and recognition.</p>
   <p>In order to make this idea a reality, we are turning to you, compatriots, with a plea for co-operation in this matter. We are hereby urging all Polish Democratic clubs to call special meetings and to select delegates in the ratio of one for every twenty-five members, and to empower them to join, in the name of the club they represent, the proposed League. The secretaries of the club will forward the list of the delegates to the secretary, Mr. M. J. Szameit, 137 Monroe Street, not later than August 5, adhering to the form given below, and the delegates themselves will appear at a Convention to be held on August 14, at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, at 137 Monroe Street (corner of Clark). The clubs out of Chicago may submit their declaration by mail, stating whether or not they wish to join the Polish Democratic League in the State of Illinois.</p>
