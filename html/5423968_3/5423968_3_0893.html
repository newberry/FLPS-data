   <p>Yesterday's election, in the minds of the intelligent class of people, was a huge triumph for the Polish. The people have spoken this time especially the Polish intelligent voters; we are not servants and tools for the political parties, but the political parties should serve us; we are on the side of the party that is honest, capable and dependable.</p>
   <p>Sincerely we wish them the best, as the result in this great triumph not to one Pole but to all of them, so they can reach the point in securing higher offices and then they shall be able gradually to make the name of a Pole famous not only in the whole state, but in this whole country.</p>
