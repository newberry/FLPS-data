   <p>Last night there was a vast gathering and organizing of Polish Democrats in the 16th Ward, at the hall of St. Stanislaus school. The aim of organizing this club is in our mind an answer to the City's central committee of the Carter Harrison Municipal Ownership League.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Czekatz opened the meeting and requested Mr. A. J. Kwasigroch, a delegate of the central committee, to explain the principles and aims of the above mentioned league. Mr. Kwasigroch explained that the purpose of the league is to bring about the municipal ownership of public utilities, like street cars, gas houses, etc. To assure, in the coming election, the nomination of Mr. Carter H. Harrison for mayor, because he was the sponsor of this movement.</p>
   <p>Later they agreed unanimously to organize the Polish club in the 16th ward.</p>
   <p>They next elected the adminstration for this Polish club, of whom were elected citizens: A. J. Kwasigroch, President; Tecfil Wesetowski, Vice President, W. J. Jozwiakowski, Secretary; Peter Rostenkowski, Cashier; Frank Socki, Sert. at Arms.</p>
