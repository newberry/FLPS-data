   <p>The editorial department of Dziennik Chicagoski has received a letter from Alderman John Scherman, a Republican and a Pole of the Sixteenth Ward, prompted by the articles written by Louis Roland, also a Republican and a Pole, which appeared in the issues of May 14 and May 16 respectively.</p>
   <p>The treatment of the Polish Republican delegation by the Mayor and the humilation accorded them is a serious matter, and it would not be fair if we did not publish Alderman Scherman's letter. This is being done on the basis that there are two sides to each story; then, too, we wish to be fair.</p>
   <p>The letter was written in English and it is only natural, for the benefit of our readers, that it be translated into Polish, adhering strictly to the meaning of the original text.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Alderman J. Scherman's letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Editor: I have noticed in the last two issues (sic) [see page 2, line 5] of your paper the articles written by an alleged Republican condemning the present Mayor of Chicago, the Honorable George B. Swift.</p>
   <p>"In response to these articles I wish to point out that its author (Louis Roland) was a Democrat from the very day he became a citizen, had a position of inspector in the Water Department of Chicago during Hopkins' administration and lost the same under this regime. When he tried in vain to regain his position, he joined the Republican ranks apparently with the hope of getting some kind of political job.</p>
   <p>"As soon as Mr. Swift took office as Mayor, the irate Democrat, Louis Roland, called upon him and demanded the position of water inspector. At that time I told Mr. Roland that he would not get this office nor any other, because he did not deserve it. This evidently angered him against the Republicans, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>resulted in the present articles of vengeance against Mayor Swift.</p>
   <p>"If only our Polish citizens will be patient, they will be convinced that Mr. Swift will treat the Poles right and will keep his promises given to them prior to the election.</p>
   <p>"If Mr. Roland or anyone else claims that Mr. Swift called the delegation "Polacks," he errs; if they claim that they were received coolly, this may be true, because a member of Roland's delegation assured the Mayor that he represented the Poles of Chicago when he had no right to say such a thing--and the Mayor replied: "You represent nobody."</p>
   <p>"I give the Mayor credit for saying this, for the people elect their aldermen for the purpose of representing them, and not any self-constituted committee, formed of chronic office-seekers.</p>
   <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>John Scherman</p>
   <p>Alderman of the Sixteenth Ward."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Thus writes Mr. Scherman. From our point of view we are compelled to say that we do not agree with all the claims and arguments of the alderman of the Sixteenth Ward--and we feel obligated to take necessary steps in this matter. These steps are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The assertion of Mr. Scherman that Mr. Roland is not entitled to a political appointment because he was formerly a Democrat is not justified in our opinion. John Dahlman found himself in the same position and yet he received a political appointment from Mayor Swift. There are many more outstanding Polish Republicans in the same category. It is only natural that the Republican party owes gratitude to the Democrats who came to their side and made the recent victory possible. Not to include this group with those of the Republicans that received appointments, especially after accepting their support, is illogical and unjustifiable....It would seem as if the Republicans wanted the votes of the former Democrats only at the time of the election--and that after the election they did not wish to recognize them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>2. Being acquainted with Mr. Roland, we do not believe nor have we the proof that he wrote the articles in question for mere vengeance. On the contrary, in his attempt we see an entirely different aim: an attempt to do right by his brothers.</p>
   <p>3. As to the audience given by the Mayor to the Polish delegation, we have heard many accounts related by those that were present; all give further evidence that Mayor Swift behaved in an unbecoming manner. Even Mr. Scherman admits that the reception was cold and that the Mayor said: "You represent nobody." In our opinion this is not cold but is plain rudeness, in view of the fact that this statement was made in the presence of others. Even this could have been said, however, in a different form.</p>
   <p>4. We are also of the opinion that the alderman is not the only representative of the people. The alderman represents his ward, and citizens of other wards need not have anything to do with him. Under Mr. Scherman's logic, if the Poles do not gain an alderman of their own nationality in the city council then they <span class="page-break">\6</span>have no right to seek an audience with Mayor Swift. It seems to us that any active politician who worked during the last election, and who was especially aggressive in a Polish political club, has the right to speak in the name and for the good of his brothers.</p>
   <p>5. The delegation that approached the Mayor was not made up of chronic office-seekers--they were respectable citizens. If their names were mentioned everyone would substantiate this fact. The request that Polish Republicans be considered for political appointments is not a crime, and finally:</p>
   <p>6. All the above questions are of lesser importance. The most important is that which Alderman Scherman promises in his letter: that the Poles should have more patience and they will be treated honestly, and that Mayor Swift will keep the promises he made prior to the election. We will overlook in this instance the fact that our patience has been tried once too often, and that the words in Mr. Scherman's letter are sufficient proof that thus far the Poles of the Republican ranks have not been treated fairly, and that Mr. Swift has not as yet <span class="page-break">\7</span>kept his promises. These are of lesser concern. We are more interested in the words of Alderman J. Scherman: that one as well as the other [reference to the promises of Mayor Swift in his letter] will come true. If all this comes true through the efforts of our alderman of the Sixteenth Ward--then we will be grateful to Mr. Swift and Mr. Scherman as well. In every instance every impartial witness will admit that in this entire matter the concern is not about party interests but about the interests of our brothers who have been wronged, although they may belong to a different political camp.</p>
