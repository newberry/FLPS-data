   <p>Last Saturday evening, December 16, a meeting of all the members of the Polish courts of the Catholic Order of Foresters was held in the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall, at the call of the chief ranger of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Court, Mr. V. Bardonski. A few hundred persons assembled. Mr. Bardonski explained that this was not an [ordinary] meeting of one or more courts of the Catholic Order of Foresters because they do not usually engage in political affairs, but that this time he considered it just and right to call a political meeting because the election of a brother member was at stake (the organizer of the Court of the Holy Rosary, in Pullman, Illinois) and the chief argument of his adversaries was the fact that he is a Catholic and they harp on this as if it were a crime.</p>
   <p>Mr. Victor Bardonski was selected as chairman and Mr. Frank Fuhl as secretary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Mr. Leon Szopinski then read a very enlightening article, in the first part of which he answered, in a convincing manner, the Republicans' accusations that the Democrats are responsible for the depression. He also spoke of the tariff, saying that if it has any influence on labor conditions, it cannot be salutary. In the second part of his speech he read a translation of an article published by the Catholic Order of Foresters about the candidacy or Mr. John P. Hopkins. Reverend Vincent Barzynski, who entered during the reading of the article by Mr. L. Szopinski, spoke to the point and condemned the action of the Republicans for mixing religion with politics, and sharply called to account those among the Poles who have been bribed by the opposition and now are trying to confuse our people. Mr. August J. Kowalski spoke next. Mr. Stanley Szwajkart told the audience who the A. P. A.'s are and translated their oath of membership, which we publish in another space.</p>
   <p>Finally, those assembled, unanimously endorsed the candidacy of Mr. John P. Hopkins and passed a motion to prepare appropriate resolutions. The chairman <span class="page-break">3</span>was authorized to select the committee members to prepare [the resolutions] and publish them in the Polish Daily News, and named the following to the committee: Mr. Leon Szopinski, Mr. Stanley Szwajkart, and Mr. Frank Fuhl. The following resolution was prepared:</p>
   <p>"Resolution</p>
   <p>"We the members of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Court No. 69, St. Sigismund Court, Kosciusko Court, and St. Boniface Court of the Catholic Order of Foresters, in meeting assembled, are of the opinion that a candidate's religious convictions have nothing to do with his political affairs--national, state, or municipal--as specified in the Constitution of the United States. As it is well known, the Foresters seldom interest themselves in those matters.</p>
   <p>"Exceptional circumstances, not of their making or of their initiative, occurring during the present political campaign for the election of a mayor to succeed <span class="page-break">4</span>the late Carter H. Harrison, compel the Foresters, as citizens of the United States, to put aside temporarily these convictions and belief. The circumstances in question are: (1) A fellow Forester has been chosen as candidate for mayor by one of the political parties; (2) His opponents are attacking him solely because he professes the Catholic faith, and advertise this fact as a blot on his candidacy; (3) The political party opposed to his candidacy is acting in the name and under the direction of a powerful, widespread organization inimical to the Catholic faith.</p>
   <p>"In view of these facts and considering furthermore,</p>
   <p>"1. That one of the objects of the Catholic Order of Foresters is to defend the Catholic religion and its believers against the actions and attacks of certain organizations, as well as certain individuals, whenever these attacks concern the profession of the holy Catholic faith;</p>
   <p>"2. That a member of the Catholic Order of Foresters, Mr. John P. Hopkins, a <span class="page-break">5</span>man of unblemished character, possessing such ability and distinguished traits that he is well fitted to perform the duties of the highest office in the city, which fact is not disputed by his opponents, who point to his religion as their main objection;</p>
   <p>"3. That the candidate of the opposing party, as it was shown during the campaign, if he were to be elected mayor and compelled to obey the dictates of this powerful anti-Catholic organization, would at all times use his influence to persecute all those professing the Catholic religion;</p>
   <p>"4. That the above-mentioned Mr. John P. Hopkins, as those present at the meeting are fully convinced, if elected, would discharge his duties in an honorable and just manner, and, according to the Constitution of the United States, will not mix political affairs with religion, but will be actuated solely by justice; and finally,</p>
   <p>"5. That this candidate, Mr. John P. Hopkins, is a working man, who has <span class="page-break">6</span>actually worked for $1.25; that he possesses exceptional administrative talent as proven on numerous occasions; that he promises the best guarantee of personal liberty; that he promises faithfully, if elected, to compel the railroad companies to raise their tracks, so as to stop the murdering of our people at streetcar crossings;</p>
   <p>"Therefore, the members of the above-mentioned courts of the Catholic Order of Foresters, assembled at a meeting this sixteenth day of December, 1893, do hereby resolve:</p>
   <p>"1. To cast all their ballots on election day, December 19, 1893, for Mr. John P. Hopkins for mayor;</p>
   <p>"2. To exert all our influence so that this candidate will receive the greatest number of votes;</p>
   <p>"3. To publish this resolution in the papers."</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Great Meeting of Poles</p>
   <p>An enormous meeting--in fact the largest ward meeting of the present campaign in point of attendance and second only to the meeting at the Auditorium last Wednesday--was held last night, December 16, in the Polish hall on Bradley Street. The hall was completely filled; some of the morning papers estimate that between 7,000 and 8,000 people attended and claim that this is a conservative figure; others say that the number of people present was much greater. Such a tremendous gathering impressed the American speakers, and every one of them expressed their admiration for the Poles.</p>
   <p>As early as seven o'clock in the evening, Mr. August J. Kowalski called the meeting to order and, after briefly explaining the purpose of the gathering, called upon Mr. Boleslaus Klarkowski to act as secretary. Alongside the secretary sat the reporters, while on the platform our foremost political leaders took their places. In a short while, however, the entire stage was packed, as there was no room left in the hall.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>The first speaker, Judge [J.] La Buy, comparing the two candidates for mayor, pointed out why no Pole, no workingman, no citizen who has the welfare of our city and inhabitants at heart, should cast his vote for Swift, who never has shown any sympathy for the workingman and oftentimes worked contrary to their interests.</p>
   <p>Next Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, in a beautiful speech, announced that peace reigns in South Chicago in spite of the rumors that the Poles have split. Then he explained why, after belonging to the Republican party for 20 years, he had left it, just as some of the better known statesmen and politicians had done when they found out how scandalously it had begun to work. He sharply criticized those Poles who even now are attempting to defend the Republicans, and who dare even to distribute pamphlets couched in silky words. These persons, unworthy of being called Poles, who are notorious anarchists and dynamiters and never did anything worth while for their countrymen, sign their names to these circulars, in which they suddenly speak of the necessity of building new churches. Feeling sure that Mr. Hopkins will win by at least a majority of 10,000, <span class="page-break">9</span>Mr. Kiolbassa explained how dangerous it would be if the Poles should be split, and how important it is to be united in a solid front for those things that may prove beneficial to them. He then spoke of the hard times caused by the Republicans, compared the two candidates for mayor, urged the Poles to educate themselves so that they may be able to hold political offices, and said he hoped this would soon happen. He concluded with a request for a thrice-repeated cry for Hopkins, which the audience did willingly and enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski spoke next. Referring to the article read by Mr. Leon Szopinski the day before, he pointed out that the question of the tariff has no connection with the depression, and that it has been proven that workers in industries protected by the tariff earn less than those not so protected. He condemned the Republicans for bringing up the question of religion, which should have no connection with politics, and stated that we should never inquire about the faith of a candidate when it comes to support or oppose him. He further belabored those who fool the people for personal reasons and even now speak in <span class="page-break">10</span>favor of the Republicans, and in conclusion exhorted all, as working-men, as citizens, as Poles, as Catholics, to support the candidacy of Mr. Hopkins with all their strength.</p>
   <p>During Reverend Barzynski's speech, the new Chicago postmaster, Mr. Washington Hessing, entered the hall amid great applause.</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted that Mr. Washington Hessing, who began beautifully, was not able to finish his speech.</p>
   <p>He began by describing his travels through Europe seven years ago, how amazed he was when traveling through Warsaw, Cracow, Torun, and that then he had come to the conclusion that the Poles were emigrating to the United States primarily in search for freedom, which is their main and foremost aim, and to improve their condition. He mentioned the Kosciusko Mound, the Copernicus monument, many prominent statesmen, and spoke of Kosciusko, Prince Poniatowski, Copernicus, Sobieski, Pulaski, saying that if these great could now look down upon our <span class="page-break">11</span>present-day Poles, they would gratefully see their love for the ideals which they themselves held sacred. He enumerated the true points of freedom, which the Democrats are defending, and had barely mentioned the anonymous letters being broadcast by the Republicans, when Mr. John P. Hopkins entered the hall and was hailed with indescribable enthusiasm. The cries for Hopkins lasted a few minutes before the audience quieted enough to permit him to speak.</p>
   <p>Mr. John P. Hopkins speaks in a fast, businesslike manner and strictly to the point, without using any oratorical phrases, any humorous anecdotes or mannerisms, but so convincingly that one can instantly recognize in him a man who knows exactly what he wants and will accomplish what he attempts. He began by remarking that the Republicans, at their meetings, talk about matters foreign to the city government and its affairs, and that, they, furthermore, are resorting to unfair campaign tricks. For example, they have distributed orange-colored cards that read: "Candidates to be voted for on December 19, 1893. George B. Swift, Protestant; John P. Hopkins, Romanist," He added: "I stand before you as a <span class="page-break">12</span>candidate, a citizen of the United States, and on this basis I ask for your support. I do not consider religion and abhor such actions." So saying he threw the card away. He then described the Democratic platform, which he wishes to defend with all his strength. He raised three points: (1) The separation of politics from police administration. The late Carter H. Harrison freed the fire department from the shackles of political influence; he desired to free the police also, but was unable to finish the job. He pledges to do this when elected mayor, and he believes that we will elect him. (2) Speedy railway transportation by elevated railroads. (3) Elimination of murderous streetcar crossings. Mr. Swift liked this Democratic platform and accepted it, but he has already violated the first point by nominating Shippy and sending sixteen policemen to interfere in the first ward primaries. As to the last point, Swift is indifferent to it (later on Judge Prendergast said, that Swift calls this a whim of the people). Then Mr. Hopkins gave assurance that he would not interfere with the people's enjoyment on Sundays, as long as it does not disturb the peace, whereas Swift plays the role of saint in this matter. Finally the speaker mentioned the accusations against him--besides the fact that <span class="page-break">13</span>he is a Catholic. The accusations were that he has never held any public office and that he is too young....He triumphantly answered both, and as to the second one, he said that he was born 36 years ago and that for 20 of these years he had worked hard for a livings. He ended by assuring all that as soon as he is elected mayor he will grant the demands of various nationalities and will give the city an honest and frugal administration. Tremendous cries were raised in honor of Mr. Hopkins, who then seated himself and remained in the hall until the meeting ended.</p>
   <p>Judge Prendergast in a very comical and happy manner described the good points of his friend, G. B. Swift, or rather Goodbye Swift; because on Tuesday we will yell, "Goodbye, Swift!"</p>
   <p>The serious part of the judge's speech consisted mainly in proving that Swift is not a friend of the working class, that only corporations can receive any benefits from him, that he is too saintly for this world, that we should wish him, not one pair, but a few pairs of wings so that he can leave this rotten <span class="page-break">14</span>world and take up his abode among the angels; while we, a sinful people, prefer a mayor who, like Hopkins, will not be scandalized by Sunday entertainments. Speaking of the depression, he reminded his listeners that we suffered a similar depression during the Republican administration and during the tariff enforcement in the years 1837, 1857, 1873, and 1877, when conditions were much worse than they are now.</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Frank Lawler very convincingly pointed out that the Republicans are the cause of this depression. Grover Cleveland saved the country from complete ruin by compelling Congress to revoke the Sherman law, and Sherman himself helped correct his reputation by helping the president to do this.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Alderman Stanley H. Kunz emphasized the necessity of voting and explained how to vote and blot the cross with a blotter so that it would not show in another circle, thereby invalidating the ballot.</p>
   <p>Thus ended a meeting the like of which as to size had never been seen before in <span class="page-break">15</span>the Polish hall of the St. Stanislaus Kostka School.</p>
   <p>Two Polish meetings in South Chicago are proof that the Poles in that district are working in harmony and peace, and everybody is solidly supporting the Democratic candidate, John P. Hopkins.</p>
   <p>At three o'clock in the afternoon a meeting was held in Mr. A. Templin's hall on Commercial Avenue. Mr. Stephen Szulski presided, and Mr. [Joseph P.] Szymanski acted as secretary. The first speaker, Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, eloquently described the machinations of traitors working for the Republican party, anarchists who presumably are working to build more churches and distribute odious circulars. Captain Kinney explained what the Democrats are doing for the working people and what laws benefiting them were passed by them. Cries for Hopkins were given three times. Mr. Hogen also spoke, remarking that the Republicans had never given an office to a Pole, while the Democrats did. The fourth speaker, Mr. John Kondziorski, said he had heard that some Republican mentioned that if anyone went to South Chicago with a Democratic speech, he would <span class="page-break">16</span>be hanged. Everybody laughed and cried out that on Tuesday the Republican party will be hanged.</p>
   <p>In the evening another meeting was held in Mr. R. Retmanski's hall, corner of Buffalo Avenue and 84th Street. Mr. J. Koziczynski presided and Mr. J. Chima acted as secretary. The chairman gave a biographical sketch of Mr. Hopkins and assured his listeners that the latter would favor the Poles in the Polish communities. Mr. P. O. Salomon spoke in the same spirit in English, and Mr. John Kondziorski spoke at length (he was frequently applauded). The other speakers were Mr. J. Merrill, Mr. R. Retmanski, and Captain Kinney.</p>
   <p>Other Meetings</p>
   <p>Last Saturday evening a Democratic meeting was held in the 28th precinct of the Sixteenth Ward, in a hall at 51 Fry Street. The speakers were M. Kalasa, J. Rapacinsk, John J. Dahlman, and others.</p>
   <p>In the Thirtieth Ward a meeting was held at three o'clock in the afternoon in <span class="page-break">17</span>Columbia Hall, corner 48th and Paulina Streets. Mr. M. Gryszczynski presided and spoke; other speakers were E. Z. Brodowski, Senators Johnson, M. McInerney, and M. H. Madden.</p>
   <p>Polish Youth--May it Live!</p>
   <p>That our young people are taking an active part in political matters in a sensible manner is proven by the existence of the Polish Youth Democratic Club of the Sixteenth Ward. At the meeting held last Saturday night, the club passed a resolution condemning the actions of those Polish gangster businessmen who for a few paltry Republican dollars betray the Democratic party by selling out to Swift.</p>
   <p>Some Additional Notices</p>
   <p>Tomorrow is election day. We believe and hope that Mr. John P. Hopkins, the Democratic candidate for mayor, will receive a plurality of 10,000 to 25,000 votes for the following reasons:</p>
   <span class="page-break">18</span>
   <p>1. Because he is a candidate of the workingman, a defender of the working class, a man who has worked as a laborer and thoroughly understands their needs;</p>
   <p>2. Because he was nominated on a platform so excellent that nothing was left for the Republicans but to attempt to steal it for themselves;</p>
   <p>3. Because he is virtuous, honest, experienced, energetic, impartial to those born here or abroad, clever, understands the needs of the city and its in-habitants, and possesses all the necessary qualifications to supply them.</p>
   <p>4. Because the candidate of the opposing party, Mr. George B. Swift, has been an officeholder all his life, does not understand the needs of the workers and acts against their welfare, does not even know how to prepare a platform, calls the demand for protection against crossing murders a human whim, wants to appear as a saint, because he presumably insists on keeping Sunday a holy day, has no regard for the foreign born, openly hates and persecutes Catholics, and, <span class="page-break">19</span>while performing the duties of temporary mayor, already has nominated infamous persons previously discharged from the force, supervising officers of the police; and finally,</p>
   <p>5. Because his worst enemies cannot accuse Mr. John P. Hopkins of anything, excepting,</p>
   <p>a. That he is a Catholic, whereas at an election the question of religion has no place;</p>
   <p>b. That he has not held any public office before, which redounds to his credit because he has been untouched by the diseases of political intrigues;</p>
   <p>c. That he is presumably too young. He is 36 years old, and as Mr. Kiolbassa said at a meeting yesterday, if he hasn't acquired wisdom yet then he never will; besides, the creator of that most wonderful act, the Constitution of the United States, was only 27 years old when he wrote it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">20</span>
   <p>We hope therefore that Mr. Hopkins is victor by a great majority, but there is a possibility that he will not win if the Democrats are again as indifferent as they were in the November elections. Let us, therefore, remember: Every person, without an exception, should vote.</p>
   <p>Vote as early as possible. Voting permitted only until four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>Those with plenty of time, should permit others, who must go to work, to vote first.</p>
   <p>Make a cross plainly in the circle of the Democratic party, and blot it with a blotter, so that when folding the ballot the cross will not be duplicated on the opposite side, because this would nullify the ballot. But once again:</p>
   <p>Every person, without an exception, should vote.</p>
   <span class="page-break">21</span>
   <p>American Protective Association</p>
   <p>(A. P. A.)</p>
   <p>Who are the A. P. A.'s that are supporting the candidacy of Swift for mayor of the city of Chicago, and what are their aims can best be seen by the authentic oath which every member joining the A. P. A. must take, and we advise everybody to read it before he votes.</p>
   <p>The Oath</p>
   <p>To the candidate: "Place your right hand over your heart, give your name, and then keep silent.</p>
   <p>"I hereby solemnly promise and swear that I will not permit any member of the Roman Catholic Church to become a member of this organization; that I will use my influence to support all Protestant businesses the world over; that I will <span class="page-break">22</span>not employ any Roman Catholic in any character, if I can possibly hire a Protestant; that I will not help build or support any Roman Catholic church or other institution connected in any way with this religion or sect, but will do everything in my power to push back and break the power of the Pope; that I will not talk about this organization to any Roman Catholic and will not enter into any agreement with Roman Catholics in regard to strikes or any other mutual actions whereby the Roman Catholic workingmen could expose and take the place of Protestants; that in all trouble-some matters I will consult only Protestants, excluding the Roman Catholics, and that I will not inform them of anything that may be decided at these meetings; that I will not support the nomination at any caucus or convention of any Roman Catholic, but will vote solely for a Protestant; that I will endeavor at all times to appoint Protestants to political offices. (Repeat.) I solemnly subscribe and swear to all of this, so help me God. Amen."</p>
   <p>Chaplain: "Marshal, lead them now to the vice-president."</p>
   <p>Marshal: "Mr. Vice-president, I present to you these friends for further <span class="page-break">23</span>instructions as to the objects and aims of our order."</p>
   <p>Vice-president: "Let darkness now be dissipated. Remove the clouds so that the light of wisdom can shine before their vision. (Blindfolds are removed from the candidates' eyes.) Consider how wonderful it is to be freed from the oppression of mental darkness, leading to nowhere! My friends, one of the objects of this order is to call the attention of citizens to the fact that they blindly permit papal power to gain absolute control over our educational institutions and over our state and local governments. Even now we are shackled through the terrible influence of the Roman Catholic Church on this continent. Consider it your duty always to help us make others cognizant of the dangers threatening our free institutions." (The candidates face the vice-president, who may deliver a speech from memory.)</p>
   <p>Vice-president: "Marshal, lead these friends to the president for final vows and instructions concerning the secret activities of our order."</p>
   <p>President: "Place your right hand on this confiscated emblem of the Roman <span class="page-break">24</span>Catholic Church (a crucifix), and your left hand on your Holy Bible and repeat after me: 'I hereby become an enemy of the Roman Catholic faith. I am an enemy of the Pope living in Rome or elsewhere. I am an enemy of its priests and emissaries and the diabolical actions of the Roman Catholic Church, and do hereby enlist in the defense of Protestantism so that nothing will prevent it from performing its civil duties, and I solemnly obligate myself to defend for all time and in every conceivable manner the good name of this order and its members; so help me God. Amen.'"</p>
