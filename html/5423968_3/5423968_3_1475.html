   <p>On the last day of February nominations for aldermen were held in Chicago, in which Poles were nominated on the Democratic ticket in three wards. They are: In the 16th ward, John Szymkowski; in the 17th, S. S. Walkowiak; and in the 28th, Max Adamowski.</p>
   <p>But in the 11th ward because of no solidarity among the Poles, alderman K. Pettkoske lost, but he will run again, on the Independent ticket.</p>
   <p>Activity in Polish districts leaves very much to wish for. The newspapers are supporting some of the Polish candidates, but you, readers, if you want to know something about politics, and how much good has been done for you, you never will find out about that in the newspapers.</p>
