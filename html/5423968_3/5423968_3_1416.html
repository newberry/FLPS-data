   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>April 13, 1927.</p>
   <p>Hon. William Hale Thompson</p>
   <p>Mayor of Chicago</p>
   <p>City Hall,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>My dear Mayor Thompson:</p>
   <p>I acknowledge with thanks the kind and sincere offer made by you and the Honorable Charles S. Peterson, City Treasurer, for the position of Assistant City Treasurer, and which has had my most careful, diligent and candid consideration; and the result of which I am herewith submitting.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The tender is a most complimentary one and naturally gives me much pleasure; especially since it comes unsolicited, and after my defeat at the recent election for office of City Treasurer in spite of my strenous, open and militant efforts for the success of the entire Democratic ticket. I assure you that you have my hearty appreciation and sincere thanks. I fully realize the splendid spirit which promoted this act; and it is clear to me that the tender was not the result of a party matter nor was it the discharge of a personal obligation.</p>
   <p>You are giving evidence at the very beginning of your administration, of good will toward American citizens and tax payers of this city, who are of Polish origin and descent; and that you wish the cooperation and service in public office, of persons not only of your political party, but also of men of my party. I owe however, much of my success to the men and women of the Democratic Party; many of your Party; independent voters of all Parties, and the splendid newspapers of Chicago, as well as to that large element of American citizens of Polish extraction, who have so loyally and energetically supported me and the entire Democratic ticket in the last election.</p>
   <p>During the recent campaign, members of the Democratic County Committee, supported me loyally and energetically. Election returns, bear evidence that I ran abead of my ticket. Their faith in me was demonstrated in many ways.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>I shall, therefore, in the years to come, do my best to merit the continual support and confidence of those who have supported me in the past, and to win the approval of many others. I make these acknowledgements because I want you to know how profoundly I understand and appreciate the splendid thought and spirit which actuated you to make me the recipient of the compliment, which in reality you pay to all members of the Democratic Party, and to all Americans of Polish origin and descent in this city.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that I have already made definite plans for my future, which will make the acceptance of your offer impossible, I must respectfully decline. In doing so, permit me to express my sincere hope and hearty wish that your administration be a success, for the good of Chicago and its people, and that the record you make for yourself in the next four years will rebound to your credit and glory.</p>
   <p>Many Americans of Polish origin in your own party, will, I am sure be glad to act in the capacity of that office which you have so kindly tendered me.</p>
   <p>For the good of Chicago, I am,</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>M. S. Szymczak.</p>
