   <p>The recently organized Polish Social Club of Chicago, with headquarters at 695 Milwaukee Avenue, was officially opened to its members on Saturday, February 10.</p>
   <p>The Club has been furnished so as to provide comfort for its members; it contains a reading room, a billiard table, a piano, several chess tables, a writing desk, and several card tables. Light lunches and an assortment of drinks are also available.</p>
   <p>The Club is open daily from 6 P.M. to 1 A.M.; on Sundays from 3 P.M. to 1 A.M. Each member is privileged to bring one friend.</p>
   <p>Beginning next Sunday, every Sunday, after 7 P.M., will be set aside as ladies' day. All members are requested to attend the inauguration of ladies' day with their wives.</p>

   <p>Thus far thirty members are listed. The membership will be increased, although at present it will be limited because of the small headquarters. The initiation fee is three dollars and the monthly dues one dollar.</p>
   <p>Gaiety reigned on opening night. The initial results show that this new Polish organization has a right to exist and that many will join it in due time in order to encourage greater social activities among the Poles.</p>
   <p>Plans are under way to hold many kinds of entertainments for the members and their families as soon as [this year's] national mourning [for the Poles' unsuccessful revolt against Russia] is over.</p>
