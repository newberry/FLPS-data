   <p>Two thousand workers joined in a strike after the repulse of fifty Polish workers, whose demands called for increase in wages and better working conditions. The strikers have taken over the four main steel plants; together with their families they walk the streets. Their behavior is respectful under the guidance of many police who keep vigil for any possible outbreak in the strike area.</p>
   <p>The workers' delegation chosen by the strikers conferred with the steel plant owners about the strikers' demand of an increase of twenty-five cents per day. In response to their demands the steel owners threaten to keep their plants closed, unless the strikers wish to go back to work under the previous conditions.</p>
   <p>The striking workers are fully confident that they will receive their present demands.</p>
