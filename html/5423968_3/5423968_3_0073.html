   <p>The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy urgently exhorts all tailors of Polish origin not to work as strikebreakers. Our people are requested not to act against their compatriots who demand better conditions of labor. Those who be come "scabs" will gain nothing and will lose respect among their fellow men. They will remain slaves of the exploiters--those self-centered people who, for a miserable pittance, would make prematurely old men of their employees and cause misery to our families.</p>
