   <p>Do you think, dear working men, that a capitalist will vote for a poor man even if he is with hom on one ballot? Oh, no. He votes only for a rich man. It makes no difference whether the candidate is a Republican or a Democrat, as long as he is a millionaire.</p>
   <p>They reject a poor man; they do not want a poor man for a senator or a governor; they do not even want him to be a justice of the peace, for they say that a working man is not a human being.</p>
   <p>Working men! Open your eyes and vote for your own men.</p>
