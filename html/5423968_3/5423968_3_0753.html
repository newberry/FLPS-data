   <p>The registration of voters, which will take place on October 13 for the second and last time before the fall campaign, should be for all Poles, both men and women, an opportunity to manifest our actual strength.</p>
   <p>We need no longer fear that by registering for a certain ticket, we shall be obliged to vote for it in the final election. By supporting a certain party or ticket we merely help to decide who shall be nominated. He who registers now will be able to vote according to the dictates of his conscience in the fall elections. Our Democrats and Republicans will be able to vote for Progressives, and vice versa. Even though one asks for a Democratic or a Republican ballot at the polls he can make as many changes on it as he likes.</p>
   <p>The question, of course, is what sort of changes should be made? In the first place, we voters should now correct the consequences of our own past negligence. Having 73,000 votes in the state of Illinois, and 67,000 in the city of Chicago, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>we could have cast 30,000 Democratic and 10,000 Republican votes; even with a low-percentage registration. Therefore, if we could have got only a small number of non-Polish votes, we could have nominated our compatriots to the most important posts.</p>
   <p>Assessor F. Koraleski counted on this when he declared his candidacy for the important office of County Treasurer, in which capacity he could have assured positions to about a hundred Poles. Mr. F. X. Rydzewski counted on this and having Harrison's support, he could easily have received the nomination for Tax Adjuster, an office of great importance to us. Mr. Zwiefka counted on this in running for the office of Trustee of the Sanitary District.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile, with all of our protestations of patriotism and solemn promises of complete solidarity, we have helped our candidates and ourselves only to the extent that Koraleski received 17,039 votes, Rydzewski 26,588, and Zwiefka 23,000.</p>
   <p>Nothing but our own Polish carelessness defeated these three candidates of ours <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and about twenty-five others, who all together had spent at least fifty thousand dollars on their campaigns before the primaries.</p>
   <p>Our defeat was most complete in the nominations of congressmen. Here careless-ness was joined by jealousy and envy. Through our fratricidal battles we helped to defeat a Pole even in the Eighth District, which is solidly Polish, and in which two candidates, Dankowski and Sabath, were running for the office of Representative.</p>
   <p>Although we were well-aware of the fact that these offices depend on the ward committeemen; we neglected to campaign for Polish candidates and gave the whole election away to strangers!</p>
   <p>Even in Ward Sixteen, which is entirely Polish, we elected a Republican, a certain Mr. K., and defeated W. Schrojda, the well-known former County Commissioner.</p>
   <p>An adage says: a Pole is wise after the harm has been done. Having been sorely beaten at the primaries, we should at least become a little wiser and see to it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>that we all turn out to register now.</p>
   <p>If we understood our national interest and the importance of having our own spokesman in the Congress of the United States, we could still obtain at least one congressional seat.</p>
   <p>Our compatriot Dr. E. F. Napieralski, brother of Miss Emily Napieralski, general secretary of the Alliance of Polish Women, received the Progressive nomination for Representative of the Fifth District.</p>
   <p>Dr. Napieralski, as well as his sister, is known for his ardent patriotism and his praiseworthy civic work. He comes from a family which is included among the pioneers of St. Adalbert's Parish. Besides this our Doctor has enjoyed the friendship of the citizens of Ward Eleven for many years and is well-known through-out District Five.</p>
   <p>It is time that the Poles wake up. Their enthusiasm should reach other nationalities. <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>A little goodwill on our part is sorely needed. We must finally glean an understanding of our own vital interests.</p>
   <p>We have heard that members of the Polish National Alliance of the Fifth Congressional District want to initiate and direct an energetic campaign for Dr. E. F. Napieralski for Representative. A committee of prominent citizens is already at work. An appeal to elect Napieralski will be made within the next few days.</p>
