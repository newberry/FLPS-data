Smulski, Republican candidate for the office of city attorney, gave indication that the party is taking steps to nominate Mr. Smulski for mayor in the year 1907. Great success for Mr. Smulski is in store for the next two years as city attorney; his victory on the Steward ticket by a majority of 17,596 votes gave the politicians great hopes for a good and strong Republican ticket in the future.</p>
   <p>"A few leaders of this party made it known that Mr. Smulski's popularity among all the people, and his record as city attorney, will stand out unblemished; it is upon this record that the Republican party, after his term of two years is over, will nominate him as candidate for the office of mayor in our city. The party is asking all the Polish people, regardless of the party they stand for, to think this matter over, and support Mr. Smulski in all his undertakings; he is the best Polish candidate to seek an office as mayor, and needs your heartiest support at present and in the future."</p>
