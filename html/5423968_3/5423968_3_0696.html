   <p>Next Tuesday, April 3, Chicago will hold its so-called spring election, that is, the aldermanic election.</p>
   <p>At this election a city treasurer and a clerk, as well as an alderman for each ward, will be elected.</p>
   <p>The campaign, which has been rather lively, is now drawing to a close, with several big rallies scheduled for tomorrow. The unusual activities before election are attributed to the fact that the city council is faced with a number of important problems, the solution of which requires the election of the right men.</p>
   <p>Peace and quiet have reigned in the Sixteenth Ward since the primaries. Stanley Kunz is certain of victory, because the Republican party has no candidate, and the Socialist party hardly counts. After violent primaries, calm and harmony, accompanied by the handshakes of erstwhile enemies reign <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>supreme. The election of Kunz may be considered accomplished.</p>
   <p>In the Seventeenth Ward, however, the battle goes on. Here the Poles for the first time in the history of the ward want to elect a Polish alderman and get rid of a man of another nationality who has held this post for fourteen years. In order to assure themselves of victory, the influential politicians of this ward agreed on a compromise candidate, and their choice fell on Mr. Stanley Adamkiewicz.</p>
   <p>After receiving the nomination, Mr. Adamkiewicz got to work and distinguished himself by the way he conducted his energetic campaign. His campaign was clean, not one of mud-slinging. Mr. Adamkiewicz and his followers fought with honest weapons, and honest citizens are supporting him, confident of victory on Tuesday.</p>
   <p>A recent count shows that 176 Polish societies--national, parochial, Falcons', and singing--have endorsed and are backing Adamkiewicz. Among these societies <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>there are groups of the Polish National Alliance, the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Alliance of Polish Falcons, the Polish Singers' Alliance, the Polish Women's Alliance, the Polish Alma Mater, and the Society of Poles in America. Also backing Adamkiewicz are a large number of communes, settlements, and citizens' clubs.</p>
   <p>These societies and clubs represent all kinds of responsible men and women. Therefore, there are excellent prospects of the election of our countryman.</p>
   <p>These societies are carrying on their activities within the boundaries of the Seventeenth Ward, and they include four parishes--Holy Trinity, St. John Cantius, St. Innocent and St. Stephen.</p>
   <p>Reports for which there is some foundation, and some of which even have been proved, are circulating to the effect that some Poles of the Seventeenth Ward are courting the non-Polish candidate and even listen to his promises.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Speakers at political rallies have said several times that they have proof of a conspiracy to betray the Polish candidate, and assert that after the election they will attend to these people properly.</p>
   <p>We really cannot make ourselves believe this, but if this treachery is proved--woe to these political "knifers"!</p>
   <p>The political harmony that prevails in the Seventeenth Ward shows that when the Poles get to work in earnest they can accomplish anything. Among those who have spoken for the candidacy of the Polish candidate, Mr. S. Adamkiewicz, the following should be listed: Ward Committeeman J. Ruszkiewicz, Alderman S. Walkowiak, Attorney J. Jankowski, former Commissioner M. Kolasa, Judge J. La Buy, T. Weyne, secretary of the Democratic organization, S. Gorecki, M. Wojtecki, and S. Kielczynski. There are also a whole legion of others who have spared neither time nor money to assure the election of our countryman.</p>
   <p>The Polish women have also organized a campaign to help Adamkiewicz and have <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>promised to vote for him. Even the Polish Republicans are working and campaigning to get rid of the present non-Polish alderman.</p>
   <p>In the next day or two the citizens of the Seventeenth Ward will receive the last call, in which they will be urged to go to the polls and elect S. A. Adamkiewicz. Let this call reach their hearts and their sense of civic duty, and the Seventeenth Ward--almost entirely Polish--will have two energetic Polish aldermen.</p>
