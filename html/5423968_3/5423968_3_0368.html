   <p>The Socialist "comrades" in Chicago besmirch everyone and everything, because they are unable to combat the Polish National Alliance in any other way. Their attacks are directed against the newspaper of the Alliance, especially Dziennik Zwiazkowy, whose editorials from time to time point out the mistakes of these radicals and give them words of good advice. These disturbing elements now resort to new tactics: they spread false news to the effect that the Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, is against the working class, is antagonistically inclined toward the laborer.</p>
   <p>Behold, brethren! Who would ever suspect that these so-called "comrades" would make such a miraculous discovery!.....Dziennik Zwiazkowy is an enemy of the workers! Hear ye, people, and wonder! A newspaper edited by the working class, directed and published not by tycoons and millionaires but by working men writing for the working class--is a foe of the laboring cause....Dziennik Zwiazkowy <span class="page-break">2</span>is willing and ready to reward generously each and every "comrade" who can prove that this newspaper in any manner or at any time has appeared against the working man, or that it has not defended the cause of labor in its articles and commentaries and even in telegrams and in the columns of local news.</p>
   <p>It requires a great amount of audacity to claim that Dziennik Zwiazkowy is antagonistic toward the working class and that it is detrimental to the workers cause. These so-called "comrades" are very modest; they do not assert that the directors of this newspaper obtained a large amount of graft from the capitalists so that the editors would write against labor. People of the type of the so-called comrades of Chicago would consider it a trifle to make allegations of that nature.</p>
   <p>One can readily ascertain the reason for the attacks directed by these "comrades" against Dziennik Zwiazkowy. By their calumnies and lies of the lowest type, they attempt to becloud the minds of those people who listen to their idiotic ravings.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Being bankrupt morally and materially, and failing miserably in the editing of their insignificant newspaper, they attempt to convince our people that Dziennik Zwiazkowy is a foe of the working class, so that they can befuddle the less knowing and force their newspaper upon them as a supposed defender of the worker. Their usual tactics are to play upon the nerves of the working people and expose "enemies" to them. This they do in order to gain from the misunderstandings, since they have no one's welfare at heart but their own. Whoever reads Dziennik Zwiazkowy knows well that it not only is unopposed to any type of working people but always defends workers against exploitation. The fact that this newspaper does not summon the strikers to violence and riots during a strike--as the "comrades" are usually inclined to do--is only for the good of the working men themselves, because usually riots and violence have an unfavorable effect upon those who engage in them.</p>
   <p>The police, under such circumstances, usually conduct themselves brutally. They club the innocent as well as the guilty, and arrest them, and the sympathy of the general public is averted from the strikers if they produce disorder. For the <span class="page-break">4</span>good of the workers themselves, therefore, it is advisable to restrain them from acts of violence, which will not help the workers' cause but, on the contrary, will only serve to do it harm.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy acknowledges and even supports strikes based upon a principle. This newspaper is of the opinion that strikes are the only weapon of defense against exploiters. Injustice is done the working people and they are compelled to fight for their rights, but, after all, every person of sound mind knows that nothing can be gained by smashing windows in factories, destroying materials and machines, and engaging in street brawls. The capitalist, who is the exploiter, is even pleased when the employees fight among themselves; it does not hurt him and he is well protected by insurance companies against any material destruction. The only one to lose in these riots is the workingman, who is clubbed and arrested by the hirelings of the capitalists. A person must be below the dignity of man who would incite the innocent to riot while he himself seeks protection behind the striker's back.....</p>
   <p>That type of man is not a true friend of labor who raves and rants on the streets, <span class="page-break">5</span>makes foul speeches against the capitalists, and incites unprotected workers to violence, from which they will emerge second best. But, on the other hand, he who teaches the people solidarity and proper conduct during strikes is a true and sincere defender of workers' rights. Let us teach the working people that everyone should be a member of an organization, that no one should proceed to deprive his brother of means of livelihood while he strives and fights for the rights of the working class, that all should conduct themselves peaceably and in unison in every respect. When all this comes about and when the people become convinced of the value that such conduct possesses, then, and only then, will the laboring class succeed in attaining better conditions of existence. It will not be necessary to resort to any violence or to rely upon ravings heard on the streets. That is the way Dziennik Zwiazkowy understands the labor question. It is not labor's enemy but its true friend, despite the ravings of demagogues of the red banner, whose eyes have been so blinded by red that they see an enemy in everyone who does not rave in the same way as they. It might be well to conclude with the religious supplication "Defend us, O Lord, against pestilence, privation, fire, war, and such 'comrades'."</p>
