   <p>The finance committee of the City Council passed a motion to assign a subcommittee to examine the books of the City Treasurer, Mr. P. Kiolbassa, and to ascertain what amount of interest he did collect. At the same time legal advice is to be obtained, that is, the committee has a right to conduct an investigation of such nature. Alderman McGillen is to name a committee of that type today.</p>
   <p>The Democrats were of the opinion that the City Council would pass a resolution of gratitude to Mr. Kiolbassa in behalf of the city for his patriotic and civic action; instead, the Council harasses him by ordering an investigating committee to examine the books. If Mr. Kiolbassa retained the $18,000 and all the interest--legally nothing could be done to prevent him from so doing.</p>
