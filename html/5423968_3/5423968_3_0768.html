   <p>Nationalistic work embraces everything which aims at the increase of Polish strength in order to exert influence in public matters and social development and to enlighten the masses.</p>
   <p>This work, therefore, embraces efforts to take part in the Government here--a part that is not merely representative but actual, as well.</p>
   <p>Members of the Polish National Alliance, who have always been pioneers in all sorts of nationalistic work, must show unequaled energy in this field and must double the efforts of other organizations and societies.</p>
   <p>Many feel that taking such part in national, state, or municipal politics causes party quarrels and enmities. But is not everyone who gives up everything for the homeland basically as partisan as he who wishes to help elect the most appropriate and most worthy men to serve its cause?</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p> On the basis of loyalty to our brother Poles, we believe that it is the duty of every Alliance member to support praiseworthy efforts to assure the Poles appropriate offices, through co-operation in the election battle.</p>
   <p>Members of the Alliance, as Poles, aim in this battle at the victory of candidates belonging to the Alliance and any candidate outside of the Alliance whose political history is a guarantee that he will honorably discharge the duties of his office.</p>
   <p>Members of the Alliance must take into consideration the fact that in order to obtain a numerically strong and efficient representation in government posts we need Polish solidarity at elections.</p>
   <p>Therefore, each one of us must understand the fact that an unregistered Polish vote or a vote not cast at the election is a double loss, since it weakens us and strengthens our opponents.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The primaries are a sort of test of our national strength, therefore everyone of both sexes should make a great effort to take part in these primaries.</p>
   <p>One should also campaign among his friends and acquaintances and encourage them to give wider support to mutually desirable candidates.</p>
   <p>When voting for Poles, we must also vote for the closer friends of the Poles in order to preserve political combinations which have as their aim the assurance of the combined vote for both our candidates and the candidates of our supporters.</p>
   <p>The state of Illinois has granted the vote to women, but in general the women voters can vote for only the following candidates: municipal judges, among them whom the three Polish candidates are Edmund Jarecki, Stanley Walkowiak, and John Przystalski; trustees of the Sanitary district, among whom the Polish candidates are Vincent S. Zwiefka and Henry Nowak; and the candidates for the Board of Review, of whom the only Pole is Francis X. Rydzewski. The bloc vote of the Polish <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>women can help these candidates towards victory on the day of the primaries. It can exert a very good and noble influence on the entire election, since, following the example of Polish womenn, the men who talk good patriotism may crawl out of their comfortable slippers and make extreme effort to become actual patriots for one day by aiding their brothers who are running thos time for important offices.</p>
   <p>In our present circumstances, the most important post for us is that of congressman. It would open for us the door to the floor of Congress 138 years after the Declaration of Independence of this country and after the gallant co-operation of Kosciusko and Pilaski in building independence. It would give us the opportunity to present before the Congress of the United States our interests and our needs, the conditions of our existence, and the rights of our homeland to full independence--rights which have never expired.</p>
   <p>Therefore, every Alliance member should cast his vote for a Polish candidate for Congress and work zealously and enthusiastically to assure our candidates the nomination.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Adalbert I. Danisch is running for Representative at Large, that is, for the entire state. let us give him a chance by giving him our vote.</p>
   <p>The Fifth Congressional District has recommended to its voters, for congressman, the gallant Alliance member, the honest, capable, and ardent citizen S.F. Dankowski, Assistant Judge of the Probate court. A very active campaign is indispensable, but with it this candidate will doubtlessly secure the nomination.</p>
   <p>Of the candidates for Representative of the Fourth District, Joseph Mendriski, one of the clerks of the Probate court, is the only Pole among ten foreigners and therefore has a good chance.</p>
   <p>In the Seventh District (Avondale and St. Hedwig's Parish) the young lawyer Jeseph L. Lissak has a good chance and should be supported as much as possible. He is being opposed in the District by the present congressman Bohanan, who openly worked against the interests of Poles in the matter of immigration <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>and should be beaten.</p>
   <p>In the Eighth District, which is entirely Polish and which encompasses the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Wards, the alderman John Czekala and Stanley Kunz are running for election to Congress. The latter, an old leader of our Polish Democrats, is being fought in every way by his opponents. In this district the enormous number of Polish votes should assure the election of a Pole.</p>
   <p>Besides the congressional candidates, we have in the present election Assessor F. Koraleski, who is battling to secure for the Poles the office of County Treasurer. The incumbent of this office hires four hundred employees and at present only 5 Poles are employed. Members of the Alliance, as one man, should support Koraleski.</p>
   <p>A furious battle is also being fought for positions as Sanitary District trustees. Two Poles are running for these offices, Vincent S. Zwiefka and Henry Nowak, both young and capable industrialists and members of the Alliance. Our Polish districts are most in need of sanitary care and therefore members of the Alliance, both men <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>and women, should most enthusiastically support their own people.</p>
   <p>Our Chief Clerk of the Municipal Court, Frank P. Danisch, has succeeded in placing the name of our gallant countryman Francis X. Rydzewski on the ballot as candidate for membership on the Board of Review. The Board is composed of three members and has the important right--one which affects us--of raising or lowering the assessed value and the amount of taxes on property. Therefore, we must absolutely vote solidly for Rydzewski.</p>
   <p>For this office, and for the office of Sanitary Trustee, women, also, can cast their votes.</p>
   <p>As regards County Commissioners, we actually have too many candidates: for twenty offices there are scores of Polish candidates. Since the present commissioners Albert Nowak and Stanley Kuflewski, both good members of the Alliance, are running for re-election, it is the duty of the members of the Alliance to give them their votes. THen the members of the Alliance owe their votes to Stanley Rokosz, former president of the Polish National Alliance who helped establish <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>Dziennik Zwiazkowy. St. Adalbert's Parish enthusiastically supports Victor R. Schiller and Thomas Kasperski. Holy Innocent's Parish is supporting the well-known Michael Kolass, member of the Park Commission. The Poles and members of the Alliance in Avondale are supporting Michael Dominowski. Messrs. Okon and Zukowski are also on the list.</p>
   <p>For candidates for the state legislature we have in South Chicago John Solski, delegate to commune twenty-three of the Alliance and in the Fifteenth Senatorial District we have W. j. Laskowski, a good Alliance member.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to name all of them. Every member of the Alliance running for office should himself remind his brothers by placing an advertisement in Dziennik Zwiazkowy. For our part, it is our duty to help gain the more important offices and members of the Alliance demand this.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>The Republican ticket this time does not have many Polish candidates because this election is so dominated by the Democratic party that the Republicans have little chance. We should try to keep our people from incurring the unnecessary expense of campaigning against the greatly superior force of the Democrats at this time.</p>
   <p>The Polish Republicans, however, stand a good chance of getting the office of Clerk of the Criminal Court, for which a universally known man and an important member of the Alliance, Casimir Armknecht of St. Hedwig's Parish, is running. They also have a chance of getting the office of State Senator of the Fifteenth District, for which John S. Rybicki, president of the second circuit of the Alliance of Polish Singers, a very capable lawyer and a good citizen, is running. For the lower house of legislature they have the present representative Albert Rostenkowski. For the office of County Commissioner the well-known member of the Alliance Frank E. Lackowski is running.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of the Alliance members of the Republican party to support with all their strength our loyal friend the universally liked and respected <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>Walter Schrojda for Ward Committeeman of the Sixteenth Ward. He has been one of the leaders of the Polish Republican party for the past twenty years.</p>
   <p>On the Progressive ticket there are not many Polish candidates. Among the better-known candidates we should mention W. Gieldzinski, who is running for election as representative to the legislature, and Professor T. Siemiradzki, candidate for County Commissioner.</p>
   <p>On the Socialist ticket there is, for the first time, a Polish name. We recommend to the voters of District Eight Mr. Henry Anielewski for congressman and thus emphasize the impartiality of our list.</p>
   <p>Vital national interests, not any sort of calculations or regard for advertisements, have prompted us to write this article. We are confident that the members of the Alliance will willingly receive our appeal and will get together to see to it that every member of the Alliance casts his vote at the primaries for the benefit of Polish interests.</p>
