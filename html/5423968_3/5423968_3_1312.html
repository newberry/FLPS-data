   <p>While Poles in various parts of Chicago are becoming more interested in politics, one ward in which Poles should have an active voice, slumbers in deep sleep. It is the neighbor of Ward Sixteen, namely, the Fifteenth Ward. They give assurance that there are 1,500 votes of citizens of Polish extraction in the Fifteenth Ward, and there is apparently no proper organization, and if there is, then it has fallen asleep and gives no evidence of life. Are there no citizens who would be able to occupy themselves seriously with an adequate political organization? The time has come to think of this. One citizen of the Sixteenth Ward, who, whenever he desires to do so, knows how to create a marked impression upon his fellow-citizens, will soon move into the Fifteenth Ward, and he could work in co-operation with others in this respect. It is too bad that he considers <span class="page-break">2</span>himself to be a Republican; however, there is every hope of his conversion. Take him to task, you citizens of the Fifteenth Ward, win him over to the Democratic party, and he will be a strong aid for you--we can assure you of this.</p>
   <p>A Polish Democratic club could become useful in the Seventeenth Ward as well.</p>
