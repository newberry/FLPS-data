   <p>Some of our readers know already, that Mr. John F. Smulski, defeated by Mr. Peter Kiolbassa for the office of alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, has filed a complaint with the city council as to the legality of Mr. Kiolbassa's election.</p>
   <p>According to the official recount Mr. Kiolbassa's majority was only seventy-two votes, so the opposition hoped that somehow this majority would be cut down.</p>
   <p>But this hope is not being realized.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, after many legal skirmishes, in the presence of election officers and a committee of the city council, a recount was begun.</p>
   <p>The first fourteen precincts were recounted. And what was the result?....Mr. Kiolbassa not only did not lose a vote in these precincts (in spite of the many <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>attempts) but he actually gained three votes.</p>
   <p>So he has a majority of seventy-five, not seventy-two votes.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow the other fourteen precincts will be canvassed, and we are convinced the results will be the same.</p>
   <p>At any rate the contest will prove a fizzle.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smulski began it, we understand, mainly on the demand of the Republican city machine, whose members supported him with a vigor worthy of a nobler cause. These gentlemen hoped something unforeseen might happen so that, by trickery, enough votes might be thrown out to change the result; they have miscalculated.</p>
   <p>That a Pole should permit himself to be used for such a purpose is very incomprehensible to us....</p>
