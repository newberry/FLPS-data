   <p>The situation in our beloved America is becoming worse and worse.</p>
   <p>Detroit has spent 17 million dollars to save the unemployed from starvation; and now, after all funds have been exhausted, the city is compelled to close down the shelters for the poor unemployed.</p>
   <p>All the government is doing to remedy this depression is to persuade the masses of hungry people that better times are just around the corner.</p>
   <p>To complete the evil, thousands of banks went bankrupt and tens of thousands of unemployed workers lost their last, meager funds.</p>
   <p>If America could find a hundred million dollars to aid Germany, let her find money to rescue millions of her own starving people.</p>
