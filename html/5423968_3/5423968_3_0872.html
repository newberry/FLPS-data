   <p>Seeking a higher office, as judge of the Superior Court in Cook County, State of Illinois, is our Polish fellow citizen. Julius Smietanka, a man of incorruptible character and plenty of energy.</p>
   <p>Brother citizens, first, before we became Democrats or Republicans, we were all Poles. Remember this, now that the elections are at hand: Forget the Republican and Democratic parties; forget the words of vote getters and remember that Polish blood flows in your veins; support your fellow citizen at the polls tomorrow. All you Polish citizens, support and vote for Mr. J. Smietanka. Mothers, wives and daughters, compel your sons, husbands and brothers to cast their votes for our Polish candidate J. Smietanka. Jews, Germans and Irish have been presidents of our country; why can't we Poles have at least a Polish citizen win the office of judge of the Superior Court? It all depends on you.</p>
   <p>Committee of the Polish Democratic Organization of the 17th Ward.</p>
