   <p>This is the question that every Pole asks when he reads the list of the committee of fifteen which is entrusted with the task of forming rules governing the presentation of moving pictures.</p>
   <p>Alderman [Otto] Kerner [Bohemian], the chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the City Council, completely ignored the Polish element when nominating members to the committee of fifteen. This seems strange and is deserving of some explanation on the part of Alderman Kerner, since Poles attend the movies rather frequently. Polish children in particular come to see these productions, which in themselves must of necessity exert a strong influence upon the mental development of our youth. Consequently, therefore, it is proper that a Pole should have an advisory voice in a matter of such importance, and should take an active part in the discussions which will lead to the forming of laws regulating these productions.</p>
   
   <p>It is therefore of particular importance that an appeal be made to Alderman Stanley Kunz, who also happens to be a member of the Judiciary Committee. A petition should be directed to him urging that he use the good graces of his public office to secure for the Polish element its proper representation on the committee of fifteen.</p>
