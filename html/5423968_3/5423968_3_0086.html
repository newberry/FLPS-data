   <p>Wilkesbare Pa. The sheriff and his deputies were placed on trial before a jury for the murder of striking coal miners in Lattimer, Pa.</p>
   <p>McGahren the prosecuting attorney in his speech said that the sheriff and his deputies were sent out to break up the striking miners in their march from Hazleton to Lattimer.</p>
   <p>One of the deputies said, "I bet that I'll kill a few of the strikers." Another deputy was to have said, "I have a feeling that we will have an opportunity to shoot at them."</p>
   <p>This was some of the proofs received by attorney McGahren telling of the attitudes shown by the sheriff and his deputies before their departure to break up the striking miners.</p>
   <p>McGahren finished his speech before the jury at 11 o'clock, after which witnesses were called.</p>
   <p>The first witness to take the stand was Andrew Siver, a Slovak, speaking English very well.</p>

   <p>After being sworn in, he said, "I saw Michael Ceslak lying dead in the street with a bullet in his head." He also saw the sheriff Mr. Martin, with his gun in hand, give his deputies the signal to start shooting the miners.</p>
   <p>John Mahala, president of the Hard Wood and Coal Union, and a member of the United Mine Worker's Union, pleaded with the miners to stop their strike march; he also threatened to shoot at them.</p>
   <p>While breaking up the strike march, one of the deputies struck and badly injured John Rostis about the head, he also suffered a broken hand.</p>
   <p>Burgess Jones of West Hazelton told the sheriff that he will quiet down the strikers; after the sheriff and his deputies boarded the train for Lattimer, to await the arrival of the strikers, who were given the permission of Mr. Jones to continue their strike march.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father R. Anst of St. Stanislus Church of Hazleton and Rev. C. Hanser, pastor of the Lutheran Church in Freeland, testified that, "on examing the killed strikers, they were all found with bullet holes in the back or in the side of their heads, which proves that the strikers never had a chance to defend themselves."</p>

   <p>Rev. Guscott, principal of a school in Lattimer testified that, "as the strikers marched by his church they were quiet and did not cause much disturbance or trouble; he did not see any of them carrying firearms.</p>
   <p>When they were near the end of their march the sheriff and his deputies blocked their passage. The leader and the sheriff met in the street and talked matters over, but none of the witnesses was close enough to hear what was being said, "If you don't come back and stand with your fellow deputies you will be shot down."</p>
   <p>As the deputy turned around to return, he was shot down by his comrades in cold blood after which the sheriff and his deputies continued shooting. The terrified strikers turned and fled; 15 of them were killed. The officers of the law did not pursue the strikers, but continued shooting at the fleeing miners. It lasted about 2 or 3 minutes.</p>
   <p>A teacher of the school in Lattimer named some of the deputies who were shooting to kill; he also showed on a map the place where the strikers made their bold but futile stand, where the sheriff and his deputies blocked their march, and the approximate position of the wounded strikers lying in the street.</p>
   <p>Dr. H. M. Rillar, attending physician said that most of the killed and wounded were shot in the back as they were fleeing. The doctor could name 39 of the wounded by their full names.</p>

   <p>Of this number 46 wounds were found in all; mostly caused by a 44 calibre Winchester, a few were wounded by scatter shot rifles. Of this number only 14 had wounds in the front of their bodies.</p>
   <p>Seven of them died in the hospital and 32 are still in the hospital, and 30 were discharged from the hospital. Rev. S. R. Staffle of St. Emanuel Church said;"the strikers were orderly and quiet, and there was no need for shooting."</p>
   <p>Miss Grace Coyle, a teacher said; "I was on a veranda, when the sheriff told his deputies to block the street before the strikers approached; when the strikers arrived, a few of them went to confer with the sheriff, who was awaiting results. None of the strikers had any firearms. A few of the strikers cried out, "march on," at which a few of them continued marching. As they passed by the sheriff, the deputies opened fire on them, and they fell mortally wounded; the strikers fled, but shots were fired at them, which lasted for about 2 minutes.</p>
   <p>After the shooting ceased I went to help some of the wounded lying in the street, Mr. Ross, a passerby, began to laugh at me because I was helping the wounded strikers," Miss Coyle was a very interesting witness, answering all cross-examination questions to the point.</p>
