   <p>As known, among the Justices of the Peace appointed by the Governor in the past year, there was not a Pole. Attempts have been made by editors and other Polish citizens to nominate Mr. M. A. La Buy for the office. The governor, on account of various circumstances, was compelled to approve only the candidates selected by the Illinois Local Bar Ass., eliminating the Polish nationality.</p>
   <p>We are informed that all is not lost yet. The legislating body is passing a bill creating a place for one more in the city of Chicago. So we still have hope that Mr. M. A. La Buy shall receive this office if his countrymen will support him.</p>
