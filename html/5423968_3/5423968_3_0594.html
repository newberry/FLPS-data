   <p>Registration will be held in Chicago on Tuesday February 1, 1927, for the coming city and county election. Because of its influence, the Polish Democratic organization of Cook County reached its goal, when it was given an opportunity to place the young and well educated Pole, Mr. M. S. Szymczak, on the Democratic ballot for the office of County Treasurer.</p>
   <p>In the opinion of the Polish Democratic organization, victory of our candidate can only be achieved by the solid support of the Poles. The appeal of the organization is made to all voters of the following class. Those who for various reasons did not register in the fall, or have changed their address; those who have reached the voting age; and those who received their citizenship papers after the November, 1926, registration date.</p>
