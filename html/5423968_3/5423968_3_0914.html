   <p>In politics it is not always best to follow the impulse of the heart; instead, one must conduct himself with cold consideration, reason, and understanding, and in this way he will be able quickly to reach the desired goal.</p>
   <p>If there ever was a need for reasoning and understanding in the political arena, it is now, for without these one will not be able to comprehend the prevailing political situation.</p>
   <p>One does not gain prominence and recognition in politics through anger, hatred, and stubborness; but through common force, harmony, unity, and peace, which are carried through with honesty and sincerity.</p>
   <p>In politics, as well as in other affairs, we gather experience with should serve <span class="page-break">\2</span>as a yardstick for the past, present, and future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stanley Kunz, after the spring aldermanic election last year, left Chicago and did not return until a week ago. Where he was and what he was doing is nobody's concern, for that is his own affair.</p>
   <p>The 16th ward began to organize immediately after the spring election of 1896, and before the fall election arrived, everything was in good order. Despite the averse conditions which existed during the last campaign, the 16th ward gave pluralities of 600 votes to Bryan and 900 votes to Altgeld, as compared with seventeen months ago, when the Republicans received 300 more votes than the Democrats.</p>
   <p>After the last election even greater energy was exerted in the 16th ward, and precinct clubs were set up in each precinct. Credit for this should be given to Judge M. A. LaBuy, president of the Central Ward Club, for under his leader-ship all organization meetings were conducted in the best order, and consequently <span class="page-break">\3</span>various political factions and various nationalistic groups disappeared.</p>
   <p>At times, stormy clouds appeared, and at the last ward meeting the winds began to lash and moan with the fury of a hurricane, threatening to overthrow everything, but aside from the noise no damage was done.</p>
   <p>Some of the Poles say that there should be two Polish aldermen in the 16th ward. A few years ago, we had two Polish aldermen in this ward, and from this we know that conditions were bad and unsatisfactory to the Poles. For if one alderman tried to get an office for his friend, the other would go before the mayor, not to help his colleague, but to oppose and spoil his plans; in the event the second recommended his friends, the first would do the same. The result was that neither the first nor the second received anything.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Kunz was alderman, he was of the opinion that the Poles should not have two Polish aldermen in the same ward, because it is unnecessary and disadvantageous <span class="page-break">\4</span>to the Poles. When Mr. Kunz was alderman and committeeman, and the Poles wanted another Polish alderman, he opposed this move and recommended Mr. Ellert, a German, instead.</p>
   <p>The Poles should not only strive for the aldermanic office, but for other and more important positions; however, this cannot be accomplished without the votes of other nationalities. A good example is to be had from the last election, when peace and harmony reigned among the Demcorates of various nationalities; the Poles had three candidates running for office from the 16th ward on the Democratic ticket. This is something that never occurred before, because of the many factions.</p>
   <p>Some of the citizens complain that Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, present alderman of the 16th ward, cannot accomplish anything for the Poles, but that this would have been different if Mr. Kunz were alderman. Let these persons try to tell me how many Poles worked for the city during Washburn's administration, six years ago. I asked a number of Individuals to name at least one Pole who worked for the city <span class="page-break">\5</span>during that time, and not one of them was able to do so.</p>
   <p>During Washburn's administration, Stanley Kunz was alderman. The Democrats had a decided majority in the city council, and Mayor Washburn, although a Republican, had to count on the Democratic aldermen, and had to give special concessions to some of them. At that time, no one even dreamed about civil service and competitive examinations. Today, the city council is made up of fifty Republicans and eighteen Democrats. Civil service exists, and competitive examinations are compulsory. What can a Democratic candidate get from such an administration?</p>
   <p>Some say that, under Carter H. Harrison's administration, many Poles were found on city rolls, and that a majority of them was placed by Mr. Kunz,--but this is not true. Six years ago, Peter Kiolbassa was elected city treasurer, and was obligated to be placed under a sixteen million dollar bond within a specified time, and if he had not been in a position to do so he would have lost that office. Mr. Kiolbassa found himself in a critical predicament, from which Mr. Harrison extricated him by posting a large portion of the money, while other <span class="page-break">\6</span>Americans and Germans followed suit. And after that time there was better understanding and co-operation between C. H. Harrison and P. Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>Two years later, when C. H. Harrison was chosen mayor, Peter Kiolbassa was offered the post of commissioner of the water department, but he declined this office. On the other hand, Mr. Kiolbassa never interfered with the recommendations of Mr. Kunz or other influential Poles before the mayor, but supported them. Because of this, some are of the opinion that it was through the influence of Mr. Kunz alone that certain offices were acquired for Poles.</p>
   <p>Next, during the administration of Hopkins, Mr. August Kowalski was appointed superintendent of the pipe extension department, where four hundred Poles found employment. In this instance, not only was Messrs. Kiolbassa's and Kunz's influence necessary, but that of other influential persons as well.</p>
   <p>Polish citizens can once again gain what they had during the previous Democratic <span class="page-break">\7</span>administration, and even more, but they must be in harmony, and must support and work with each other (before the election) for the entire regular Democratic ticket, from the mayor down to the alderman. They should work to such an extent that the 16th ward will give the Democrats a plurality of at least four thousand votes, and not nine hundred, as in the previous election. After the election, in the event of C. H. Harrison's victory, we can safely make demands and have them fulfilled.</p>
   <p>Unity is imperative among the Poles, for only under such circumstances can they count upon victory. If the Poles are to divide into regular and irregular Democrats, Republicans, and independents; if religious and nationalistic differences are to enter the political arena, if the young and old Democrats are to divide, as is happening, what can be expected from such a mix-up--chaos? Only a Democratic defeat and a Republican victory. Let those citizens who are agitating for an independent alderman take cognizance of what has transpired in previous elections, in order that they may not voice complaint after the <span class="page-break">\8</span>coming election is over, and be sorry for the way the cast their votes, as has happened during the last presidential election [votes cast for McKinley].</p>
   <p>Cold-bloodedness, consideration, and understanding are essential to our well-being.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry Ludolph, a businessman, is a candidate for alderman of the 16th ward on the Democratic ticket. Mr. Ludolph was largely instrumental in the election of Mr. Kiolbassa as alderman last year. He was a sincere, honest, and energetic worker, and through his efforts, gained many Republican votes for Mr. Kiolbassa. The Poles who at the present are yelling for an independent alderman, and are against the regular Democratic aldermanic candidates, only expose the Poles to defeat and weaken the Democratic party.</p>
