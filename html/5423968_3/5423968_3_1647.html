   <p>Elections will be held the coming year for county officials, judges, congressmen, etc. We have a notable group of intelligent Poles in our city and county, who could qualify in these positions. When will they organize?</p>
   <p>Will it be as in the past when at the last moment they staged a few meetings at which they passed resolutions demanding recognition from the political machines?</p>
   <p>The Polish politicians should push themselves to the top in ward organizations because these organizations only receive consideration from the central party committee. Ward gatherings create political leaders who later enter the field of candidacy for higher recognition.</p>
   <p>For this reason let us hope that in the future a greater number of Poles will regularly attend ward meetings sponsored by their parties.</p>

   <p>With this assurance we can look forward to leadership in the field of politics against our foes.</p>
   <p>Let us stop creating various leagues and immediately take an active part in the work of our ward organizations.</p>
