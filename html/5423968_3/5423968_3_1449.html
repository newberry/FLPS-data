   <p>We have five Polish aldermen in the new City Council: Stanley H. Kunz and John Szymkowski (Sixteenth Ward), Stanley Adamkiewicz and S. S. Walkowiak (Seventeenth Ward), and Maximillian Adamowski (Twenty-eighth Ward). The Chicago Poles can well rejoice, for they now have their own representatives, to whom they will be able to turn every time they want to have the City Council do something for them. The victory of the Polish candidates in the last election has made all the Chicago Poles happy, with the exception of a handful of troublemakers in the newspaper of the Reds. These troublemakers would rather see Germans exclusively in the City Council than Poles. And people such as these have the effrontery to call themselves idealistic workers of the Polish-American community.</p>
