   <p>August J. Kowalski, superintendent of the Water Pipe Extension Department, has resigned his position in the City Hall to which he was appointed by the former Democratic Mayor, J. P. Hopkins.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kowalski left an admirable record. He sincerely helped his fellow men through his influence. Many Poles had either steady or part-time employment in his department.</p>
   <p>Because of this the Poles will always remain grateful to him and will not forget him in the future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kowalski relinquished his position because of the change in administration.</p>
   <p>It has been rumored that two or three Polish Republicans are making an effort <span class="page-break">\2</span>to fill this vacancy. In view of this, no matter which one of this trio gets the position, it is hoped that he will emulate Mr. Kowalski's record, and will support the Poles when it comes to the distribution of city jobs.</p>
