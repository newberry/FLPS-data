   <p>For many years the Poles living in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> ward did not have a representative in the city council. The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> ward is populated in great majority by Poles; therefore it <span class="gap">[gap]</span> have its own alderman. In the past we could not <span class="gap">[gap]</span> a Pole for alderman because always there were <span class="gap">[gap]</span> candidates for the primary and our votes were <span class="gap">[gap]</span>tered. Now it is different; we have just <span class="gap">[gap]</span> candidate on the Democratic ticket, N. S. Budzban, for alderman of the 27th <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. With the help of all Polish votes we hope to elect <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. N. S. Budzban had held many public offices; he was a member of the Board of City I prove <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, member of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>tate Tax Commission, and lately chief clerk of the Municipal Courts. He is an honest and efficient public <span class="gap">[gap]</span>rvant. Mr. Budzban is endorsed by the citizens' club of St. Ladislaus Parish, by the <span class="gap">[gap]</span>men's Voters Club and the Business men Club of Avondale.</p>
