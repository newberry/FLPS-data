   <p>Tomorrow, September 15, 19<span class="gap">[gap]</span>, is the day of the primaries in Chicago. Although in accordance with its principles the Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy does not show any particular preference for any political party in this country, nevertheless, it is its right, and even its duty to support Poles when these aspire to public office. Regardless of the political faction to which a Pole belongs, we support him because duty and national feeling impel us to do so. A Pole can perform official duties as capably as those of many other nationalities, if not more capably. Conseauently, why should our people not did him and increase the number of honest officials? The following Poles are candidates for nomination for various public offices in tomorrow's primary election:</p>
   <p>For county assessor: Mr. Frank <span class="gap">[gap]</span> a well-<span class="gap">[gap]</span>, at present <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
