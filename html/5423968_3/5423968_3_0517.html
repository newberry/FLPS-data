   <p>The Polish Socialist party in South Chicago, organized by the notorious character J. Rybakowski as Branch No. 4, had no success.</p>
   <p>An article on this subject appeared in yesterday's issue of our newspaper. We also received more information on this subject from two sources--one of them a letter, which reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Socialists were given 'a hot reception' in Warsaw, [probably name of the Polish district], South Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Last Saturday night, J. Rybakowski started the announced meeting at Kosinski's hall, South Chicago, for the purpose of converting American Poles to socialism. The meeting was opened by a certain Pacanowski, who was forbidden to speak when he began to blaspheme and attack everything. There was a great disturbance in the hall, and Pacanowski left in a hurry.</p>

   <p>Rybakowski, fearing rough handling, made his exit through the window, scattering his propaganda literature all over.</p>
   <p>It seems that the socialists in South Chicago were baptized, not with water, but with something stronger. We do not approve of such tactics, neither in this particular case nor in principle; on the contrary, we condemn them. At all events, we wish to advise Mr. R. and his "comrades" that in the future they should not force themselves where they are not welcome, and that they should not use falsehoods and malice as their weapons; then they will surely avoid unpleasantness.</p>
   <p>That there must have been some unpleasantness can be proved by the organ of Rybakowski, Gazeta Robotnicza [Workers' Gazette], for in its last issue we read:</p>
   <p>"To the members of Branch No. 4 in South Chicago: These members who desire to <span class="page-break">3</span>remain true to the cause of labor and to the Polish Workers' Alliance in the United States of North America, will kindly send their names and addresses by mail to our Executive Committee. The list then will be sent to the secretary, who will inform you when and where the meetings of Branch No. 4 will be held.</p>
   <p>"The names and the addresses of the members will be kept in secret till the rest of the members be convinced that this concerns only their own welfare. Only members of the Branch, or candidates introduced by them, will be admitted to the meetings."</p>
   <p>This article seems to prove positively that Mr. Rybakowski, has decided to contact Branch No. 4 not "in person" but "by letters".</p>
   <p>In our opinion, even such letters will be useless. No one will remain true to Rybakowski's cause, neither openly nor secretly, and the information on "when and where the meetings of Branch No. 4 will be held" will be entirely superfluous.</p>
