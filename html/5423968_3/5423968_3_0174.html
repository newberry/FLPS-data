   <p>There is no escape from old age, is a well-known Polish proverb. It is an involuntary sentence imposed upon man's life. And it becomes harder for those who have passed half the span of their life to find a new job when they lose their old one.</p>
   <p>Chicago is a typical example. There are many old persons who say there is no work.</p>
   <p>For every industrial job, filled by an old individual, who cannot work with the intensity and energy of a young person, there are one hundred younger candidates waiting. To make matters worse for the old workers, these young men claim that they can produce more and work better. Today the streets are filled with many sad and unfortunate individuals who have worked many years, and now find themselves without work, without any savings, without any reward for their labors.</p>

   <p>They go everywhere, asking for work. Many times, in their search for work, they are ridiculed. At times, they are told that there is no need for old men in industry.</p>
   <p>Openings available at employment offices, bureaus, and other sources of employment, are filled by young men. It is apparent from this outlook that there is even a shortage of work for them.</p>
   <p>The older women have suffered more in this instance. The younger generation is filling all the positions older women once held. Those who want to understand the full meaning of this problem can get a better glimpse of it along Madison Street. Here you will find men from all walks of life without work and homeless.</p>
