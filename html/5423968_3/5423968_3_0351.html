   <p>The strange and apparently irrational question of who should control the prices is asked every day in the United States. Whoever has heard anything about economics, knows of the existence of the law of supply and demand, a law that regulates the prices of anything valuable enough to be bought or sold.</p>
   <p>The greater the supply the smaller the price; the greater the demand the higher the price. A combination of these two laws regulates prices. For instance, when there is a large demand for an article that is scarce, the price of the article <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, and vice versa.</p>
   
   <p>Rare articles for example are bid high during auctions. On the other hand, if the supply exceeds the demand, the price falls. It falls because the seller in his desire to get rid of the surplus is willing to charge such a price as will appeal to the buyer. However, if the supply equals the demand, the price will be normal.</p>
   <p>Overproduction increases the supply and there is a corresponding fall in the prices, a fall which, by making possible a larger demand, is followed by a rise. As a result of this continual conflict between supply and demand, the prices fluctuate.</p>
   
   <p>Some commodities rise continually when the supply decreased and the demand increases. Land belongs in this class, for the total area is fixed and the number of people wanting to buy it is always increasing.</p>
   <p>Leading economists have come to the conclusion that selfish interests have succeeded in disturbing this natural balance of supply and demand by appropriating the right to control the prices of the necessities of life. These selfish interests are trusts. If there must be some one to control prices, let it be the government. The government is the strongest power in the country and it should control the prices through a commission specially appointed for that purpose. Railroad fares in this country are regulated by the government, and this industry is very prosperous. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> then is it that the government cannot regulate the prices of other things? It is quite true that such regulation is not natural, but the government is the only organization that represents the people, and it should have the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> regulate or control prices.</p>
