   <p>Alderman Stanley Kunz of the Sixteenth Ward does not concede victory to Henry Ludolph, Democratic candidate. A protest was made to the Election Commissioners, which alleged that Ludolph was passing out money to election officials in the various precincts of the Ward. Alderman Kunz asserts that because of this many of the ballots were marked void that were cast for him.</p>
   <p>According to him he received eighty-six more votes than his closest opponent. Alderman Kunz consulted with a hundred precinct captains yesterday, and this evening he is going to hold an indignation meeting in Andrew Schultz's hall, where all the facts of this matter are to be presented.</p>
   <p>We are eager to learn the result.</p>
