   <p>The recently organized Citizenship School at the St. Hyacinth parish at present boasts of sixty-five members. But, considering the size of the parish this is indeed a comparatively small number.</p>
   <p>Instruction is given by attorney John Rybicki, Francis J. Kempa, and Herman Wisniewski.</p>
   <p>Those that do not have their citizenship papers are urged to attend the class of any Tuesday at the parish hall on 17th and Paulina Streets. Class starts at 7:30 P. M.</p>
