   <p>What is the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of Socialism? The aim of Socialism in the expropriation of citizen capitalists in the political and economic field.</p>
   <p>In what way can that expropriation allow itself to be carried through? In this respect the Socialists themselves are not in accord: some, like Julius, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> want to use superior force and violence and due to this they are called <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, (after their leader, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Marx, a German Jew); others, like <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, desire to <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, based on agreement, and they are known as Parliamentary Socialists.</p>
   <p>What is the program of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> should embrace all means of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> altogether; competition and over-production should be stifled. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> statistics would show how much should <span class="gap">[gap]</span> produced for general use. The worker should work an average of three hours daily, and with an increase in machinery the working day should be shortened to one hour daily.</p>
   
   <p>Personal property is a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> away with entirely, but is concentrated and applied to that which is <span class="gap">[gap]</span> personal.</p>
   <p>What is the program of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Socialists? The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> The Parliamentary Socialists are making towards collectivism with every <span class="gap">[gap]</span> but for the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> based on agreement; the most <span class="gap">[gap]</span> over by the government of all enterprises, industrial and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> such as railroads, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> monopolies, etc., so as to gradually abolish <span class="gap">[gap]</span> service, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> wealth into state ownership.</p>
   <p>What do the Socialists promise? The Socialists promise perfect happiness, a true <span class="gap">[gap]</span> There will be no poor or rich people, master employers or <span class="gap">[gap]</span> there will be no capitalists or proletariat, but there will be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> workers. From then on they will not have to buy bread, pay <span class="gap">[gap]</span> etc. The inhabitants will be maintained and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> at the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> be no care about bringing <span class="gap">[gap]</span> children, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and those <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to work; the state will attend to the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> children, the lodging <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the hour of light work a person will enjoy <span class="gap">[gap]</span> peace.</p>
   <p>What benefits will result <span class="gap">[gap]</span> compliance to the community question?</p>
   <p>This system will lead a worker slavery and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> under the tyranny of socialistic government! The country or state which does not know how to produce good <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will be <span class="gap">[gap]</span> with the preparing of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> food, homes and clothing for the entire world. The state as the only spreader, the only <span class="gap">[gap]</span> will appoint to everyone a quarter, for which he will <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to work very hard. Every person will be a mechanical part in a large machine operated by the hand of a tyrant. The Socialists are jeering at us because such a paradise will be a virtual hell, where one will not understand <span class="gap">[gap]</span> other, indeed, where <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
   
   <p>Did the law of possession always exist and was it recognized? Yes, all civilized nations <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the law of personal ownership, and countries which have stopped upon this law have fallen anew into barbarism.</p>
   <p>In what way does Socialism consider personal property? Socialism recognizes personal property as robbery; it would like to bear from all individuals their property and give them to the "chosen" (Jews?! - Compositor). In one word, Socialism desires a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of personal property.</p>
   <p>Does Socialism <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Socialism does not recognize marriage, but is for free love.</p>
   <p>What will become of the children brought up under the Socialistic system? The children will not know either <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they will be foster children of the state.</p>
