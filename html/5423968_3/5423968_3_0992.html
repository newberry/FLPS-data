   <p>"The fall elections are upon us; they will be held on Tuesday, November 7. However, the elections have not awakened much interest especially among the Poles, probably because of the fact that many of us mistakenly believe that these elections are of lesser importance than usually. It is my desire to protest here against this impression.</p>
   <p>"It is true that the coming elections do not involve the choice of a governor, or of any high state or city officials. Despite this, however, the elections are of great importance. Omitting discussion of the county commissioners, whose important and useful activities are well known to us, we turn to the fact that six Superior Court judges and four Circuit judges will be elected. The election of competent men to these important offices should be the concern of all people. There is hardly a man who at one time or another is not forced to come in contact with the courts, either in his own defense or in protection of his rights. Decisions of very important nature, dealing with honor, property, and sometimes lives, rest with the judges; judges also confer the rights of American citizenship upon immigrants who settle here. Who is to occupy so important an office should be the concern of every citizen. Everyone should desire that his judge be an intelligent man, honest, with a good knowledge of the law, and above all, a man free from prejudice toward certain classes of people.</p>
   <p>"This last concerns the Polish people. We know well that certain elements of the Republican party are prejudiced against those people who were not born on American soil, and especially against those who are Roman Catholics, as we. While all Republicans should not be accused of being thus prejudiced, it is in our own interests that judges from a party which, to a certain extent, is unfavorable to us, should not be elected. On the contrary, we should do what we can to place Democrats in these important offices--representatives of a party which has always been favorable to us, with which we are so closely bound.</p>
   
   <p>"In the present elections, the Republicans have no hope that their entire ticket will win; they are making special efforts, therefore, to push through at least one of their candidates, Judge Gary. They are even trying to win certain Democrats to this candidate's side, extolling his supposed virtues. It may be that they will try to win the Polish vote also, but the Poles should not allow themselves to be misled. The election of Judge Gary would be a great victory for the Republicans, to which, certainly, the Polish Democrats have no desire to contribute.</p>
   <p>"The Poles ought to vote for the entire Democratic ticket. They should not neglect their civic duty, but vote in the greatest possible numbers in order to convince the Democratic party that they really helped in its victory of Judge Gary and his fellow-Republicans.</p>
   <p>"One other consideration should prevail upon our countrymen [to vote against Judge Gary]. Judge Gary is politically opposed to Governor Altgeld; his victory would constitute a political setback to the Democratic leader of our State.</p>
   
   <p>For this reason, Governor Altgeld is personally conducting the Democratic campaign; he is exerting every effort to provide the State of Illinois, which has a majority of Democratic citizens, with Democratic judges. Under such conditions, voting for even one Republican candidate, and especially for Judge Gary, would look like a sign of ill will toward the Governor. Governor Altgeld has done us much good, examples of which are the appointment of the undersigned as park commissioner (who, as a result, was able to give work to many Poles), and his noble defense of the persecuted Poles in Lemont. The Governor's good will deserves our gratitude, and we can show it by voting as numerously as possible against his enemies and the enemies of our party.</p>
   <p>"I have no fears, however, that the Poles will have any desire to vote Republican. I am only afraid that, misled by the honeyed words of their enemies, they may, as an exception, support one of the Republican candidates--the worst one--or that they may neglect to vote in the greatest possible numbers due to the mistaken idea that these elections are not very important. I most warmly urge my honored countrymen to vote as numerously as possible, and to vote a straight Democratic ticket, if they have the good of the party at heart and wish to retain the good will of the Governor.</p>
   
   <p>"Let the Sixteenth Ward give the Democratic candidates the greatest possible majority, let the Polish precincts in other wards do the same, and we will be able to count on the party's gratitude and on Governor Altgeld's friendship. The Poles who are working in the parks today will not lose this work; the Governor's good will may yet be useful and necessary to all of us.</p>
   <p>E. Z. Brodowski,</p>
   <p>Park Commissioner."</p>
