   <p>Mr. Max Kaczmarek, the prominent Chicago attorney, was the principal speaker at a political rally held on Friday, August 16, 1918. The meeting was sponsored by the regular Republican organization and was held at the party's headquarters at Noble Street and Milwaukee Avenue. Mr. Kaczmarek is the Republican candidate for Congress. In his speech he discoursed at length on all questions of importance that are to come under discussion at the forthcoming session of Congress. In addition he gave a rather interesting review of the international situation. His arguments were rewarded with an outburst of applause.</p>
   <p>After Mr. Kaczmarek's able speech Mr. Joseph P. Kruppa, representing the Deneen faction in the Seventeenth Ward, was so much impressed that he assured Mr. Kaczmarek of his party's undivided support.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Pelka, candidate for clerk of the municipal court, will begin his campaign in the very near future.</p>
