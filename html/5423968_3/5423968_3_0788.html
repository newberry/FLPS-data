   <p>Tomorrow we elect justices to the Superior and Circuit Courts of Chicago. These are important positions, and it is the duty of every citizen to see to it that unworthy people do not secure them. Many of our people unfortunately come in contact with judges frequently, and whether a judge decides a case humanely or resorts to chauvinism and inflicts heavy punishment on some people, merely because they are foreigners, depends solely upon the judge.</p>
   <p>On the basis of information from reliable sources, and through our personal acquaintance with some of the candidates, we can recommend the following men to the Polish voters:</p>
   <p>Joseph H. Fitch, Democrat</p>
   <p>Marcus Kavanagh, Republican</p>
   <p>Henry V. Freeman, Republican</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Daniel Cruice, Democrat</p>
   <p>Clarence Goodwin, Democrat</p>
   <p>Charles M. Foell, Republican</p>
   <p>M. L. McKinley, Democrat</p>
   <p>Hugo Pam, Republican</p>
   <p>Edward A. Dicker, Republican</p>
   <p>Dennis L. Sullivan, Democrat</p>
   <p>John P. McGoorty, Democrat, is running for the office of judge of the Circuit Court. In the opinion of people who know him, he is a just and impartial man. The candidates listed above are recommended by the Far Association, an august body which certainly would not recommend unsuitable people.</p>
