   <p>Dear Editor: In behalf of righteousness, please publish these few words in Dziennik Chicagoski. The undersigned has known Mr. Ignace Francis Dankowski for almost ten years. This period of time and various circumstances gave me an opportunity to assure myself of who Ignace F. Dankowski is.</p>
   <p>Through my business and social relations with him, I am convinced that he does not speak very much but thinks a whole lot, and that he has more sense than many people suspect. As a businessman, he is unusually punctual and conscientious. From our social intercourse, I know that he is very accommodating, even if it hurts his pocketbook. He is not wealthy but he is honest.</p>
   <p>I underlined the word "honest" because I do not believe that wealth should be acquired in a surreptitious manner. From my neighbors who live at St. Adalbert Parish, I have learned that he rendered them great service by helping them in legal matters, by going to court with them, by trying to secure employment for them, devoting many hours of his time without any recompense.</p>
   <p>He began to earn his daily bread during childhood, and was always employed by American firms. He is well educated and knows the English language thoroughly. For the last few years he has been holding a position as bookkeeper and cashier for one of the largest lumber companies in Chicago. Thousands of dollars pass through his hands every day. Money is a great temptation, but it cannot tempt him, for he prefers honesty to wealth.</p>
   <p>Closing my letter, I wish to state openly that if the Ninth Ward elects Dankowski, it will not only fulfill its civic and honorable duty but it also will gain a victory over all corruption. Mr. Dankowski will represent the poor working people faithfully; he will try to improve their condition and help them as much as he can.</p>
   
   <p>The Sixteenth Ward will have two Polish aldermen, we are certain. The Fifteenth Ward, though still young, is going for a big thing and will try to elect Mr. Kaszuba, a Pole, its alderman.</p>
   <p>It would be hard to believe that St. Adalbert Parish (Sixteenth Ward) will wait until Bridgeport and St. Casimir Parish outrun them in electing Polish aldermen.</p>
   <p>Do you think that our hearts on the North Side beat with stronger love than those on the South Side? A little of good will and co-operation and Mr. Dankowski will be our first Polish alderman of the Ninth Ward.</p>
   <p>This I wish him from my heart.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Teofil Stan,</p>
   <p>589 Milwaukee Avenue, Chicago</p>
