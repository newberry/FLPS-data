   <p>About 500 citizens of the 16th ward were assembled last night in the St. Stanislaus School, at Noble and Bradley Streets, and listened with keen interest to several speakers, who pointed out the importance of the next election, and the necessity of a change in governments. The speakers characterized the Republican Party as the protector of a privileged class, to the disadvantage of the people in general. They, likewise, touched the school-question, but only briefly, and emphasized the importance of the same for the citizens of Illinois. With eloquent words the speakers appealed to the people, asking them to do their duty on the day of election, that is, to vote for the men of the people-the torch bearers of true liberty and servants of men-such as Grover Cleveland, J. P. Altgeld, and others nominated by the Democratic Party. Most of the speakers spoke Polish; A. S. Kowalski spoke English only. Anton Rudnitcki presided.</p>
