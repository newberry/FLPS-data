   <p>The present--so important in its consequences for our homeland--places upon us the obligation to be particularly watchful and to take advantage of all opportunities to benefit Poland, and thus to benefit us all as part of the entire nation. On November 3, there will be placed in the hands of the Polish women a weapon which has powerful force in modern life--the ballot. By means of it they can turn the scales of victory to the advantage of candidates of their own nationality.</p>
   <p>Here in America, where we live, the toil of Polish workmen produces the benefits and wealth of this great country. Often Polish life and blood are sacrificed for the success and the development of this land. Nevertheless, we are treated as stepchildren in the politics and government of this country. While other nationalities sit at the head of the table richly <span class="page-break">\2</span>laden with political plums and influence, we Poles are left at the end to gather the crumbs which do not interest the others, although we represent a population of three million inhabitants of this powerful Republic.</p>
   <p>The fault is largely our own. Every one must look after his own interests, no one else will do it for him. We need complete solidarity. We must rid ourselves of trivialities, jealousies, and general interference with each other's progress. Then we shall go forward as a unit, and it will be better for us and for everyone. It is bad that so far we have cared so little about putting up our own candidates and that we have not energetically fostered their election by bloc voting as other nationalities do for their candidates.</p>
   <p>But now Polish women have joined the ranks. Our gallant, energetic women, <span class="page-break">\3</span>deeply concerned about national and social matters, will contribute their energy, zeal, and courage. Will not a new era dawn in the lives of the Poles? Will not a complete change come about, an awakening, an improvement in conditions? We must believe this. We want to believe this--and now, dear Polish women, a broad field lies before you at this especially important time.</p>
   <p>On November 3, a handful of our countrymen who survived the primaries are running for office. Their election depends upon Polish solidarity and good will. I shall mention the names which we know. Candidates for the office of County Commissioner are Messrs. [Albert] Novak and Lackowski and Professor T. Siemiradzki; for the office of Municipal Judge, Mr. E. J. Jarecki; for the state legislature only Mr. Rybicki; and for Congress Dr. E. Napieralski. We know all of these people. They are respected and worthy of confidence. They are ready and willing to serve the people in general and to work for their countrymen. Give them your strong, united support and your votes, and we shall have our countrymen occupying important posts. Their votes and their presence at this time will have great <span class="page-break">\4</span>historical importance for our nation. Polish women voters can tip the scales in their favor if they wish. Therefore, women citizens, do this: consider the importance of this matter, the needs and demands of this great era in which, fortunately, you are allowed to vote, and, above all, be Poles.</p>
   <p>I know that women do not yet vote for all offices, but they can use their influence on the men voters. They can take advantage of every opportunity which presents itself to further the Polish cause. This is a matter of great importance at this particular time.</p>
   <p>It is especially important and pressing that we have our own representative at Washington now. When the matter of our homeland is being judged by the world, who will speak up for us in the Congress of the Mighty American Republic? What can a stranger say, how can he fight for Poland's rights, when this matter requires a champion devoted to the nation with his entire soul, one who is deeply affected by the importance and sacredness of his mission <span class="gap">[gap]</span> We have now <span class="page-break">\5</span>neither a voice nor a representative in the Congress of the United States of America. While we are not present, they can do whatever they like with us. We are at the mercy of strangers who are either indifferent or inimically disposed towards us. But there is still one hope--still one candidate preserved by fate, who can give us such a voice and representation in Congress. Dr. E. F. Napieralski has received the nomination for Representative to the Congress of the United States. Let us do everything in our power to save this man as our one spokesman at Washington at this decisive moment. Let us employ all of our energy, influence, and pull to help this one Polish candidate gain victory. Our nation's cause--more important than anything else in the world--the cause of the homeland, demands this of us. Let our Polish women voters take this matter to heart. Let them use all of their energy to win this one voice for Poland in Congress, their own representative, their own countryman. Dr. E. F. Napieralski of St. Adalbert's Parish is known by his work and his character as an eminent physician. He is worthy of the confidence of the people. We believe that he will fulfill his high office <span class="page-break">\6</span>for the good of the nation. Polish women, especially members of the Alliance of Polish Women, are well acquainted with the work, devotion and merits of the secretary of this organization, Miss Emily Napieralski, who is the candidate's sister. It is not just today that we have become acquainted with this entirely meritorious family. Therefore, let us do everything in our power to elect this one Polish candidate as a representative to Congress, so that he may be the voice of our people at this inexpressibly important time for the nation. Polish women, tip the scales of victory for the whole list of our Polish candidates. Make our influence, which has been ignored, worthy of respect. Let us free ourselves once and for all from servitude, and let us finally speak for ourselves. Let us have the courage and the unbreakable will to act as behooves the children of a great nation striving for liberty. Let us do this especially today--at a time of such great historical importance.</p>
