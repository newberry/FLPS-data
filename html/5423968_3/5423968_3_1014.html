   <p>A Democratic mass meeting will be held tomorrow evening at 7:30 in the lower hall of St. Stanislaus Kostka School. All those who have not as yet registered, especially those from the 4th, 6th, 12th, 14th, and 19th precincts are cordially invited to attend.</p>
   <p>The supervisors, judges and clerks, through unfamiliarity with the law or through sheer negligence, turned away many people who gathered at the registration offices last Tuesday at 9:00 P. M. Next Tuesday, October 25, is the final registration day. The same thing will not occur again. All those who are at the registration place must be registered, irrespective of the time.</p>
   <p>All supervisors, judges, and clerks of all the precincts of the Sixteenth Ward are to attend a meeting to be held Monday at 8:00 P. M. at the Democratic headquarters, 587 Milwaukee Avenue. Important matters will be discussed.</p>
