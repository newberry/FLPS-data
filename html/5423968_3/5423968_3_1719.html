   <p>The future alderman of the Sixteenth Ward should be none other than Stanislaus Kunz, present alderman and well-known Pole of Chicago. All Poles of the Sixteenth Ward must agree upon this.</p>
   <p>No matter what their political affiliations may be, or what personal sympathies they may hold, they ought to vote for Mr. Kunz because he is a Pole. If they act otherwise they will elect a German, George C. Lenke--thereby acting directly against their own interests, and the national solidarity will be betrayed.</p>
   <p>At the present time our ward has two Polish aldermen. [Translator's note: under the old setup there were two representatives from each ward in the City Council.] Relinquishment of these offices to Germans should not be permitted, for they oppress our countrymen. [Translator's note: Specific reference is made to the Germans or Swabians of Swabia or Schwaben--a province of Germany.] There is no alternative. He who is a Pole will vote for a Pole.</p>

   <p>It is only too well known to us that our enemies are capable of intrigue. As a consequence such persons will work against their own kind for the gain of a few dollars. Such persons should be driven away and their damaging whisperings ignored.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Kunz has worked hard to get his name established in the Sixteenth Ward; he has many friends and holds office in many organizations. Because of his abilities and activities he deserves to be re-elected. But even such people as he, through being in the public limelight, have enemies who do not stint to flay and cast slander at them.</p>
   <p>Such calumny, which is directed at diverting the people's interest, will be treated in the future issues of the Dziennik Chicagoski. A biographical sketch of Mr. Kunz will also be given, from which you all will be convinced that he is just as sincere a Pole as any of us.</p>
   <p>In the meantime we say: Vote for Kunz! Do not listen to Schwabian agitators.</p>
