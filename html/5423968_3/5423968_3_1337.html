   <p>Sunday afternoon, March 27, a political meeting of the Democratic party was held in R. Retmanski's Hall on the West side. Peter Kiolbassa, city treasurer, and Mr. Kozlowski, the principal speakers, spoke in favor of the Democratic candidate, E. Marsch, for alderman of the thirty-third ward.</p>
   <p>That same evening Kosciuszko's Political Club held a meeting in the church hall. Members of the club did not permit the above speakers on the rostrum, because they are supporting another candidate. The procedure of the meeting was rather broken-up.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session was executed without interruption.</p>
   
   <p>It is apparent, as the results of these two meetings show, that some of our citizens are supporters and representatives of Polonia and others, instead of spreading the good will of the Dziennik Chicagoski. They stage demonstrations in saloons and confuse the people. If it were not for this handful of agitators, we could live peacefully. The Poles of Chicago belong to the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and the Polish National Alliance. Yet they get along with each other most cordially. In fact, we can use them as a fine example of harmonious relationship between Poles in America, although both lack a leader.</p>
