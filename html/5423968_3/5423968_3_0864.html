   <p>Thursday night Polish citizens gathered in Pulaski hall, in order to discuss the Poles of the 11th ward in regard to politics.</p>
   <p>Efforts have been made to elect a Polish alderman, but without success. At the meeting cries were heard of "Away with others who carry the Polish votes in their pockets! Political freedom to Poles of the 11th ward! Let us not be misled again by bosses and political directors."</p>
   <p>Cheers and applause greeted the slogans. There may result a strong Polish ward organization, admitting citizens who work together for others rather than various factions.</p>
   <p>This meeting was called by the order of Mr. Thomas Kasperski.</p>
