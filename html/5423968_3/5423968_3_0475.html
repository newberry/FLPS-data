   <p>In the periodical The Commoner, edited by W. J. Bryan, we find the article, "The Poles, Lovers of Freedom."</p>
   <p>"Polish societies throughout the country are adopting resolutions expressing their sympathies toward Mrs. McKinley and indignation toward the murderer of her husband. At the same time they condemn the act of Czolgosz, who is of Polish descent. Amid the general indignation resulting from the base attempt on the President, comes a great danger because of the harm that will be done to a brave and liberty loving people.</p>
   <p>"Anarchism is not the product of any particular national group or race; and most surely does not thrive on Polish soil. The Poles always were lovers of freedom, and the pages of history are filled with their heroic efforts. The page listing the deeds of the manly Kosciuszko is one of <span class="page-break">2</span>the brightest in history, and the American people never will forget the help given them in their struggle for independence by the brave and unselfish Pulaski. Unreasonable and without consideration, indeed, are they who would like to place the responsibility of the attempt on the life of the President, on a liberty loving people, because a man of their nationality became a murderer."</p>
