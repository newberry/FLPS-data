   <p>The battle is on. The Nash-Kelly Democratic organization hurled an insult at the Polish voters of Chicago. They ignored the demands of Chicago Poles that Judge Jarecki become a candidate for re-election to the office of county judge. They ignored his qualifications and his character. They ignore public opinion, which was, is, and always will be for Jarecki.</p>
   <p>When the plans of the Nash-Kelly Democratic machine, to omit Jarecki from the list of indorsed candidates, came to light, all the Polish-American leaders in Chicago, declared themselves in favor of Jarecki. In our editorials, we have come to a definite and decisive conclusion, that Jarecki, should be a candidate for re-election, and should be indorsed. The Democratic party has been enriched by his membership. When the nominating subcommittee announced, that, Jarecki's name will be omitted from the party's regular nominees, we very definitely demanded that Jarecki be slated for re-election and no other candidate. This demand was presented carefully to proper authorities of the Democratic party. The general opinion of Chicago Poles was also presented; but to no avail; they were completely ignored.</p>

   <p>The Cook-County general committee of the Democratic party, did not indorse Jarecki for re-election, as county judge. Obviously, Judge Jarecki will run as an independent candidate. And he will be re-elected because of his clean and honorable record in office; and because he is supported, not only by the Polish vote, but by all American voters; not only by Democratic, but also by the Republican voters.</p>
   <p>What are the reasons for such action on the part of the Nash-Kelly political organization? Because Jarecki is not a politician. He filled his judicial duties honestly. Because he was conscientious, and lived up to the letter, and not party dictation. And because he was honest enough to recognize the right of both, the Democrats and the Republicans; and their leaders. These are not the qualifications the Nash-Kelly political machine admire. They want obedient stumps-wooden soldiers-men they can move around to fit their plans. They want, yes-men, messenger boys, obedient and always ready to comply with orders. And now that a Pole has been found, who says he can better serve the people and the Democratic party, then they try to pull him down from the position he attained through honesty and hard work. The machine had other hot desires. Jarecki was not frightened however by the Democratic party threats, and will run as an independent candidate.</p>

   <p>It is only natural now, that all Nash-Kelly appointed jobholders will besmirch Jarecki and boost Prystalksi to the heavens. All Polish jobholders, of both the higher and lower offices appointed by the Nash-Kelly machine will begin a bitter conflict among the Poles, so they can defeat Jarecki. They have matched one Pole against another Pole; they have divided the Poles; now they are trying to drive the wedge still deeper. Their aim is to create chaos among the Poles and thereby weaken them.</p>
   <p>These are the reasons the Irish present. They have awaited them for years. And now, it seems, their dreams have been realized. Thanks to the narrow-mindedness of the Polish Democratic leaders.</p>
