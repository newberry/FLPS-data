   <p>Despite all kinds of interference, the project of the Polish Stock Company, organized to carry on a co-operative store in South Chicago, is going forward steadily. Notwithstanding the obstacles of our erstwhile friends and Jewish agents, the project is continually gaining friends among the Poles here in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>Although the factories have suspended work for an indefinite period, the shares of stock are eagerly sought, and, to date 800 shares amounting to $8,000 have been already sold. It is to be expected that the factories will soon reopen. This will contribute greatly to the success of this project.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the propaganda committee of the Business Corporation of South Chicago will be held on Friday, January 17, at 7 P. M., in the rectory, Bond Avenue and 83rd Street.</p>
