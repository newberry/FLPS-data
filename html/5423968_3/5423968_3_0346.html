   <p>One institution in the United States of North America has almost an unlimited power. This institution is the U. S. Supreme Court.</p>
   <p>It has the power to abolish any law or measure passed by the legislature of any state; the power to nullify any court decision, if its members agree by a majority of the votes that such a law or judgement is against the Constitution of the United States.</p>
   <p>The power of the U. S. Supreme Court has affected the whole nation severely more than once.</p>
   <p>The most famous decision of the Supreme Court prior to the Spanish-American War was given in the Dred Scott case.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Prominent American historians are of the opinion that this decision was responsible for the Civil War; like a spark, it ignited the accumulated inflammable material.</p>
   <p>We still remember the nullification of Judge Landis' decision by the Supreme Court in the oil trust case which exposed many abuses.</p>
   <p>If the decision handed down by Judge Landis had been upheld, and the punishment carried out, this oil trust would come to order and it would be a warning to other trusts.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, there should be some one in the country to guard the Constitution and interpret it in doubtful or obscure cases. Wise were the founders of the Republic, for they have not placed the highest laws of the country in the hands of the short-term President, or a Congress open to influence by politics, but in the hands of competent judicials, appointed for their lifetimes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>When the country was young and mostly agricultural, with very little commerce and industry and no outside politics, the Supreme Court was performing its protective function satisfactorily. However, later on, when the internal and external affairs of the country became more complicated, the harmony between the Supreme Court and the nation began to wane. Today, many citizens of this country are determined foes of this absolute authority of nine life-term judges over the judiciary system of this great nation.</p>
   <p>Some more radical citizens would curb the power of the Supreme Court in respect to the Constitution. They would allow the Supreme Court to pass judgement on all cases, but not to decide on questions of constitutionality.</p>
   <p>Other citizens, more conservative, ask: Who shall decide? If we allow the state legislatures to interpret the Constitution they will tear it to pieces. If we allow the President to do it, he might become too powerful. To allow the Congress to pass judgement upon itself and its colleagues is not in <span class="page-break">4</span>conformity with the principle that no one should be a judge in his own case.</p>
   <p>A very practical suggestion is introduced by Senator Jonathan Bourne Jr., of Oregon. It is true that he does not solve the problem, but he brings it a step ahead.</p>
   <p>We have before us Senator Bourne's bill which he has presented to the Senate.</p>
   <p>Senator Bourne has no intention to curb the power of the Supreme Court, but he demands that there should be unanimous agreement of all Supreme Court Judges on the question of Constitutionality.</p>
   <p>The author of the bill bases his argument on the fact that the Supreme Court Judges could not all agree on important matters, and that the opinion of the minority is always recorded in the Supreme Court docket.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Senator Bourne reasons that when a case is clear all Judges will agree, because no jurist of such high standing would deny a true fact, so if they cannot agree, we should suppose that the case has two sides and that its unconstitutionality is very doubtful, therefore, it should remain as it is, instead of imposing questionable law or judgement.</p>
   <p>This principal is applied at all jury trials in England and the United States, where a unanimous agreement of jurors is necessary for the conviction of the accused. The difference is this, that in the lower courts, the disagreement of the jurors does not acquit the defendant, but results in another trial. However, in the Supreme Court deliberations on constitutional matters, a disagreement of the jurors would result in dismissing the issue forever. We want progress and we do hope that Senator Bourne's bill will pass and become a law.</p>
