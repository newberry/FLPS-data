   <p>At the last meeting of the Walter Swiatkiewicz Society, Aerie 189 of the Polish Falcons' Alliance, upon the motion of Mr. John Krawczewski a citizens' club of that Aerie was formed. This club unanimously decided to indorse the following Polish candidates in the forthcoming primary election: Mr. F. Koralewski, candidate for Congress from the Eighth Congressional District; Mr. Joseph Petlak, candidate for State representative of Illinois; and Mr. Joseph LaBuy, a member of this Aerie, candidate for the municipal bench. It was decided to support all the above-mentioned candidates and to work incessantly in their behalf.</p>
   <p>The Walter Swiatkiewicz Aerie requests all its members to give active support to these candidates and thus to help to perpetuate the good name of our Polish-American citizenry.</p>
