   <p>A strike broke out today in the Ames and Frost bicycle factory, Blackhawk and Cherry Streets (Goose Island).</p>
   <p>The superintendent of the factory has set the price to be paid for certain piece work so low that even an expert and rapid worker cannot earn a miserable wage.</p>
   <p>After demanding a fair rate of pay without success, the Middle Trades Council has ordered a strike. This morning all workers left the factory, with the exception of machinists and polishers.</p>
   <p>If the factory does not agree to pay the rate demanded, the machinists and polishers will also quit.</p>
   <p>A large number of Poles are employed in this factory, and all of them are <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>co-operating in the strike.</p>
   <p>The strike committee and the Polish workingmen employed by this factory wish to warn other Polish workingmen to keep away from the Ames and Frost factory until the strike is settled. The strikers have placed pickets all around the place.</p>
