   <p>We received the following letter to be placed in this paper the - Zgoda;</p>
   <p>Dear Polish Brothers in Chicago! - We have been without work for the past seven months due to the strike at the Pullman plant.</p>
   <p>This whole misfortune is a trial of conscience, for the Poles.</p>
   <p>Many of the strikers of other nationalities have been back at work for sometime, but we poor Poles are less fortunate, because we do not understand, speak or write the American language, and we haven't any bright prospect for the future, because it will be a long time before we go back to work, if then. We Poles are suffering the most and are the hardest pressed; many with their wives and children are on public charity, and are waiting from day to day for help from some unknown source.</p>
   <p>With the New Year a few days away, we are asking our Polish brothers, to help the unfortunate ones and their families. God will repay you for all the good you do to help these poor.</p>
   
   <p>The other nationalities remember their needy at all times, because they say "it is our duty to take care of our brothers." Why don't the Polish businessmen, and workers of different organizations look into this matter of their poor brothers and help them, now in their hour of need. This is not merely a letter but a <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, please do not forsake us now.</p>
