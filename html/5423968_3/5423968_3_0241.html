   <p>One has to laugh heartily when one hears the Socialists loudly renouncing the bolsheviks, claiming that they warped the Socialistic idea and that they have rendered it odious through their unskillful compliance with active Socialist principles.</p>
   <p>Like all other socialistic arguments, so is this one, only an empty phrase calculated for the ignorant masses and nothing else.</p>
   <p>In reality, Russian bolshevism is nothing else but conformation of a practical socialistic theory, it is practical Socialism.</p>
   <p>Socialism, in such a form as it is sounded at present by socialistic teachers, is the entree to bolshevism, it only clears the way for bolshevism and, therefore, is the last phase of the socialistic make-up, beyond which there is nothing but remnants of conflagration, death and the cemetery.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Socialism kindles the flame of class prejudice and hatred and prepares for bolshevism to reign over the ruins and remnants of the cultural and civil acquisitions burned by the flames of class hatred.</p>
   <p>Socialism, directed from under cover by an internationally organized capital, is making war on the national capital, weakening in this way economically a given nation and rendering it defenceless and ready to commit mass suicide due to despair, by throwing itself into the whirlpool of a fratricidal war and giving away later voluntarily the rule over itself to the murderers of the social intellect and work, and to their own executioners.</p>
   <p>Socialism quite often clothes itself in various garments in order to hide its own intentions and aims, so as to gain easier the confidence of the masses, to acquire through them the physical power necessary to arouse disturbances and riots in the community, and, if it is successful, to accomplish a bloody bolshevistic overthrow.</p>
   <p>Socialism, by degrees, drop by drop, trickles into the weak heart and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>mind, the venom of hopelessness, hatred of one's own nation and one's Christian culture, with the intention of leading man to despondency, savagery and brutality; bolshevism casts these savage multitudes before itself and brings about a complete work of destruction, preparing in this way the exclusive rule of an "anonymous" power over the world. Socialism is a red, bloody theory; bolshevism is a socialistic practice.</p>
   <p>For that reason, all of you who desire happiness for yourselves and your children, those of you who want to live and develop, guard your-selves against socialism, because socialism does not build anything, and destroys everything; because destruction and agitation are its aims.</p>
