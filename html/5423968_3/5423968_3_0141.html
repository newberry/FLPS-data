   <p>The matter concerning the Poles who were victims of the vicious attack in Lemont, Illinois, has entered upon the course suggested by Dziennik Chicagoski in a recent article. The Poles of Chicago realize that it is their duty to protest against this criminal attack and to bring the perpetrators to justice; at the same time, relief will be given the poverty-stricken victims.</p>
   <p>A temporary committee has issued the following appeal:</p>
   <p>"The awful occurrences in Lemont, Illinois, on Friday, June 9, should have touched the heart of every Pole. Through no fault of their own, our countrymen were barbarously assaulted, while seeking to improve their living conditions by legal means. Already two Poles are dead, victims of this atrocity; many more are injured. All of them are in direst need. In view of these circumstances, we, a group of local citizens, have decided to call a mass meeting, <span class="page-break">2</span>to be held at the School Hall near Bradley Street at 7:30 Monday evening. The crimes of the contractors call for a vigorous protest on our part; it is also necessary that we determine the most effective way of helping our brethren in their present need. Finally, we owe acknowledgment to the governor of this state for his public defense of right and justice. The matter is now quite widely known--it has been publicized in all the newspapers. The Poles of Chicago are in duty bound to take active interest for their own good. We have hopes that our countrymen will attend this meeting as one man."</p>
   <p>These eloquent words need no addition. We can only support the committee by urging co-operation.</p>
