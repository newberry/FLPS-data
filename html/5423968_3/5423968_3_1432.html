   <p>There is not one citizen in Cook county who doesn't hold any interest in today's election. Especially is there great interest held by the Poles, who are trying to gain a nomination for E. K. Jarecki as county judge.</p>
   <p>Every candidate awaits the climax of today's election. The Polish candidates are certain of their victory, depending upon the entire mass of Polish votes in Cook county, and for that reason they preserve themselves peacefully.</p>
   <p>We are also convinced of their coming victory, but can't be too certain, because it is politics.</p>

   <p>An enormous amount of strength is held in those Polish votes. Many candidates shall say to themselves, O, those Polish votes! if only I were sure of them being cast for me I would not have to worry about my fate. Polish votes are recognized as holding great power. Tomorrow will bring us the result of our solidarity.</p>
