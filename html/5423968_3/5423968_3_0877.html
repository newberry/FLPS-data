   <p>From among all the candidates seeking the office of city attorney, our own choice, who until the present election held this office faithfully, is John F. Smulski, a Republican who defeated his Democratic opponent, Mr. William B. Moak, by 17,506 votes.</p>
   <p>This was an unusual occurrence, during the Democratic landslide to have a Republican win the city attorney's office by so large a majority.</p>
   <p>The Republicans admitted defeat but have already stated that their only candidate for the office of mayor in the city of Chicago in the coming election who will have a possible chance of defeating the strong Democratic Party's candidate, will be John F. Smulski.</p>
   <p>During this last election the Polish candidates did not fare so well, and fared even worse in the aldermanic race.</p>
   
   <p>In the 16th ward were three Polish candidates seeking the aldermanic office, Mr. Nowicki, Democrat; Mr. Przybylski, Republican; Mr. Jozwiakowski, Independent Democrat. The victor had to be a Pole, because all the candidates were Polish. Mr. Nowicki, who was strongly supported by the Poles in that war, the press and different Democratic organizations, was the victorious candidate.</p>
   <p>We feel sure that if Mr. Jozwiakowski had the right support and financial backing, the story would have been different. Nevertheless, we, the Polish citizens of the 16th ward, feel that Mr. Nowicki will do his utmost to fulfill his office duties to the best of his ability. Mr. Nowicki was the only Polish candidate to win an alderman's office.</p>
   <p>In the 17th ward, Mr. Budzban, a Polish candidate for alderman, was defeated; in the 5th ward, Mr. Leszczynski, an Independent Republican candidate for alderman, was decisively beaten.</p>
