   <p>The news that the qualifications and the meritorious work of a young Polish attorney have been recognized by the leaders of the Republican party in their selection of Mr. Frank Peska as their candidate for the municipal court bench is indeed an honor and a distinction. Mr. Peska was born on Noble Street, on the site now partly occupied by Holy Trinity Church. His parents removed to Hamlin Avenue, in the Twenty-fifth Ward, when he was barely five years of age.</p>
   <p>Since they wished him to have the education which only Polish environment can impart and to inculcate in his young mind the ideals of a true Pole, his parents sent him to the Holy Trinity parochial school despite its great distance from their residence. This primary education had a great influence in the formation of Mr. Peska's character. It made of him a man who has wholeheartedly dedicated himself to the Polish cause and to Polish ideals. In his untiring work in <span class="page-break">2</span>numerous Polish literary circles as well as in other organizations he has given incessant proof of his profound love of the literature of his forefathers. In his stage presentation of a few of the best creations of Polish literature he has touched the innermost depths of the Polish soul.</p>
   <p>To those who have carefully watched the progress of [our] Polish youth the name of Frank Peska is not unknown. Neither have others, not Poles, failed to recognize the true value of his character, his sincerity and his knowledge of the law. This has been practically manifested by the fact that the number of his clients has increased among people not Polish as well as among Poles.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Peska if elected to the bench will remain a source of pride to the Poles because of his profound knowledge and understanding of the law and of <span class="page-break">3</span>human nature. It is, therefore, the duty of our people, as true Poles, to cast their votes in his favor.</p>
   <p>This important political significance of Mr. Peska is the natural result of his untiring willingness to come to the assistance of the working people of his Ward But our people, in general, regardless of what ward they reside in, should place Mr. Peska in a position in which he can be more useful to the Chicago Poles.</p>
   <p>The Poles here have complained frequently in the past that they have not received their proper share of recognition. Our people have blamed the Republican party for this. In the person of Mr. Frank Peska we have a man of whom we can be justly proud. Every Pole, therefore, who is solicitous for the Polish cause and who is desirous that we shall have our own people in important official positions--every Pole, I repeat--should aid in the election of Mr. Peska to the municipal court bench. Cur people are therefore urged to do <span class="page-break">4</span>their duty. They should feel their obligation to go to the polls at the forthcoming primary election and cast their ballots for Mr. Peska. By so doing we shall assure him a place upon the ballot in the regular election, when we shall be able to elect as judge a young man who represents in himself the noblest qualities of the Polish character.</p>
