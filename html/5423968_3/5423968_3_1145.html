   <p>Yesterday afternoon, the twenty-eighth convention of the Cook County [Polish] Democratic League, attended by more than a hundred delegates, was held at Warszynski's Hall, Central Park Avenue and Wolfram Street. The convention was opened at about three o'clock in the afternoon by the president, Francis Danisch, Clerk of the Municipal Court, who explained the need for unity and mutual support, after which Francis Landmesser, secretary-general of the League, read the list of officers of the League and the names of the chairmen of the individual wards. At present, the officers of the League are as follows: Francis Danisch, president; F. Landmesser, secretary-general; B. Galecki and J. Przystalski, first and second assistant secretaries, respectively; County Commissioner Albert Nowak, treasurer; W. Linowiecki, quartermaster; and F. Rydzewski, B. Galecki, N. L. Piotrowski, Peter Jezierny, V. Zwiefka, and W. Nowak, vice-presidents.</p>
   <p>Then followed the reading of the list of ward committeemen, after which <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>President Danisch addressed the gathering, pointing out the importance of the convention now that the United States is at war with Germany and we Poles are awaiting the restoration of Poland, our homeland. In concluding his address, Danisch asked the delegates for co-operation for the good of the League, the United States, and Poland.</p>
   <p>The election of officers followed the president's address. Felix Gorski was unanimously elected president of the twenty-eighth convention, and B. Galecki was chosen secretary, likewise without opposition. The newly elected president of the convention thanked the gathering for the confidence placed in him and said that the twenty-eighth convention had a greater significance than any that had preceded it, owing to the fact that we Poles are now awaiting the restoration of our Poland to liberty. Further, he asked the delegates to conduct the discussions calmly and in a dignified manner. After this address, President Danisch named a credentials committee, consisting of Ignace Frasz, F. Witkowski, and Martin Gorski. The report of the credentials committee showed that ninety-eight delegates were present. The president then named a resolutions committee, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>....a committee on complaints,....and a nominating committee, after which the list of delegates was read. [Names of delegates omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>President Danisch then presented his report in a long address, in which he described what has been done by the League for its members in general and how it has benefited individual members. At the close of his report, Danisch expressed his regret that in February some sort of a central committee of the Democratic party had been formed, but how much this committee interfered with the work of the League he did not say. Alderman S. Adamkiewicz was asked to speak on this matter. He said that the aforesaid committee was organized to operate hand in hand with the League and to aid delegates who are running for office. The explanation accepted, Danisch concluded his address with the announcement that he did not intend to run for the office of Clerk of the Municipal Court in the coming fall elections as he had planned. The presidents' report was accepted unanimously. In recognition of his efforts, the delegates arose from their seats.</p>

   <p>Further, the report of Secretary-General F. Landmesser and the report of the committee on complaints were accepted unanimously. The resolution read by M. Zacharyasz was accepted unanimously, with a minor amendment by Adamkiewicz that all members of the League who are running for office be endorsed by the League. A rather lengthy discussion evolved around the question of the League's naming Polish candidates for Congress, especially in the Eighth District, where a Pole would have the best chance for election. The matter was finally left for the new executive committee to decide. On a motion by Danisch, the delegates arose from their seats to honor the Poles now serving in the army.</p>
   <p>The nominating committee then presented to the convention the list of candidates it had selected, all of whom were elected unanimously. The new administration consists of: F. P. Danisch, president; F. H. Landmesser, secretary-general; B. F. Galecki and John Przystalski, first and second assistant secretaries, respectively; Albert Nowak, treasurer; W. Linowiecki, quartermaster; and F. X. Ridzewski, Peter Jezierny, Vincent Zwiefka, and K. Susralski, vice-presidents.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The newly elected executive committee consists of N. S. Budzban, F. X. Rydzewski, Albert Nowak, Thomas Kasperski, Peter Jezierny, J. M. Nowicki, Stanley Adamkiewicz, and of F. Danisch, president, and F. Landmesser, secretary, ex officio. The organization committee consists of Judge Joseph LaBuy, Michael Kolassa, J. Helminiak, M. Zacharyasz, I. F. Dankowski, W. Orlikowski, and John Przystalski.</p>
   <p>Needless arguing and unpleasant discussion were brought on by an address by J. Czekala on the politics of the Sixteenth Ward. The delegates, however, chose a committee from this ward consisting of F. Witkowski and B. Mindak. In conclusion, President Danisch spoke again to the convention, thanking the delegates for re-electing him. A.Nowak and T. Kasperski also spoke, urging the delegates to co-operate and to support the League's candidates in the coming fall elections.</p>
   <p>When all the business had been taken care of, Felix Gorski, chairman of the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>twenty-eighth convention of the Cook County Democratic League, thanked the delegates for conducting their discussions in a calm manner. The secretary then read the following list of ward committeemen: Ward 4, M. Gorski; Ward 5, F. Derdzinski and F. Zientek; Ward 8, W. Przybylinski and S. Bloch; Ward 9, J. Bzdek and B.

The delegates then proceeded to another hall where quartermaster Linowiecki had prepared a delicious meal. There were also several cases of beer for the delegates.</p>
