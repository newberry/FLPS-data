   <p>Tomorrow will be election day in Chicago. As in previous years we feel obligated to say a few words to the readers about how to vote.</p>
   <p>This election is primarily concerned with the election of two judges to the Superior Court and trustees for the Sanitary District.</p>
   <p>Every Democrat should vote a straight Democratic ticket, making a cross in the large circle next to the word "Democratic". In this way victory will be assured all Democratic party candidates.</p>
   <p>Besides the election of candidates another important question is up for public decision. This is whether or not a new system of registering title ownership to property should be introduced (Torrens Land Title System). According to specialists in the real-estate field, this is a very practical method. It simplifies the transference of ownership, lowers the cost of the change, eliminates the necessity of examining abstracts, and assures a better title of ownership. This system reminds one of the methods used in Europe.</p>
   <p>On the whole, everyone agrees that the new Torrens System will be of great benefit to the public. Therefore we advise all to vote for this system. To do do it is necessary to place a cross in the square opposite the words, "For the Torrens Land System". These words are placed at the head of the ballot. Those who place a cross in the second square will vote against the Torrens System.</p>
