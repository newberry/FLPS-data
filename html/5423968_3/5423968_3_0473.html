   <p>In another column we have printed the article: "Do Miners Desire Smaller Wages," which can be found in several newspapers, published in the east, in that part of the United States, where the main industry is coal mining.</p>
   <p>Do the residents of the city of Chicago know what it costs to mine one ton (2,000 lbs.) of hard coal?</p>
   <p>As to this, we doubt very much, not denying however that even here in Chicago you will find a few who have been in those sections and are acquainted with conditions there, therefore they can also answer that question. Mindful of that let's go further.</p>
   <p>The strata of hard coal, in the vicinity of Scranton, Wimesbarre, etc. are found from 700 to 2000 feet under the surface of the earth. Down inclines and shafts are lowered small rail wagons which the miners fill with coal. Each one of these wagons contains exactly four tons of coal, practically clean, because one is not allowed to fill the wagon with stone under a penalty of a several day's "layoff".</p>
   <p>For the digging of four tons of coal and loading them on the wagon, the company pays the miners $1.25 (on the average, because in various places the pay differs a little.)</p>
   <p>Therefore 4 tons $1.25, - one ton 313/4 cents. The cleaning of the coal does not come to more than 20 cents per 2000 lbs (1 ton). From the above figures we see that the mining and cleaning of 1 ton of hard coal, costs the mine owners barely around 50 cents.</p>
   <p>The residents of Chicago, pay $8.00 per ton. Does the freight cost that much? No! not in the least!</p>
   <p>Well, but its difficult that is why America has so many millionaires, - who have enough money to buy all of Europe and to pay the debts of all its millionaire lords.</p>
