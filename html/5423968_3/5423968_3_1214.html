   <p>Through the initiative of the John Sobieski Political Club of the Tenth Ward, a meeting was held Sunday, February 8, in St. Casimir Parish. Many things were discussed and the following resolutions were adopted:</p>
   <p>1. Considering it our duty to support all Poles, regardless of partisan following, we endorse the young and energetic Stanislaus Kuflewski, brother of the well-known Dr. Kuflewski, as a candidate for the office of West Town Clerk.</p>
   <p>2. Realizing that during the past two years the alderman of this ward only made promises sans actions, we, therefore, have indorsed the well-known Peter Biewar as a candidate for alderman of the Tenth Ward.</p>
   <p>J. Rosinski, secretary.</p>
