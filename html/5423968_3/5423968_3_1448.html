   <p>Mr. Joseph Ruszkiewicz (Rushkiewicz), former member of the Sanitary District Board, who has a real-estate office at 1536 West Chicago Avenue, was appointed assistant city treasurer yesterday afternoon at a salary of $4,500 a year. Many aspirants of other nationalities--Germans, Irishmen, Jews--had tried to get this post but Clayton F. Smith, the city treasurer, gave it to a Pole.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ruszkiewicz is deeply grateful not only to Smith but to Alderman S. Walkowiak, Alderman Stanley Adamkiewicz of the Seventeenth Ward, R. Sullivan, Doile, and other politicians who helped him get the appointment.</p>
   <p>This is good news for us Poles, and we extend our best wishes to Mr. Ruszkiewicz.</p>
