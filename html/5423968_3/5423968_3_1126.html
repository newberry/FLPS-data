   <p>In connection with the misunderstandings among local Polish political organizations we have received from the Polish Democratic League the following communication, which for the sake of impartiality we publish in full.</p>
   <p>Polish Democratic League</p>
   <p>Last week Polish newspapers published a report of the meeting of the League and the list of candidates for nomination recommended by the League. In connection with this report they made certain statements openly accusing the League of dividing the Polish people.</p>
   <p>We protest most emphatically against such accusations. The whole tenor of our meeting, all the speeches and the resolutions, had only one aim, and that was to sound out the wishes of the Polish community and to have candidates for office selected by the people and not by a single individual.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In order to clarify our position, we feel that it is necessary to sketch briefly our history. The league was organized in Chicago in 1894; it elected Mr. Stanislas H. Kunz president and Mr. Szameit secretary. In the course of time, because of lack of energy on the part of Polish politicians, the League became dormant, and it remained so up to 1908, when it was revived, having at its helm Mr. Ruszkiewicz as president and Mr. Lisack as secretary. In 1910 Mr. Joseph Lisack was elected president, and Mr. M. J. Szameit secretary of the League, and these offices they have held ever since.</p>
   <p>The League since its reorganization has adhered to one cardinal principle: to work for the good of the people through the people and not through individuals. Mr. Ruszkiewicz would not act according to this principle, and that is why the League did not re-elect him president. Since that time all the efforts of Mr. Ruszkiewicz have been directed against the activities of the League, and before every political campaign, with the help of his followers, he forms a new Polish organization which, as he says, is an expression of the will of the people, and which usurps the power of decision from the people, submitting <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>as candidates for office individuals selected by Mr. Ruszkiewicz and not by the Polish community. Mr. Ruszkiewicz did this six years ago, four years ago, and two years ago, and he is doing the same thing now.</p>
   <p>The assertion that the organization of Mr. Ruszkiewicz is composed of representatives of all the Polish wards is based on false information, since only people selected by Mr. Ruszkiewicz, not those selected by the Polish people, attended the meetings of this organization, and so they did not represent the Polish people either in their separate wards or in the whole Polish community but only themselves, and if there were some individuals present who really cared for the good of the Polish people, they were not in harmony with Mr. Ruszkiewicz and his works.</p>
   <p>As far as the list of candidates submitted by our League to the Central Democratic Committee is concerned, we have thus much to say. It is the firm belief of the League that the Polish people are capable of selecting and nominating candidates for office and need not let the Central Democratic <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Committee, on which by the way there are two Poles, do it for them. There are more than 90,000 Poles in Chicago and in Cook County and they have a right to decide whom they want as candidates, and what offices they wish to demand for the candidates whom they want nominated; they do not have to ask for favors or to submit a long list of names from which the Central Committee may select a few as candidates.</p>
   <p>The League is decidedly against giving authority to any individual to make decisions for the whole community, regarding the people as the final authority and not some individual who has forged ahead by hook or by crook and now assumes the right to represent the Polish people, and who to further his own selfish plans is willing to work against the interests of the Polish people, as his past clearly shows. It is a fact that Mr. Ruszkiewicz called twelve prospective candidates to his office for a secret meeting, and that with these candidates he formed in his usual way a so-called Polish political organization. These gentlemen did not come to this meeting as representatives of the Polish people; they were there representing their own aspirations and <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>personal ambitions. Only four or five wards were represented at this meeting.</p>
   <p>Fulfilling the mission of the League, the undersigned called a mass meeting of Poles for Monday, January 16, in the Hotel Morrison, which was attended by Poles from fourteen wards and by Congressman Stanislas H. Kunz. Invitations to attend this meeting were sent to Mr. Ruszkiewicz, to all Polish alderman, and to all Polish officials. If these gentlemen did not come to this meeting, it is not our fault but theirs.</p>
   <p>After the discussion of the political situation the League, in accordance with its aims, made the recommendation to the Central Democratic Committee that it place on the committee of fifteen preparing the list of prospective candidates for office the name of Stanislas H. Kunz as representing the Polish public and the Polish League, which is convinced that Mr. Kunz will properly represent the interests of the Polish people. Further, the League made up a list of candidates who in the opinion of those present are fit for <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>political office, and it expresses its confidence and its conviction that Mr. Kunz as a member of the committee will insist on the acceptance of this list by the Committee. The list of candidates submitted by the League represents the Polish people in all Chicago and Cook County and not only those living on the Northwest Side of our city. Our candidates are in every respect fit for the offices which they are seeking; they believe in the rights of the people and do not concede to any individual the right to dictatorship. Those gentlemen who have aspirations to be candidates for office had an opportunity to be at this meeting and to give us their reasons for their political ambitions. But not believing in the rights of the people, they ignored the invitation of the League and did not appear at the meeting.</p>
   <p>In view of these facts the Polish Democratic League asks the Polish public in behalf of which it works in the field of politics to take under consideration: first, that Polish strength in the city and in Cook County is 92,674 votes scattered among nineteen wards and nine country towns; second, that this <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>considerable number of Polish votes in the city and the county should not be controlled by some autocratic individual; third, that the Polish people should have and do have the right to select and to elect their own candidates and need not permit the Central Committee of the party to choose the candidates for them through the secret machinations of some individuals; fourth, that the interests of the Polish people demand that the candidates for office be capable men who can be relied upon to work for the interests of the Polish people; fifth, that it is to the interest of the Polish people that a Polish candidate shall be nominated for at least one office which can dispose of a considerable number of jobs; and sixth, that it is to the interest of the Polish people that they shall not ask for favors but shall demand and obtain their just rights. We ask again whether in view of all these facts the actions of the League are not justified, and whether the Polish community will continue to be misled by selfish and self-seeking individuals.</p>
   <p>The League does not hide its activities. It does not call secret meetings nor so-called mass meetings held in private offices where less than twenty <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>men can be accomodated; it works in the open. The league does not care for personalities, and as far as the candidates are concerned, its main consideration is how much good the Polish public will derive from such and such a candidate. If Mr. Joseph Ruszkiewicz could give us a valid guarantee that he will strive more for the good of the public and less for his own, the League, with the consent of the public, would support his efforts.</p>
   <p>Finally, the League renews its pledge that its aim and purpose are to work profitably for the good of the Polish people through the representatives of the people, and it does not grant to any individual the right to make political decisions for the Polish people without authority from the representatives of the people.</p>
   <p>The League kindly asks all Polish papers in Chicago to publish this article in order that the Polish people may know accurately the true state of affairs.</p>
