   <p>In the 27th ward, where there is a growing Polish colony, Mr. Wulf, a man who lived solely for politics and from politics, lost in the last election. If Poles living there were "able to stick together" they could in the future play a very important part in ward politics. Their votes would determine every election. We should not attach such a great importance to party principles but rather see to it that people representing us are honest men and not just windbags</p>
