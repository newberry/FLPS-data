   <p>assessors and Mr.J. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, for State Representative. On the Republican ballot those endorsed were: Mr. Armknecht, for County Commissioner; Mr. F. Rostenkowski, for State Representative, and Mr. S. Gillmeister, for member of the Board of Assessors.</p>
   <p>Also endorsed were Dr. E. Napieralski, for coroner and Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for State Representative, on the new progressive party ticket. It was the wish of the members present, to endorse the latter two candidates, because they also are of Polish descent.</p>
   <p>All the Poles, who have the right to cast their votes on election day, should vote for all Polish candidates, without regard to their party affiliations, and then vote for the other candidates who are not aspiring to the same offices as the Polish candidates. Let us unite and help ourselves, because the other nationalities are not going to help us.</p>
