   <p>On last Sunday, October 20, 1912 the oldest Polish Citizens' Club, known as the, Casimer Pulaski Citizens Club, held a special meeting, for the purpose of takin gup the political situation.</p>
   <p>The chairman for the meeting was, Mr. Paul Nawrot, who also is president of this club. Mr. Albert Danisch, was appointed recording secretary.</p>
   <p>At this meeting the following Polish candidates, aspiring for political office, were unanimously endorsed on the Democratic ballot: Mr. Frank P. Danisch, for Clerk of the Municipal Court; Mr. Joseph Labuy, for Judge of the Municipal Court; Mr. Stanley Kuflewski and Mr. Nowak, for County Commissioners, Mr. Joseph P. Ruszkiewicz, for member of the Board of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>assessors and Mr. J. Pitlok, for State Representative. On the Republican ballot those endorsed were: Mr. Armknecht, for County Commissioner; Mr. F. Rostenkowski, for State Representative, and Mr. S. Gillmeister, for member of the Board of Assessors.</p>
   <p>Also endorsed were Dr. E. Napieralski, for coroner and Mr. W. Gieldzinski for State Representative, on the new progressive party ticket. It was the wish of the members present, to endorse the latter two candidates, because they also are of Polish descent.</p>
   <p>All the Poles, who have the right to cast their votes on election day, should vote for all Polish candidates, without regard to their party affiliations, and then vote for the other candidates who are not aspiring to the same offices as the Polish candidates. Let us unite and help ourselves, because the other nationalities are not going to help us.</p>
