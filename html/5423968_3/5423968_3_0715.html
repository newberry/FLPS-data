   <p>It seems that there is no other nation so little skilled in politics as are the Polish people. The Americans themselves publicly point to this short-coming of ours at our own Polish meetings. They state openly that we do not know how to profit politically by our numerical strength, and that for that reason many Polish candidates lose. The main fault of our political impotence is jealousy. This jealousy is brought out by the so-called political detractors who either openly or secretly attempt to work harm to a Polish candidate whenever a Pole through his endeavors and initiative begins gradually to amount to something in political life.</p>
   <p>We have had many instances in which a Polish candidate with a clear record has been defeated simply because his opponent wanted to avenge himself or has accepted graft and exerted all his efforts, together with those of his clique, to slander and bring about the defeat of an honest Pole. This proves only too well that the Polish people are unable to be guided in politics by reason and judgment. They listen only to the advice of paid agents and to people who are ill disposed toward Poles. Because of that fault we are, politically speaking, excess baggage.</p>
   <p>Let us follow the example set by American citizens of other nationalities. We can see how they work together and co-operate in every respect whenever the welfare of their candidate is at stake. They do not ask to what party or faction the candidate belongs. To them it is sufficient to know that a person is a candidate of their race, and the whole matter terminates in that. Among us Poles, on the other hand, our people inquire from what part of Poland the Polish candidate comes, whether he is a good Catholic or a nationalist, and whether he is rich. When they finally find out everything about him, then, to conclude it, the political detractors begin to blacken his name. They smear his reputation so as to create the conviction in the Polish voters' minds that this Polish candidate is the worst man under the sun. As a result, the majority of unenlightened Polish voters, instead of casting their votes in favor of the Polish candidate, give them to a candidate of another nationality, whom they usually do not know, and who, quite often, has such a record that he should never have been permitted to leave jail.</p>
   <p>This Polish newspaper, Dziennik Zwiazkowy, has at all times defended the principles of clean politics. Whenever it has recommended any candidate for public office, it has done so with the idea that the candidate deserved support as a good Pole. Such also should be the attitude of our entire Polish press in political matters, for only in that way can we hope to educate our people and properly to inform them who deserves our support.</p>
   <p>Rumors have already been spread among the political malcontents that a clique of dishonest political detractors want to knife some of the Polish candidates in the coming elections. Among these "butchers" there are people who have a very dubious record in politics, and who have at no time brought honor to the Polish name in our political life. Such people should be opposed and pointed out at every opportunity because there is no other cure for them.</p>
   <p>Members of the Polish National Alliance can at all times look with pride at their solidarity in politics. They do not allow themselves to be taken in too readily by the political detractors. The principle of the members of the Polish National Alliance is to support Poles in every field. Above all they consider it their sacred duty to support their brother members of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Among the Polish candidates belonging to the Polish National Alliance we have a very capable individual in the person of Mr. Joseph Ruszkiewicz. He is a Democratic candidate,aspiring for the distinguished position of trustee of the Sanitary Board. Women as well as men may vote for him. Every one should cast his votes for Ruszkiewicz, since he has an enviable and unblemished record and will not bring shame to our people when he is elected.</p>
   <p>Like every human being, he has his friends and his enemies. His enemies are people who are jealous and who, in principle, are underminers of the type which attempts to nullify at times even the best plans of those who are interested in a better future for our people.</p>
   
   <p>In this instance the members of the Polish National Alliance should not allow themselves to be led astray by any derogatory remarks made by the detractors. We should stand firmly by our own candidates on the election day of November 7, 1916, and cast our votes in behalf of Mr. Ruszkiewicz. If a Pole and a member of the Polish National Alliance succeeds in attaining that distinguished public office, it will indeed be an honor to us Poles. It will mean that our people know how to take care of themselves in politics.</p>
