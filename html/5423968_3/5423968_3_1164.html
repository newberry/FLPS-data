   <p>Citizens! A certain group of foreigners has collected a number of signatures on a petition for the purpose of having the commissioners of Kosciusko Park change the name of that park from that of our hero to that of someone of another nationality. In order to frustrate this plot and in order to prevent any indignity aimed at us, the Avondale Improvement Club is calling all citizens together at a meeting of protest, which will be held tomorrow, Sunday, February 11, at 3 P. M., at St. Hyacinth's Parish hall, corner Wolfram Street and Lawndale Avenue.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Welfare Committee:</p>
   <p>J. Kikulski</p>
   <p>T. Jaszkowski</p>
   <p>J. Wojtalewicz</p>
   <p>J. Turzynski</p>
   <p>P. Rychlowski</p>
   <p>A. J. Plocinski, president</p>
   <p>N. Lengowski, secretary</p>
