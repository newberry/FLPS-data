   <p>Cast aside all political points of view when it comes down to the cold facts in considering for what candidate to vote at elections; and then see for your-self or analyze the thing as a whole. What does it reveal?</p>
   <p>In searching over the records of prospective candidates, voters absorb all information regarding the men for whom they intend to vote. They scrutinize the records of the men who aspire to some public office, as they should honestly do. Voters search for men whom they can entrust with their interests; men who will fight for their benefits and protect their privileges. Men of that type are those who will champion the cause of their people, thereby repaying the voters for the confidence reposed in them by the latter.</p>
   <p>Being mindful of the real object of political search for responsible men to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>elevate them to positions worthy of their character, let us consider the question: just what are the people looking for?</p>
   <p>We answer that they seek men who have been tried and true. Men who stand on their record. Men who, having nothing to hide, will not wilt under storms. Men who fear nothing, who will fight for right, who will spare no efforts in order to get their people that which is rightly due to them.</p>
   <p>And what men possess these qualities? Is there, or can there be a more qualified candidate than a sportsman? A man who has honestly fought for victory from his childhood days, ever since he bagan to distinguish between right or wrong; a man who has been a defender of all that is just; and who has given his efforts for securing civic benefit to those whom he loved, with whom he has constantly associated, and which whose wants and trends he is familiar? Can anyone be more qualified than a man who lives the life a true, honest sportsman?</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Nowhere can you find the spirit just described, except in a champion, whose hart has ben stimulated to battle for those things which may hold the key to the welfare of a community</p>
   <p>Those are the kind of people for whom voters should vote on primary day, April 8, 1930.</p>
   <p>Now, voters of the twenty seventh senatorial district, who will be your candidate for state representative of your district?</p>

Polish Roman Catholic Union members, you can do a lot for your man. He has been an organizer, a defender, a champion worthy of your support. He has been active in all affairs that meant your welfare.
