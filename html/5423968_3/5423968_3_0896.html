   <p>We must share some sad news with our readers for the coming holidays. Not so long ago a meeting was held in the sixteenth ward by the representatives from the ten districts in which it is divided. At this meeting there were present seven Poles, two Germans and one Egyptian nobleman with "cutlets"(Jew). The main intention of the meeting was to nominate a so-called "committeeman." One would judge that out of seven Poles there would be nominated a Pole, as it has been until now, but no! all of them unanimously nominated a "landsman" by the name of Leininger, and he will represent the Polish people. Is this mockery or a higher branch of politics unknown to anybody? Where are our dignified and worthy citizens? Will they further permit this type of faulty methods, which bring us shame and disgrace? It is high time to show these "corner politicians" that the traffic in human goods is forbidden.</p>
