   <p>Yesterday's mass-meeting of the Polish Democrats who intended to form a Polish Democratic League in Cook County, was marred by a slight misunderstanding among the representatives of Polish democracy. This gathering was arranged in order to organize an alliance and to elect its officers from the delegates of all Wards inhabited by Poles. Instead, as Councilman F. B. Koraleski explained, most of the gentlemen were detained by the Grunwald celebration and therefore could not be present. Except for the citizens of the 8th Ward and their Councilman, Mr. J. S. Derpa, no other Ward was represented by delegates.</p>
