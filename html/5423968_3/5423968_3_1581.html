   <p>The Poles of South Chicago have never before been so intensely interested in politics as they are now.</p>
   <p>All available halls in the Polish sections have been reserved by Polish political clubs, and political meetings are being held every night, including Sundays.</p>
   <p>At first most of the Poles in South Chicago were Democrats, later the Republican party made some gains, and now the People's party, consisting of two clubs with about four thousand members, plays a very important role.</p>
   <p>The meetings of the Populists are always crowded....The Democratic party also does good work and is successful, but the Republican party is inactive....We do not hear very much about Polish Republicans.</p>
