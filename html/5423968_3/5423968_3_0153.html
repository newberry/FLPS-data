   <p>The secretary of the Polish Union Organization informs us that among our fellow men who work in the mines there is a strike bringing poverty to them and their families.</p>
   <p>So, for this reason the central government of the Polish Union Organization appeals to our fellow men's hearts in the United States, begging them to make a donation, if able to do it.</p>
   <p>The ill fate that befell them today might happen to us tomorrow, so let us help now, and in the future let us pray that our plea for help shall not be rejected.</p>
