   <p>Every time the American citizen who has the misfortune of being a proletariat compares that which the present government gives him with that which he should get, so many times he must clinch his fists and say: "This government is my enemy, though it should be my protector." Indeed there is no field in which the American workman has not been wronged by the governmental authorities, which at present are the expression of capitalism, protecting its interests and acting as if labor could have only duties but no rights. Each time the business interests are exposed to any loss, the government steps in, suppressing and disorganizing strikes, either by filling the pocketbooks of tricksters with gold or siding openly with capital against labor. The police, the courts and the legislature are the servants of the Moloch of Gold (Money God) and the worker should be glad that he is not thrown into jail or discharged from work for merely thinking about a fight.</p>
   <p>Capital and the present government are like master and servant.</p>

   <p>It is not enough for the government that it serves capital indirectly everywhere and at every hour, that it treads upon laws and destroys the interests of the workers, but it is not even ashamed to take a direct stand against the economic interest of the working class.</p>
   <p>We have learned from yesterday's dispatches that the present Secretary of War, the obese Taft, ordered and bought supplies used in the United States Army during marches, from the penal institutions or prisions.</p>
   <p>These prisons use very cheap labor and can furnish these supplies at prices much lower than the manufacturers could supply.</p>
   <p>The result is that the manufacturers do not get the orders and employ no workers, in other words, Taft is taking advantage of his influential position; he fights the American worker, whether we have prosperity or unemployment.</p>

   <p>Will anyone tell him anything?</p>
   <p>No, unless the citizen workers find out about this pleasant candidate for presidency and vote for their own, the Socialist candidate. Let us agitate and make it a reality.</p>
