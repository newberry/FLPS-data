   <p>"Campaign boasts and subterfuges will not help our opponents," Mr. Philip Ksycki, leader of the Polish Republicans of the Seventeenth Ward, told us today. "I am wholeheartedly for [Stanley] Adamkiewicz and believe that all the Polish Republicans of the Seventeenth Ward will declare themselves for him and will give him their votes.</p>
   <p>"Please state in my name that our Polish candidate should be supported by all the Poles, because only then will we succeed in having a Pole elected and thus obtain another seat in the municipal government.</p>
   <p>"I am sure," continued Mr. P. Ksycki, "that Mr. S. Adamkiewicz will have the support of all the members of the Polish National Alliance--in the first place because he has been a member of the Alliance for many years, and in the second, because, as a Pole, he should be supported by all Poles with all their power.</p>

   <p>"I am also convinced that with the support of all the Poles behind him, Mr. S. Adamkiewicz will be elected, and the Poles of the Seventeenth Ward will finally show that they represent a force which must be reckoned with, and that in this ward a Pole should be elected."</p>
   <p>From this, one can see that Mr. S. Adamkiewicz's chances are increasing with each day, and that on Tuesday the victor will be a Pole--Mr. S. Adamkiewicz.</p>
