   <p>A political mass meeting, sponsored by the Polish-American Democratic Club of the Sixteenth Ward, was held last night at the new Polish hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. It was the last Polish meeting in this hall prior to the election next Tuesday, November 8.</p>
   <p>The hall was not as crowded as at previous political assemblies, probably because the mass meeting was held on a working day. In spite of this, more than one thousand people attended.</p>
   <p>The president of the Club, Anthony Rudnicki, presided over the meeting. The [speakers'] platform was occupied by many outstanding citizens of the Sixteenth Ward. Among the speakers were S. Kunz, A. Kowalski, N. Piotrowski, and Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. Judge Yanin, of McComb County, spoke in English.</p>
