   <p>At the recent meeting of the Kensington Civic Committee, held on September 18, 1918, Mr. John Musial was selected as financial secretary of the Committee, succeeding Mr. J. Bemki, who was obliged to resign from this position because of other interests which demanded his undivided attention. At the same time Mr. Francis Miazga was chosen correspondent for the Civic Committee, and from now on he is authorized to inform the Polish press on the activities of the Committee. The new Polish reporter of Kensington promises faithfully to fulfill his obligations in so far as his time permits.</p>
