   <p>Six protectors held in abeyance the nomination. The non-indorsement of Jarecki is not agreeable to the regular Democrats of the party nor the people of the county. They demand that Jarecki run independent, and show the people that the office of county Judge is not to be used for politics.</p>
   <p>The nomination of Mr. Jarecki was assured at the beginning of the caucus by the Central Committee of the Democratic Party. Six members of the committee, made the charges against county judge, Jarecki, that he does not attend any of the Democratic gatherings or meetings. This was either a pretext or a bluff. It is said to be a fact, that during the first few days of the committee the county judge sentenced election cheaters to jail, irrespective of their political preference. This, according to the political protectors of the election cheaters, was an offence, punishable, by the refusal to indorse his candidacy for re-election.</p>
   <p>Before it was possible to ask county Judge Jarecki as to his view on the steps taken by the nominating committee, which ordered three members of the subcommittee, namely, Konkowski, Bowler and Szumnarski to find a suitable Pole, on whom they could depend, and place on the Democratic ticket for county judge, instead of Jarecki, prominent Democrats, not entering the committee session presented a problem for the Democratic committee to solve.</p>
   
   <p>What reasons will be given to Judge Jarecki and will they be satisfactory? In the vast circles of Democrat and non-committee leaders they offer the following suggestions: Their uppermost thought is that he should be in the race.</p>
   <p>All prominent Democrats, Republicans and voters, who have observed Jarecki's conduct in office, declare, that Judge Jarecki, during elections, before elections, and after elections, made it known, that he, the county judge, will not permit his office to be used for political usurpation. The office of county judge should be absolutely non-partisan. The duty of the county judge is to serve the people of the whole county, and not only one or another political faction or party.</p>
   <p>Action taken by this Democratic Committee, the opinion being that it is a responsible one; even though six of their number are the cause of this scandalous affair, plainly shows that this is really the action of a "clique-ocracy" and not democracy. To please and satisfy their ambitions, and to further their aims in removing judge Jarecki from the ballot, they have decided to substitute another Pole in his place. They have decided on the spur of the moment to find this new candidate so that his name could be readily presented. Their wishes will be granted. These are the comments of the majority of Democrats. This is what the leaders of the Democratic party say, who were always proud of county judge Jarecki's conduct in office. Of all the existing discord in the Democratic Party, this one threatens to be the most serious. The Cliqueocrats will have what they wanted. Jarecki worked for the good of the county, for clean elections and the sanctity of the ballot, and won. But now, his own party failed to nominate him for re-election.</p>
