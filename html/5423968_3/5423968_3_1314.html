   <p>The efforts of the Polish American Democratic Club of the citizens of the Sixteenth Ward did not go for naught and yesterday's encouragement by Dziennik Chicagoski created a marked influence among the Poles residing in the Sixteenth Ward. The Poles have occupied nearly all the seats in the police court at West Chicago Avenue, where a Democratic Ward Club was to have been formed, and the Irish and others, to whom this was a surprise and who could find very little space in the small hall--because the Poles had preceded them--looked with wonder upon what was happening. It can be said that yesterday the Sixteenth Ward, that is, at least the Democratic part of it, officially passed into the hands of the Poles, who will certainly never allow it to be taken away from them by force. The other nationalities were in a considerable minority at this meeting and it could be ascribed only to the courtesy of the Poles that in the scope of the administration, other nationalities were also selected.</p>

   <p>The hall in reality was very small and for that reason it was impossible to accommodate many people; it seems that it was purposely chosen by the Irish, with the anticipation that by congregating about one hundred people, they would not let the Poles in or at least allow in only a few. They were fooled, however, since they themselves nearly were not admitted and it was worthwhile looking at their comically surprised faces.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Kiolbassa presided, and Mr. Gieszkiewicz was the secretary. Immediately after the meeting was opened by a beautiful political speech of Mr. Kiolbassa the business of forming the club was advanced. In order to allow those present to enroll in the club, the chairman nominated two other secretaries to assist the secretary. Out of courtesy he wished to nominate at least one Irishman, but everyone declined and did not want to accept the office; it might be that they were afraid to write down the Polish names because that would most likely be beyond their ability. Therefore, Messrs. Thomas Krolik and Biniak were nominated instead.</p>

   <p>All those present joined the club and the election of a permanent administration of the ward was then in order. Mr. Peter Kiolbassa was unanimously elected president, and Mr. Gieszkiewicz secretary. Then two vice-presidents were nominated: Mr. J. Buxbaum (a Hungarian) and Mr. J. Kristian (a Bohemian). Judge M. A. LaBuy was enthusiastically nominated for treasurer; he really wished to decline the honor in behalf of an Irishman, so that, as he stated, other nationalities might be represented, but the Irish candidate himself clearly stated that it was not a matter of nationality, that only the Democrats of the Sixteenth Ward had met and not merely various nationalities; he did not allow Mr. LaBuy to resign.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gieszkiewicz was ordered to inform the press of the results of the meeting; the chairman, again, was entrusted to call the next meeting at a larger hall. This future meeting is to be held a week from today, and it will most probably be held at Walsh's Hall.</p>
   <p>Despite the small amount of people that could be accommodated at yesterday's <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>meeting--many persons had to remain behind the door, because it was impossible for them to enter--nevertheless this meeting will constitute an epochal moment in the history of the Sixteenth Ward which is Democratic to a greater extent, according to the chairman's statement; the Sixteenth Ward will undoubtedly be one of the principal pillars, and perhaps the main pillar of the municipal's Democracy and even of the State of Illinois. In addition it will henceforth and permanently belong to the Poles.</p>
