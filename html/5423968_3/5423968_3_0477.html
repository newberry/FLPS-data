   <p>The Rev. Father Anton Heiter from Buffalo spoke yesterday at the hall of St. Martin about the social question to a large crowd of Catholics, Heretics and Socialists. The speaker outlined three points that the socialists affirm:</p>
   <p>1. Workers today are slaves. Their earnings are the earnings of slaves.</p>
   <p>2. Only the Socialists are capable to free the workers from slavery.</p>
   <p>3. Every worker should become a socialist.</p>
   <p>Father Heiter, then, again reminded the people that here in America and in the whole civilized world that the question of wage earnings is at present regulated by contracts accepted by both parties, the worker and employer. As for the worker being a slave, we should not even think of it. The Socialists never interceded to help the working man, while the state and church did.</p>
   <p>The workers should not encamp themselves with the socialists, but let organized labor throw out the socialists who might hinder the future of workers, capitalists and all followers of organized order. Where there are no slaves, we do not need univited defenders.</p>
   <p>Let us stand on the ground of christianity, let the workers and employers hold to the teachings of Jesus Christ, let the state go hand in hand with the hand of the church and the soical question shall be happily solved. without the aid of Socialists.</p>
