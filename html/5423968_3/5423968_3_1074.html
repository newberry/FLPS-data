   <p>The Polish Democrats gathered yesterday at Pulaski Hall for a great mass-meeting, which was attended by many people in spite of rainy and stormy weather.</p>
   <p>I. F. Dankewski, chairman, of the meeting, delivered a short speech. Other speakers were Judge [J.] La Buy, Attorney M. Drzemala, and Peter Kiolbassa. The speakers explained the Democratic party's platform and maintained that if the Poles wanted to gain influence, they had to unite and rally round the Democratic party, with which they were connected by tradition, self-interest, and conception of freedom. There were also English speeches.</p>
   <p>It was a splendid meeting, and no disturbances occurred. We are positive that all Poles in the Ninth Ward will vote for Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
