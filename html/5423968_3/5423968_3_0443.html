   <p>The "smart" mayor of Chicago, Mr. Busse, yesterday forbade the Chicago theatres to criticize or make a laughing stock of our wealthy people, such as Carnegie, Rockefeller, etc. The mayor stated further that "criticism in theatres of such wealthy people would create jealousy, after which follows the creation of anarchists." We think that our Mayor has become a slave of these "masters" and gives us this order, given by them.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, we would like to know if the Constitution of our country does not grant us the liberty of free speech?</p>
