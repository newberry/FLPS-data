   <p>The matter of bringing aid to the strike victims in Lemont, Illinois, is taking shape according to the program outlined in a recent issue of Dziennik Chicagoski. Although the attendance at yesterday's meeting was rather small, it achieved some very important results. The following is a report of the meeting by the committee's secretary, H. Nagiel.</p>
   <p>"In accordance with the announcement made by the temporary committee, organized for the purpose of bringing aid to and defending the rights of the Polish strike victims in Lemont, Illinois, a meeting of Chicago Poles was held in the School Hall in St. Stanislaus parish on Monday, June 19. About a hundred and fifty Poles attended. The meeting was opened by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, who explained its purpose. He pointed out the necessity of protesting against the crimes committed in Lemont, of bringing the perpetrators to justice, and, at the same time, of giving <span class="page-break">\2</span>material aid to the innocent victims. This is demanded of us both by any intelligent comprehension of national solidarity and by Christian instincts. In concluding his address, Father Barzynski called upon E. Z. Brodowski to preside over the meeting, naming the undersigned [H. Nagiel] as secretary. Mr. Brodowski repeated the purposes of the meeting and asked for a general discussion. Father Barzynski, A. W. Rudnicki, H. Nagiel, and others spoke, arriving at the conclusion that an executive committee should be formed, which would investigate the matter thoroughly. In view of the emergency, it is necessary also to take up a collection at the earliest possible time, and of course, to call another meeting which would be attended not by hundreds but by thousands of Poles.</p>
   <p>"Dr. Janczewski, who has just returned to Chicago after two days in Lemont, reviewed the conditions as he found them. He explained that the victims of the assault and their families are living amidst the direst poverty and that they lack proper medical care. Two of them, Jaskulski and Wojtanowski, need surgical attention; since it was impossible to perform the necessary <span class="page-break">\3</span>operations in Lemont, Dr. Janczewski arranged for them to be moved to Chicago, where they would be placed in a hospital at the committee's expense. The doctor asked the gathering to take care of these two unfortunates.</p>
   <p>"On a motion by Rudnicki, Maciontek, and Biniak, it was decided that an executive committee be named, and that the necessary collection be taken up. J. Mucha, E. Z. Brodowski, A. Kdinski, T. Krolik, Maciontek, A. W. Rudnicki, and J. Biniak made up the committee. The committee was made a permanent one and was instructed to go to Lemont for a close investigation of the matter, to raise the necessary funds for the relief of suffering there, and to arrange for the hospitalization of Jaskulski and Wojtanowski, who will arrive in Chicago today.</p>
   <p>"The collection, taken up immediately after the committee had been named, yielded $44.40.</p>

   <p>"In conclusion, it was decided that a mass meeting be held at this same hall on Sunday, June 25, at 7:30 in the evening. Appropriate resolutions will be presented for this meeting to vote upon. The chairman named Father Barzynski, Judge [M. A.] La Buy, and H. Nagiel to formulate resolutions. With this, the meeting was closed. An earnest desire was evinced by those gathered to render all possible aid to their stricken brethren; the best proof of the sincerity of this desire was shown in the generosity with which contributions were made to the collection.</p>

   <p>As we can see from the above report, the project is now well under way. If the committee takes action immediately--and we do not doubt that it will--the general public will lend its support. Our Polish public always responds readily to an appeal for a worthy cause.</p>
   <p>The executive committee organized itself after the general meeting had closed.</p>

   <p>A. W. Rudnicki was elected chairman; T. Krolik, secretary; and J. Mucha, treasurer. Krolik and Maciontek took upon themselves the duty of seeing that the wounded men, Jaskulski and Wojtanowski, are taken care of properly. E. Z. Brodowski and T. Krolik were delegated to go to Lemont to determine the exact state of affairs among the strike victims. The treasurer of the committee, J. Mucha, received the sum of $44.40 from the chairman and secretary of the general meeting.</p>
