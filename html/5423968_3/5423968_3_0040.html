   <p>Monday, December 5, has been set as the day for the strike in the Stockyards, according to an announcement issued by the secretary of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America, who is acting under the orders of the members of the union. At a joint meeting recently called 35,000 voted in favor of the strike, while 3,000 voted against it.</p>

M. Over 20,000 workers will leave their ranks of employment in Chicago. The entire number of strikers will reach a figure of 45,000.
