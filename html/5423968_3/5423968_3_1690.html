   <p>The Polish persuader of the Republican party, through the unfit talk of a greenhorn in his speech of yesterday, is claimed to be impressing on the minds of the republicans, the catastrophe and suffering of the people caught in the Iroquois theatre fire.</p>
   <p>He also advised the Polish people to vote for the Republicans. It is the least we can do, because the daily tricks of politics in this country are legitmate, but are not as crazy as the Polish National Alliance claimed.</p>
   <p>The English republican newspaper claims that on the first page of this Polish newspaper the illustrated story about the C. Harrison museum was copied and reprinted. It will take careful consideration and thought on the part of the editor, in this case, because it involves our prominent Polish citizen Peter Kiolbassa, thus it will be injurious to his social and business affairs.</p>
   <p>I am refreshing your memories, that when Mr. Kiolbassa was building commissioner, <span class="page-break">\2</span>American newspapers would always find fault and criticize him when some great mishap has happened. I admit that this is a kind remembrance.</p>
   <p>But this Polish newspaper adds, that the other newspapers were writing this at the request of our mayor Harrison, who wanted Mr. Kiolbassa removed from his office as building commissioner.</p>
   <p>What a foolish request. Who appointed Mr. Kiolbassa as fuilding commissioner? Wasn't it Mr. Harrison? Who during all this scandalous talk spoke in behalf of Mr. Kiolbassa, and kept him in office as long as possible. Wasn't it Harrison?</p>
   <p>After Mr. Kiolbassa resigned who defended Mr. Kiolbassa's good record and behavior; and placed him in a different office, so as not to jeopardize his own political standing. Wasn't it Harrison again?</p>
   <p>What kind of newspapers have we; that were constantly criticizing Mr. Kiolbassa when he was building commissioner. Now that an American is holding that office, <span class="page-break">\3</span>nothing is said about it. Nevertheless it is the work of the Republicans, but not the Democrats. Is this a warning to the Poles that in the future they must support the Republicans, not the Democratic party, also to refuse to support the Democratic Mayor, because in face of the Republicans scandals, he is supporting and striving to help Mr. Kiolbassa a Polish political figure.</p>
   <p>Is this the means of fighting the Republicans are using against the Democrats? What a foolish procedure.</p>
