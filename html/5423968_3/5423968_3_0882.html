   <p>Last evening two meetings were held for Alderman Jozwiakowski, the first meeting was held at a hall located at Noble and Blanche St., the second meeting at Sienkiewicz's Hall at Noble and Rawson.</p>
   <p>Tremendous crowds were present at both halls to support <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ld. Jozwiakowski for the good of the ward and the Poles.</p>
   <p>At the first hall were a good number of Kaszubs, who for the last two years have done everything possible to cause the downfall of our alderman, but yesterday they pledged their whole-hearted support for him.</p>
   <p>Many Irish citizens were present at Sienkiewicz's Hall, who were enthused at having the pleasure of talking to <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ld. Jozwizkowski. He thanked them for coming to his meeting in so great a number, and in return they guaranteed their heartiest support for him at the April election.</p>
   <p>From these meetings, we can visualize who the people want for their alderman, a man who is honest and we judge from their attitude that they are well pleased with Ald. Ozwiakowski.</p>
