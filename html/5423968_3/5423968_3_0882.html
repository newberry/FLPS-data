   <p>Last evening two meetings were held for Alderman Jozwiakowski, the first meeting was held at a hall located at Noble and Blanche St., the second meeting at Sienkiewicz's Hall at Noble and Rawson.</p>
   <p>Tremendous crowds were present at both halls to support Ald. Jozwiakowski for the good of the ward and the Poles.</p>
   <p>At the first hall were a good number of Kaszubs, who for the last two years have done everything possible to cause the downfall of our alderman, but yesterday they pledged their whole-hearted support for him.</p>
   <p>Many Irish citizens were present at Sienkiewicz's Hall, who were enthused at having the pleasure of talking to Ald. Jozwizkowski. He thanked them for coming to his meeting in so great a number, and in return they guaranteed their heartiest support for him at the April election.</p>
   <p>From these meetings, we can visualize who the people want for their alderman, a man who is honest and we judge from their attitude that they are well pleased with Ald. Jozwiakowski.</p>

   <p>From these meetings it is easy to think that the citizens of the 16th Ward are planning to show the whole city of Chicago that the most generous, capable, trustworthy and the best suited man for this position is one Polish candidate for re-election, Alerman Jozwiaskowski.</p>
