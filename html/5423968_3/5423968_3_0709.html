   <p>Poles who are American citizens should remember, above all, that they became citizens of their own free will, that no one forced them into it. They did that because the ideals of the free American Republic corresponded with their own viewpoint.</p>
   <p>Poles who are American citizens are really so with all their hearts. They come here to better themselves and after having a taste of American life and freedom decide to remain here and become American citizens. Their open-hearted, honest, Polish souls soon realized that the ideals that inspired Kosciuszko and Pulaski are good enough for us newcomers. Therefore the American Poles become citizens of this country without any reservations and do not expect to find this an alien country. They love America and their slogan is: "America First."</p>
   <p>By that slogan and principle they are guided, whenever they take an active part in the life of their adopted country. The welfare of America and American people lies near their hearts. They want America to be more powerful and better and for that reason they are proud of their American citizenship.</p>

   <p>American citizens of Polish descent consider themselves as sons and defenders of this country and are ready to sacrifice their energy and life for the benefit and honor of their adopted country.</p>
   <p>Today when the election time is near and when we must decide by our ballots who is most worthy and suitable for the public service: "Polish" citizens realize that voting is a very important and at the same time a very honorable privilege and duty of a citizen. Therefore they must think the matter over conscientiously and decide for whom they are going to vote and why they should vote for these candidates and not for others.</p>
   <p>In this important instance, important not only for them but also for the whole American nation, our citizens should take under a very careful consideration the following points:</p>
   <p>First: That the Republican Party is a party of the capitalists oppressing and exploiting the workingman, while the Democratic Party is the party of progress and freedom.</p>
   <p>Second: That the present candidate of the Republican Party, Judge Hughes, has been selected from the peacefulness of the highest tribunal of the United States; <span class="page-break">\3</span>that this candidate should be beaten (or defeated), if for only one reason and purpose, that is, that the party should not look for a political candidate in such a high place, among the most dignified assembly, the highest judges of the country. That highest tribunal is the last appeal in the country in all most important matters, and for that reason should be free from politics.</p>
   <p>Never in the history of America was a candidate selected from these judges because a judge who expects a political office will become partial and unjust, thus destroying the faith and respect of the people in the highest body of justice. That is why no American citizen, no Democrat and no Republican should vote for Judge Hughes. It would put the interests of the party higher than the interests of the country.</p>
   <p>Third: That the Republican Party always was unfavorable towards citizens of Polish descent, that it never did anything for them, even ignored and disregarded them. On the other hand, the Democratic Party never made any difference between the citizens born here and those who have become citizens by naturalization. The Democrats always appreciated the value of our immigration and when the Congress, due to Republican pressure, passed the law forbidding entry to the United States to those who are unable to read and write, President Wilson objected to that law by refusing his signature, or in other words he vetoed it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Citizens of Polish descent should bear that in their minds, when it comes to voting.</p>
   <p>Fourth: In case of a Republican victory we shall have a war with Mexico, war demanded only by those who want to grab the riches of Mexico, while, Democratic victory assures us the same peace and prosperity that we had during the last four years under President Wilson.</p>
   <p>Fifth: The Republican victory will give our country a government of the trusts, by the trusts and for the trusts in other words a capitalistic government which deludes with plausible promises of prosperity but ends with a panic, as we had in 1907 to 1910. On the other hand, a Democratic victory will give us a government of the People, by the People and for the People; rights and protection for the working men and assurance of steady prosperity. Furthermore, the country will enjoy peace and splendid legislation enacted by the Democratic Congress, under President Wilson's Administration. The legislation known as the Federal Reserve Act, the most important act in the history of American nation, prevents in the future time all financial and commercial panics by taking away the controlling power from the Trusts, which were masters of the situation under Republican administration. Just now President Wilson's government opened Federal Reserve Banks, under the President's direction for the welfare of the country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Sixth: That the Democratic Party was never prejudiced against the citizens of Polish descent; on the contrary, it showed its good faith and sympathy. It understood that the work of Polish working men contributed in a great measure to building the great structure of American wealth, that there are people among the American Poles who are able to serve the country efficiently. For that reason the Democratic Party nominated many Poles for high offices, while the Republican Party never did anything for the citizens of Polish extraction or only humoured them with idle promises.</p>
   <p>HOW POLES SHOULD VOTE?</p>
   <p>President Wilson, speaking to a Polish delegation, made a statement that he will not cease for a moment to care for Poland's welfare, who thru no fault of hers, was plunged into the sea of misfortune and blood. He tried continually through his ambassadors to arrange shipments of food from America to Poland, and when that failed, he wrote letters to all the kings and emperors of Europe himself, urging them that they should allow the passage of food for Poland.</p>
   <p>No one should wonder that in the hearts of American Poles there is still warm feeling and attachment for their old country.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Democratic Party shares with them these sympathies, and for this reason our citizens should have a very high estimation of President Wilson's endeavours for Poland and feel a deep gratitude to him who, during the four years of his wise rulership, took the side of the weak against the strong, the side of oppresed against oppressor, the side of the working man, the side of the people.</p>
   <p>What a great difference between the politics of Democrats and the politics of Republicans, who always, and without exception, with all the hypocrisy of a Pharisee, cared only for the interests of the Trusts and millionaires, and were against the working men and the people.</p>
   <p>All the above points and considerations will be taken up today by the Polish citizens of America and carefully thought over.</p>
   <p>These citizens have only one welfare in their heart: the welfare of America. They can give only one verdict. They, as honest people, as citizens and patriots must vote for the People's Party, for the Democratic Party. They will vote without any exception for President Wilson, for that great and providential man who saved us from war, assured better wages for working men and prosperity for the whole nation. For that candidate who is not supported by any foreign power, who follows the will of the honest and patriotic citizens, President Wilson, the protector of the oppressed and friend of the working people.</p>
