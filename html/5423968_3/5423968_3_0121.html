   <p>The case against the Lemont contractors has begun, thanks to the efforts of the committee which was appointed at a mass meeting in Chicago to take charge of the matter. Action was taken against the contractors Locker and Bibb, who were responsible for the slaughter of Polish workers. Both men are charged with the murder of J. Kluga, a young Pole. It was at the inquest into the death of Kluga that the testimony of the witnesses was most incriminating.</p>
   <p>The proceedings were opened by Attorney Max Drzemala, assisted by [Attorney] Donahue, of Chicago, and [Attorney] D'Arcy, of Joliet, where the trial will be held. Last Wednesday, Mr. Drzemala obtained warrants for the arrest of Locker and Bibb in Joliet. Both were arrested and later released under a ten-thousand-dollar bond.</p>
