   <p>Polish Citizens League in the city of Chicago at their last meeting passed the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>All Poles know that in Fifth Ward a Pole, Mr. Leszczynski, is seeking the nomination as alderman.</p>
   <p>All Poles known that Mr. Leszczynski is a true citizen and patriot, therefore he is one of their fellow-men.</p>
   <p>All Poles know that Mr. Leszcsynski is at all times honest, trustworthy and is, and will always be, a friend of the working man and the poorer class of people.</p>
   <p>All Poles know that the 5th Ward was never represented in the city council by a Pole.</p>
   <p>All Poles know that the other nationalities consider the Poles as uneducated and unfit to be elected as aldermen. Many times people laugh when they see a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> Polish candidate seeking any political office.</p>
   <p>Well, citizens of the 5th Ward, the Polish Citizens League is calling all the citizens of Polish extraction to be present at the polls tomorrow, election day, and regardless of what party you belong to, vote for Anthony A. Leszczynski for alderman of the 5th Ward.</p>
   <p>I. O. Iszewski, Pres., A. Judlaff, Vice-Pres.</p>
