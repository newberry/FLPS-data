   <p>Mr. John Czekala was born in 1861 in Rosek, in the province of Posen,Poland. He came to America with his parents in 1868 when only seven years old. At first his parents settled in Toledo, Ohio, but in 1872 they moved to Chicago and established themselves in Stanislawowo (the section around the St. Stanislas Church, in the northwestern part of the city).

   <p>In 1896 the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, appointed him to the St. Stanislas parish committee, of which he is still a member. In the political life of Chicago Mr. Czekala plays an important role.
