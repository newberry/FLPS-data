Smulski, Republican candidate for the office of city attorney, gave indications of the beginning of agitation to nominate Mr. Smulski for mayor in the year 1907. Great success for Mr. Smulski is indicated for the next two years in the office of city attorney.</p>
   <p>"His victory on the Stewart ticket by a majority of 17,506 votes, gave the polticians great hopes for a good and strong Republican ticket for the future. A few leaders of the party made it known that Mr. Smulski's popularity among all the people and his record in the past stand out as unblemished, and that upon this record the Republican Party, after his term as city attorney is over, will nominate him as candidate for mayor of our city."</p>
