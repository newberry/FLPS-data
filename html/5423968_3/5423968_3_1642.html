   <p>[Joseph] Petlak was born in Posen in 1878. When six years old, he came to America with his parents. At first he attended the St. Stanislas parochial school and later the public grammar school. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to politics, which he entered early in his life. He was elected to the Illinois State legislature for the first time in 1901. Since that time he has been steadily elected as a State representative in Springfield, and only recently he won for the third consecutive time; this is because as a member of the legislature he conscientiously represents the people of his district, and as a Pole he sees to it that no harm is done to us through the passage of unfavorable legislation.</p>
   <p>It is to his great credit that only recently, when the American jingoists decided to abolish parochial schools, which are conducted to preserve the spirit and the language of immigrants, and had the bill to this effect ready in the legislature, Mr. Petlak, seeing in it a blow to the Polish parochial schools, <span class="page-break">2</span>fought against it so valiantly that he, together with others, succeeded in defeating the bill. He was assisted in this fight by the generous help of his conationals, by the Polish societies, and by the Polish press.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petlak married Rose Nosek. He has one son, Edward, who goes to Lane Technical High School. Besides belonging to many American clubs, the Royal Arcanum and others, Mr. Petlak is also a member of a great many Polish organizations, among others the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish Alma Mater, and the Polish National Alliance. He is also president of the Democratic organization of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>A man of great popularity and a good worker, Mr. Petlak is liked and respected by everybody.</p>
