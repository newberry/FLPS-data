   <p>A certain Mr. Dolski, an agitator and a representative of the Polish socialists in London, has arrived here from New York. He has announced a great meeting to be held tomorrow in one of the halls on Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>What this agitator wants, and why he should come here, are mysteries.</p>
   <p>If he wishes to confuse our people with his socialistic dreams, then he is on the wrong track. Our people do not need socialism. Our people in America are Polish and Catholic--and besides, it is a long-known fact that the Polish socialists scorn nationality and patriotism, and blaspheme against our faith....</p>
   <p>So let us not permit Mr. Dolski to turn our heads with his agitation--and let him get out to "where the pepper grows".</p>
   <p>Even at the last national celebration in Cracow, our Polish people, with the <span class="page-break">\2</span>peasant representative Bojko, protested against socialists and their red banners.</p>
   <p>It will not be otherwise here!</p>
