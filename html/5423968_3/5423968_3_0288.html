   <p>For some time in the past, in Hearst's papers, especially in the Chicago Herald and Examiner articles have been written by many well-known correspondents, in which, if you read between the lines, German-Bolshevist propaganda is revealed. The authors of these articles are Jews from Italy, France, England and America; and are much like the journalistic, clown, Mr. Brisbane. They try to impregnate in American minds a view of an alliance between American and Germany, and between Germany and Bolshevik Russia. This happens to a very dangerous thought; and the fact that it appears in Hearst's papers proves that powerful Jewish interests are behind it. This power is trying to influence, above all, the senators and congressmen in Washington. Evidently this influence has accomplished its purpose, for Senator Borah, a Jew, suggested in his speech that lost German provinces which were returned to Poland and France, be given back to Germany, also, that American politics should favor the American-German-Bolshevist Alliance.</p>
   <p>Another senator, Mr. Reed, an Irishman, has violently attacked, in the senate, Mr. Hoover because, he dared to extend to Poland a credit for $24,013,000 for the purpose of buying food. Had this help not been given to feed 700,000 soldiers, the Polish government would not have dared to engage in war with Russia; and America could even then trade with Bolshevist Russia.</p>

   <p>The foregoing facts indicate very clearly that there exists in America, an organized, German-Bolshevist propaganda, supported by the Jews and the Irishmen.</p>
   <p>Senators Borah and Reed, do not, in this particular case act in accord with their own convictions, but are the tools in the hands of propaganda.</p>
   <p>Let us be on the lookout.</p>
