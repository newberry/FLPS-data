Arguments expressed with the aid of a fist lead nowhere. That is what [recently] happened in certain headquarters. Let us remember once and for all that only by co-operation can we accomplish anything. Resort to physical force in matters purely intellectual is unbecoming to a true Polish-American.</p>
