   <p>While the results of the primary election of September, 1918, are evidence of the sincere desire of the people to bring the World War to a victorious end, nevertheless they failed to fulfill the expectations of the Poles. Our people have failed to gain the very thing that they so earnestly desired. They did not gain what Polish honor required of them. Ambitions and petty local and personal differences disrupted our national unity. Our people have failed to achieve the necessary political solidarity, and in their blindness they have buried their chances for representation in Congress. The Polish element, embittered by such base conduct, will ultimately take energetic steps to expose the dissenters from Polish solidarity who abuse their authority. They will be deprived of their powers once their nefarious and underhand activities are brought before the bar of public opinion.</p>
   <p>Enough of this disgraceful abuse of our national honor! The betrayal of Mr. F. Koralewski as an individual would be insignificant were it not for the fact that his candidacy embodied the hopes of the Polish people to express <span class="page-break">\2</span>themselves in Congress through their own Representative. Let th<span class="gap">[gap]</span>se gentlemen who are responsible for this <span class="gap">[gap]</span>etrayal ask their own consciences whether they still have the right to expect the confidence of Polish voters. They had better retire from public life lest the embittered Polish voters <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the political scene once and for all. Thanks to these gentlemen, the Polish voters of a purely Polish district are entirely <span class="gap">[gap]</span> upon the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of Mr. Thomas <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. He is unfamiliar with our interests <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in the least concerned with our Polish national cause.</p>
   <p>Just words of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are also due to Polish Republican voters. They allowed an almost certain nomination to be torn from their grasp. It was unpardenable carelessness. They might easily have foreseen that the intrigues in the Democratic camp, which for the last several years have acquired an almost chronic character, would make impossible the nomination of a Polish candidate. They had an extremely well-qualified candidate who enjoyed general respect, and whose name carries no little weight in authoritative circles. With Mr. <span class="page-break">\3</span><span class="gap">[gap]</span> the Poles could easily have won the nomination and have saved the Polish national cause. Unfortunately, the Republican leaders were entirely indifferent to this matter. Their indifference allowed the nomination of Mr. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the disloyal Thompson faction, in a Polish Republican district. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, Polish Republicans, this does not reflect great credit <span class="gap">[gap]</span> you.</p>
   <p>The generally popular Republican candidate for clerk of the municipal court, Mr. John <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to gain the nomination despite the fact that his victory was said to be assured. It would have been better to boast less and to work more, and victory would not have been snatched from us. Luckily for us Mr. Frank <span class="gap">[gap]</span> gained the Democratic nomination for this office and in that way maintains our prestige.</p>
   <p>Among Poles, besides Mr. Rydzewski, the following have their victory assured on the Democratic ticket: Messrs <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. Nowak and Thomas <span class="gap">[gap]</span> candidates for country commissioner, Joseph La Buy and S. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> candidates for judge <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Joseph Petlak, and <span class="gap">[gap]</span> representative. Other results of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are as yet uncertain, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> is not complete. Mr. Albert <span class="gap">[gap]</span> nomination for State senator from the twenty-seventh <span class="gap">[gap]</span> district.</p>
   <p>Among our <span class="gap">[gap]</span> more received by Thomas Scully for the county court bench <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Anthony <span class="gap">[gap]</span> for sheriff. Adolph Sabath [Jewish-<span class="gap">[gap]</span> true <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the Poles, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the Democratic nomination for <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to Congress from the Fifth District.</p>
