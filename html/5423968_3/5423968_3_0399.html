   <p>The actions of the Polish Socialists' Aid Alliance are limited to the purpose indicated by its name.</p>
   <p>But the Aid Alliance of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> composed <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Alliance and of the adherents to the "Leftists", <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Lapinski, who came to the United States from <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and enlightenment of our proletariat.</p>
   <p>The work of the Aid Alliance is inclined only in one <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of the "Leftists" of the Police <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are connected with that party work in a very narrow field, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the local movement.</p>

   <p>Even the material help, which the adherents of the Aid Alliance can offer to the "Leftists", is not very great. According to the statement issued by the third conference of the Aid Alliance, only $479.70 was collected and sent to the Polish "Leftists" in spite of their best efforts. Their help can never amount to very much, as it is not sufficient to endanger the Czar by a revolution.</p>
   <p>Besides a few intelligent comrades, usually without work, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> are the working masses conscious of their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> duty to help?</p>
   <p>The duty of the Polish socialists in America is to work right here, to fight the present capitalistic system and belong to "The Socialist Party".</p>
