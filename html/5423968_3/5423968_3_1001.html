   <p>Despite the fact that there are from eight hundred to a thousand Poles in the 9th Ward (St. Adalbert's), the Poles of that section have had no success in politics. They have not succeeded in electing a single Pole to office, and in general they have not been able to gain any political advantages. The reason for this state of affairs is the utter lack of organization.</p>
   <p>To this end, a group of Polish citizens have started a movement to organize a Polish-American Ninth Ward Democratic Club. Last Sunday, at a meeting in Pulaski Hall, the Club was organized. It hopes to include all of the Democrats of the 9th Ward. The founders of the Club are Frauds Sowadzki, K. Zychlinski, J. Rozanski, G. T. Kozlowski, and K. Brukwicki. A great many people joined the Club immediately, and it is hoped that in a short time many more will do the save. A temporary committee was elected to formulate a constitution; its secretary is Mr. Sowadzki. The Club will be incorporated as soon as possible. Meetings are to be held every first Monday of each month, with <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>special meetings in cases of emergency.</p>
   <p>Even though the Club is but newly organized, it is already very active. It has called a mass meeting for April 3 at Pulaski Hall. Besides Carter Harrison, Captain Williams, and Judge Hughes, others to speak will be A. E. Gans, August J. Kowalski, K. Zychlinski, G. Kozlowski, and F. Sowadzki.</p>
