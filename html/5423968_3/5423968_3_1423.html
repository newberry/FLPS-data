   <p>While this publication has no intention of entering politics, or political controversies, it believes it is in duty-bound to point out the glaring injustice done the Americans of Polish ancestry in the matter of representation in public office. As citizens we should insist that our rights <span class="gap">[gap]</span> prejudiced for racial reasons by political leaders. It is our civic duty to take a more active part in politics, not for the jobs themselves, for few of us need them, but for the sole purpose of obtaining and retaining the recognition that our voting power demands.</p>
   <p>"The Chicago Society" is not and need not become a political organization to propagate active interest in that game, but should <span class="gap">[gap]</span>erve notice on political leaders whenever our element is ignored in the distribution of patronage. This rule should also be follwed in civic activities.</p>
   <p>We will never get anything unless we demand what we feel we are entitled to. We have been sitting idly by long enough. The time has come to begin, and we have started with our open letter. We will strike from the top of the list until we reach the <span class="page-break">\2</span>bottom. We will ask our local leaders in politics a few pertinent questions later.</p>
