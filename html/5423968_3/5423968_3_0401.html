   <p>The <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Socialists' Alliance in America has a history, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> has brought and brings <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and teaching them <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Polish <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Alliance did much work, especially during the revolution in the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> proclamations, and collected about $20,000 for a revolution in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> finally, it protected the organ of the Alliance, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Dziennik Ludowy.</p>
   <p>Hasn't the Executive Committee of the Polish, <span class="gap">[gap]</span> And has the Polish Socialists' Alliance<span class="gap">[gap]</span> No! Did it properly understand the needs of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by poverty to the land of America? <span class="gap">[gap]</span> working men and direct them into the proper <span class="gap">[gap]</span> local conditions and does it know to adapt <span class="gap">[gap]</span> no!</p>

   <p>The situation became worse after the split of the Polish <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Party under Russian Poland, when the Polish Socialists' <span class="gap">[gap]</span> by the Executive Committee of the Alliance, declared that it favored the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> faction. From that time on, the Polish <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Alliance practically ceased to exist as an independent Polish socialist organization the United States, since <span class="gap">[gap]</span> became a gropup of adherents of only one faction in <span class="gap">[gap]</span> under Russian Poland.</p>
   <p>This caused a <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in the Polish Socialists' Alliance. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> who sympathized with other factions, were excluded from the Alliance. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> members have joined the Socialist Party, others formed new organization.</p>
   <p>The decomposition of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Alliance was spreading very rapidly, due to the disorganizing direction of the executive Committee of the P. S. Alliance. It couldnot be otherwise.</p>
   <p>The sympathizers of the faction have won. All members, who did not <span class="gap">[gap]</span> with the faction, were "excommunicated" from the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Alliance, and the whole independent <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>organization became only an "aid society", a branch of the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>All attention was directed toward the old country faction, and the interests of our Polish working people in this land were given second place. This caused the downfall of the Polish Socialists' Alliance.</p>
