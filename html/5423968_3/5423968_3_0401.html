   <p>The Polish Socialists' Alliance in America has a history, and without doubt,it has brought and brings great benefits to the working people by enlightening them and teaching them the principles of socialism.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Polish Socialists' Alliance did much work, especially during the revolution in the "Czar's Empire". It conducted meetings, issued proclamations, and collected about $20,000 for a revolution in Poland, and finally, it protected the organ of the Alliance, Robotnik, against the red apparition of Dziennik Ludowy.</p>
   <p>Hasn't the Executive Committee of the Polish Socialists' Alliance done enough? No! And has the Polish Socialists' Alliance as an independent organization done enough? No! Did it properly understand the needs of the Polish working men, who were driven by poverty to the land of America? Did the Polish Socialists' Alliance curb our working men and direct them into the proper channels? Did it look closely into local conditions and does it know how to adapt itself to them? No, and once more---no!</p>

   <p>The Polish Socialists' Alliance did not fill the duties, which were required of it by the ideals of its organizers. This Alliance was going to gather all Polish socialists in North America under its banner, and unite all loose forces into one power, binding them into one great living organization. It did not, however, carry out its plans.</p>
   <p>It is a known fact that the Polish Socialists' Alliance, besides organizing the thirty branches, which are getting along very poorly, was not able to carry an agitation among the Polish working people. It did not know how to adapt itself to local conditions, and it could create nothing worthwhile from the raw material.</p>
   <p>The Polish Socialists' Alliance, not being interested in the wants of Polish immigration, could not draw into its ranks the large masses of common people. Getting a new member, who was not acquainted with the socialistic doctrine in the old country, was a rare occasion. THis is the best proof that the present Polish Socialists' Alliance did not know how, and did not try to supply the necessities of life of the Polish Proletariat on American soil.</p>

   <p>The situation became worse after the split of the Polish Socialist Party under Russian Poland, when the Polish Socialists' Alliance, influenced by the Executive Committee of the Alliance, declared that it favored the revolutionary faction. From that time on, the Polish Socialists' Alliance practically ceased to exist as an independent Polish socialist organization the United States, since it became a group of adherents of only one faction in Poland under Russian Poland.</p>
   <p>This caused a split in the Polish Socialists' Alliance. Comrades, who sympathized with other factions, were excluded from the Alliance. Some members have joined the Socialist Party, others formed new organization.</p>
   <p>The decomposition of the P. S. Alliance was spreading very rapidly, due to the disorganizing direction of the executive Committee of the P. S. Alliance. It could not be otherwise.</p>
   <p>The sympathizers of the faction have won. All members, who did not unite with the faction, were "excommunicated" from the P. S. Alliance, and the whole independent <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>organization became only an "aid society", a branch of the Polish Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>All attention was directed toward the old country faction, and the interests of our Polish working people in this land were given second place. This caused the downfall of the Polish Socialists' Alliance.</p>
