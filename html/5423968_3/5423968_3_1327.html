   <p>We again call the attention of our readers, and request them to call the attention of their friends and fellow citizens of the Sixteenth Ward, to the fact that tomorrow, that is, on Sunday, at 7:30 P. M., a political mass meeting will be held at Hall No. I of the school building, at Bradley Street. At this meeting a Polish-American Democratic Club of citizens of the Sixteenth Ward is to be finally organized, and a permanent administration should be selected. All will recognize the necessity of establishing a club of that type, but only a few wish to dedicate an hour of their time for a meeting called for this purpose.</p>
   <p>In view of the forthcoming political encounters, it is a pressing matter to organize a Polish club of that sort and it seems to be of such importance to us <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that today, in several columns of the Dziennik Chicagoski, we make separate notices of it.</p>
   <p>We have heard that several good speakers from amongst our elder citizens intend to speak at tomorrow's meeting. Last Sunday, citizens Adalbert Jendzejek and John Arkuszewski spoke rather convincingly on the need of forming such a club, and, in addition, on matters closely related to this, citizens Anthony Rudnicki, John Kortas, Thomas Krolik, Jacob Mucha, Adalbert Tomasik, Frank Murkowski, and others, voiced their views. The very opportunity for listening to and exchanging opinions in political matters should encourage many people to assemble.</p>
   <p>We were greatly surprised that these citizens were absent. They, who held or now hold political positions. It happens that from among those whom we have in mind, two were absent from the city and the others were occupied elsewhere. Tomorrow perhaps they too will appear. They are - But why mention their names? They know well who they are. We have mainly seven in mind.</p>

   <p>Citizens who possess their own property, and hence pay taxes, and who often complain that improper action is taken against the Polish real-estate owners by officials, that there is no one to act on their behalf and no one wants to intercede for them, save when some one does this for them out of courtesy, should be mainly interested in this matter. These real-estate owners who pay their taxes should enroll in such a club as soon and in as great numbers as possible. They can have, must have, and certainly will have gains from such an organization. As soon as the club is formed everyone will have to reckon with it: the politicians, officials, etc. The club will always act on behalf of a member of the organization and they must listen to the club when necessary. In the future, when the club is organized, it will not be necessary to tolerate injustices or run from one to the other, begging for intervention on his behalf. Only the club, as such, will take precautions that no harm befall any of its members. We would be greatly surprised if our real-estate owners were not to recognize this and failed to appear at this meeting, upon which their material welfare depends. There should not be a single absentee among the real-estate owners at this meetings <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>People may also belong to the club who do not as yet own real estate but possess sufficient political sense to have already become citizens, and intend to be good citizens. Everyone who believes that he is a good citizen of this country is desired as a member, and only those are not wanted who, knowing nothing about politics, make great commotions and create disturbances. There will be none of these among us, will there?</p>
   <p>Let no one think that "it will get along without him." Whoever does not wish to counsel or speak himself, let him come to hear and learn, because the welfare of all is at stake. The interest of every individual is equally to stake, as well as the general welfare. We can boldly state that there is no citizen of the Sixteenth Ward who would not be interested in this matter. The matter which is to be discussed pertains to every citizen, without exception; so, let everyone at least listen to what is discussed, since he does not wish to discuss the matters himself.</p>
   <p>Such clubs should also be formed in all the other Polish communities in Chicago.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Through the aid of Dziennik Chicagoski, all of them can constantly communicate with one another. In the Sixteenth Ward such a club should be most powerful. Everyone is confident of this, because the Poles are most numerous in this Ward.</p>
