   <p>This country with its constitutional system has no need to resort to the use of armed force or noisy upheavals and riots. All it requests is that the voice of the people express their will. This was proved during the 1910 election of public officials throughout the entire nation.</p>
   <p>The Polish newspaper Dziennik Zwiazkowy is free from political partisanship. It does not support any faction because our people know that it is not the party but the people who stand for honesty in this country, as everywhere else. It is possible to have people of unsavory character in the Democratic, the Republican, or even the Socialist party. Such individuals wish to establish a career for themselves; they have no consideration for their party's principles and are interested solely in their own welfare. Numerous examples of their behavior have been given on many occasions. They tend to prove our contention that "the party cannot safeguard the nation." A party is merely a certain group of people who are not in accord with the views of other groups of people. Whether the people of one party or another know how to govern better--that is a question. Individuals do not determine the fate of this nation, it is left to the will of the entire citizenry. In this country, the Republicans can be as ingloriously defeated as the Democrats, or even the noisy Socialists if they fail to conduct themselves properly and for the welfare of the entire nation. If a party to which the people entrust the fate of the nation is unable to cope with difficulties during a given period of time, it is removed and replaced by other leaders, who may govern better and more adequately.</p>
   <p>The election of 1910 proved that the voters know how to use their most formidable weapon (the ballot) in a proper manner and at a proper time. If the voters find that the leaders of one political party or another who have been placed at the head of the government do not measure up to their expectations, the voters turn them...out and look for more adequate people. That will happen to every party that places the wrong people at its head, and thus manifests inability, insincerity, and ignorance of the welfare of those who made possible the party election to public office. People are ...only people; regardless of what party they belong to, they can always work sincerely or insincerely in behalf of society. All programs, platforms and promises, are merely baubles to befuddle the naive. Unfortunately, in our social conditions we find that a majority of candidates do not aspire to public office for the purpose of serving the people honestly and sincerely; their principal aim is to gain a position and to amass money for themselves.</p>
   <p>Let us not be misled by mottoes, and ideals. They are likely to be false in a nation where every item is counted in dollars--if national politics are at stake, where these dollars may be gained so easily without work or great effort. Be he a Republican, a Democrat, a Socialist, or even an avowed Prohibitionist--every politician will strive to gain the most...for himself. Such is human nature, and it will not be corrected by time, because people...are only people in every profession, and it is useless to fight against this fact as long as people wish to live happily and enjoy life. The beautiful declarations of politicians in this country are misleading pilot lights that could bring about the downfall of man. Wherever there is no love of an ideal, no true love of a nation, and where application of the principle, "Love thy neighbor as thyself," is ignored, then there can be neither justice nor truth. Our people is a people of romanticists and dreamers. We are of the opinion that everyone is as just and right-thinking as we are ourselves. But he who looks into the local conditions and studies them thoroughly is compelled to admit to himself that there are no principles and true ideals here, but that a bestial battle for existence predominates. Everyone strives to place himself above others, even if at the greatest cost to his fellow man.</p>
   <p>America is a school for many, but a school that does not cultivate sound and healthy principles in the people. Dirty and abhorrent politics surpasses justice, and in this mire cannot be found the things which the heart and soul of a Pole so ardently desire.</p>
   
   <p>The recent political war of the Republicans with the Democrats perhaps has its principles and a sound foundation, but we cannot be assured that conditions in this nation would be better if the government passed from one political party to another. In America, everyone wishes to profit personally as much as possible, regardless of the party to which he belongs. There are honest people in public office, but there is a huge majority of evil persons, who must be irrevocably condemned by the voters if they do not wish to be robbed and degraded. A blind faith in any party, its programs, mottoes, and promises, indicates either the inexperience or the naivete of the citizens. We do know that there are people of various types in every political party--people who could work either for the welfare of the nation or for the good of their own pockets. Proof of this statement is seen daily and in abundance in the actions of the various officials of various parties. The people, therefore, should pay no attention to party--should not vote blindly in favor of political machines. The citizens should consider the candidate's character, acquire a general opinion of him, and ascertain whether he has ever been guilty of a criminal offense. Only after such investigations should a vote be cast in favor of a candidate.</p>
   <p>During the political campaign of 1910, our Polish people proved, at least in Chicago, that they know how to vote as sanely as the other nationalities. They manifested their political sense by their activity in the Twenty-seventh Senatorial District, where two Poles of both parties and three candidates of other nationalities aspired to the public office of state representative. The voters of Polish descent came very close to electing both Polish candidates. Had there not been such a Democratic landslide, both Mr. Pytlak and Mr. P. Rostenkowski would have been victorious. Mr. Pytlak, on the Democratic ticket, won by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Rostenkowski, a candidate on the Republican ticket, received a much larger number of votes than could have been expected at such a defeat of the Republican party. This means that Poles, voting to a great extent in favor of the Democrats, did not forget their Republican compatriot. This political cleverness was never present among us formerly, and for that reason the Poles were always ignored in politics. Today our Polish voters are taught to vote in favor of our candidates; they do not adhere blindly to party lines but cast their votes in favor of the candidates of all parties who, in their opinion, are best. Splitting of a ballot --that is, casting votes for candidates of various parties--was formerly unknown to the Poles. Today, however, conditions have changed, and when all our voters become well acquainted with political matters not one Polish candidate in Chicago will fail. The same will hold true in other cities where there are many Polish voters.</p>
