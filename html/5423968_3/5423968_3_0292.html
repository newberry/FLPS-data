   <p>The bolsheviks are introducing serfdom in Russia. Is that not ridiculous? No! It is an accomplished fact. It is the irony of fate. The bolsheviks abolished capitalism and established a dictatorship of the proletariat which will end ultimately in the slavery of the working masses.</p>
   <p>This has been very plainly indicated by a manifesto to the Russian people issued by the Russian Committee of Compulsive Labor.</p>
   <p>The manifesto reads that every able-bodied citizen in Russia will be classified according to his or her ability, registered and compelled to work. This means that the Russian government chooses a profession for everyone, selects a place where one is compelled to work, and appoints the number of hours. The basic minimum working day in Russia is limited to "only eleven hours," but the industries manufacturing transportation supplies have a 12-hour day.</p>

   <p>The so-called Soviet Factory Committees and Workers Committees have been abolished.</p>
   <p>That is what is going on in bolshevist Jewish Russia. Whoever likes that system should go to Russia and if he has no money for transportation he should apply to the American government and he will be shipped there absolutely free on the Ark of the Soviets. Let him enjoy the bolshevist freedom which shackles the arms and legs of every inhabitant.</p>
   <p>There is nothing extraordinary about it if we analyze the Russian situation carefully. When we have before us millions of fools who do not know how to live and cannot think, who look with indifference at their acquired freedom and the Jewish domination, who a thousand years ago asked the Normans, "Please come and rule us, for our land is large and rich but we have no order," such good-for-nothing jackasses and drunkards can be ruled only by the Russian Mahjka (whip).</p>
   <p>If the Jews would leave Russian society alone, there would be enlightenment and social order in Russia in short time, and also the understanding of the part that Jews are playing Russia, or the fall of the Jews.</p>

   <p>The Russians should down the Jews as did the Ukrainians, but the Jews prevented that by establishing compulsory work in Russia and ordering everyone to do that which is best a safest for the Jew.</p>
