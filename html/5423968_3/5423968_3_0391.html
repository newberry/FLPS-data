   <p>Taking an example of our comrades from Finland, who succeeded in overpowering disorder and uniting their forces into one single organization constituting a self-governing unit of the Socialist Party, we decided to unite our ranks and stand under one banner.</p>
   <p>By uniting all organizations which formerly opposed one another into one autonomous section, the Finnish comrades gained a great deal. For during the first year, right after the opening of the Finnish bureau in the Socialist Party, the number of Finnish branches has increased 93 per cent, and this membership 75 percent.</p>
   <p>This fact should convince us that after establishing such union, our organization would also increase in the same proportion.</p>

   <p>Now we will give you another example of factional misunderstanding. At the 11th congress of the Polish Social-Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia, the following resolution was adopted in regard to the Polish Socialist parties in Russia, the right and left wings: The 11th congress of the Polish Social-Democratic Party has approved a resolution of the executive committee which reads that because of the conflict between the two factions of the former Polish Socialist Party in Russia, our party will remain neutral.</p>
   <p>The comrades in the Austrian part of Poland settled this question of the party press very sensibly; while here the executive committee of the Polish Socialist Alliance of America has an unfriendly attitude towards Dziennik Ludowy, the first Socialist daily in America, which it has maintained from the beginning of its existence till this very day. The committee sees a red or yellow danger in Dziennik Ludowy for the Robotnik (an organ of P. S. Alliance in America). Let us take these resolutions as examples. We can allow this deplorable condition in our organization no longer. We must have an understanding among ourselves. We must create <span class="page-break">\3</span>a single, autonomous Polish Socialist organization; an organization whose program is adopted to local conditions, economic and political, and having a neutral attitude towards the old country parties.</p>
   <p>All business between the Polish section and headquarters of the American Socialist Party would be transacted by an interpreter but the organization itself would be managed by the executive committee according to rules printed in the circular.</p>
   <p>There would be a general committee represented by every state according to the number of the members in each state and finally, a general voting system for the members. The program of the Socialist Party would naturally be the program of the section.</p>
   <p>Matters of this kind will be taken up by a special convention, at which time a central committee from Chicago will present the rules and regulations of the project.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The members of the section could form aid societies for the purpose of helping factions in the old country. A member could send his money to any faction in Poland he wishes. By adopting such methods we could remove the cause of misunderstandings and hatred within our ranks, which nullify our mutual work.</p>
   <p>Only in this way can we come to an agreement and form a united front.</p>
