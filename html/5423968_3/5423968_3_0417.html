   <p>If any woman socialist were traveling around the world with a useless "bum", as Anna Gould is doing, the capitalistic press would undoubtedly shower her with uncomplimentary names, which would serve as food for people who like public scandal.</p>
   <p>The capitalistic newspapers would call her a licentious woman, a prostitute, practicing free love, etc., with an accusation blaming socialism for broken homes and advising authorities to stop such abominable actions.</p>
   <p>Evidently in the eyes of the capitalistic press only poor people are immoral and virtue dwells only among the higher social classes.</p>
   <p>This can be proved by a New York club, "The Four Hundred", where the first child, if there is any, is given an additional name almost every year, according to the impulse of the mother for contracting new marriages.</p>
   <p>Morality of the rich as a social class is so rotten that it stinks.</p>
