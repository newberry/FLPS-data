   <p>When I speak of salvation I mean the salvation of the working people from poverty, starvation, degradation and uncertainty of the future, in which they find themselves due to the capitalistic system or social order, which allows one group of people, very small, to grab land and factories and become masters of life and death of the other group, millions who do not possess anything.</p>
   <p>The salvation of the working people lies in knowing and realizing their own strength and in understanding that their interests differ from the interests of capitalists.</p>
   <p>Knowing that capitalists are the same, regardless of their nationality or religion, working men should not read capitalistic papers, but their own. The capitalistic papers lie to you and confound you. Sometimes they even ridicule the working class.</p>
   
   <p>Working men should read papers which protect working men. Such papers are Dziennik Ludowy, Robotnik, etc.</p>
