   <p>Our citizens should not neglect their duty as citizens, but should go to the polls tomorrow to cast their votes for those candidates to the judiciary whom they consider honorable and competent to fill these important posts. In our remarks we have listed the names of the candidates recommended by the Bar Association, an organization which certainly should know who the most suitable people are for these important posts. The opinion of so august a body as the Bar Association can serve as a criterion, because none of the citizens know the candidates as well as the lawyers do, since the latter come in daily contact with them; besides, members of the Bar Association would not want to risk their reputations by recommending unsuitable people.</p>
   <p>The polls will be open tomorrow from six o'clock in the morning until four in the afternoon; every citizen should go there during these hours and vote.</p>
