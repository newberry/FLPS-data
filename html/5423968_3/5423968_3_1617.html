   <p>At last the commissioners of the Sixteenth Ward agreed to hold an aldermanic caucus. Democratic voters may choose a candidate for Alderman of the Sixteenth Ward next Tuesday. Only one place has been reserved for this purpose, and those citizens of the Sixteenth Ward who desire to vote must go there. This caucus, however, is not official and will not be controlled by the law. Whoever is not acquainted with political tricks, will wonder why this preliminary election did not take place on the same day when a candidate for mayor was nominated, and why this election was not called under Crawford's Law. This question may be answered in the following way: This caucus was called by the commissioners of the Sixteenth Ward, who were elected by most of Polish votes. These commissioners, although one of them is a Pole, do not favor a Pole for alderman, and in order to assure a victory for the German candidate Sigmund, have set another day than the day of the mayoralty nomination for this caucus. This is one of the clever tricks which our high class politicians resort to very often.</p>
   <p>If this primary election or caucus were held together with the one for mayor, Sigmund would undoubtedly be defeated, because too many Poles oppose him. The commissioners of the Sixteenth Ward are taking it for granted that if the date of this caucus is changed to Tuesday, a majority of the Poles will not vote. Secondly, the polling place will be located on Milwaukee Avenue, right in the heart of the German neighborhood, where it will be very convenient for them to vote but where many Poles will not care to go. Sigmund will probably be nominated, even though he is not supported by the citizens of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
   <p>But this is not all, for this caucus was not called and will not be conducted under the Crawford's Law; therefore, it will be very easy to cheat. Anyone who cares will be allowed to vote, regardless of whether he lives in that ward or not, and the judges may cheat if they wish because no one will control them or make them responsible for their actions. The laws in this respect are inadequate. For this reason all Poles should take an active part in this preliminary election and vote next Tuesday, if they desire to express their will as the will of the majority of this ward. The address of the polling place will be announced later.</p>
   <p>We wish to remind you that there will be a political meeting at Schulz's hall next Sunday,at which the election of an alderman for the Sixteenth Ward will be discussed.</p>
