   <p>From the present election results for local offices, we received the following Polish nominees. From the Democratic party in the West Town section for collector, August J. Kowalski; in the South Town section for supervisor, Julius Piotrowski. From the Republican party, for alderman of the 9th Ward, Adalbert Lauferski. In the 16th Ward, greatly populated by the Poles, no Polish alderman from either party received the nomination.</p>
   <p>It is evidently satisfactory that all four Polish candidates are not rivals for the same offices.</p>
   <p>If we take peaceful means, and all work for the benefit of the Poles, we can then be assured and maintain the hope of victory for our "brother" candidate. Let us behave nobly and with dignity without mutual prejudices; vote for the Poles and rebuke everyone who urges you to vote for the benefit of others who harm your own countryman.</p>
