   <p>The Polish Fellowship League of Illinois has sent us the following resolution for us to publish in the columns of our newspaper:</p>
   <p>Whereas, by the death of the late County Commissioner, Albert Nowak, a vacancy occurred in the list of the Democratic County Commissioners on the Democratic Ticket, and</p>
   <p>Whereas this place, according to logic and justice, should be filled by a candidate of the same nationality as the deceased candidate, and</p>
   <p>Whereas the nomination in the last primary election of said Albert Nowak, although his name was placed beneath the ten city candidates is a patent proof of the desire of the voters of this nationality or race, that at least one of their own should be nominated and elected as County Commissioner, and</p>
   <p>Whereas the people of the race of which the deceased was a member are showing their dissatisfaction on account of the unfriendliness of some of the leaders of the Democratic Party in the meetings and in the press, regarding the intention of filling this vacancy by a person of different race, therefore be it Resolved. That we, the Managing Committee of the Polish Fellowship of Illinois, an organization embracing all Polish organizations and Societies in the City of Chicago and County of Cook, upon the order of said League, do hereby protest against the contemplated attempt to nominate for the vacancy caused by the death of Albert Nowak, a Polish American, a person of any other race, and ask that a Polish American man or woman shall be nominated to fill said vacancy on the Democratic Ticket.</p>
