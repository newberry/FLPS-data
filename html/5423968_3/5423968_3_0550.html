   <p>The term "enforced" brings to our mind an abuse committed by some who employ that word. We should be willing to discuss this, more particularly because it echoes daily in our ears at the meetings of societies; nearly every day we read in some periodical some strangely deduced notions arising from a false application of this word.</p>
   <p>"We are in a free country, and it would be contrary to the constitution of this country to place any type of enforcement upon its citizens." Such an argument we hear and read daily.</p>
   <p>It surprises us also that the most respectable editors of the most esteemed periodicals do not see the sophism hidden in this argument. Force is not equal to force and perhaps it might be proper to find two different <span class="page-break">\2</span>terms to describe two different types of "force", but because these as yet have not been found, consequently, we can describe them only by discussion. And thus, we must distinguish between a self-imposed discipline, that is, one to which we willingly surrender ourselves, or impose upon ourselves for the reason that we consider it useful--and a discipline imposed upon us by others against our own convictions and contrary to our will, and imposed by violent means.</p>
   <p>We are compelled to obey, for example, the enactments or laws of a nation. Although such an obligation limits our personal freedom, yet we acknowledge it as useful, appropriate and conform to it willingly, especially in this country, where every citizen indirectly participates in the government and himself contributes in the enactment of laws. [Translator's note: Line missing due to cutting of volume into form.]....is the enforcement of those enactments which do not correspond with our convictions since they were <span class="page-break">\3</span>adopted or enacted by the majority of a citizenry to which we did not belong. Let us mention here, for example, McKinley's enactment. Nevertheless, we even obey this law; we have adopted the principle once and for all that the decision of the majority shall be the law, and as long as the majority adopted the enactment of McKinley, we adhere to it, for the time being, although we are free to protest against it and we are permitted to try to convince a majority that it is improper and injurious to the nation--that it should be abolished and replaced with a more proper one. The person violating this law; in any manner is considered as a violator as long as it is a legal statute, and no judge, even if he were a most vehement Democrat, would consider the violation justified, or would declare the violator innocent.</p>
   <p>The same thing occurs with the associations that we organize among ourselves. These societies form their constitutions and their laws. Every article of these laws and these constitutions imposes upon the membership a <span class="page-break">\4</span>certain compulsion limiting their personal freedom; but every member of an association willingly subjects himself to this enforcement, because he evidently consider it beneficial when he wishes to belong to the association. This compulsion, ho ever, is not opposed in the least either to the constitution of this free nation or to the feeling of justice of every citizen.</p>
   <p>The enactments of Congress, in which the majority decides--even if they pertained, for example, to the editing of a society's news organ--are also compulsions of that nature. The members of an association acknowledging once and for all that the majority makes the laws, subject themselves to these laws, as long as they are considered useful by the majority. One is, however, free to write or speak against these enactments as being improper; an attempt to convince a majority that it would be better to abolish them or replace them with other laws is permitted, but it is improper to present them as "compulsion" in opposition to the civic freedom guaranteed by the <span class="page-break">\5</span>Constitution of the United States. Such enactments are not contrary to the Constitution--they are absolutely legal and if they limit freedom, then they restrict it as much as all the national enactments limit freedom.</p>
   <p>Consequently if we were to follow this line of argument, speaking only of compulsion limiting freedom, and wishing to be rid of it as being inapplicable to a citizen of these "free" United States, then we would have to abolish all the enactments of Congress, throw away the entire Constitution and say: "From this time let everyone do what he wishes." The societies then would have to disband and would have no reason for existence because the collection of dues could not be enforced. The associations, unions, communities, cities, states nations, none of these could exist. It is impossible to even speak about the abolition of that type of compulsion.</p>
   <p>"Freedom" in the United States, the freedom of every citizen of the country, depends upon something else. In the first place it depends upon this--that <span class="page-break">\6</span>one is free to write voluminously and hold sway in public orations on the propriety or impropriety of the activities of the government. That is freedom of press. Consequently, if one or another decree, one or another enactment is not agreeable to someone, he is free to discuss it publicly, explaining to others why he considers it to be improper or dangerous. He is free to endeavor to enroot his convictions among a majority of the citizens and by these means work for the abolition of enactments considered harmful to or improper for the country. It is sophism to underhandedly present these enactments as coercion not in accordance with the Constitution of the United States as long as they do not really violate any of the paragraphs of the Constitution.</p>
   <p>This freedom is further dependent upon this--that one is free to observe that religion which he considers best.</p>
   <p>It depends on this--that every man of more than twenty-one years of age, <span class="page-break">\7</span>irrespective of race, color or former social position, has the right to use fully all the powers of citizenship, that is, to take part in the government.</p>
   <p>Even freedom of speech, freedom of religion, civic freedom--all are limited because every writer or speaker, be it in behalf of some political party, or in the propagation of some denominational creed, is responsible for the effects resulting from his writings or speeches in so far as they may lead, for instance, either to bloodshed or to an injury to property or to endangering the life and safety of other citizens--then the author of such articles or such a speaker is summoned before the courts and receives his punishment, and the use of the phrase: "freedom of press and speech," or the argument that he only spoke or wrote in behalf of a political party will be no defense. That enforcement is useful and necessary; although the censorship does not exist, nevertheless it is necessary to use proper judgement in speaking or writing.</p>
   <p>The Moscovite slavery stands in the most extreme opposition to this freedom.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>There to criticize the errors of the government either by writing or speech is prohibited; the censor watches over every written word and frequently even the most innocent expression, words or articles are erased. It is prohibited to write, speak and it is almost unallowable even to think about that which the government decides. It is permitted to confess only the orthodox religion (at least the government tends toward that, in order to issue finally that decree, because it systematically persecutes those who are of a different denomination); a distinction is made between the citizens of various nationalities, limiting for some even the right of education, or qualification to certain offices, and for other so-called citizens, civic rights are almost nil in comparison to our rights, because the citizens as such do not participate in the government; further the majority does not rule there but only the minority which is, in many respects, reduced to a minimum, that is, to the caprice of one man.</p>
   <p>Consequently, in comparison with such countries, for example Russia, we <span class="page-break">\9</span>enjoy an extraordinary and great freedom here: but it is not unlimited and it is well that it is not. Even here we find that enforcement, in many situations, exists, but it is an enforcement that is either self-imposed or to which we surrender because it was imposed upon us by a majority of the people.</p>
