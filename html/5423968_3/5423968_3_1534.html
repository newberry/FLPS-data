   <p>When Carter H. Harrison was chosen Mayor four years ago, and the appointment of Poles to office was rather slow, the citizens of the Sixteenth Ward called a meeting for the purpose of sending a delegation to the Mayor for the purpose of finding out the cause of the delay. This delegation consisted of the undersigned.</p>
   <p>This group, escorted by Alderman Stanley Kunz, presented itself to the Mayor and stated to him that although not many political appointments had been made, they nevertheless noted that every other nationality was represented except the Poles. C. H. Harrison was somewhat astonished to hear this. He looked toward Alderman Kunz and said,</p>
   <p>"How come, Stanley? Didn't I give positions to three Poles?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The delegates informed the Mayor that the three individuals mentioned were Irish. The Mayor in turn said that Alderman Kunz had presented them as Poles.</p>
   <p>This is only one of the things that Alderman Kunz has done.</p>
   <p>The Poles should not listen to the haranguers who are agitating for an independent alderman who prior to the election is a Pole and after the election seeks friends among other nationalistic groups and often moves to another ward or leaves town.</p>
   <p>Stand by the regular Democratic party; support and vote for the entire Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>We recommend and support Henry Ludolph, who is the regular Democratic candidate for alderman of the Sixteenth Ward. He is a business man who <span class="page-break">3</span>is honest and a man of his word. That is why he is well liked by all who know him.</p>
