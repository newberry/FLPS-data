   <p>A mass meeting was held yesterday by the citizens of St. John Cantius Parish at the school hall relative to voicing a protest against the recent appointments of justices of the peace for West Town.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by I. Komorowski. Joseph Dabrowski was chosen chairman and Edward Niemierowicz recording secretary.</p>
   <p>Among the number of speakers were: Francis Bieszki, Joseph Gieszkiewicz and I. Komorowski. All agreed that the omission of Poles in the appointments for West Town was a grave wrong to the Polish citizens of Chicago. Each speaker urged that something be done about this while there was still time.</p>
   <p>The large audience that gathered received all speeches with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>The following resolution was adopted:</p>
   
   <p>"We, the Polish-American citizens who reside in West Town, are of the opinion that there ought to be at least one justice of the peace of Polish extraction appointed; so that our problems will be given a fair trial, which in turn will be beneficial to the courts; and that is why we beseech the Governor of the State of Illinois and the State Senate to assist us by appointing a justice of the peace who understands our language and customs."</p>
   <p>A committee of three, J. Dabrowski, I. Komorowski and John Brzezinski, was appointed to deliver the protest to the authorities, and to consult the previous delegation that went to Springfield.</p>
