   <p>In answer to a call, there was a large meeting of the English-speaking Poles held at the corner of Milwaukee Ave. and Noble St., last evening, and a Garfield and Arthur Club was organized.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by K. J. Malek, and Peter Kiolbassa was called to the chair. Messrs. Kiolbassa and Krzemieniecki made speeches in their native tongue, advocating the cause of Garfield and Arthur, and the result was the information of a club.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected:- President, Peter Kiolbassa; Vice-President, J. Krzemieniecki; Secretary, K. J. Malek; and Treasurer, Joseph Gillmeister.</p>
   <p>The club promises to be a strong one, if the enthusiasm of last evening can be taken as an indication.</p>
