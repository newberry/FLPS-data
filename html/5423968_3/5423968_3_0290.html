   <p>Two antagonistic ideas contending for world supremacy have made a battlefield of all nations. One one side we have the American idea, contending for the equal rights of man without regard to race, creed or class.</p>
   <p>On the other side Bolshevism born of class hatred, denies the equality of rights. The Bolshevik idea demands the destruction of class distinction by the sword. Under its regime every class, except the proletariat must ultimately perish. The American idea stands for the abolition of class distinction due to special favors. This is desirable and possible, but class distinction due to natural inequalities cannot be abolished except by death.</p>
   <p>Government cannot eliminate class distinction due to physical defects, nor to certain phrenological bumps which make one man a banker and another man a bum - which make one Bolshevist and editor, and another a sewer digger.</p>
   <p>Under Bolshevism every action of government is made to turn not on a question of right, of justice or principle, but on a question of class interest.</p>
   <p>The American idea is diametrically, emphatically and eternally opposed to Bolshevism--Marxian socialism in practice. Based upon class interest Bolshevism cannot recognize the rights of all people. Its very nature calls for repeal of the Golden Rule, the imprisonment of liberty, and the crucifixion of justice.</p>

   <p>Its record in Russia proves that Bolshevism is a cold-blooded conspiracy to dehumanize the human race.</p>
   <p>The American idea stands for loyalty to the whole race. Bolshevism fights for a class, and stands for a war of exterm nation of all except the proletariat. The American idea is blood brother of patriotism.</p>
   <p>Bolshevism is only another name for treason. One of these warring ideas is destined to rule America and the world which shall it be?</p>
