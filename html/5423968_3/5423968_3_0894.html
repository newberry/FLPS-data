   <p>Republican pursuaders are trying to induce the citizens, who are Democrats, to take part in today's Republican primaries and that later they can vote any way they choose. So we warn you Democrats don't let any one deceive you with these talks but show as citizens that you understand what you are doing.</p>
   <p>If you were to vote today in the Republican primaries, you would lose the right to cast your vote for the Democratic primaries, that shall take place this coming week.</p>
   <p>So beware! Especially those living in the 16th ward.</p>
