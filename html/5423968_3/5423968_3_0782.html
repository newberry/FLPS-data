   <p>Washington, D. C. - It happened the other day that some one who is closely associated with President Taft, mentioned the Polish National Alliance. When Mr. Taft heard those words he became greatly excited, jumped up, screamed terribly and flapping his hands fell down.</p>
   <p>It took a long time to bring him to consciousness. As soon as he opened his eyes he said: "You bluffers, you invited me to Cambridge Springs and at the conference held in Hotel Bartlette you promised my re-election by Polish votes. You liars, I do not want to hear that again for it would make me so angry that my big belly would burst."</p>
