   <p>A few days ago in the heart of the city of Chicago something happened which could not be called extraordinary, but which had a deep significance. A father of several children, Mr. Klementy, had been unemployed for a long time. Every morning he used to go to the city in hope to find some work. But it was all in vain. Everywhere he would get the same answer, "No help wanted," or "Drop in some other time". In vain he tried to tell them that his children wanted bread, needed some clothes. There was only one answer: "That is your business, we cannot help it." With unbearable heartache he used to return home to find his hungry wife and children waiting for bread. And this was going on for months. Finally the cup of patience overflowed. One evening Klementy got a gun and went to the house of his foreman, to whom he used to go looking for work. Without any explanations he shot the man down. Then he went to a second foreman and he killed him also. The police went after the unfortunate, and after a long gun fight he was killed. This is the horrible <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>story in short. The American papers writing about the case related above, tried to attach to it a criminal significance. They failed to notice any of the causes that had led to the murder. Yet, the most important is not the event itself, but the causes of it. This is a question of purely social nature and one could even call it psychological. It does not concern the prosecuting attorney, but a sociologist or a moralist, who is sensitive to the human soul. A man committed a criminal act not by his free will, but being influenced by the existing circumstances. In this case, the man being driven to full despair, to an extremity, decided to commit a criminal act. He decided so because he thought that the persons he had planned to kill were those guilty of his misfortune. The man was, no doubt, wrong. The guilty in such cases are certainly not some foremen, who themselves are at any time liable to lose their jobs, but it is the whole present social system which is built on the principle of hired labor. Every human being, as any other living creature <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>is born with the full right to live. At the present time nobody thinks of depriving a man of this right (because it is not human), but a man can be deprived of his subsistence, and this is considered to be quite humane. It is understood that so long as such a state of things will exist and so long as the majority of the population will depend upon the employers, social disharmony in some form or other will not cease to exist. There always will occur such sad events which will darken the joy of living.</p>
