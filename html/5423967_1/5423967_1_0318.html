   <p>A Russian intellectual who for a long time had not participated in the public life of the colony, when speaking to the writer of this article, complained about the strange attitude towards intellectuals which has become prevalent in our colony.</p>
   <p>"An intellectual is regarded in the colony," said this gentleman, "almost in the same way as a soldier who is bound by duty to perform military service. It is believed that it is the duty of an intellectual to give lectures, to teach in schools, to help organizing the colony, to write articles for the newspapers; but nobody cares to think about the conditions in which this intellectual has to live, about the remuneration which he gets for all this work.</p>
   <p>"The intellectual is regarded as one belonging to an inimical class. Some organizations think that when they invite him to give a lecture, they are conferring on him a great honor, and when the people come to <span class="page-break">2</span>the lecture first of all try to find in the words of the lecturer something to quibble about; they try to prove that he has selfish motives, that he is deceiving his audience, etc."</p>
   <p>It is not an uncommon thing to hear such complains uttered by intellectuals.</p>
   <p>Because of this attitude towards them, intellectuals give up all public work for the colony and become alienated from the latter.</p>
   <p>They say, "we reject the honor which you want to confer on us; we do not want to be unjustly suspected and insulted. We want to keep away from the petty disputes so common in the colony."</p>
   <p>And they abandon the colony.</p>
   <p>Progressive, clever workmen see in such occurrences a dark side of the life of our colony, something abnormal, ugly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Many workmen tell a different story.</p>
   <p>"Too many intellectuals who are just cheap politicians join organizations not because they want to teach us how to read and write better than we do, to help us increase our knowledge and to get better organized, but in order to disunite us, to instill into our souls love for an outlived regime, to show enmity among us and to foster in us a display for all those things which the workmen of all countries are struggling to obtain."</p>
   <p>There are also many in whose eyes any intellectual is hateful just because he has had the opportunity to get education and has more knowledge than they have. Such persons regard every intellectual as a "bourgeois," a crafty and selfish man, an enemy of the working class.</p>
   <p>To our great regret we have to acknowledge that there are some intellectuals who join organizations not with the desire to impart some of <span class="page-break">4</span>their knowledge to others, to raise the standard of education of the workmen and to strengthen the bonds that unite them; these persons have ulterior motives, harmful for the colony.</p>
   <p>But all this can be said only about a small group of intellectuals.</p>
   <p>There are many intellectuals who are sincerely eager to put at the service of the colony their knowledge, to help the colony to get organized; but owing to the distrust towards all intellectuals prevailing in the colony, such persons prefer to keep aloof from the rest of the colony, not to mix in the activities of its various organizations, and we seldom see them in our midst.</p>
   <p>This inimical attitude towards intellectuals, this distrust and lack of respect displayed towards them, has a very deleterious influence on the life of the Russian colony, This is especially so with our <span class="page-break">5</span>Chicago colony; on the whole there are very few men of knowledge and initiative among us.</p>
   <p>This unreasoned inimical attitude towards intellectuals is a heirloom of a historical past, when the masses were enslaved. This wrong attitude is especially unpardonable now, here in America, where a Russian intellectual, a "dude" who hates to soil his hands, is sometimes forced to endure greater hardships than an ordinary workman. Nobody can deny that for many Russian intellectuals who have a good professional education, it is much more difficult to make a good living in America than for plain workmen.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to eradicate in our colony this harmful spirit of hatred towards the intellectual workers.</p>
   <p>We must use all our efforts in order to increase the small band of men <span class="page-break">6</span>of knowledge who participate in the life of our organizations; we must apply all possible measures for the purpose of filling the gaps caused by the lack of intellectual workers in our colony. Whenever possible we should utilize the services of every intellectual who is willing to do any work in connection with cultural and educational activities that are being carried on in our colony. Thus the slumbering life of this colony of ours will sooner and in a more effective way be removed from that dead point where it is languishing now.</p>
