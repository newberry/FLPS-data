   <p>Mr. I. Okuntsov's lecture on Tuesday, Dec. 29, 1925, was fairly successful.</p>
   <p>About (one) hundred persons were listening to the lecturer, who was speaking about the unification of the Russian colony in America. He touched upon some dark sides of the life of the Russian colony, and pointed out the chief obstacles to our unification. He ardently advocated the members of the colony to get more education. He mercilessly branded hard drinking, to which many of the members of the colony are addicted. He also spoke of politics. "If we go into the game of politics," he said, "we shall never be unified. If we want to have success in our endeavor to be unified, we must leave alone politics. The non-partisan members of the colony will never join either the Communists, or the anarchists, or the Socialists. We can <span class="page-break">\2</span>become unified, and see the good fruits of our unification, in benefit societies and kindred organizations."</p>
   <p>After that Mr. I. K. Okuntsov made a stirring appeal for more reading of books and more study.</p>
   <p>After the lecture questions were asked and opponents formulated their views. Mr. I. K. Okuntsov gave clever and pointed answers to these questions and objections. The audience was satisfied with the lecture.</p>
