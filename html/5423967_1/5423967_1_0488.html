   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>This will advise you there is a strike on at the plant of the Russian newspaper, Rassviet (formerly Russky Viestnik-Rassviet).</p>
   <p>The strike was declared sometime ago by the Chicago Typographical Union No. 16, after the owners refused to recognize the union.</p>
   <p>In view of the obvious unfair, anti-labor attitude of this publication, scores of Russian societies, fraternal and labor organizations have passed resolutions condemning the publishers of the paper for their unfair attitude toward the workers and upholding the union men in their struggle for living wages and conditions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>At a district conference held a few days ago in Chicago in which sixteen Russian societies of Chicago, Milwaukee, Kenosha, Gary and other cities participated, such a resolution was passed unanimously.</p>
   <p>We bring this matter to your attention with a request for your sympathetic cooperation.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>N. Kozak</p>
   <p>J. Sleznik</p>
   <p>H. Petruchik,</p>
   <p>G. Baka,</p>
   <p>The Locked-out Workers of Rassviet, Members of Chicago Typographical Union No. 16.</p>
