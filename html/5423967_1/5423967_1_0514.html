   <p>The Russian Bolsheviki, having invaded and "conquered" the Russian cooperative restaurant at 1628 W. Division street, started immediately to eliminate the non-partisan Russians who are working in this restaurant, giving their jobs to Communists. Some of the former members left the cooperative of their own free will because they could not work under the rule of the new "bosses." The cooperative is now entirely in the hands of the Communists.</p>
