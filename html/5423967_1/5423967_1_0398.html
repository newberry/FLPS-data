   <p>The May 1st meeting in Pulaski Hall is reported as "unforgettable." The attendance is estimated an overflow by 1,000. Dr. Krasnow presided. In a few words he described the existing conditions, with all mankind involved in a struggle without precedent. "Those to whom democracy and love of their neighbor is dear should participate in the struggle. This meeting is the colony's first opportunity to prove to America that it is capable of appreciating hospitality - our first occasion to prove our loyalty to the American people who gave us shelter. The time has come, not for words but for action."</p>
   <p>Next spoke Ivan Erin. He vehemently appealed to the Russians to make the Liberty Loan a success. The Club "Znaniye," of which he is a member, had bought bonds for about $2,000.</p>
   <p>A chorus of twenty people from the Independent Society was next on the program. They sang several songs beautifully, among them "My Country," and the new Russian Marseillaise, "Tempests Hostile." The audience was enchanted by it all and rewarded the singers with long applause.</p>
   <p>An English speaker, a soldier recently returned from the war, also appeared. He told many episodes from the battlefield and it is to be regretted that many did not understand him. D. Orlovski spoke. His speech was of such fervor that in a moment of ecstasy he threw his pocketbook on the chairman's table.</p>
   <p>"Take all I have. I have subscribed already, but am ready to give all. Buying Liberty Loans we sacrifice nothing, we merely take a certain sum from our left pocket and put it in our right pocket, yet by so doing we perform a great deed."</p>
   <p>Next spoke the very popular M. Polak. But this time he surpassed himself. His speech was sparkling and sincere. In a few words he gave a picture of German heartlessness. But the central attraction at this meeting was A. A. Bublikev from New York, who was greeted very warmly. It was some time before this speaker could start, owing to the prolonged hand-clapping. Very skilfully,step-by-step the orator sketched the present state of affairs in Russia, economically and politically. He touched upon some details as to the reasons for failure of the Liberty Loan started by the late Shingarev, and finished his highly interesting speech with an ardent appeal to the entire Russian colony to help America with subscriptions to the Third Liberty Loan.</p>
