   <p>I happened to attend a meeting of the Russian Cooperative Society on Division street. It was on August 9, 1929. Quite a considerable number of people came to this meeting, and the discussions were lively. This is what I gathered from these debates: the society, or rather the cooperative was organized about seven years ago by non-partisan Russians. In the beginning there were financial difficulties; there were also many attacks on the part of the local Bolsheviki, who ridiculed the initiators of the society, calling them henchmen of the bourgeoisie and counter-revolutionists. But the organizers of the cooperative society did not pay any attention to these attacks as a rule, or, when it was really necessary, they would meet such attacks with the proper answers. As far as one could see, this enterprise was thriving tolerably well as long as no large amount of money had been accumulated. But as soon as this had happened our "comrades," the Bolsheviki, started an organized movement to join the society. When a certain number of Bolsheviki had become its members, they made an attempt to control the society. And as soon as they had succeeded in getting control, they captured all the responsible and most lucrative positions and began to spend the money that had been accumulated just as they pleased. Hundreds of dollars were given to the Bolshevist newspaper Novy Mir, (New York), or were spent on the campaign for the election of Mr. Foster to the post of president, or on the pioneers, and in general for Bolshevist propaganda.</p>
   <p>The financial report for the month of July was read. The gross intake was about $12,000, yet, strange to say, in spite of that there was not only no net profit, but even a deficit of about $400. The Bolshevist leaders attacked in their speeches some of the members for boycotting the cooperative restaurant and having their meals in private restaurants. Many of the members, answering these attacks, said that at the cooperative restaurant the prices were high and the service bad.</p>
   <p>The greatest excitement was caused by the discussion on admitting new members. The Communists, having noticed that many non-partisans were joining the cooperative and that this was endangering the Communist control of this enterprise, mobilized all their forces. The day before the meeting they had met privately at the headquarters of some Bolshevist "pioneers," and everybody was told to apply for membership at the cooperative. On the day of the meeting sixteen new Communists were accepted as members. At the head of these were Stolar, Deviatkin and Morel. When the Jewish names of these three Communists were mentioned they aroused particularly strong protests. Voices were heard saying, "But these are the very men who tried to interfere with the organization of cooperatives. They opposed us, and now you want to foist them on us!" But all these protests were ignored. The Bolsheviki were now the majority and could have their own way.</p>
   <p>It was a sad spectacle even for an outsider to see how unceremoniously these Bolshevist ruffians were acting. But nothing could be done to stop them. Perhaps, after all, the organizers of the cooperative themselves were responsible for what was happening. If you have created something good, uphold it; do not allow drones to get into your beehive. It is not the first time that such a thing has happened in our Russian colony. The Bolsheviki have already ruined many useful enterprises, but they are unable to create anything that is good.</p>
   <p>I would venture to advise more care in the future with these "comrades," and shut the doors when they try to get into some organization.</p>
