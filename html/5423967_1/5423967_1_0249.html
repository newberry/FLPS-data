   <p>Last Saturday in the dictionary of Novyi Mir (The New World) there appeared another word pertinent to Chicago comrades. It is necessary to welcome such an improvement because it will not be so dull to read Novyi Mir, in which, besides such words as kulak (well-to-do farmer), burjuy (bourgeois), podchalim (plunderer), and belogvardeets (white guard), the word chernosotenets (Black Hundreder) appears.</p>
   <p>Knowing the intellectual level of the correspondents of Novyi Mir. we can delight in this word and have to count it as a colossal success for them. The most important thing is that those correspondents select words which are very appropriate to themselves.</p>
   <p>We will analyze the word chernosotenets, alias pogromshchik (plunderer).</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Chiefly this word means: a person who tries in every way possible, even by the use of physical force to destroy or annihilate any person who thinks differently.</p>
   <p>In the U. S. S. R. any party other than the Communist party is strictly forbidden. Freedom of speech exists only in singing the glorified song to "God" Lenin and his viceroy Stalin. To teach any religion except communism is also strictly forbidden, etc. But what goes on on the other side of the ocean, in Russia, is difficult to prove accurately here. [Therefore] we will describe for instance the activities of the so-called communists in Chicago.</p>
   <p>How much work have they done to destroy their adversaries? These chernosotentsi have attacked broad-minded people and several times beat them up. Others were kicked downstairs only because of their convictions. Very often [the communists] entered the meetings of opposition groups and used all sorts <span class="page-break">\3</span>of force to break up the assembly, and to deny to others the opportunity to speak. They invented any kind of a lie against the people in the other camp, to discredit them before the Russian colony. They are guilty of every kind of vile conduct. All of this only proves that the comrades-communists are the only genuine plunderers, black-guarders, that the nickname chernosotenets becomes them more than it does anyone else.</p>
   <p>No, comrades-communists, you are the genuine chernosotentsi, cleverer than Purishkevichs or Krushevans. You even surpass them in the insolence of your unscrupulous principals.</p>
   <p>Certainly any art improves gradually, and you, the pupils of the plunderers, stand much higher than your teachers.</p>
   <p>You started the fight against Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), Russkoe Ob'edinennoe Obshchestvo <span class="page-break">\4</span>Vzaimopomoshchi (Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society), Russkoe Narodnoe Obshehestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (Russian People's Mutual Aid Society), and other Russian organizations. You succeeded in taking over one of them,and partly destroying another. The RNzOV you "placed under martial law", which profited no one, except that it overburdened the main committee of the RNzOV. But we think that it is much better to fight than to pay tribute to strangers.</p>
   <p>We Russians very good-naturedly welcome different strangers. The strangers sometimes feel somewhat awkward about governing us, the Russians. There fore they invented a slogan: The Russian colony in America is mature and large, but it lacks order.</p>
   <p>And so from somewhere appeared Diviatkins, Shkliars and similar adventurers, who are trying to get the last hard-earned penny from our Russian workers under the guise of bringing order to the Russian organizations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Russians, we are ashamed that up to the present time we still cannot or do not want to govern our social obligations ourselves.</p>
   <p>Let us eliminate those strangers who do not have anything in common with the working people and who never were either laborers or peasants. Unite around the RNzOV--the genuine Russian National Workers Mutual Aid Society in the Central States. This organization is developing and is marching in harmony with the requirements of the contemporary era; its main goal is the social welfare and unification of all the Russians in America. It strives to raise our good Russiah name to its proper and deserved height.</p>
