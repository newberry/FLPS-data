   <p>This article is intended for readers of Rassviet, who are interested in the subject of self-education and have not the time to attend high school and college.</p>
   <p>Before explaining briefly the social meaning of the article, I shall answer, for the benefit of the readers, the following questions:</p>
   <p>(1) What is education? (2) Why is it important?</p>
   <p>Personal education, as generally understood, is the cultural, mental and spiritual development of man. If one follows only some particular line of study, he can be called a specialist, but not necessarily an educated man. It is estimated, that even in our 20th century, the number of specialists exceeds ten times the number of men possessing a general education. Education is very essential to every man. It develops the understanding of the human being above the state of savage beasts. It makes possible an adjustment of social order, such as would serve for the protection of human rights and social and economic justice. The ideal social life should be: freedom, equality and brotherhood.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Education may be classified into three groups: (1) literary, (2) general enlightment, (3) scholastic attainment.</p>
   <p>Literacy is gained through elementary courses; enlightenment through study in intermediate schools, such as high schools and academies, and scholarly knowledge is acquired at universities, colleges and similar institutions of higher learning.</p>
   <p>The average man is not expected to possess 2nd or 3rd grade of schooling. Most men limit the course to the first group, that of Public school. Many of the average people are still illiterate.</p>
   <p>This social inequality existed for many centuries, and was the one cause in creating the difference among classes. Educated men, when they acquire wealth rapidly, very often lose their conscience and exploit the uneducated classes. The consequence of ignorance is the exploitation of the people by those of superior knowledge.</p>
   <p>Usually in revolutions the minority was defeated by educated leaders, who <span class="page-break">3</span>had the support of the majority of the people. It is not necessary to mention the results of these revolutions. For instance let us cite as an example the Russian Revolution of 1917. The revolution was known as a proletarian revolution, made by the poorest class of people. For fourteen years the Russian proletarians struggled to become the ruling class. But Russia now, as formerly is governed by educated men, who constitute a minority selected by the Communist party, only to defraud the people who have not had sufficient education to determine the principles of social and cultural life. The minority rulers in Russia are comprised of only 1/130 percent of the one hundred and sixty millions of the population. This minority enslaved the Russians, for its own gain, and formed its army, fleet and its own police. The minority governs by their own arbitrary power, the lives of 157 million people, controls public property, tax assessment without the sanction of the people, and the allotment of large sums of money for propoganda, with the purpose of abtaining power over the majority of other countries and states. This minority prepared for world war, by erecting numerous ammunition works for the production of great quanities of war material, under the direction of prominent Russian and foreign scientists and engineers.</p>

   <p>It is possible to see the same tendencies in other countries of the world. The tremendous inequality in the education of the people, is the cause of it. It is true that we have another group of people, desiring freedom, equality and brotherhood for all.</p>
   <p>These are writers, journalists, scientists, and public workers, but their percentage is small compared with the great number of educated people, who lack the spirit of social justice.</p>
   <p>There is only one solution to this.</p>
   <p>In order to establish a general welfare in the world, we must adopt a broad educational program.</p>
   <p>Therefore every individual shoud devote his efforts to gain enlightment and culture.</p>
