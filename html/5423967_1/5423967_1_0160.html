   <p>In the newspaper Rassviet, there have been published many articles concerning the Russian-American youth. Running like a red thread through these articles has been the thought that in spiritual [intellectual] ways, the youth are leaving the paths of their elders, that they do not join Russian organizations, and that between parents and their children an unbridgeable chasm is being formed. Some parents also point out that some of the youth are influenced by neighborhood gangs, and begin to frequent taverns and become acquainted with the criminal world.</p>
   <p>In connection with this situation, the parents appealed to the youth and called upon them to form their own clubs and other organizations; to visit lectures and decent Russian entertainments, but all these appeals were in vain. Only the society Roov, in the eastern states, succeeded in organizing a considerable section of the Russian youth. In the other states, however, nothing has been <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>done, or almost nothing. Youth continues to go its own way, and pays no attention to the appeals.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that this phenomenon is a disturbing and pathetic one, but it is seen not only among the Russian immigrants, but among the colonists of all other nationalities as well. Even among the native-born Americans, the chasm between parents and children has been widening during recent years.</p>
   <p>At present this problem is no less disturbing to the native American than to the immigrant parents. The difference between the attitudes of the immigrant and the native American parents is that the first see the situation and try to correct it by appealing and pleading with the youth, whereas the latter seek to discover the cause of what is taking place.</p>
   <p>With this purpose in view, the civic organizations in the United States arranged a series of conferences between the old and young generations. Through the exchange of opinions, some of the main causes of the spiritual rift between <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>parents and children are clarified, and the virtues and faults of both generations are revealed. After these conferences, parents and children begin to understand one another better; they gradually find a common language. Consequently, the Russian organizations (in localities where such organizations do not exist, civic-minded individuals) should begin to arrange such conferences. In cities where there are several organizations, joint conferences should be called in order to reveal to the youth not the worst, but the best features [of the parental relationship], not enmity and discord, but friendliness and co-operation.</p>
   <p>At these conferences, parents and children should not be embarrassed or afraid of one another. They should state frankly the causes of their friction. Then the children will understand the backwardness of their parents, and the parents will understand the aspirations and ideals of their children.</p>
   <p>As a result, both will find ways and means to compromise, and will cease to be strangers to each other in their spiritual life. Then the youth will not loaf <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>on streets or ruin their lives in taverns. Young people will begin to unite and organize in order to promote the ideals of their parents.</p>
   <p>This is an extremely important and immediate task, and it cannot be postponed for any length of time. The sooner the task is performed, the quicker will parents and children go forward together in social and family life.</p>
