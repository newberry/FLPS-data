   <p>In the editorial of Rassviet the author is discussing the question as to which is the better technique of legislation - that existing under a dictatorial form of government or that of a democracy. He illustrates this by the example of the statement of the Senatorial Commission of Investigation of Expenditure, where it is said that the passing of the 18th Amendment cost $35,000,000.</p>
   <p>The author, not approving such a procedure of passing a law, doubts whether the technique of passing laws of a democratic form of government is better than that of a dictatorial one. Such an expenditure for passing a law proves that a very hard struggle was going on between those who stood for prohibition and their opponents. Consequently, the law had not behind it the will of a great majority of the people, and therefore could not be enforced in an effective way.</p>
