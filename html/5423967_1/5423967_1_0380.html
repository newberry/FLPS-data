   <p>On October 28, 1923, our great singer F. I. Chaliapin, who has (just) arrived from Europe, will sing at the Orchestra Hall. Later he will sing at the local opera.</p>
   <p>The American papers gave a hearty welcome to F. I. Chaliapin. To them his arrival is important only because his singing promises to give great delight to lovers of music. For us Russian immigrants Chaliapin's arrival is important because of other considerations.</p>
   <p>We see in Chaliapin not only a singer of extraordinary genius, but also an eminent representative of the cultured Russians, of which there are few representatives in America.</p>
   
   <p>Chaliapin's singing already has attracted for a long time the attention of the world. For a long time people have been used to only saying evil things about Russia. But when in foreign countries there appear Russian giants, scientists, singers, artists, musicians, painters, and writers, they make one think about the true Russia, not about Russia as it is painted by inimical correspondents.</p>
   <p>They (these Russian giants) acquaint foreign countries with Russia much better than do various diplomatic representatives.</p>
   <p>Welcome to Chaliapin, a genius among our singers!</p>
