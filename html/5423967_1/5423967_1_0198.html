   <p>The Slavonic Alliance of America, composed of members of various Slavic groups in Chicago who are citizens of the United States, held its meeting on Thursday May 17, in the Morrison Hotel. The representatives of Polish, Czech, Slovak, Jugoslav, Russian and Ukrainian nationalities participated in the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to unite all Slavic national groups in Chicago into one whole, for common action in the political, economic and social life of the United States of America.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Ketzlik, secretary of the Alliance for the Chicago area, opened the meeting with a brief speech on the aims and problems of the Alliance. He also mentioned that similar work of uniting the Slavic groups is now going on in other cities of the United States, such as New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and other centers of large Slavic populations.</p>
   <p>Mr. O. Kerner, the chairman of the Alliance, then made a speech in which he pointed out the opportunities lying before the ancient Slavic race of contributing much of their national culture to the young American nation. He also advised the Slavic peoples of the State of Illinois to unite and combine their efforts to win a better place for themselves and their children in the economic, social and political life of this great country. He called the attention of those present to the fact that the Slavic peoples living in the State of Illinois have a great numerical power, but need one strong organization if they are to use that power to good advantage, according to the democratic principles of this nation.</p>
   <p>The Polish nationality was represented by a group headed by Mr. B. C. Miroslawski, an orator par excellence. His speech, by its profound thought and matchless delivery, made a deep and lasting impression on the assembled representatives of the local Slavic groups. Like Mr. Kerner, Mr. Miroslawski gave a brief historical review of the Slavonic nations of the world, with special reference to their immense cultural achievements and cultural contributions to the common treasury of the entire human race. He urged all Slavonic nationalities living in America to form one strong union for the good of the entire Slavic race, saying that here in America there is nothing to divide us or to cause us to hate one another, but everything to unite us for common action in our common interests.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. Kishun spoke in the name of the Russian group. He said that Russian people in Chicago only lately have shown some interest in the public and political life of this country, and are very anxious to work together with other Slavic nationalities in this city for the better future of all Slavic peoples in America.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Smuk, who is engaged in organizing politically all the Ukrainian people in Chicago, made a brief talk in behalf of the Ukrainian group. Mr. P. Rozdelski spoke for the Carpatho-Ruthenian branch of the Ukrainians.</p>
   <p>Other members of the Alliance, mostly professional men--physicians, lawyers, and journalists of various Slavic nationalities--also made short addresses expounding the many benefits to be derived from one strong all-Slavic political organization in Chicago and elsewhere.</p>
