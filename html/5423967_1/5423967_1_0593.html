   <p>On March 20 and 21 in London a joint conference of the Socialist International and the International Federation of Trade Unions was held for the purpose of discussing the international situation, particularly with reference to the re-militarization of the Rhine province. The conference disapproved of the indecision of the League of Nations, particularly in the matter of applying sanctions to Italy, and adopted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"The joint conference of the Executive Committees of both organizations confirms its former declarations about the aggressive war carried on by Faseist Italy against Abyssinia and emphatically demands that the League of Nations without hesitancy or weakness shall continue to act to preserve the independence of Abyssinia as a necessary condition for the triumph of justice and peace."</p>
   <p>This very brief resolution bears witness to the fact that Socialists now are very little concerned with saving Abyssinia from the Italian highwaymen. The <span class="page-break">2</span>eyes of European Socialists at present are all centered on Germany, and to this country a long resolution is devoted. This resolution, however, cannot be regarded as a serious document, for in it, as in all Socialist declarations and writings, naivete, propaganda, demagogy, and bragging are combined.</p>
   <p>At the outset the resolution speaks of the militarization of the Rhenish province, which should be, the resolution insists, submitted to the decision of the International Tribunal at The Hague, as if Hitler would pay any attention to the Tribunal's decision. Then the resolution speaks of the affirmation of the principles expressed in the Locarno agreement and the necessity of concluding an all-around pact of nonaggression. In their resolution concerning the Italo-Abyssinian war the Socialists do not demand the application of sanctions to Italy, though as far as Germany is concerned, they show some warlike spirits. In connection with possible aggression on the part of Germany the resolution reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"A criminal assault cannot be prevented by moral preachings. To every one who <span class="page-break">3</span>dares to commit an act of aggression should be opposed an overwhelming force in the formation of which all countries should participate in accordance with a prearranged plan. In conformity with this plan the armaments of the individual countries should be regulated."</p>
   <p>The French Socialists adopt a more peaceable attitude. Their leader, Mr. Blum, in Populaire recently rejoiced over the fact that France did not respond by mobilizing to the seizure of the Rhine province by German troops. He wrote in his article that "military occupation of a demilitarized zone is defined in the Locarno agreement as 'an unjustified aggression' and as an invasion of national territory. The French government had the full right to regard the crossing of the Rhine by the German troops as an act of aggression. But this is what was done, instead of handing passports to the German ambassador, proclaiming immediate mobilization, and demanding of the other European powers the fullfillment of their obligations in conformity with the Locarno agreement France applied to the League of Nations. This--proof of the deep changes that had taken place, as we affirm with pride--was done not without Socialist participation".</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Thus it appears that German preparations for war are being carried on not only with the knowledge but "not without the participation of Socialists".</p>
   <p>In the concluding paragraph of the resolution the London conference appeals not to the League of Nations but to Socialists and workers to crush Fascism. This is, of course, quite natural, for Socialists always have considered their movement as a colossus which can do anything and crush everything. Their resolution concludes thus:</p>
   <p>"We call upon workers to exert all their power in order that Fascism may be crushed everywhere and socialism may be the victor. We call upon all friends of freedom and peace to fight ceaselessly and energetically against war. We should strengthen the feeling of international solidarity. We call upon organizations supporting us to do everything possible to unite in a mighty effort all forces sympathetic with us."</p>
   <p>But this, of course, is mere propaganda. Just as the Socialist colossus could <span class="page-break">5</span>not have stopped Japanese brigandage in China and Italian brigandage in Abyssinia, so it will not prevent the brigandage of Hitler if he decides to attack other countries. For that reason the Socialist movement is nothing more than a colossus with legs of clay.</p>
   <p>The international proletariat, unfortunately, is also the same sort of colossus. It it possessed the sense and the power ascribed to it by the Socialists, the proletariat without any assistance from the League would be able to stop the war in Abyssinia and crush Fascism.</p>
