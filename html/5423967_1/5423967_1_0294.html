   <p>On the pages of the foreign press there are sometimes articles about the life of the Russian colonists in America. These correspondents describe the life of the so-called new colony. The old colony has already outlived that which the new colony is now going through. The ties that bound the old colony to the past have grown weak. The new colony, which as to the social status of its members and their way of thinking is very different from the old colony, is still living with the past.</p>
   <p>Here, for instance, is a letter from San Francisco, which was published in a paper in Harbin. The author, a woman, writes about the number of Russians living in San Francisco, their professions, earnings, etc.; then she says, "Everybody here is living for himself and thinks about the dollar. Every human being is relying on his pocketbook and has no need for friendship. It seems to be quite natural to the Americans, but not so for the Russians."</p>
   
   <p>"The life of the Americans is simple," says the author, "they finish their studies in schools and colleges and then they work in banks, offices, play tennis, golf and ride in automobiles. But we Russians cannot be satisfied with such a life, because a life like this gives nothing to the soul."</p>
