   <p>The page of the Rassviet devoted to the Russian "Independent Society for Mutual Help" has an editorial commending the work of the 17th branch of the Society in Chicago, and of the 19th branch which is located in Benton Harbor, Mich. The 17th branch had opened a school for adults, and the new 19th branch was organizing a similar school. The editorial explains how necessary such schools are, as they train members who will be able to do useful work for the Society and will be more conscious of their duties as members than those who have not had the benefit of improving their education in such schools.</p>
   <p>(Note. As far as I know the 17th branch of the Independent Society is located in Melrose Park, where about 1,500 Russians are residing. It is to be regretted that both schools for adults, mentioned in the editorial, do not exist any more. Only very few of the Russian residents appreciated the useful work these schools were doing. D.
