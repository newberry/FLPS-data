   <p>On April, 1925, there was produced in Chicago the operetta "Natalka Poltavka." This theatrical performance was organized by the so-called White Russian National Committee of the State of Illinois, or, to put it in a simpler way, by those seven members of this committee which constitute at the same time the whole organization and its committee.</p>
   <p>It had been said the net profit would be used for the education of children in White Russia.</p>
   <p>One and a half months have elapsed since the operetta was produced, and yet no report has been published anywhere.</p>
