   <p>While attempting to express an opinion regarding the so-called "New Deal," I wish to warn my readers that in my consideration of the problem I am guided by the economic rather than the political aspects, for it makes no difference, insofar as I am concerned, who are at the helm of the state--Republicans or Democrats. There is essentially no difference between the two after all. If some of the Democrats, particularly before elections, called their party "The workers' party" and the Republican party a "capitalist" one, it reminds one of the Bolsheviks who claim that the Communist party is the only workers' party and that all the rest are bourgeois parties; that only Bolsheviks are pure proletarians; and that all other workers and peasants are bourgeoisie and kulaks. But I touch this only in the discussion of the main subject of my theme--the question of the New Deal and its consideration from a worker's viewpoint, and what it promises to one who works.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In my opinion, the slogans of the present administration remind one of the Russian slogans proclaimed in 1917 when it was said that "land should belong to peasants and factories to workers," with only one difference: here they promise "a more equal distribution of the good things of life among the people". The result, however, is the same: the "people" get just as much as the Russian peasants and workers are getting. Despite this, the slogans of the New Deal remain as popular as the slogans of the Second Revolution in Russia.</p>
   <p>We were assured that the realization of the N. R. A. aims would reduce unemployment by five or six million men or by approximately fifty per cent; yet, as a matter of fact, we see that the number of unemployed men has not been reduced, and if it has been according to official data, the reduction amounted only to three or four per cent.</p>
   <p>Why does all this take place? The reduction in hours of work by fifteen or twenty per cent alone could have reduced unemployment by the same percentage, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and besides, they still boast that child labor has been abolished, and that the Government employs hundreds of thousands of men at its public works.</p>
   <p>This is why: First, the reduction in hours of labor from forty-eight or fifty hours to forty hours does not mean that employers have hired additional men to do the work. On the contrary, they devise all kinds of ways and means to perform as much work, if not more, in the shorter hours.</p>
   <p>Second, the N. R. A. cannot compel manufacturers to produce goods for stocks since there is no immediate demand for them. The demand for goods is lacking because the purchasing power of the people is falling instead of increasing, and the purchasing power of the dollar has fallen by forty per cent; whereas the wages of workers remain at their former level.</p>
   <p>Despite all this, the American people still believe in the genius of President Roosevelt, in his New Deal. They believe just as the Russian people did. As far as his genius is concerned, it has nothing to do with what happens.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Roosevelt tries to fulfill his pre-election promises for the sake of the party prestige alone, if not for personal glory. But we know that President Roosevelt is not an exception, and that many statesmen try to do some good for the reasons just mentioned.</p>
   <p>Not all of them succeed in this, however, not genius, but time and circumstances play the role in such matters. Let us look, for instance, in the not so distant past of the Russian people and we shall see that many men of genius have retired from the stage unnoticed, while some of the most inconspicuous people have advanced to the forefront. All this happened because circumstances did not favor the first and did favor the second.</p>
   <p>Let us consider Lenin's "genius" with his Marxism. We notice that while the time was not opportune he was not noticed; but, when the time came for demagogues to appear and ply their trade; when the Russian people, fatigued by czarism and war, began to look far away out of the predicament, Lenin became a genius and his Marxism appeared on the surface.</p>

   <p>The same happens everywhere, even in America. If all the slogans of today had been proclaimed by Hoover or Roosevelt in 1929, they would have been laughing stocks, and yet the same Democrats who were fighting the present modern slogans now wholly support the New Deal.</p>
   <p>But, as always happens, disappointment follows affection. Many people already realize that the New Deal gave nothing new. The same twelve million men remain unemployed. The three or four billion dollars thrown into the fight against unemployment and to help those that were idle has not changed the situation a bit. The only change has been in the number of government officials, which has grown to twice what it was in 1932. It means that the slogan proclaiming equal or a more even distribution of wealth among the people was used in vain, for capitalists and not workers continue to grow richer. The dream of reducing unemployment by means of the N. R. A. and the improvment of conditions for workers has not materialized, for the reduction in the number of hours of labor brought about only some physical relaxation but not a material improvement in workers' conditions. While reducing the hours of work, employers have increased <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>prices to the same extent and sometimes even much higher than such reduction justified.</p>
   <p>To clarify the idea I will cite an example of a worker who is employed. In 1930 he received twenty dollars a week for forty-eight hours of labor. In 1933 he worked only forty hours and received the same pay. It would seem that this worker is better off because of the change, as his hourly compensation has increased. Actually his economic circumstances remain the same. His stomach still requires as much food as previously, and the prices on all articles of food have been raised by at least twenty per cent.</p>
