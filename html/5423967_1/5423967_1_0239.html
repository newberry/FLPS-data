   <p>When you are caught in the whirl of our social life you look with pain in your heart upon the activities of our colony. How tedious, cheerless, desolate, and ugly it is. Our organizations are weak, lifeless, and very poor, spiritually as well as financially. The colony is scattered all over this spacious city. In its spiritual life some sort of emptiness is observed, as though it does not have a spiritual source, which would give it life. But really we are not so helpless. We have many talented and artistic forces, artists and other representatives of art; we have our press. Our Russian art is recognized by all nations to be the best. In the theaters, in the clubs, on the radio, anywhere and everywhere, Russian music is heard, spreading the enchantment of Russian melodies.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Foreigners, old or young, read Russian literature with profound interest. No matter how the foreigners stand with regard to the political situation in contemporary Russia, to its present administration, they value Russian literature and art and place it on its deserved height, according it due deference.</p>
   <p>The present day Russian immigrants, cast abroad by the present regime, brought with them a great and valuable cultural baggage. Our composers, actors, artists and literati, scattered all over the globe, showed to the world many things from their cultural treasury, of which the world had had no knowledge, or only a very vague idea up to the present time. We can even be proud before other nations, but: "Our country is spacious and abundant, but without order." We Russians are not organized properly. There is no solidarity. There is no mutual sympathy, we do not have patriotic sentiment; we do not place the preper value on our wealth, and without that we are weak spiritually and financially. Without it, not only can we create nothing, we cannot even support properly that which was created by our predecessors and contemporaries, the great <span class="page-break">\3</span>artists and philosophers.</p>
   <p>At the present time, we have begun to talk and write much about the unification of the Russian colony. The tolerant element in the colony realizes that to continue to live in such condition is impossible, because we will continue to remain behind; no one will respect us, because we only talk; we are not active, and our movement to unify the colony is very slow, uncertain, and shows considerable negligence. But this should not be! We need action; fearless, energetic, indicating faith in the knowledge that only by consolidation and organization can our social life strengthen and raise our colony to a height of due respect. Only then will we be strong spiritually and financially, when we are united, and have established large and strong organizations. "In unity there is strength"--says a Russian proverb (sic).</p>
   <p>We have had a very good lesson already. Let us take for example the unification of our mutual aid societies. We know what great benefit will be derived from <span class="page-break">\4</span>such consolidation. It is a great and necessary task, on a high plane, but it is far from finished; it should be continued. In our colony there still are many weak "independent" organizations, which should be amalgamated with larger organizations. The big organizations are: "Russkoe Ob' edinennoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi"--ROOV (The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society) and "Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi"--RNOV (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), and it is also necessary to consolidate them. The larger our organizations become, the stronger they will be spiritually and financially. There are also in existence many colonists, who at the present time are not members of the organization, or belong to foreign organizations, and whom we must bring into our ranks. The more we organize, the stronger we will be, and then we will be esteemed by the other nations, and our colony will obtain its rights in conformance with the civil and economic life of the country. Let us take as examples the Germans, Poles, Czechoslovakians, and others. We see how they have gained their rights in the City Hall and other institutions.</p>
   <p>We, Russians, have many good qualities, but the trouble is that we are too <span class="page-break">\5</span>obliging towards others, and neglectful of our own interests. We do not pay any attention when others frequently laugh at us, because we are too deeply anxious over the welfare of other nations, and at the same time, we do not take any care of, or create any good for ourselves. We are ready to support various adventurers, but we forget that our own brothers are dying from hunger, that the economy of our country is being destroyed, and also that the morale of the Russian nation is beginning to fall lower and lower.</p>
   <p>It is necessary for us Russians to think more about ourselves, to take proper care of our own welfare first, and then to go and aid others, as the other nations do. As far as the welfare of the activity of our colony is concerned, I wish that the initial act of unity may continue, that our social leaders and colonists to whom that work is entrusted, will attend to their commission seriously and respectfully, and bring to fruition, as soon as possible, the great deed of uniting the Russian colony.</p>
