   <p>The second convention of the Russian sections of the Industrial Workers of the World took place on May 3-7, 1920, in Chicago, with thirteen delegates representing about one thousand members.</p>
   <p>After the reports of the executive committee and of the delegates had been heard, the convention took up several questions, of which the most important was the question of aid to Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>Those who did not understand international affairs thought that Russia was in need of material aid, and the Russian colony was discovering all sorts of aid, except the most important one - that of creating public opinion so as to lift the blockade of Soviet Russia, to curtail the aid of the United States Government to counter-revolutionists who attack Soviet Russia, and the revolutionizing of American workers in <span class="page-break">\2</span>order to bring pressure to bear upon the administration and capitalists.</p>
   <p>The industrialists were nearing the truth when they passed the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Taking into consideration that Soviet Russia is in need of aid in order to strengthen her revolutionary conquests; that such aid might best be given by hastening the destruction of the capitalist society - such aid is possible only by revolutionizing the working mass and by organizing them into revolutionary industrial unions of the Industrial Workers of the World."</p>
   <p>On the question regarding our attitude towards Soviet Russia, the following resolution was adopted:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"In view of the fact that the suffering of the Russian workers and the struggle of the Russian leaders is the struggle of the industrial leaders of the world;</p>
   <p>"We, the Second Convention of Russian Organizations of the Industrial Workers of the World, greet Soviet Russia in her struggle against world capitalism, and hope that she will be the reflection and voice of the Russian revolutionary proletariat from poverty-stricken villages, and promise her unlimited aid in the struggle against world capitalism."</p>
   <p>A characteristic resolution was adopted on the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which had been analyzed over a period of years upon the pages of Golos Truzenika and was frequently discussed on meetings. The resolution reads:</p>
   <p>"Taking into consideration that the dictatorship of the proletariat is <span class="page-break">\4</span>confused with the dictatorship of the leaders;that this question is purely theoretical, as in daily life we are practicing workers' solidarity, by which we accomplish results, and in order to accomplish this, there exists a proclamation, "The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.'</p>
   <p>"That workers' solidarity is supported by organizing revolutionary industrial unions of the Industrial Workers of the World;</p>
   <p>"Therefore, we do not heed the theoretical basis of this question of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and aim to promote workers' solidarity by means of which the system of slavery will be abolished."</p>
