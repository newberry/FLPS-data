   <p>This article signed for Russian Immigrants, written in a rasping, biting style, It is another expression on the topic of Methods of organizing American Russia. The opening sentence is typical of the exasperated, but intelligent Russian. He arraigns the local leaders of the colony for their large intentions but small achievements.</p>
   <p>"Already for seven or eight years the idea of self-help organization, akin to the "Arbeiter Ring", has been hovering among the Russian laborers; many of them are members of Jewish, Irish, or German organizations", because one of their own is, as yet, non-existent.</p>
   <p>He does not deny the fact (as he sees it) - that the Russian immigrants, chiefly peasents, need an organization which would first and foremost help him materially. The Russian immigrant needs a job,needs practical advice, needs protection, language, then, in most difficult moments he needs assistance in cash.In this direction, organization should -<span class="page-break">\2</span>be steered... What nonsense to meditate on nationalism under such conditions. Russia has numerous nationalities, and if organizers will stress one to the exclusion or neglect of the other, such an organization will die at birth".</p>
   <p>Should the organization be ecclesiastical? Those who have such needs will be ministered to for a small consideration in Temples of religion specially designed for such purposes....The same may be said of the importance of political leanings in organizations.-- "I can be a socialist, an anarchist, a monarchist, a republican, and at the same time a member of a sport-club or be insured in any Insurance Company I may choose. Why cannot I, a socialist, be a member of an organization, whose goal it is to extend material and moral assistance to Russian immigrants"?</p>
   <p>The writer asks his compatriots why they could not accomplish, what Germans, Italians, Irish, Finnish, Letts, etc., have long since <span class="page-break">\3</span>accomplished... "It would seem that we alone are incapable of even imitating those others,- we are so busy caucusing, cursing or worshipping those worthless little deities, which we have brought along with us from our half-savage fatherland".</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the writer apparently somewhat relieved from the accumulated pressure, gives somewhat more moderate council saying, that "if an organization with far-reaching objectives is beyond the strength of those who started it why not be content with a more Bureau of Information, just so that you steer in the beginning for the strictly material needs of the population instead of cultural educational. Unemployed, hungry,--one thinks little of culture. Without anchor, entirely dependent on chance one does inquire into universities, but after some degree of material security. Schools, universities, -- they can only be next in importance".</p>
