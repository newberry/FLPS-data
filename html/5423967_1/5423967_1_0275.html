   <p>On January 30, 1928, one of my friends handed me a pink program with the following showy headline, "See Russia in Chicago." It contained information about an excursion organized by a certain Mr. Jenkins with the purpose of showing the "Russian Chicago" to the Americans. The excursion was to take place on Saturday, Jan. 28, 1928. The program and a large poster indicated two places where those wishing to participate in the excursion had to assemble: The University of Chicago, and Evanston. Next there follows the enumeration of the various items of the program. At 2:30, at the Chicago Commons, Mr. Karl Borders will answer all questions concerning what the Communists are doing in Russia. It is explained who Mr. Borders is. He is at present the assistant manager of the community house called Chicago Commons. Quite recently Mr. Borders has returned from Soviet Russia, where he was working <span class="page-break">\2</span>during two years in a Russian village, being the manager of the local kultprosviet (cultural and educational committee) of the Fund for the Recovery of Russia.</p>
   <p>At 2:30 P. M. there was to be read at the same place a paper, "The Progress and Present State of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat in Respect to Communism," by Professor P. Douglas. "Professor" Douglas, as is well known, traveled last year with a self-appointed American delegation with the aim of acquainting this delegation with the U. S. S. R. He is a Bolshevik par excellence, not differing in this respect from the many other noted foreigners who, after passing "a week less one year" (Note: Russian expression meaning a ridiculously short time. D. S.) in Russia, become enthusiastic admirers of the Soviet system for the Russian peasant.</p>
   <p>The third number on the program was a visit (at 4 P. M.) to the headquarters of the American Communist party. These headquarters proved to be situated at the very center of the Russian colony on Division <span class="page-break">\3</span>street, somewhere between the Russian Cathedral and the Russian Cooperative Restaurant. Here a certain Mr. Max Bedacht, who was one of the orators at the Ashland Auditorium at a meeting called for the commemoration of Lenin, spoke on the theme, "What is the Communists' Creed and What do they Want to Attain in Russia?" Comrade Bedacht is the manager of the cultural and educational committee of the 8th district of the American Communist party. The program kindly informs its readers that in the same house where the Communist headquarters are located there is also to be found a radical bookstore, where everybody can acquire all the Communist literature he wants.</p>
   <p>At 5 P. M. -- A dinner at the Russian Cooperative Restaurant (managed by the Bolsheviki). The menu is a special one: Borshch (Russian beet soup), stuffed cabbage, tea, and a Russian dessert, all that for 60 cents. All orders to be given by telephone to the above mentioned Mr. Jenkins.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>At 6 P. M. -- Visit to the Svyato-Troitsky Cathedral, 1121 N. Leavitt Street. Dr. M. Spinka, who is lecturing on the history of the Russian Church at the Chicago Theological Seminary, will give a lecture, "The Russian Orthodox Church." Deacon Ludogovsky will explain to the excursionists the ritual of the Russian Orthodox Church, which they will witness.</p>
   <p>At 7 P. M. -- Service at the Cathedral. The officiating priest will be Archbishop Theophil Pashkovsky.</p>
   <p>At 8 P. M. -- Russian festivity in the Russian Workmen's House, 1902 W. Division street. A Russian theatrical performance is announced, Russian balalaika orchestra, Russian chorus, Russian dances. Everything in the Russian spirit. After the program everybody present will have an opportunity to become acquainted with our Russian neighbors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The party breaks up at 10:30 P. M. The charge for the whole program is 50 cents (the food and the transportation are not included).</p>
   <p>I shall not expatiate on this excursion - organized, of course, by the Bolsheviki. Neither shall I discuss the personalities of Messrs. Borders, Douglas, Bedacht, etc., all pupils and hangers-on of the Bolshevist school. I want only to draw the attention of the reading and thinking part of the Russian colony to the fact that members of the clergy of the Holy Trinity Cathedral have found it possible to participate in this purely Bolshevist undertaking. How can such incongruous things be reconciled? How can it be explained that the Russian Orthodox Church, so venerated by the Russian colony - a church whose attitude towards the murderous fanatics who subjugated great Russia has always been an uncompromising one -- that the clergy of our Chicago Cathedral, with Bishop Theophil at their head, have been induced to participate in this purely Bolshevist excursion? That next to the names of Comrade <span class="page-break">\6</span>Bedacht and others of his ilk, next to the so-called Workman's House (known in the Russian colony rather as the 'House of Chekists') we find the name of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral? And you should pay attention to the fact that of all the numbers on the program, only one - the visit to the Troitsky Cathedral - is encircled by a black frame, evidently in order to serve as a bait, being one of the most interesting items. This illustrates the methods used by the Bolshevist agitators; here, in Chicago, they are using even the holy church for the furthering of their immoral and anti-social aims.</p>
   <p>In adulatory, insincere terms, the Communists who started this undertaking describe how "in this delightful service (in the cathedral) we shall experience a holy rapture when contemplating the marvelous, beautiful images of the saints, illumined by the glittering lights of hundreds of tallow-candles. How wonderful are the grand iconostases (Note: A partition adorned with pictures of saints, archangels, etc., dividing the place where the altar stands from the rest of the church.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>D. S.), the altar, etc. We shall witness the very same church service which was enacted in thousands of villages on the vast plains of Russia in ancient times, and is still being enacted at present.."</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviki see in the Orthodox Church their chief enemy: they destroy and split up by all possible means this very church there, on the plains of Russia. Yet, the Bolshevist organizers of this excursion, because they have to do with cultured Americans, not only promote the visiting of a Russian church, but invite the excursionists to attend a church service. </p>
   <p>One hundred and seventeen orthodox bishops (recognizing the authority of the patriarch Tikhon) have been exiled. Scores of thousands of priests and laymen have been shot, or exiled, or jailed by the Cheka. Who does not know all that? And, just in order to show to everybody that all these facts are garbled "by the accursed bourgeois press," the local henchmen of the Bolsheviki conduct the excursionists to an evening service at the Chicago Russian Cathedral: and attending <span class="page-break">\8</span>this service does not prevent them to go immediately after that to a Bolshevist den, I mean the Workman's House.</p>
   <p>One would like to believe that the clergy of the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity had no knowledge whatever as to who are the real inspirers of this Jesuitical program of an excursion to the Russian colony of Chicago. Let us hope that the priests of the cathedral will be more careful in the future and will not allow the name of the cathedral to figure on programs of such equivocal character.</p>
