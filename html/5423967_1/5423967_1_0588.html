   <p>To-day in almost all countries of the world First-of-May meetings and demonstrations will take place. But ironically enough the biggest and most imposing demonstrations, with all the characteristics of military spectacles, not of demonstrations of the laboring class, will be staged in Russia and Germany, namely, in the countries in which the mass of the working population finds itself in worse conditions than those that exist in many capitalist countries. Workers in most of the capitalist countries to-day will have an opportunity to demonstrate their power and through it to fight for better working conditions, but in Russia and Germany they will be compelled to participate in governmentstaged, cut and dried parades and to listen to the speeches delivered by party and government leaders declaring that they (the Russian and the German workers) are the happiest and the most contented people on the face of this earth. The speeches of these functionaries will all be alike in content, despite the fact <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that in Russia the demonstrations will be carried on under the socialist banner and in Germany under that of the fascists. And these, "the happiest and the most contented people," will have no opportunity either to tell the outside world just what are the conditions under which they are compelled to live or to demand any improvement in their lot, for such demands in socialist Russia or in fascist Germany are considered serious offenses.</p>
   <p>It should seem that for the workers of all the rest of the world the Russian and German experiments should be sufficient to convince them that bolshevism and fascism bring no good to the working people. But to our regret we do not see any general aversion to these movements among the laboring people. Workers in many countries even now continue blindly to follow the political adventurers who lead them not to freedom and a better life but to total enslavement.</p>
   <p>If we are to judge by the newspaper reports, in Spain they are about to repeat the events that took place in Russia in 1917, and that country is about to be plunged into a bloody and horrible civil war. The last elections in France <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>showed that many French workers are also beginning to believe and to follow the political adventurers instead of fighting independently for improvements in working conditions.</p>
   <p>All such shifts in workers' sentiments, of course, are greeted with glee by communists, socialists, and fascists, but they cannot inspire any joy in the minds of sensible workers and honest men who fight for the common good of the working class, for the consequences of such changes in workers' sentiments may be tragic. We need not go far afield for proofs of this statement. Every American and European worker with common intelligence knows what kind of liberation was brought to Russian workers by bolshevism and to German workers by fascism. A considerable section of the laboring class has taken and is following the wrong path, the path that leads not to freedom and a happier life but to chains and absolute slavery.</p>
   <p>And yet in this important phase [of development], when one should warn workers of the impending danger, there are people who close their eyes to the grave <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>events that are now taking place and who, persisting in their old habits, continue to assert that the working class is fulfilling an important historic mission. Thus, for instance, in to-day's issue of Rassviet A. G. Alexeev, just as one would expect a follower of Marx to do, heaps criticism on the intellectuals and says that "the working class, having sensed the course of history with the help of the Marxian theory, foresees at the end of that course its own liberation and joyfully greets the approach of an age of reason," whereas Berdiaev, our great compatriot and philosopher, sees [in all this] only a "reversion to the Middle Ages".</p>
   <p>This statement [of Alexeev's], of course, does not hold water. Nowhere, to our regret, can we note even the slightest signs of the approach of an age of reason, and there are no indications that the liberation of the workers is just around the corner. And as far as sensing the course of history with the help of Marxism is concerned, we frankly state that Marxism leads directly to fascism and not to an age of reason. Germany and Austria are the proof of this statement. Nowhere before the rise of fascism were there so many socialists and workers <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>who sensed the course of history according to Marx [as in Germany and Austria], and yet in these very countries, as if to disprove the whole theory and to make a laughingstock of Marxism, fascism reigns supreme and triumphant.</p>
   <p>And what kind of liberation the victory of Marxism will bring is well known to Russian workers. In this connection it should be noted that Marxism was victorious in Russia not because the Russian workers sensed the course of history with the help of the Marxian theory but because of other factors and quite by accident. That is why a general idealization of the working class does not at all correspond with the real situation and is, in fact, harmful. All people make mistakes and go astray, and in this number workers are included. For that reason the true defenders and protectors of freedom should point out to the workers their mistakes and their faults and warn them against approaching dangers, more particularly now, on this very day, which is considered the international labor holiday.</p>
