   <p>The Bolshevik sheet Russkii Golos (The Russian Voice) recently published an article entitled "Why We Do Not Go to Soviet Russia". This article was an answer to the many demands expressed in the anti-Bolshevik Russian press in America that those Russian communists in America who praise the Soviet paradise should leave America and go back to Soviet Russia. The writer of the article argues that the Russian-American Bolsheviks must not leave capitalist America at present, since the Soviets are not prepared at this time to receive Russian immigrants from America, and since Russia has no need for immigration, as it has sufficient manpower of its own to take care of its industry and agriculture.</p>
   <p>Not long ago, however, the Russian-American Bolshevik leaders were proclaiming at every meeting that the Soviet government would send ships to America to take home all those Russians who have red identification cards attesting <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their membership in the Communist party. Now then, since when have the Russian people in America been told that they are not needed in Russia and that they should remain in America? The answer is, since very recently. At last the Moscow lords have understood that even the Russian Communists from America, let alone the noncommunists, are not as good material for exploitation as the home-grown species. They realize now that the Russian immigrants in America enjoy a political freedom unknown and even unthinkable in Soviet Russia, and that they have a much higher standard of living than the Soviets could offer them. A mass return from America to Russia might prove troublesome to the Soviet government. Hence the sudden change of policy. Now the Russian Communists in America, and the Russian people in general, are being advised not to return to Russia. Indeed, the Soviet government recently issued a decree depriving of Russian citizenship all Russians living outside of Russia, thus making it impossible for the Russian immigrants in America and elsewhere to return to Russia.</p>
   <p>We regard these Soviet precautions against the return to Russia of the Russian <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>people living abroad as unnecessary and superfluous, because, in our opinion, hardly a single Russian, whether man or woman, now living in any foreign country would want to return to the Soviets. More than that: we can say with certainty that, if the Bolsheviks decided to open the borders of their country to free traffic, millions of men, women, and children would leave the country and the Red slavery in search for a better life in foreign lands. The Kremlin masters know this, and, to prevent the exodus, have sealed tightly all their borders. They have set an exorbitant price of five hundred rubles for a passport to any foreign country, thus killing all chances for the Russian worker to travel and see how people live in other countries.</p>
   <p>We would recommend, however, that all the Russian Bolsheviks in America who so flippantly and stupidly sing the praises of the Soviet masters go to Russia and stay there for several years, and live the life of the peasant or the worker. Let their own backs experience the pain of Red slavery. If they like it, let them stay there for good; if, however, they become cured <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of their blind Bolshevik stupefaction, let them come back to America to spread the truth about the Bolshevism among their Communist friends.</p>
   <p>The whole Bolshevik system is built on force and slavery unknown for centuries in any civilized country in the world. If, in the opinion of the Bolsheviks, the capitalist system is no good and is hostile to the interests of the workers, then Bolshevism is a hundred times as bad and inimical to all working people.</p>
   <p>The old Russian immigration came to America more than twenty-five years ago to find a better life and a more humane government. It found both. For these reasons, the old Russian immigrants and their children intend to stay on in America, however shocked they may be that the government of their mother country is trying to rob them of their nationality by taking their citizenship away from them.</p>
