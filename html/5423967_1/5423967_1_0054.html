   <p>Under the title "Entertainment given by the Humboldt Park School", Mr. I. Ph. Yerin gives a detailed account of this entertainment, praising highly the results achieved by the teacher, Miss P. V. Svatikova and the conductor of the children's chorus, Mr. V. V. Shunkov. He concludes his article with the following words: "On the whole, the entertainment arranged by the Humbeldt Park School has shown us plainly that our young generation has not been estranged from us old-timers. Our children still uphold, as far as it is possible, the Russian traditions and partake of the influences of Russian culture and art. We express our gratitude to those parents who try to instruct their children in Russian culture and art and who educate them in the Russian spirit".</p>
