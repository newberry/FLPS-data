   <p>In an editorial bearing the above title the victory of the opponents of prohibition in Pennsylvania in connection with the senatorial elections of 1926 is discussed. The author of the editorial expresses the view that the "dry law" has not diminished drunkenness, but, on the contrary, has even increased it. This law has created an army of prohibition agents, but they have been unable to transform drunkards into total abstainers against their will. The author also expresses the opinion that the "dry" law, by creating the illegal professions of producers of "moonshine" and bootleggers, has thereby given occasion to the committing of numerous monstrous crimes.</p>
