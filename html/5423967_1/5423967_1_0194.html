   <p>Russian and Ukrainian communists of Chicago held their meeting to commemorate the death of their murdered GPU member, Sergei Kirov. Chairman Kutzko called the meeting to order and proposed that all those present should rise to their feet. The Ukranian choir sang "The International", the song which drowned the Russian people in blood.</p>
   <p>On a table at the front, they set a portrait of Kirov in order to impress somebody. After the singing, the floor was given to one of their itinerant propagandists by the name of Deviatkin, their key speaker. He began his seditious speech thus:</p>
   <p>"Comrades! We have not come here to lament Kirov's death. We have gathered here to demonstrate our solidarity against the bourgeoisie. We know that <span class="page-break">\2</span>Kirov was one of the leaders--a "shock worker" of bolshevism. The world bourgeoisie thought that by hiring an assassin for $5,000, they would not only kill Kirov, but would disrupt the ranks of the Communist party. They are mistaken, however; the Soviet proletariat follows vigilantly every step of the White Guards and guarantees the safety of the Soviet government. Do you know that had it not been for the Communists, twenty million Americans would never have gotten any relief? Thanks to the Communist party we shall soon have social insurance."</p>
   <p>This "windjammer" ascribes to bolsheviks services which they have not rendered and for which they do not deserve any credit. In the speaker's opinion, Kirov's assassination was in reality a bullet directed against the Russian workers. He does not want to say that Kirov's elimination is only the first step toward the liberation of the Russian people from the shackles of the bolshevik bandits.</p>

   <p>This pitiful windbag concluded his speech with an appeal to join the ranks of the party of bolshevik soul-wreckers. On this occasion he was so confused that he even forgot to chastise Rassviet, in spite of the fact that an attack upon the newspaper is the most beloved topic of Bolshevik oratorical virtuosity. Seemingly the assassination of commissars produces fear and a particular [type of] sorrow in the soul of all Bolshevik speakers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kushnir spoke in Ukrainian, after Mr. Deviatkin. He gesticulated constantly and said nothing that made any sense. The Ukrainians themselves have no wish to hear Mr. Kushnir, and, therefore, they do not appear at meetings where he is scheduled to speak.</p>
   <p>After the speeches, Mr. Eberhard introduced a resolution which the bolsheviks intended to send to the Kremlin for Mr. Stalin. When Eberhard had finished reading the resolution, someone called for an amendment to the effect that <span class="page-break">\4</span>if Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and other counterrevolutionaries had not yet been executed, they should be shot at once.</p>
   <p>At the same time a resolution was passed against Rassviet because of the newspaper's attacks upon Bolsheviks. The meeting was concluded by the singing of "The International", with the customary raising of the fists in the Bolshevik salute.</p>
