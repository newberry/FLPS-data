   <p>After several years of comparative quiet, a new campaign of agitation against foreigners is in progress. This agitation is carried on in newspapers, in various conventions, and in state legislative assemblies.</p>
   <p>This agitation against foreigners was caused by several circumstances, but the main cause of rising anti-foreign sentiment is the unemployment problem. When economic conditions in the country were normal, when there were no unemployed, when Federal and state governments did not have to spend enormous sums of money to assist the unemployed, there was no ground for such agitation, and foreigners were considered a desirable element. If they had been undesirable people, they would not have been admitted to the country--such people are being refused entrance now.</p>
   <p>But when the crisis came, the situation in the country changed radically.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>From that time on, Americans began to treat foreigners with suspicion, on the assumption that if it were not for the foreigners in this country, American-born workers would certainly be able to find jobs.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, discontent has arisen among the taxpayers; they are not dissatisfied with the foreigners who hold jobs, but with the unemployed whom they have to feed. They reason as follows: We have a whole army of our own unemployed, and yet we have to feed foreigners.</p>
   <p>It would not be so bad if dissatisfaction with foreigners took only this form. This would be mere grumbling, simple discontent, which would disappear with the improvement of the industrial situation, but there is one circumstance which often turns mere discontent into active animosity toward foreigners.</p>
   <p>This factor is the Communist party and its activity. During the past few years, it has been well established that the American Communist party, which is striving to overthrow the existing order of things, is made up mainly of foreigners. Foreigners who are Communists receive assistance just as <span class="page-break">\3</span>American workers do. Thus a condition is created under which Americans support, at their expense, those people who are seeking to destroy their social system and establish, by force if necessary, their own Communist order of things.</p>
   <p>But, since many Americans, as a result of misinformation, regard every foreigner as a Bolshevik (particularly those foreigners who came from backward European countries), they draw the conclusion that they must cease feeding all foreigners who have not taken out citizenship papers. They reason that if a foreigner has failed to become a citizen after having lived here for a long time, he is inimical in his attitude to the United States and its government.</p>
   <p>This, of course, is not the case. It is well known, for instance, that a preponderant majority of foreigners who are Communists have received their citizenship papers in order that they may enjoy all the rights of citizenship, and at the same time secure themselves from possible deportation to their native country. On the other hand, many honest and respectable foreigners, <span class="page-break">\4</span>for various reasons, have failed to take out their papers, and still remain foreigners, if only in name. In several state legislative assemblies bills have been introduced with the object of discontinuing every form of assistance to unemployed foreigners.</p>
   <p>If these bills are adopted, Communists will be little affected, and honest and industrious foreigners will suffer privations, and not because they do not want to work for capitalists, and, as a result, receive help while they live as parasites, which is Communist reasoning, but because economic conditions force them into circumstances where they suffer hardship and privations, and must seek assistance from the state.</p>
