   <p>Between Bolsheviks and Fascists, as we all know, an oral war is going on. This war, of course, cannot be justified by anything that we know about the contenders, for it is extremely difficult to discover any difference between Bolshevism and Fascism.</p>
   <p>Bolsheviks and Fascists look and act more like members of one and the same party, belonging, however, to two factions, than like two implacable enemies in two hostile camps. The fight between the two is perhaps being carried on only because each faction is striving to gain the upper hand. If they could once agree on this point, there would not be any dissension between them at all.</p>
   <p>This can clearly be seen from the fact that despite their unceasing oral war the "contestants" find themselves in the most friendly commercial relations with each other. Obviously both sides in this combat consider that politics is one thing, and business relations are something else again.</p>
   <p>Fascist Italy, as we all know, was one of the first countries to recognize the Bolshevik government. Prior to the Italo-Abyssinian conflict very close and friendly business relations existed between Italy and Soviet Russia. The Bolsheviks at that time supplied Italy with grain, oil, and raw materials, and Italy in turn furnished Soviet Russia with machinery and some manufactured articles and even sent specialists like General Nobile, who helped the Bolsheviks build up their air force.</p>
   <p>With the appearance of Hitler's dictatorship in the European arena it seemed that the trade between Germany and the Soviet Union would be discontinued altogether, for Hitler and other leaders of the National Socialist party called Bolshevism the source of all the world's evils and miseries. But this did not happen. Fascist Germany continues to carry on trade with the Bolsheviks in much the same way as Republican Germany did.</p>
   
   <p>According to the information reaching us from Berlin, Germany has offered to the Bolsheviks new credits to the extent of five hundred million German marks. Like the credits previously extended, amounting to two hundred million marks, which will have been used up by March 1, these new credits are for the purchase of German machinery and manufactured goods. The amount credited must be repaid in ten years.</p>
   <p>The semiofficial German organ, Der Deutsche Volkswirt, in connection with this credit arrangement writes:</p>
   <p>"Russia has always been a very dependable debtor."</p>
   <p>Along with Hitler's government German business circles are also very much interested in developing German-Soviet trade. Thus, for instance, another economic journal, Oest-Wirtschaft, expresses anxiety not only in connection with the falling off of German exports to Soviet Russia but also with regard to the diminishing volume of Soviet imports into Germany in connection with the decree promulgated by the Soviet government on January 16, which restricts the Soviet exports to several countries. According to this journal the stagnation observed in the Soviet exports to Germany is due to the inability of German exporting firms to satisfy the provisions of the Soviet decree.</p>
   <p>"It is quite understandable," writes this journal, "that such a situation can be corrected only through a new trade agreement covering Soviet exports to Germany and the purposes for which the proceeds thereof shall be used."</p>
   <p>In England for a time Lloyd George was the most prominent supporter of trade relations with the Bolsheviks; he repeatedly declared that one can carry on commerce not only with Bolsheviks but also with cannibals. In one of his recent speeches he declared:</p>
   <p>"I do not consider that carrying on trade with Bolsheviks is contrary to our morals. The time has come when we cannot confuse politics with trade. We prefer that those who want to buy and are willing to pay should have access to our markets, and we are willing to transact business on this basis."</p>
   <p>The same rule is followed both by Bolsheviks and by Fascists. This is the reason why they are enemies in the political sphere and friends in business.</p>
