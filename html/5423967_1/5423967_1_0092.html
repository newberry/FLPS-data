    <p>In connection with the beginning of the new academic year in our colony schools, it is well to point out which of our school books are more suitable, for instruction. There are several <span class="gap">[gap]</span> works, which <span class="gap">[gap]</span> my opinion are the best for our schools, by the existing <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. They are: 1) The Alphabet, by F. F. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, this book is well <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and very popular. The new edition of it, was published by the American Publishing <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, with the new orthography, new clear illustrations and on good paper. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Stories" for children by <span class="gap">[gap]</span> State Publishing. In addition to the above mentioned <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Copybook" by P. A. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and the "Atlas" <span class="gap">[gap]</span>. <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the first book you can easily teach the children the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> calligraphy. In the second book, there are pictures of our city and country life, which give the children an understanding of the old country. As a second book after The Alphabet, it is well to recommend the book Living Word by A. Ya Ostrogorsky, corrected with the new orthography and with added original pictures. Also, it has beautiful fragments of classical literature and copies of famous paintings of famous Russian artists such as <span class="gap">[gap]</span> and others.</p>

   <p>It is much more complicated as to grammar. On the new Russian orthography, there is not a single grammar in United States. There are Russian Publications on the market, but for American born children, they are difficult and not easily understood. Many colonists through misunderstanding are calling the new orthography "bolshevistic", but this is not so. The new Russian orthographic was worked out by the Imperial, Russian Academy of Science shortly before the Revolution, partly affirmed by the temporary government and finally carried out by the Bolshevics. The Bolshevics accomplished the things in which their predecessors failed.</p>
