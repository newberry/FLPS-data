    <p>In connection with the beginning of the new academic year in our colony schools, it is well to point out which of our school books are more suitable, for instruction. There are several school books, which from my opinion are the best for our schools, by the existing present conditions. They are: 1) The Alphabet, by V. P. Vachtierov, this book is well tried, known and very popular. The new edition of it, was published by the American Publishing Co. in Pragne, with the new orthography, new clear illustrations and on good paper. The first book after the Alphabet is: "The World in Stories" for children by V. E. Vachtierove, published by the Moscow State Publishing. In addition to the above mentioned books, it is well to recommend the "Russian Copybook" by P. A. Kushnirov and the "Atlas" by M. A. Trostnikov. By means of the first book you can easily teach the children the real slavonic calligraphy. In the second book, there are pictures of our city and country life, which give the children an understanding of the old country. As a second book after The Alphabet, it is well to recommend the book Living Word by A. Ya Ostrogorsky, corrected with the new orthography and with added original pictures. Also, it has beautiful fragments of classical literature and copies of famous paintings of famous Russian artists such as Zyukovsky, Riepin and others.</p>

   <p>It is much more complicated as to grammar. On the new Russian orthography, there is not a single grammar in United States. There are Russian Publications on the market, but for American born children, they are difficult and not easily understood. Many colonists through misunderstanding are calling the new orthography "bolshevistic", but this is not so. The new Russian orthographic was worked out by the Imperial, Russian Academy of Science shortly before the Revolution, partly affirmed by the temporary government and finally carried out by the Bolshevics. The Bolshevics accomplished the things in which their predecessors failed.</p>
