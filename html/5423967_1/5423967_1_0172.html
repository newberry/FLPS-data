   <p>In some respects they are right.</p>
   <p>The Russian parents of many children are illiterate; some of the parents are also "uncultivated." But this is not their fault, they have not been given any education. But the children do not take that into consideration.</p>
   <p>In this country children often treat their fathers and mothers scornfully just because these do not speak English. Often the parents have to listen to such reproaches as, "we are ashamed of you." And when the father or the mother of these children try to teach them something, the children sometimes tell them: "How can you teach us when we understand things better than you do?" And sometimes the parents are at a loss when they try to answer the children; they feel as if they, the parents, were guilty.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the parents do not understand their children, and the children do not understand their parents. And this lack of mutual understanding is the cause of many sad conflicts.</p>
