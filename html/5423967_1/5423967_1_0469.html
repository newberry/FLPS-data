   <p>The union of Russian workers (organized in 1907-08) was composed of political immigrants who did not know the English language and who lived for the interests of the revolutionary movement in Russia.</p>
   <p>Newspapers printed in Russian were not in existence, and it was necessary to be satisfied with newspapers from Russia.</p>
   <p>In the fall of 1907 appeared a newspaper, Russky Golos, (New York City), published by a former Socialist-Revolutionist, John Okuntsov, which gained the approval of the Russian colony. Immediately after its birth, this newspaper became the official organ of the Russian organizations, mainly, the Unions of Russian Workers. Consequently, Okuntsov became a typical businessman, and the direction of the newspaper changed in accordance with public opinion.</p>

   <p>At that time the Union of Russian Workers embraced all the immigrants. It was composed of anarchists, Social-Democrats, Socialist-Revolutionists, workers -all enemies of tsarism.</p>
   <p>A united front of this type would seem strange to a contemporary party worker, but considering the fact that the educational activities, aid and work of the Union of Russian Workers was all directed towards the overthrow of tsarism, it will become clear that this was possible.</p>
