   <p>In the Pogromnom Mire [The Novyi Mir, called sarcastically The Destruction of the World] a certain slave of Shkliar criticized me because I disclosed the life of the colonists in Argo.</p>
   <p>The correspondent of Rassviet (The Dawn), it seems, does not see the crisis and defends the capitalists. The correspondent wrote that the majority of Russians own their homes. "But who owns these buildings?" asks the Rabkor, Rabochiy Korrespodent (The worker's correspondent). "One or two decent workers, but the rest gain these houses dishonestly--by selling moonshine." How they gain these buildings does not matter, and does not concern me. But you are not pleased with such an answer, then permit me to ask you: On what theory did your Soviet Government open taverns and rob the workers and peasants?</p>

   <p>The communists of Chicago held a benefit performance for Novyi Mir and (extracted coins) raised money from the colonists with the help of moonshine. Are your school entertainments "dry"? No, everyone knows that. And so,you too are dishonest. What right have you to reproach the others? Furthermore you write that in Argo there are unemployed, and even there they are thrown out on the street.</p>
   <p>I agree with you on these facts. I wrote on the basis of information and statements received from residents of Argo. I talked to the residents and all of them told me that everyone was working. True, some of them stated that they are not working full time. In Chicago and other provincial towns conditions are much worse. Concerning the eviction of tenants who do not pay their rent, I want to put to you a question: What do you do with the member who does not pay his membership dues to your organization or the school assessment for the education of his children? You will retain him and wait for a time, and then will say to him; "Go, we do not need such persons, we need dollars."</p>

   <p>What does your party's newspaper do when a subscription has expired? The same thing. In the capitalist's country everything exists on a money basis. One who possesses a dollar is clever.</p>
   <p>The pillars of this system are already rotten and are tottering; it would fall quickly if the Soviet Government did not support it. And over there also money talks, and the commissars love it. You wrote that Monrell is with the working class, and that you respect him. The question is: Why did you remove him from your school if he is such a good friend? Indeed, you removed him for the reason which I mentioned before--he filled the children's heads with foolishness.</p>
   <p>It is also known to all that the Independents have their own schools; at present you have a teacher who is weak in Russian grammar. Soon you will discharge him too, because already there are complaints from the parents. You do not mention the most important thing, and that is <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>that I wrote of what former communists who have visited the Soviet paradise say, and declared that Chicago's Cheka--Chrezvichaynaia Kommissia (The secret police commission) forbids them to tell the truth. Here is what they say: "The present communist domination appears to be greedy, gluttonous, rude, and impudent, and the communists are robbing the peasants. Do not believe any promises of the communists because one cannot wash the communistic red-dog white [similar to: one cannot wash a blackamoor white]. The workers and peasants overthrew the government in 1917, hoping to liberate themselves from the yoke of the landholders, and the Tzar's reign, and to live in freedom, and in the hope that everyone would be fed and clothed. Rivers of blood were spilled for that great dream of humanity."</p>
   <p>But you, hangmen, destroyed all of that, and converted the working people of Russia into slaves, and what is more, here you are trying to deceive the workers. But your intrigues are useless; here we enjoy freedom of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>speech, and the press can unmask your vile machinations.</p>
   <p>You, the workers of America, you must lead the fight against the hangmen communists, for individual freedom, toward the creation of the true Russian nation. The worker's correspondent of Shkliar is very brave against the unorganized, but against the valiant organized Rassviet, he will be as meek as a lamb.</p>
