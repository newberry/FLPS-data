   <p>The Bolsheviks quite frequently assert that almost the entire population of Soviet Russia has got rid of the old petite bourgeoisie psychology and has changed into an immense army of conscientious builders of socialism. It is true that among party members and the non-partisan elements one sometimes finds "chiselers," greedy, selfish people, and even rascals but there are only a few such people, and besides, they are rapidly diminishing [in number] and will soon disappear from the socialist fatherland.</p>
   <p>In reality the situation is quite the opposite. No socialist psychology exists in Soviet Russia. No socialist sentiment pervades either the masses of the population or the communists themselves. Instead of the socialist psychology a purely capitalistic psychology is developing. In Soviet Russia, as is well known, the most privileged people are the communists who occupy high positions <span class="page-break">\2</span>and the prominent specialists. One of the correspondents of the Socialist Herald writes that these "responsible people" think as much of the masses of the people as they do of last year's snow. Such people now see to it that they have all the "little things" that give color to the life. They want to enjoy life to the fullest, holding all the trump cards, and their principal care is to make their personal life more comfortable. It is self-understood, of course, that such a psychology has nothing in common with the socialist psychology.</p>
   <p>Among the workers a similar "socialist" psychology is also clearly revealed. A correspondent of the same journal characterizes the present sentiments of the Soviet workers as follows:</p>
   <p>"Only three years ago they did not speak of money. There was no money-hunger, but there was cunning in the struggle to get something somehow in kind. At present money is the driving force and the great attractive power. It is the subject of never-ending talk. Now every one sees that it is possible without <span class="page-break">\3</span>concealment to buy in stores for money. Money! Money! Money! The chatter about money goes on on every floor of the Soviet buildings, from the Kremlin down to the lowest basement. Formerly, if one of the workers had heard that any one occupying even the most responsible position was receiving seven thousand dollars a month, he probably would have angrily cursed the name of the "damned bourgeois" who was sucking his blood and battening on it. Now we observe a different attitude. Masses of people are preoccupied with the thought that any one can make money if he is shrewd enough. This was the idea that generated the speed-up system known as Stakhanov's. This idea explains in part the desire of most young people to free themselves as soon as possible of machine work and to become engineers, technicians, doctors, agronomists, directors--in a word, anything but workers."</p>
   <p>According to the Marxian theory and the old Bolshevik platform there should be no money at all under a socialist regime, but in Soviet Russia, where socialism supposedly exists, money is everything. It is quite curious also that the Soviet youth, supposedly reared in the spirit of Bolshevism, manifests aversion <span class="page-break">\4</span>to physical labor. This youth thinks only of its personal interests and strives to get into the category of "responsible people".</p>
   <p>All this shows that the Bolsheviks did not succeed in re-educating the people in the socialist spirit, and what is more, the Bolsheviks themselves have caught the contagion of the capitalistic psychology and have become self-seekers and moneygrubbers.</p>
