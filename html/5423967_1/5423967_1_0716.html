   <p>The two years of the New Deal are historic years in the political life of the United States. It is not yet possible to draw any conclusions or to evaluate fully this period of daring and dangerous social experiments initiated by President Roosevelt. This will be done in the future, which today seems to be veiled in mystery. At the present time, America resembles a ship caught in a thick fog, its bearings lost. The ship is at the mercy of the elements. The captain and his crew are confused; the passengers are alarmed.</p>
   <p>Two years of the New Deal have wrought changes in the psychology of the people, and already it is possible to detect the alarming symptoms that appear only when the government and the people lose their equilibrium. What are the <span class="page-break">2</span>changes in the psychology of the people of the United States, and what are the new symptoms that appear on the horizon?</p>
   <p>Confusion exists even within the executive department of government. There is a lack of certainty in the efficacy of the new ideas on the part of the government, and a lack of confidence in the administration among the governed. This state of mind undermines the authority of the ruling class, and the country, as a whole, moves perceptibly toward the stage of revolution. The spirit of revolution grips a country when the people lose confidence in the government. Loss by the government of the state authority and by the citizenry of faith in the government are the first symptoms of a disturbed equilibrium in a country even though the government, in the meantime, enjoys a noisy "popularity" among the masses. This spirit of distrust and the disappearance of unity between the government and the people are very alarming political portents, and it is impossible to foresee what the immediate future will bring.</p>
   <p>Only two years ago, prior to President Roosevelt's election, it would have been <span class="page-break">3</span>impossible, in this country, to picture the existence of such people as Senator Long and Father Coughlin, with their revolutionary and revolutionizing slogans, that have about the same value as those of Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
   <p>"Take that which was taken by theft"--that was the slogan of the Bolshevik revolution. Russia paid for that slogan in her own destruction, carried on during the past twenty years by means of hunger and other barbarous methods. Today these ideas are preached from the highest circles of American society, and this is what makes them dangerous. Senator Long and Father Coughlin are not Communist agitators in Union Square, whom the police could easily remove from the soapbox. Their names are known all over the country, and are very popular even in higher circles in America. One of them occupies a seat in the highest legislative body in the country.</p>
   <p>Senator Long and Father Coughlin are products of the social atmosphere which is developing as a result of two years of experimenting by President Roosevelt.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In this atmosphere, their ideas find a very favorable response; they awaken a sympathetic attitude on the part of the masses toward innovations in the social system. These ideas are dangerous for the Roosevelt government and the New Deal. In a democracy, with its use of Utopian words and ideas, the upper hand is always gained by the more extreme and more radical thought. Such is the psychology of the masses and the revolutionizing power of demagoguery.</p>
   <p>In this sense, Senator Long and Father Coughlin are very ominous figures on the present social horizon of the New Deal; revolutionary ideas are being thrown to the masses by responsible political figures. For the poor and against the rich, for the weak and against the strong--these have always been slogans of political demagogues. Wasn't this the slogan which was flung to the masses by the government, and doesn't the Roosevelt administration continue to play this dangerous game?</p>
   <p>Senator Long and Father Coughlin go further in this philosophy, proceeding to <span class="page-break">5</span>develop the logic and to carry it out to its ultimate conclusion. If the cause of all social evils rests within the owning class [of society], let us eliminate that class; let us divide the wealth among the poor. This is a logical and consistent conclusion and it appeals to the great masses of the people.....But the danger, of course, does not lie in Senator Long and Father Coughlin. The danger lies in the fact that this dangerous philosophy of "class struggle" is preached by the government itself.</p>
   <p>Long and Coughlin desire only to outwit Roosevelt's administration and to carry the President's policy to its extreme and yet logical conclusion. Whether they will succeed in arousing and carrying the masses with them, remains, to be seen. In all probability, the demagoguery preached by Long and Coughlin will die out if the country is fortunate enough to regain its prosperity. But that demagoguery may turn into a national menace if political and ecnomic conditions do not improve. This can be expected if the policies initiated by the New Deal continue in effect because they paralyze industry and deprive the nation of the necessary confidence in the government. By this road revolutions always come-- <span class="page-break">6</span>both from the right and the left. This has been concretely proven by the experience of modern Europe.</p>
   <p>The state authority which forgets its primary function--to serve as the final moral arbiter of society--and begins to play with class passions and antagonisms, becomes a revolutionary authority and constitutes a grave national danger.....No statesmanship is required to inflame class passions and to direct them against the groups that dominate the nation. For this purpose, there is a well-tried method--demagoguery. But there is no skill of statesmanship which can arrest a mass movement once the masses have lost their equilibrium. Herein lies the danger of revolution always.</p>
   <p>The popularity of the government and its state prestige and dignity do not always coincide. Nothing is easier than to declare the rich and other classes that dominate society to be the cause of all social ills. And yet there is nothing more dangerous for society than to play on the passions arising from social <span class="page-break">7</span>or economic inequality. This game becomes still more dangerous if it becomes part of the governmental policy.</p>
   <p>A government which substitutes "classes" for a nation, and the concept of statehood for the ideas of demagoguery will always represent a national danger no matter what noisy "popularity" it enjoys among the masses. The national government loses its authority whenever it neglects its state dignity and embarks on a search for popularity. This has always been true of mass psychology. </p>
   <p>It is always easier to be a government of noise and promise than one of dignified statehood and accomplishment; it is always easier to destroy than to create. Great national achievements and social improvements are possible only in a closely knit and united state, where the people and the government are indivisible. A government which forgets this cardinal political truth and plays on passions and antagonisms is the first and foremost menace to social peace. By this policy it subjects its own existence and that of the whole nation to grave danger.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>Senator Long and Father Coughlin, the products of this new social atmosphere and the New Deal, are a timely and ominous reminder of that fact.</p>
