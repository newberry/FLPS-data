   <p>When I wrote my article, "Why I Am Ashamed to Call Myself a Russian," I did not think it likely that it would provoke so many objections. One of my critics, Anton Narada, states that "Kondratieff shoots splendidly, but misses his mark" Were this so, my "shots" in all probability would have remained unanswered. But, because there was a whole shower of answers, I must have "hit the mark".</p>
   <p>All these answers convince me that I was not mistaken when I said that the Russian colony dislikes the truth, as well as people who dare point out its shortcomings. This peculiarity of the members of our Russian colony lies in the fact that they cannot bear any criticism of themselves. They heap praises upon themselves, and are always waiting to be lauded by others. If someone tries to point out their faults, they immediately show their unfriendliness and regard <span class="page-break">2</span>their critic as an enemy. Whenever they are presented with concrete facts which plainly show their defects, and which they are unable to contradict, they then find a scapegoat upon whom they lay all responsibility for their shortcomings. Under no circumstances are they willing to place the blame upon themselves.</p>
   <p>Their psychology is similar to that of the Bolsheviks. When the Bolsheviks fail in anything, they find a scapegoat to take the blame. As a rule, they shift the responsibility for their political and economic blunders to the Russian intelligentsia. As soon as they discover any gap in their "grand" work of construction, they immediately begin to proclaim in one voice, "This is the work of the wreckers, the intellectuals."</p>
   <p>Our Russian intellectuals in America have also been made scapegoats by my critics. Not one of them, except F. Chernovetz, gave a proper answer to questions discussed in my article. Not one of them placed even the slightest responsibility for our people's backwardness, in any instance, upon the people themselves. But they all acknowledge the fact that the Russian colony, generally speaking, is little educated and little cultured, and has not accomplished much.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>At the same time, however, they declare in one voice that the blame rests with the intelligentsia, and particularly with me, because I want neither to teach the colony nor to make it cultured.</p>
   <p>This one thought is emphasized throughout all their articles. It forms the chief basis of their objections to my own article. If we remove this basic thought from their articles, almost nothing will remain. It is different, however, with the article written by Mr. Chernovetz, who gave careful and serious thought to all questions discussed in my article. He comes to the conclusion that my article contains "many bitter truths and honest reproaches" directed against the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>My critics, one and all, for some reason class me with the intelligentsia and even with the aristocrats, subjecting me, as an enemy of the people, to attack's from all sides. One of the writers, one Petroff, for instance, states point-blank: "The Russian colony has little culture and is uneducated, because our Kondratieffs keep all culture and education for themselves under the seven seals, and do not want to give them to the people".</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>To the great distress of my critics, I should inform them, if they are interested in my biography, that I do not belong to the intelligentsia and I am not an aristocrat; but, like themselves, I am a former peasant. I cannot understand why they regard me as a member of the intellectual class or as an aristocrat. Is it not because I dared to point out the defects in the Russian colony, rather then exalt it, as it is our custom to do? Or is it, perhaps, because I possess a certain amount of education, and am able to express my thoughts on paper in plain and understandable language? I came to America with just as little education as other old Russian immigrants. But, I had a strong desire to free myself, by all means, from the bondage of illiteracy and lack of culture, and I succeeded in attaining that desire. All Russian immigrants, certainly, could have accomplished the same thing, had they possessed a desire to do so. But they had no such desire; therefore, they were left behind other national groups, which were more willing to learn.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kovaleff and Mr. Chernovetz probably think that they are completely disproving my statements and my claims about the Russian colony when they declare that some of the Russian immigrants have improved their education; that they have read many books; that some even have their own five-hundred-dollar <span class="page-break">5</span>libraries; and that some have become technicians and specialists of various kinds in American industry. However, they do not disprove my assertion, but confirm it; for I said in my article that those who wanted to improve themselves did so. And if tens, hundreds, or thousands have improved their education, why could not hundreds of thousands of our immigrants do the same; why couldn't the entire Russian colony raise its mental level? They all have had the same opportunity. I worked hard in factories; but I studied nights in an American high school. Within a few years I had finished my high school course, but I was not satisfied; I continued my studies independently. At the same time I was learning the Russian language. During those years there were not many Russian intellectuals in America, but those who were here were always ready and willing to help those who wanted to be helped. Besides that. I devoted all my leisure time to independent studies in the Russian language. I toiled over grammars and other books about the Russian language until I mastered it. But my fellow countrymen with whom I worked laughed at me and called me a fool who wanted to be a scholar. They spent all their time when away from work playing cards or drinking in the saloons and various dens, as one of my critics puts it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Now, I ask my critics, who is to blame that only a few have improved their education, while hundreds of thousands have remained on the same level as when they first came to America? Our intellectual class cannot be blamed for it. Our intelligentsia has always been ready to help us; but we disregarded their good intentions, and frequently we even pushed them away from us. It was to somebody's interest to inspire in the uneducated members of our colony enmity toward our intellectual class, and to this day the colony has not been able to free itself from this hostile attitude.</p>
   <p>The articles of my critics are filled with the same enmity, though undoubtedly my critics consider themselves outstanding persons among the colony. They constantly scold the intellectuals, and abuse them; at the same time they reproach them for not having educated the colony. One of them writes, for instance, that the intelligentsia brings only harm to the colony. "The Russian colony," he states, "as far back as twenty years ago, was trying to build its own national homes; but the intelligentsia prevented it."</p>
   <p>But my critic, to my sorrow, has not specified when and where our present-day <span class="page-break">7</span>Russian intellectuals have ruined or prevented such undertakings. If he gives the names of intellectuals to various sharpers and adventurers, he then commits an act of dishonesty, as, in that case, his desire is to set the already hostile, incited, and uneducated masses of Russian immigrants upon them. Our present-day Russian intelligentsia has never ruined or prevented anything that might be good for the colony. The trouble, however, is that the colony did not want to benefit by the help of the intellectual class. The colony listened to different adventurers and charlatans; it turned a deaf ear to the honest advice of the intellectuals, whom it regarded, and still regards, as deadly enemies who wish it not good, but evil.</p>
   <p>Another critic writes: "Chaliapin, Maria Kurenko, Rachmaninoff, Rerich [famous Russian artists]--what are they to the Russian colony? Have they ever taken any notice of the colony's existence here? Have they given it all they could? Have they lifted it up to the level of understanding of their art? No!"</p>
   <p>That is not true. The teacher should not look for students, but rather the students for a teacher, if they want to learn anything. It would be ridiculous <span class="page-break">8</span>if Mr. Chaliapin, when on a concert tour in a certain city, or a Russian professor, filling a lecture engagement, were to take time to search for Russian immigrants in order to impart to them some spiritual treasures. But even that sometimes happens. Russian intellectuals have often been engaged in opening schools for immigrants. In New York there was organized a national Russian college, but not many people cared to benefit by it. Here in Chicago, Mr. Moravsky tried to organize a school for adults, also a correspondence school and a course of instruction in public speaking; only a few enrolled.</p>
   <p>And my critics dare assert, after all this, that our intelligentsia is to blame for the backwardness of the Russian colony. Do they want our intellectuals to rope people and drag them to schools and lecture halls? Lectures almost everywhere are free, and how many people attend them? Only a few.</p>
   <p>Here is another important fact. About two years ago, a concert of Russian songs by Maria Kurenko, famous Russian songstress, and a Russian composer, Grechaninoff was held in New York. The concert was a great success. Madame Kurenko then wrote to one of her friends in Chicago, asking him to find out if it would be <span class="page-break">9</span>possible to have a similar concert in Chicago, exclusively for the Russian colony. And what happened? The Russian friend of Miss Kurenko called on all Russian societies, with the suggestion that they should arrange such a concert; but none of our Russian organizations accepted the proposition. And my critic still asks if any of our great Russian artists has ever tried to do anything for the colony!</p>
   <p>The Russian colony has remained uneducated and uncultured because of its own indolence and its hostile attitude toward the Russian intellectual class. But my critic is right when he says that the most favored leaders and spiritual teachers of the Russian colony were not real Russian intellectuals, but were political adventurers, like Deviatkins and Shklars [local Russian communist leaders]. These "spiritual teachers" were teaching the people not what they should learn, but what they should not learn. Instead of telling the members of the colony that, above all, they should learn grammar and read books of the better Russian and foreign writers, they inspired them with hate, not only for those Russians who could read and write (classifying them as exploiters), but also for literacy itself. They began to educate the members of the colony <span class="page-break">10</span>by giving them worthless propaganda pamphlets to read. Thus, having glutted all the "wisdom" of these pamphlets, as one of my critics puts it, the colony imagined it knew all, and was smarter than other national groups in America. This critic also writes, and truly, that the colony knows more about Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and Liebknecht, than about Tolstoy, Dostoevski, and Solovieff. But this fact also stands out as one cause of the colony's ignorance and backwardness. If it knew less about Lenin and Trotsky, and more about Tolstoy and Dostoevski, and if it knew its own native language better then our colony would be quite different.</p>
   <p>These worthless political propaganda pamphlets only disorganized the colony and killed in it all desire for real knowledge. I happen to know persons who consider themselves prominent public workers, dreaming of rebuilding the entire world; but they know nothing about decimal fractions, and can hardly write two words correctly. Why is it so? It is because they regard the arts of reading and writing as bourgeois luxuries.</p>
   <p>My critics also declare that it is the fault of the Russian intelligentsia that <span class="page-break">11</span>there has been no Russian pavilion at the Chicago World's Fair. That is not true. The intelligentsia alone could not build the pavilion, as this could have been done only by the concerted action of the entire Russian colony. But, even if the intelligentsia had taken the initiative, the colony would have immediately raised the cry: "Ah, the White Guards are beginning to build the pavilion in order to fleece the colony!" It is necessary to be aware of the fact that, no matter what the intelligent Russian class might undertake, the colony always treats it with hostility and suspicion and refuses to support it.</p>
   <p>Let us take, for example, the Russian National Mutual Aid Society. Is it the intelligentsia that is to blame for the fact that the Society submitted to communist dictatorship, and at the end was sold out to some international order? No, the colony itself was to blame. All honest Russians, intellectuals and workers, had cautioned members of the Society against the looming danger. But did they listen to these warnings? Did they renounce their Deviatkins and Shklars and join their Russian brothers?</p>
   <p>An honest Russian intellectual for the last several years has been talking about <span class="page-break">12</span>forming one strong union of the entire Russian colony. And has the colony united? The newspaper Rassviet has appealed to the colony to organize public meetings in protest against the beastly Soviet regime, but has the colony hearkened to the calls? The same Rassviet took up the question of calling an all-Russian convention, but did the colony give its support to this idea? No! I am convinced that there will be no convention, and the readers of this newspaper are only wasting their time and paper in discussing the subject.</p>
   <p>Who bears the blame for the fact that the colony, to the present time, does not have its own large newspaper? One part of the Russian colony never reads any newspaper, and another part supports not the Russian press, but foreign papers printed in the Russian language. Is that not strange? Even the church people, members of Russian parishes, are supporting not their own Russian newspapers, but those printed in Russian by various commercial interests, not for the purpose of enlightening the Russian people, but for the purpose of furthering their own financial gain. Is it not a disgrace? I personally know many members of the Russian United Mutual Aid Society, and of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, who never read even their own page in Rassviet, and never show <span class="page-break">13</span>any interest in the affairs of their organizations. Is the intelligentsia to blame for that, too? No, my dear critics, the colony itself must bear the blame for all this. But, to our sorrow, it is unwilling to acknowledge its guilt, and shifts it to others. This fact, more than anything else, prevents it from freeing itself from backwardness and ignorance, and from displaying some creative ability.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I want to declare that, in the future, I shall not answer my critics, as they are not interested in establishing the truth of the matter; they become personal, and just want to say a few "strong words" directed at those who dare tell the truth. Under such circumstances, all discussions are fruitless, and it would not pay to waste one's time by continuing this bickering.</p>
