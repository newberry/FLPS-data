   <p>The conference of March 1, 1928, was opened at 8:45 P. M. at the headquarters of the newspaper Rassviet by Dr. Pertsov's report on the work done by the temporary committee elected by the Initiative Group of the striking miners. Dr. Pertsov first of all proposed that a chairman and a secretary of the meeting be elected. This proposal was accepted.</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by sixteen delegates of Bolshevist organizations and by eight delegates of progressive (non-Bolshevist) organizations. It was found out that the Bolsheviki, in order to get an artificial majority and to silence all dissenters, had sent two delegates from each organization.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviki demanded that all the work undertaken by the Russian organizations in order to give relief to the miners, should be done <span class="page-break">\2</span>entirely under the control of Bolshevist committees and that the money collected should be sent only to places indicated by the Bolsheviki.</p>
   <p>The delegates of non-Communist organizations would not agree with such conditions. No agreement was reached, and the Bolsheviki left the conference. The Initiative Group, however, declared that it would not abandon the relief work undertaken by it. The program of a great festivity, to take place on March 25, 1928, at Walsh's Hall, was being successfully rehearsed. The following organizations had joined in arranging this festivity: The Society Rassviet, the Society for Relief to Political Prisoners, the Club Mayak, the Russian-American Citizens' Club, and the Russian Center.</p>
