   <p>At the corner of Madison Street and Damen Street there is a six-story building, the Lewis Institute, occupying a whole block.</p>
   <p>The Lewis Institute is a school of a democratic character, founded in order to give to young people who have to earn their living themselves the possibility of making their way in the world. This school attracts a multitude of students from all parts of the city. Among these students there are many Russians. Most of them, of course, are learning the English language.</p>
   <p>A few days ago I happened to have a long talk with one of the ladies teaching in this school the English language after I had given her the compliments of one of her pupils, the wife of a well - known Russian physician. The teacher was very pleased with that greeting and exclaimed in a jocular way: "There are so many of you, Russians, in Chicago; it seems to me that 90 percent of my pupils have been Russians."</p>
   <p>Some ten or twenty Russians are also studying there engineering, mechanics. Many of them have been accepted as students while still living in Russia, and the institute has obtained for them the permission to come to this country.</p>
   <p>The attitude of the American students towards the Russians is a friendly one.</p>
