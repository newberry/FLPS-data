   <p>The Moscow correspondent of the Vienna newspaper Neue Freie Presse, N. Basseches, in one of his articles informs us that at present in Soviet Russia almost nothing remains of the old Bolshevik internationalism. The liquidation of this internationalism began at the moment when the word motherland was "legalized". The fact that Soviet Russia national anthem still remains the "International" may now be considered a paradox, for according to Mr. Basseches Soviet Russia has gradually become a state like any other, and the last vestiges of, Soviet practice and Soviet legislation with tendencies toward internationalism are rapidly disappearing. It is not merely a coincidence, it seems, that the latest Soviet coins do not bear on their face the slogan, "Proletarians of all countries, unite!"</p>
   <p>Extremely characteristic is the following fact. In an official speech by one <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the members of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist party in which he struck the balance of the latest check-up on membership, it was openly stated that the enrollment of citizens of foreign countries in the Communist party had been stopped. All foreigners heretofore carrying party tickets were to surrender them till they had gone through all the formalities of naturalization and induction into Soviet citizenship . From now on, therefore, foreigners may not join the governing party.</p>
   <p>"This," writes Basseches, "actually abolishes what was formerly the basic principle of the Soviet law, according to which foreign workers enjoyed in Soviet Russia not only civil [rights] but also political privileges."</p>
   <p>Parallel with this fact one may observe another interesting development. During the last few years the authorities have brought pressure to bear on foreigners residing in Soviet Russia to induce them to acquire Soviet citizenship. Since <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>"the Soviet Union is the fatherland for all workers," the formalities for naturalization were reduced to a minimum, and the entire procedure took very little time. At present, however, foreigners applications for Soviet citizenship are very carefully scrutinized, and most of them are rejected.</p>
   <p>Moreover, according to Bessaches, a considerable strengthening of the Great Russian influence has been taking place lately all over the territory of Soviet Russia. The long-established Bolshevik custom of presenting Russian history in its negative aspects and of portraying Russian as the [former] prison of the peoples which inhabited it is recognized now as false and anti-Leninist. Because of this change of front N. Bucharin, editor of Izvestia, was recently slapped in the face several times by the Central Committee. After that he "acknowledged his error" and began to write about the virtues of the Great Russians.</p>
   <p>The importance and significance of Russian culture in the general history of Russia is now emphasized on every occasion and is always, pushed to the fore. Among the Soviet national states "Russia should take the front seat among equals," <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Bolsheviks say. In accordance with this latest tendency the work of revising all school textbooks on history is being rushed at top speed.</p>
   <p>This ideological reconstruction of the Soviet state finds its reflection even in the organizational forms. Centralization of administration is proceeding apace. The central authority has gradually fully subjected to its control all branches of administration and industry. The so-called autonomous component republics are now left only with social insurance and public health problems in their care. Their courts are under control of the supreme court and of the attorney general of the Union. From the autonomous commissars of education theaters, movies, music, and fine arts have been taken away. The complete centralization of all branches of administration is only a matter of time.</p>
