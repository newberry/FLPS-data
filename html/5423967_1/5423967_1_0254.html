   <p>Concerning the question, power lies in unity, there has been a lot of discussion in the page Novosti (The News), but it is necessary for us Russians to talk [about it] even more. We must also write about unity because we are divided into many political groups. Our misfortune lies in the fact that we are naturally egotistical. If the opinion of John or Stephen is not agreeable to Paul, [it is because] we cannot find a common cause to agree upon together. Frequently, because of a very trivial matter there arise great discord, insults and even quarrels. Everyone tries to prove his correctness, and as a result of his stubbornness and desire to put over his point of view, our society suffers.</p>
   <p>The enemies of Russian unity take advantage of this and deepen our dissension even more. They canvass the illiterate colonists from house to house and with various promises instigate the latter against those who strive to accomplish <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>something useful and valuable for the Russian colony in America. Those political provocateurs also instigate the stupid people against the colony's intelligent social workers, making them an enemy of the people.</p>
   <p>After hearing these sweet promises, such a colonist comes to a meeting, and, being stupid, openly begins to carry dissension into his own circle, incriminating either the main committee or the intelligent social workers. There are several such examples. Let's take for instance the Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society). Of what did they not accuse the main committee of that good organization! Either the chairman of the Rnzov sells the organization to the Democrats, or Michalchik sells the organization to the Republicans. The election has already passed but Rnzov has not sold out, but instead, according to the latest statement, is growing and gaining strength.</p>
   <p>Prior to the election, as well as now, the members remained loyal to their organization and worked actively for the benefit of the entire Russian colony <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in America. Hence it is clear that those people are working neither for gold nor for their own profit.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that those who accused these honest workers of treachery will give special attention to the above statement. It is time to cease incriminating and accusing one's own neighbor; instead it is time to start together to develop the enlightenment of the Russian colony. Further it will not hurt us to learn from our brothers, the Slavs, who are organized into strong mutual aid societies, and have their own public buildings, and advanced educational institutions. All of these were accomplished through unity and complete harmony. They found a common understanding on which they agreed, and conducted their affairs in an exemplary and the best possible manner.</p>
   <p>The writer of these lines was a witness at one of the meetings where there was present one of the ardent defenders of the Soviet Union, who insisted that Politgramota (political grammar) must be introduced into the school program, and demanded a resolution in favor of recognition of the Soviet government. What was the reaction of the assembly to this?</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The answer is very simple and clear. However the most interesting factor was that the people who believed in Bolshevism protested spiritedly against such an introduction stating first:</p>
   <p>"Science cannot be either proletarian or bourgeois because, of itself, science is nonpolitical and therefore the youth should not be prejudiced. We must give the children an education, but we leave the selection of a political career up to them, when they mature and are hardened spiritually and physically.</p>
   <p>"Our organization is nonpolitical, and cannot accept any political color. Those who want to support the Soviet Union are free to do as they please, but the Mutual Aid Society on the whole is not supposed to do so."</p>
   <p>It is clear and understandable that the foundation on which our organization is based is absolutely wholesome, and therefore the results are splendid. And this is also true for us--we must gather around the strong organization of Rnzov, which has a foundation most suitable to the modern era.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>So, friend colonist, get to work, reunite into one strong Russian organization such as the Rnzov, which recognizes the individual freedom of every person.</p>
   <p>In unity there is power. </p>
