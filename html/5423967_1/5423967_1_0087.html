   <p>Three schools for children maintained by the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society--the Bunin School, the Krylov School and the Pushkin School--held their final examinations for the pupils who had finished the course in elementary Russian. The examinations were held at the Bunin School, Cortez and Rockwell Streets. Forty-three children took the examinations. Parents and invited guests also were present during the examinations. Mrs. Paulina Svatikova is the instructor in all three schools. Dr. A. I. Nedzelnitzky, the chief examiner, was assisted by Anton Bernov, who represented the Russian School Council.</p>
   <p>The pupils, unlike the American school children, behaved admirably. One could feel the intelligent discipline the children had been inoculated with by their experienced instructor. They answered all questions put to them by the chief examiner withour fear or shyness. Their knowledge of writing in Russian was clearly shown. Their recitations showed a good command of spoken Russian.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Only the smaller children showed a lack of knowledge and insufficient training in the Russian accent. But this is mostly the fault of their parents, who have neglected to train their children in the proper pronunciation of Russian words. The older children, however, passed all the examinations to the complete satisfaction of the examiners, the instructor and the parents. Those who graduated from the highest grade are now ready to enter the Russian High School. But we have none!</p>
   <p>It was our pleasant duty to note that Dr. A. I. Nedzelnitzky was perfect as the chief examiner, and one to whom the youngsters would look up for inspiration, hope and example. With his jokes and his keenness of mind he at once captured the attention and the confidence of the youngsters, and held it throughout the entire session, thus making it easy for them to answer questions without timidity and with self-assurance.</p>
   <p>When the examinations were over the pupils thanked Mrs. Svatikova for her hard work in teaching in three schools. One of the graduates made a short but <span class="page-break">\3</span>heart-felt and deeply-thought-out speech of gratitude for Mrs. Svatikova's efforts in teaching them their native tongue, and the history and geography of Russia. Dr. Nedzelnitzky also addressed the children, praising their work, and the work of their instructor.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Svatikova in her parting words, mingled with emotion, advised the children to continue their studies in their native language whenever they have the opportunity of doing so. Very touching and impressive was the leave-taking, when the children embraced and kissed their instructor. Tears of emotion rolled down the cheeks of everybody present, especially the parents, who beamed with pride and gladness.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Bernov, the chairman of the Russian School Council in Chicago, closed the day by treating the children to ice cream. He then invited Dr. Nedzelnitzky, Mrs. Svatikova and some of the parents to his home for a chat over cups of tea.</p>
   <p>Thus ended the examinations of the three schools conducted by the Russian <span class="page-break">\4</span>Independent Mutual Aid Society. These schools should serve as models and graphic examples for others to follow; for the children attending them, they will continue to be among the most precious memories of their entire lives.   </p>
