   <p>Where are you who are vigilant, strong, and courageous? Is it possible that you do not exist among a population of a million? Is it true that all of you are as passive, cowardly, heartless and indifferent as are the million? Is it possible that you are so small, crude, self-centered, made up of wrinkled bodies only, without any opinions or thoughts of your own--is it possible that you are rolling on the inclined plane of life from birth to the death, rolling without a murmur or revolt, without vigilance, without the courage to grasp on to something, so that you can stop and check on yourself, so that you can look upon your life, and on the circling universe?</p>
   <p>No, it cannot be! We wish to believe that in the mass of indifference, deafness, blindness, and rude egoism, there still are people capable of hearing, and seeing, capable of vigilance, and by their own vigilance, without humiliation or insult to personal feeling, capable of enlightening the hearts and thoughts of others with bright and joyful hope. Vigilance is the most priceless treasure of life.</p>
   <p>Individual elements, individual organisms, as well as any organized systems, organizations, societies, empires, survive longer than others with the exception only of those which are vigilant, because vigilance is life.</p>
   <p>During a shipwreck only those survive who are vigilant. But those who yield to despondency and fear--perish. The vigilant and courageous fugitive traverses the most dreadful mires and rotten swamps. The swamp will slowly suck down into its depths, first to the armpits and then up to the head, those who are weak, sad, and lifeless.</p>
   <p>I think it would be proper to draw an analogy with our own organizations. Our organizations have no vigilance, that vitality which strengthens and increases the abilities of the organization. The new organizations are vigilant, active, and growing. But the old ones fall into passivity and are dying.</p>
   
   <p>Organizations need new streams of people, fresh energy, and force; they require young, healthy, and energetic people. It is possible to attract them only by vigilant effort. The vigilance of any organization is shown in its cultural and educational activities. To attract the others it is necessary to organize debates, lectures, literary and musical affairs, and various entertainments, using even native, amateur talent, but basically, alertness is required.</p>
   <p>I have traveled all over the states where there are Russian organizations and have discovered that only those groups which are still active expect to continue to exist.</p>
   <p>The vigilance of the organization exists only there where the cold, inanimate nickels of the members are converted into living deeds--by organizing debates, lectures and entertainments. Incidentally all of us are at present stirred by one thought: is it possible that our younger generation will leave us if we are not vigilant? Yes, indeed, they will withdraw from our organization to seek life and satisfaction elsewhere, outside of the organization, and if they leave, they will not come back.</p>
   <p>And to all those who think of and propose the establishment of some kind of a central organization which will cause only crowding (sic), it would first be necessary, before doing anything else, to strengthen the individual organizations, to strengthen the individual organizations, to create a living vigilance, which will help attract new forces.</p>
