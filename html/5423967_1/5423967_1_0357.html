   <p>The schools, lectures, and other undertakings of this year have been unequalled in the previous existence of the colony. The Chicago colony is growing and multiplying. New elements of energy are continually being added to it. Soon the time may come when we, in this respect, shall equal New York.</p>
   <p>Our schools have been unified into federations. Our clubs, societies, circles and other institutions of enlightenment are growing and progressing. In the past, there has hot been one year equal to the last, in which so many lectures were given for the Russian workers of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Professor A. P. Braghin upon his arrival had hardly announced his first lecture on the theme "The Life and the End of the Last of the Romanovs," which was fixed for May 31, when two women with college educations arrived and announced their intention to lecture on the next Friday. One of them, Dr. Khodya Shurovtseva, will lecture on the theme, "History of Ukraina," and Mme. Khrapko-Dragomanov, LL.D., will lecture on "The Condition of Woman in Russia and Ukraina." During this week the well-known singer, Mme. F. Pototski, arrived, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in a few days the singer, Mme A. M. Karinsky will arrive and also a number of other well-known artists and representatives of the Russian intelligentsia, many of whom intend to settle down in Chicago forever. </p>
