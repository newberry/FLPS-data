   <p>In the Novy Mir (New York Daily published by the Russian Communists) there appeared an article advocating the cooperation of the Russian Independent Society of Mutual Aid with the Russian-American Communists. Mr. Sidorovich, in the Rassviet, denies the possibility of such cooperation for the following reasons: he says that the members of the Independent Society stand for freedom and equality and are enemies of any kind of dictatorship; whereas the Communists stand for the enslavement of the people by a party dictatorship and deny the freedom of the press and of speech as "bourgeois superstitions." They are not concerned about the true welfare and liberty of the people, and only seek political power in order to attain selfish ends and to dictate their will to the people, which they have proved by their activity in Russia. It is impossible to cooperate with such a party.</p>
