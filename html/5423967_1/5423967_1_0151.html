   <p>Last Saturday, A. S. Dubinka, an aged Russian immigrant, celebrated his younger daughter Sophie's graduation from high school by a family dinner to which about thirty guests were invited. Dubinka's family in many respects is an ideal one. A genuine Russian spirit pervades the entire life of this family: a most generous hospitality, and a high degree of cultural attainment. This could be seen not only from the way the guests were entertained, but from the entire setting of the apartment where the family lives.</p>
   <p>The parlor was set with beautiful furniture, and the walls were hung with paintings, and portraits of Mozart and other celebrities of the music world. Among them one could also notice an artistically executed portrait of Sophie, the girl whose graduation was being celebrated. In one of the corners one saw a grand piano, in another a radio. A whole case, in a third corner, was filled with violins, and there were many books and music on the shelves.</p>
   <p>The guests were entertained particularly by Sophie, a very attractive and talented girl, and an accomplished musician. She plays the piano, violin and accordion, and displayed well-developed technique while playing each of these instruments. She intends to continue her musical education at the Chicago Musical College, and there is no doubt but that she will be a first-class pianist after finishing her musical education. One could also note that Miss Dubinka particularly likes Russian music, for most of her music library consists of the works of Russian composers.</p>
   <p>Another daughter, Anna, is also a very able and sensible girl who has chosen a business career. Having received proper education, she is employed now in the office of a large business firm.</p>
   <p>Looking at these two girls, one is glad that among the Russians of the pre-war immigration there are to be found parents who give their children the best education possible, and who keep them off the streets where a tremendous influence is exerted on most of the Russian youth. Ideal parents, of course, bring up ideal children. Confirmation of this old truth is to be found in Dubinka's family.</p>
   <p>After a sumptuous meal the guests danced and enjoyed themselves until the early morning hours. They will not soon forget this occasion.</p>
