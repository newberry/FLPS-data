   <p>(This editorial contains a pathetic appeal for the unification of the Russian colony in Chicago. It characterizes the state of this colony so vividly that I decided to give an almost complete translation of it. D. S.)</p>
   <p>The Russian colony in Chicago still presents a sad spectacle. An unprejudiced observer notices immediately that it has not yet freed itself from the pernicious and destructive influence of various partisan currents and groupings which strive to keep this colony in a state of enmity, mutual hatred, intolerance - we might say, in a state of spiritual civil war.... We are still fighting each other, or, like <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Don Quixote, we are fighting imaginary enemies and do not notice our real enemy, nor do we heed the real danger.</p>
   <p>This element of animosity does not only appear in the relations between the various parties and currents of thought; it also gets hold of individuals who hold the same political opinions.</p>
   <p>The Russian bishops are enemies of each other, and their example is followed by the parishioners. There is no peace and friendly cooperation neither among the monarchists nor among the Bolsheviki, Socialists and anarchists, nor among any other Russian organization or group.</p>
   <p>We Russians seem to be somehow moving farther and farther away from each other; we are more and more scattered, as if we were obsessed by some evil demons who want to drive us over a precipice where we would perish.</p>

   <p>Our colonial civil war brings with it very sad results. Our Russian colony is being blown into atoms, and these atoms are getting absorbed by the American element. Even in such large centers as Chicago and New York, where there are many Russians, they are too much absorbed in party quarrels and controversies; and because of that we have not been able to create any large organization even on such a neutral ground as mutual aid. We have not succeeded in using this form of unification for the gathering and preservation of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Such comparatively small nationalities as the Lithuanians, the Ukrainians, the Czechs, the Finns, the Poles, the Jews, etc., have mutual aid societies with many thousands of members; some of these societies have a capital of several million dollars.( For instance, the Ukrainian Society Svoboda, the Galician Society in Scranton, Pa.; the Polish Zgoda, etc.)</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Many of these societies have built enormous people's palaces with libraries, offices, gymnasiums, and schools, thus making such institutions to be real centers of education where the young generation is being firmly linked to the culture of the old country.</p>
   <p>And thus the young generations of the above mentioned nationalities do not get out of touch with the life of the respective foreign groups and with the traditions of their fathers. The young people are proud of the social successes achieved by their parents and do not look down on them with a feeling of superiority as this happens among some of the Russian young people who have been brought up entirely along American lines. Such children of Russian parents regard anything foreign as inferior, not excepting even their own parents.</p>
   <p>The Russian colony must not lag behind the other nationalities. What the Polea, Ukrainians, Czechs, etc., have been able to create in America can be done by us Russians just as well. We must not be like <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>dust under the feet of the Americans or like a kind of manure for the triumphant growth of their civilization.</p>
   <p>We must gather together the scattered Russian colony and unify it in mutual aid societies.</p>
   <p>The already existing organizations of this type should manifest more energy and persistency in attracting into their ranks new members.</p>
   <p>The larger amalgamations of such societies in New York, Chicago, and other cities, should make it their aim to create branches in those cities where there are no such organizations at present.</p>
   <p>And, most important of all, we should concentrate all our efforts in quelling those continual dissensions which are tearing to pieces our Russian colony.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>It is impossible, of course, to establish among all of us a complete consensus of opinions, and we think that such a uniformity would even be harmful; but we could and should be tolerant towards opinions and convictions which contradict our own views.</p>
   <p>Even if such opinions are erroneous and unacceptable to us, we should tolerate them. For a true libertarian cannot but grant to every man the right to hold even erroneous views.</p>
