   <p>All countries communicate that there are more women than men.</p>
   <p>After the world war the women of the fighting countries raised a great cry - that there was a deficiency in bridegrooms. An exception in this respect is our "chief town," the Russian colony of Chicago. We have a deficiency in girls - Russian brides.</p>
   <p>If one visits a Russian party, play or concert, he will hear the complaints of the young people: "It is gay, but it is bad; there are no girls." If you ask a Russian young man or a Russian bachelor why they do not get married, they will answer, There are no Russian girls.</p>
   <p>And in reality one can notice almost involuntarily the absence of Russian girls. There are often advertisements in the Russian paper <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>concerning bachelors who desire to get acquainted with a Russian girl or woman, with the purpose of marriage. But there are no such advertisements from women. After the war many young people went to Russia. Some of them admitted that they were going to Russia to get married. A strange but a serious problem for the Russian colony - a deficiency in brides.</p>
   <p>As we already mentioned before there is a strong tendency in some part of the Russian colony to buy houses, farms and businesses.</p>
