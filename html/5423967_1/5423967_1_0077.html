   <p>The Russian schools will soon open in many American cities having a Russian population. The Russian organizations, supported by the parents, are now busy with the preparatory work, such as finding suitable locations for the schools, engaging competent instructors, providing textbooks, etc. The most important preparatory work the Russian organizations are doing now in connection with the forthcoming opening of the Russian schools is, however, the persuading of Russian parents to send their children to Russian schools, where they may learn their mother tongue.</p>
   <p>The Russian language is becoming more and more important in the world. In America, hundreds of persons of non-Russian nationality are studying the Russian language for future use and convenience. Yet many Russian parents who were born and reared in Russia are neglecting to inculcate the knowledge of <span class="page-break">2</span>the Russian language into their American-born children. It is time that every Russian in America, young and old alike, should understand that the Russian language has a great value, not only from the point of view of culture and art, but also in a practical sense. In order to become well acquainted with the great treasures of Russian culture, and to understand the peculiarities of the Russian soul, it is necessary to know the Russian language. Moreover, every Russian born in America will find it more and more useful and convenient to be able to speak Russian, for purely practical reasons.</p>
   <p>In certain American cities with a large number of Russians, there are Russian grammar schools as well as advanced schools of the Russian language. Every Russian colony should have both primary and advanced schools for teaching Russian and other subjects to Russian children. The Russian grammar school alone cannot supply a sufficient knowledge of the Russian language to Russian-American children. Every Russian colony in this country, whether large or small, should have at least one advanced school where the Russian language, <span class="page-break">3</span>and other subjects pertaining to Russia, are taught. In Chicago, where there are many Russian organizations, religious societies, and clubs, the problem of establishing a Russian advanced school should be easily solved. Various Russian organizations, however different their political, social, and other viewpoints may be, should unite on this one point--Russian schools. If all Russian organizations in Chicago would unite upon this one point, and would co-ordinate their actions toward that one end, the Russian colony here could have not only a well-established Russian advanced school for children, but also a school for adults, and perhaps could even sponsor a people's college. There are many educated persons among the Russian people in Chicago who would gladly offer their aid and co-operation in organizing and developing such useful and important educational institutions. This plan can be realized, however, only after the establishment of co-operative action of all Russian organizations in Chicago. Even though the Russian organizations in Chicago cannot unite politically, if they differ on religious questions, if they disagree on any other issue they can and they should be as one on matters of <span class="page-break">4</span>culture and education. They should have no disagreements on this score.</p>
   <p>We suggest that the Russian organizations in Chicago call a school conference and invite to it all the Russian teachers, the intellectuals, the representatives of youth clubs, the representatives of the Russian parents, and all the outstanding persons interested in Russian public life in America. This conference could work out plans for all our school activities, could solve many baffling problems which cannot be solved by any one Russian organization alone. If, henceforth, any single Russian organization will continue to hold to the old idea of having its own school, such a school will lead a sorry existence, and its work will fall far below the minimum standard of other Russian schools which will be conducted efficiently by the common effort of many Russian organizations.</p>
   <p>Russian organizations in other American cities and towns desiring to improve their teaching system, and to strengthen their schools, will also do well to <span class="page-break">5</span>unite and co-ordinate their efforts toward that particular end.</p>
