   <p>The American press has lately been publishing data concerning the number of unemployed in this country. These data, however, are so contradictory that it is very difficult even now to gain a true picture of the unemployment situation and its seriousness. In the European countries, as is well known, close tab is kept on the number of unemployed by the labor exchanges, municipal authorities, and other agencies. Here we have a number of institutions engaged in studying this particular problem, such as The Department of Labor, the American Federation of Labor, The Federal Administration of Public Works, the Chamber of Commerce, and even private statistical firms. The result, [however, has been nothing but confusion in this important matter, and nobody seems to know even approximately just what the number of unemployed in the country is.</p>
   <p>Recently W. Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, declared that according to his estimates in March of the current year there were 12, 184,000 unemployed; he included in this number three and a half million men employed on the public works.</p>
   <p>However, the data gathered by the New York Sun show that the figure cited by Green is altogether exaggerated, and that in answers to questionnaires mailed to three thousand firms the employers state that whereas in 1929 they had on their payrolls 5,498,000 men, at present they employ only 4,640,000 people, and the newspaper estimates that on the basis of the percentage of workers employed the number of unemployed in the country should not exceed four million men.</p>
