   <p>January 15, at the quarters above the Obzhorka (Gluttony Inn), the Glavuprav (chief superintendent) and his retinue hypnotized the ignorant workers; the chief superintendent baptised Moroz as a member of the "whites" and a Belogvardeyts (White Guard) became one of the "red".</p>
   <p>Two months ago in the Pogrom Miro [the newspaper Novyi Mir (the New World), sarcastically called "The Destruction of the World"] there was a challenge to the White Guards. Shkliar and Deviatkin begged them to unite into one group. Those "comrades" found out that the people had begun to distrust them and started to leave them after learning of their dirty deals.</p>
   <p>Because of this situation, the "comrades" tried to unite with the White Guards, and endeavoured to keep the Russian colony in darkness and ignorance. If the colony was backward, it would be much easier to extract Vodri (sic), quarters and dollars.</p>

   <p>The same adventurers screamed: "Do not read the workers' newspaper Rassviet, only we are allowed to read it, because we must learn. But for you, nihilist worms, knowledge is not necessary."</p>
   <p>It is time, comrades, to analyze what these foreign adventurers preach and it is time to drive them out.</p>
