   <p>Everybody knows that the Bolsheviks have taken the places of Russian nobility and other privileged classes, that they worry only about themselves, but this does not in any way keep them from saying that they are engaged in building a classless socialist society.</p>
   <p>How they do it one can see from the information supplied by the news-gathering agency "Cresteress" concerning the recent census of suburban summer homes <span class="gap">[gap]</span> formerly belonging to the rich people of Moscow and high government officials.</p>
   <p>The census disclosed that the Moscow city inspection has registered 183 summer homes which belong to members of the government of U.S.S.R., members of the Russian Federated Soviet Republic, and to the members of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist party. Adjacent to each of 89 such summer homes and constituting a part of the property, is a parcel of land of twenty acres or more. Besides, there are 976 summer homes which are temporarily occupied by high Soviet officials from various commissariats and other Soviet institutions.</p>
   <p>This information is very valuable because it gives data on the number of summer homes to which communists themselves hold titles. This information shows that the right of private property in land and homes in U.S.S.R. has been abolished only for workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but as far as commissars and other high Soviet officials are concerned, this right still exists.</p>
   <p>Communists also are well provided with food, clothing, footwear, and other things [not only with articles of first necessity, but with articles of luxury, as well].</p>
   
   <p>The same agency reports on the results of the recent investigation into the distribution of goods among workers from the Central Co-operative stores in the province of Nijni Novgorod. During the investigation the Soviet inspectors discovered, besides bureaucratism and waste, a well-organized system of pilfering the products by party members who had been put at the head of the organizations and in charge of the whole business. Thus, for instance, the practice of <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the best grades of meat from distribution among the workers was well established and the meat was consumed by party members and high Soviet officials. This "blocking of products" was practiced also in regard to fowl, hams, best grades of sausage and other articles of food, and all food so reserved was distributed among Soviet and party officials occupying high posts in the province in quantities exceeding two or three times the amounts fixed by the government. Due to this, workers and employees received only half or less of what was prescribed by the law. For instance, the workers in the state industrial plants during the past three years have not received the full allowance of the meat products.</p>
   
   <p>At the same time pilfering of the state property is going on on every hand, and bribery is thriving. All this, of course, is done, not by workers, peasants, or employees, but by the Bolsheviks exclusively, for they are the ones who occupy the most responsible and lucrative positions. Honest nonparty men and women are not permitted by the Bolsheviks to hold such posts.</p>
   <p>No wonder, therefore, that the foreign journalists claim that in none of the capitalist countries is there such a cleavage of population into classes, and nowhere is this cleavage so rampant as in the Soviet Union, where supposedly a "classless society" is being formed.</p>
   <p>We are not surprised, therefore, that lately the hatred toward Bolshevism has grown apace. This is evidenced by the wave of Bolshevik terror that rolled over the country.</p>
   <p>The Soviet newspapers lately quite frequently print the news about assasination of responsible party members, but this information lifts only a corner of the curtain behind which is concealed a relentless and incessant struggle of the people against the Bolsheviks.</p>
