   <p>As was correctly noted in one of the Chicago articles, writes the author of this editorial, we are great egoists. Egoism creates intolerance and disdain for the convictions of others. A typical egoist - and there are many in our colony - is deeply convinced that only his view and understanding of some question or other is correct, and (that) other people's opinions and views are wrong and not worthy of any attention. It is no wonder if people like Milikov, Chernov, Kerensky, Stalin, Trotzky, and other professional politicians are fighting each other, but what good reasons have the Russians in Chicago to quarrel continually with each other? Probably not less than 99% of our colony are proletarians. They often work in the same factories, the same hours, and slave for the same capitalist, and in spite of all, these people in many cases are spending their energy and strength in fighting each other. There are more than 20,000 refugees from Constantinople, mostly cultured people. But even among the more educated part of the Russian colony one does not find any peace and harmony. Such an intolerant attitude <span class="page-break">2</span>leads only to a senseless waste of our spiritual powers, time and means. Instead of building and creating with united efforts, we preper to act single-handed.</p>
   <p>The editorial ends with the following words: "When shall we get wise and understand that our internal strife in the colony and this inhuman intolerance dooms our community to fruitless work?"</p>
