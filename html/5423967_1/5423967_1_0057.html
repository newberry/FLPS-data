   <p>On Tuesday, Dec. 29, 1925, Mr. Bernardo, a journalist, gave a lecture. His lecture was very interesting. The subject was, "Russia and America. "The character of the lecture was entirely non-political. The lecturer gave a sketch of the needs of the Russian colony, and pointed out that we must be entirely cured of our predilection for politics.</p>
   <p>"Politics," he said, "divide the members of the colony into cliques and bring dissensions into the life of the colony."</p>
   <p>Mr. Bernardo pointed out that the colony was tired of politics, and that in order to organize the Russian colony in America, to unify it, we should work energetically in benefit societies, cooperatives and such like organizations.</p>
   
   <p>He said further that the Russian colony was losing interest in politics and has begun to aspire after education. Many are attending schools and reading scientific books. Therefore - and Mr. Bernardo emphasized this thought - it is necessary to start doing work on the field of culture and enlightenment; to drop politics and to undertake constructive activities instead; to move from a state of being scattered like dust to a state of unification.</p>
   <p>The lecture proved to be interesting and besides also useful.</p>
