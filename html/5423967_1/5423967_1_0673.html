   <p>In the last issue of Novyi Mir (the Russian communist publication) the central committee of the American Communist party published an appeal to Russian workers, asking for contributions to the fund now being raised by the communists in order to change their Russian Novyi Mir from a weekly to a daily publication.</p>
   <p>The entire appeal had been formulated according to a familiar communist pattern, and was filled with radical stock phrases about capitalism, fascism, class consciousness, the necessity of defending the USSR, the coming revolution, and the united labor front. The appeal contained also the usual sally against Rassviet. Only three lines in this hackneyed ranting have caught our particular attention. In these three lines there is a statement to the effect that, as soon as enough money is collected and the daily <span class="page-break">2</span>Novyi Mir will have become an accomplished fact, the campaign will be started by this Russian language international sheet to "educate, to civilize, and to ennoble" the uncivilized and unlearned former Russian peasants, and to raise their cultural level. If we are to believe this statement, the Russian communist leaders in America will embark upon the destruction of the very things which they have hitherto so eagerly propagated among the Russian masses, namely, political ignorance, rowdiness, intolerance, and other symbols of Bolshevik culture. It goes without saying that it would be very nice indeed if one day all Russian Bolsheviks in this country would betake themselves to some good school in order to "liquidate" their illiteracy and their hopeless ignorance. It would also be good if they could raise their cultural level by learning the ABC of the political and economic science. Even the Russian communist leaders and writers themselves are terribly lacking in this fundamental knowledge. Their ignorance of the political and economic problems of our day is plainly evident from all their public utterances and from their writings. We wonder how the central committee of the American Communist party and the Russian Red Leaders may even attempt <span class="page-break">3</span>to raise the educational level of the rank-and-file communists at a time when the entire world-wide communist movement is based, primarily on the ignorance of the masses and on political banditry. Were there no illiteracy and no out-and-out ignorance in this world, there would be no place for communism. It was Lenin himself who once remarked quite justly that ninety per cent of all members of the Communist party are fools. But Lenin needed these fools, just as our American communist leaders need them.</p>
   <p>That the central committee of the American Communist party, as well as the Russian Red leaders, do not really want to educate the Russian workers, but to clean out their pockets, is plainly evident from the concluding statement of the appeal, in which the committee calls upon all Russian workers to collect the ten thousand dollars for Novyi Mir before October 1, and immediately afterward to start collecting sixty thousand dollars for the Daily Worker, the English language communist newspaper.</p>
   <p>From the foregoing facts it is not difficult to infer that all those Russians <span class="page-break">4</span>who really want to broaden their education and to raise their general cultural level should abandon, once and for all, the hooligan Bolshevik press, and should rally around Rassviet, whose slogan and chief aim may be expressed in three simple words: Liberty, Justice, Culture.</p>
