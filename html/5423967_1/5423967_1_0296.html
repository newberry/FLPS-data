   <p>The author of this article, Mr. B. Gerschenfeld, gives a very one-sided view of nationalism, not discriminating between true and legitimate nationalism, recognizing the individual characteristics and missions of each nationality, and false nationalism characterized by an unfair and haughty attitude towards all nationalities except one's own. He defines nationalism as essentially a form of 'group selfishness.' He concludes his article with the following words:</p>
   <p>"Thus nationalism, like patriotism, is a fanatical way of thinking and only religiously-minded people can believe in its capacity to endure. And if essentially it is not an obstacle to the progress of human society, it anyway does not further that progress. Therefore we must relegate nationalism to the category of already outlived ideas. For humanity at large nationalism is no more than a dead letter."</p>
