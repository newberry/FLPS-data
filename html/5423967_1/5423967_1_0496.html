   <p>The other day final approval was secured from the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Ickes, for the creation of an industrial and agricultural colony of needle workers near the city of Heightstown, New Jersey. This will be the first colony of its kind to be founded on co-operative principles.</p>
   <p>The colony, named "Jersey Homesteads," will have a plot of ground, 1,260 acres in area, located 45 miles from New York City and about the same distance from Philadelphia. The soil there is fertile and well suited to intensive agricultural development. At the same time the colony will be located near two large cities, and its industrial products will have easy access to the markets by light trucks.</p>
   <p>The colony will be built to accommodate two hundred families. The heads of these families are workers in various occupations in the clothing industry. The families have already been selected from one thousand applicants. Each <span class="page-break">\2</span>family will be provided with a house and one acre of land on payment of $500. The rest of the ground is reserved for the co-operative purposes. The main co-operative plant will consist of a well-equipped tailoring shop which will give work to all members for at least part of the year. The wages so earned will secure payments on the house and the land.</p>
   <p>The average cost of each homestead will be about $3,500. The monthly payments, including interest and amortization charges, will not exceed $14,75 and will extend over thirty years.</p>
   <p>Each settler will have his own house, consisting of five or six rooms with all conveniences, and his own garden and orchard.</p>
   <p>The farm will comprise about 500 acres and will include a dairy and a chicken farm. Accommodations are being made for one hundred cows and one hundred thousand chickens. The colony already has an orchard of 40 acres. Last year, crops from the fields and fruit trees yielded an income of $12,000.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Of the two hundred settlers, about one hundred and sixty are tailors, and fifteen are farmers. There are, besides, a doctor, a dentist, several teachers, mechanics, etc. Everything is arranged in such a way that the colony is self-contained and can get along without outside assistance in satisfying its immediate needs.</p>
   <p>The Federal government through its Department of Subsistence Homesteads is lending the project $850,000, out of which $160,000 will go toward equipping the industrial undertakings. The management of the colony will be entrusted to a special committee, two members of which must be members of the colony. Later on the colony will have its own management, which will be composed entirely of settlers.</p>
   <p>The famous physicist, Professor Einstein, is one of the persons actively interested in establishing such a co-operative, self-managing community. The sponsors of this colony set its aims as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>1. To demonstrate the possibility of decentralization in the industrial field, where the workers continue to live and work under sweatshop conditions in the factories and shops of crowded cities.</p>
   <p>2. To demonstrate the possibility of combining industrial and agricultural life.</p>
   <p>3. To carry out a co-operative experiment in which each of the participants taking part in the common effort would have his own home and his own small homestead.</p>
   <p>It is quite proper to emphasize that although most of the twenty-five-million-dollar fund appropriated by Congress for experiments in industrial homesteads has already been disbursed; only 555 families of unemployed have been settled on the soil. This spring will see an extension of the chain of such homesteads in a number of states.</p>
