   <p>The Russian Bolsheviks in America, like their comrades in Russia and in other countries, have been following the policy of continual attacks upon all non-communist organizations, as well as cultural and religious institutions. Their slogan has been, "Whoever is not with us is against us." "And who is against us," they argue, "should be mercilessly fought and finally destroyed." So they have been bending every effort, and using every means at their command, to bring about the downfall of those who oppose them. They have succeeded in Russia, where the government is in their own hands and where they can crush, with absolute impunity and in the name of the law, the slightest attempt at opposition. In America and in other foreign countries, however, the communistsâ€˜ total war upon our institutions has resulted in a complete fiasco.</p>
   <p>In recent weeks, however, the communists have decided to change their tactics.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Now they avoid the direct open attacks, but resort to underground methods. Evidently they have come to the conclusion that it is easier to destroy an institution or an organization by working surreptitiously, and by boring from within, rather than by attacking openly from without. At the latest convention of the Comintern (International Communist party) in Moscow, a resolution was passed that the communists in all parts of the world should cease open attacks on institutions, organizations, and individuals opposing the communist way of thinking, and, instead, should adopt a new method of procedure, new technique which, they say, will assure them a quicker and more complete victory. The resolution requires all communists in all foreign lands to join as members such organizations and institutions as they want to take over or destroy. The comrades must, from now on, try to win over by trick, graft, or persuasion, a sufficient number of members of a given organization to enable them to grab the reins of that organization into their own hands, or else to bring about dissension within its ranks, and afterwards its downfall. Because the Comintern wants also to square accounts with its fiercest enemy, the Church, the Red comrades all over the world received an order to join various religious organizations. It is logical, now, to expect <span class="page-break">3</span>that in the near future the Bolshevik agents will start to penetrate like bugs into the texture of our organizations and religious societies.</p>
   <p>This change, the sudden about face in the established methods of action of the Comintern is a direct challenge to all Russian organizations in America. Therefore, all Russian-American men responsible for the well-being of their organizations should be on the alert for the Red borers who will, no doubt, try, under the guise of feigned friendship, to make their way into the Russian organizations in-America, in order to start their insidious boring from within. If this danger is disregarded or made light of, the Red enemies may, in a short time, inflict irreparable damage upon Russian organizations, especially upon those of them whose members do not possess a sufficient amount of general education and political knowledge. Our watchfulness should not become lessened because of temporary quiet on the Red front in America, before the new communist offensive.</p>
