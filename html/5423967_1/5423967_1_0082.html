   <p>Should the Children of Russian Immigrants be Taught the Russian Language in Russian Schools? by Miss B. O. Pikhotskaya.</p>
   <p>The author of this article points out that young Americans who are graduated from high-schools know at least one other language than English, i.e. French, German, Spanish, or Latin; also that any young man or woman who knows some foreign language has a certain advantage when it comes to getting good employment, over one who knows only English. In public schools some foreign languages are also taught, but the Russian language is not among these. Lucky is the boy or girl who is born of German or French parents for he (or she) will have the opportunity to learn the language of the parents in school. Such is not the case with the children of Russian immigrants. Hence, argues the author, the necessity of Russian schools for children of Russian immigrants, where these children would learn the Russian language and literature, Russian history, etc.</p>
   <p>They would thus become more useful American citizens as they would be able to enrich the comparatively young American culture with the best achievements of Russian literature, art and science.</p>
