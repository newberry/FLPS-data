   <p>That which farsighted, progressive readers of Rassviet foresaw and wrote about has come to pass: the end came to R.N.O.V. [Russian People's Mutual Aid Society]. In the Novy Mir of December 30, Mr. Schkliar [editor of the Novy Mir] gives prominence to the following notice:</p>
   <p>"The Russian People's Society, which only recently affiliated with the International Workers' Order, is moving its main office from Philadelphia to New York, and will have its headquarters in the building owned by the parent organization. In connection with this, the executive committee of R.N.O.V. is mailing out a circular letter to all its members, in which they are advised that the formal ratification of the agreement took place on December 23. This action converts R.N.O.V. into an autonomous section of the International Order."</p>
   <p>After reading such an announcement we thought that Mr. Schkliar was dreaming, <span class="page-break">\2</span>but in the following issue of the same newspaper, under the title "An Act of Great Importance," the executive committee of the R.N.O.V., over the signatures of Popov, Iliukov, Andreiuk, Kazushchik, and Nikolaiuk, gave official notice of the action taken and repreated what had been already announced by the Novy Mr. In addition the executive committee advised the branch secretaries that applications for membership from now on should be filed on the forms used by the International Workers' Order, that the names of the branches and that of the R.N.O.V. itself should be eliminated and replaced by the numbers taken from the table of the International Order.</p>
   <p>In its issue of January 1, the Novy Mir rejoiced over the affiliation of R.N.O.V. with the International Workers' Order, and Mr. Schkliar devoted a whole article to the event. He wrote:</p>
   <p>"This affiliation strengthens the financial position of the organization which has been weakening since the almost total stoppage of immigration <span class="page-break">\3</span>from Russia and the consequent decrease in the number of young members, causing a rapid rise in the average age of the members of the R.N.O.V. The insufficient influx of younger people into the membership ranks of the Russian mutual aid societies is creating very serious problems for all of them, particularly for the small ones, unbalancing their financial position. By joining the International Workers' Order, R.N.O.V. has reacquired its former financial stability and solved its most pressing problem."</p>
   <p>If the memory of the rank-and-file members of R.N.O.V. serves them right, they can recall that when their Society was independent Mr. Schkliar sang nightingale songs to them, told them that they belonged to a powerful organization, and that their Society had been created for the benefit of Russian workers and was serving their interests well. Schkliar, to suit his purpose, made the members of the R.N.O.V. so class-conscious that they were even ready to rule America [although, in reality, they were not even able to preserve their own independence]. But when he had the bird in his hand, he began to laugh at them by telling them that they were weak <span class="page-break">\4</span>numerically and financially. This, of course, is only the beginning. Soon nothing will be left of the Society for the rank-and-file members follow blindly their false leaders. The executive committee of the R.N.O.V. workers' correspondents, and various blockhead Communists have done nothing worth while for Russian workers or for the Russian colony at large; and, besides, they have put in servitude that organization which was created by shortsighted Mr. A. Kurilovich.</p>
   <p>We, as a group of Russian colonists, deeply regret that a whole Russian society has gone off the scene of American Russia--a society which bore a Russian name; for it mignt have been otherwise if energetic farsighted Russian leaders had appeared and led the Society in the right direction. No nationality nor national group, be it ever so weak, wants to die voluntarily. Only Russian Communists, as a flock of sheep, reject everything that should be dear and ennobling in a nation's life. Even beasts and birds have attachment for their place of birth and their abode, and do not willingly surrender that which belongs to them. For that reason, we dare <span class="page-break">\5</span>say, Russian Communists occupy a lower level than animals; for even they have more compassion and take a more sensible attitude toward surroundings.</p>
   <p>The history of Russians in America will brand Russian Communists as a destructive and odorous element. The Society that has just died was called briefly R.N.O.V.; and these four letters recalled to Russians in America many things that were dear to their hearts. Under these initials persisted national spirit, attachment to their own people, and the deeply ingrained Russian sense of mutual assistance in a faraway land. But some evil fate has ordained that the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society shall lose its national identity; and so, instead of bearing its own proud Russian name, it will henceforth, as a criminal committed to jail, bear a number assigned by the International Workers' Order.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, many branches of the R.N.O.V. bore the names of great Russian men: poets, writers, national heroes, etc. All these names have been <span class="page-break">\6</span>abolished and are being obliterated on the walls of meeting places. Only memories will remain of these names. Their places will be taken by the dead numerals of the I.W.O., and the members of the R.N.O.V. will be counted as so many inanimate objects.</p>
   <p>Our motherland, Russia, has also lost her name; for it has been replaced by four initials--U.S.S.R. With a gunstock placed under the ribs by the O.G.P.U. agent our people, just as members of the R.N.O.V., ceased to call themselves Russians and are now called merely workers. But why should this have happened in the case of the R.N.O.V., here in America, where its members enjoy freedom of expression and action, where no secret agent of the O.G.P.U. is permitted to intimidate, or threaten death, or outrage people? Why should this Russian Society have lost its Russian name and given itself up to servitude and to be made a laughingstock? We regret that among the members of R.N.O.V. there were not any thoughtful and resourceful men who could have held in check their executive committee, which quietly and <span class="page-break">\7</span>without meeting any opposition handed R.N.O.V. over to the I.W.O.</p>
   <p>We do not want to play the role of prophets, but we say to Kazushchik [general secretary of R.N.O.V.] and his underlings that they will meet the fate of Mr. Kurilovich [one of the founders of the Society who was expelled from R.N.O.V. by the Communists after they gained control over the organization]. The I.W.O. will not retain them long. The Russian colony and the members of R.N.O.V. will long remember the names of Popov, Iliukov, Andreiuk, Kazushchik and Nikolaiuk--these betrayers of the Russian cause. These traitors will bear forever the onus of condemnation. They will be condemned by all Russian people even in generations to come. When they shall have been thrown out as useless rubbish, they will come back to their own people; but they will be shunned as if they were lepers. They will have no place in Russian social life, nor will they have any personal friends among their compatriots.</p>
   <p>Citizens, Russian men and women, Communists have always appealed to the <span class="page-break">\8</span>Russian people in the name of the Russian cause, in the name of R.N.O.V. Now they have no right to do so because they have no Russian organization under their control. From now on they will appeal in the name of the I.W.O, and continue to disrupt, if they can, Russian organizations.</p>
   <p>We appeal to all Russian organizations, and warn them to be on guard against these despoilers of Russian social and family life. Chase them out of your social circle, drive them away from your family, kick them--these Red intruders--out of your organizations.</p>
   <p>We are planning to have on April 26 an evening of entertainment in which, if possible, all Russian organizations will participate. We had intended to invite the several branches of R.N.O.V. in Chicago and vicinity, under the direction of their officials to take part in the arrangements for this affair. But now, since R.N.O.V. has liquidated as a Russian Society, we shall avoid it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>We wish to conclude our letter by extending our greetings to the glorious and unshakable organizations of the R.I.M.A.S. [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society] and the R.O.O.V.A. [R.C.M.A.S.--Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society]. Let them prosper. Brothers from R.O.O.V.A., from now on your ranks will grow very rapidly, for members of the R.N.O.V. will run away from the I.W.O. as rats from a sinking ship. To punish their betrayal, these deserters from I.W.O. should be made to subscribe either to Rassviet or the Russian Herald, for they meekly paid assessments for Novy Mir while belonging to R.N.O.V. after its affiliation with I.W.O. thus contributing from ten to twelve thousand dollars annually for the support of this Communist propaganda sheet. Had they subscribed to a decent Russian paper, these deserters would be able to partake of a mental health food and regain their Russian equilibrium, which they have lost while reading the Novy Mir.</p>
   <p>We address our request to all branch secretaries to include our letter in the order of the day for the next branch meeting and read it to its <span class="page-break">\10</span>members. Let your members know what Communist leaders do with Russian organizations. It's the duty of members of R.O.O.V.A. and R.I.M.A.S. to tell all Russians and members of R.N.O.V. that they are fortunate because of their membership in the R.O.O.V.A. or the R.I.M.A.S.--to organizations in which Communist influence is of little moment.</p>
