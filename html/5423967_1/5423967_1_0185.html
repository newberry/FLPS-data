   <p>In our previous articles, we have severely criticized the Russian organizations and the Russian colony in Chicago in general, for their failure to provide means and proper facilities for the upbringing and education of Russian-American youth in the Russian culture and in the language of their fathers. We have also admonished the parents for neglecting the Russian national side of the education of their children. We consider it now our duty to speak directly to you Russian young people in America.</p>
   <p>Some of you young men and young women of the Russian group in America have already reached the age of maturity. Some of you are still adolescents. Some of you have received a good education in American schools; many of you still continue your education. But only very few of you have had the opportunity to obtain proper Russian education. Yet, you are here to take our places in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>affairs and in the life of the Russian group in America.</p>
   <p>Today, when you are entering the new era of your life, have you considered, even in general outline, the future life of the young Russian-American generation? What are going to be the principal foundations of that life? Have you worked out a plan for your future activities? We, on our part, can offer you the following advice and suggestions, based on our life experience: The public life of the young Russian-American generation should be built exclusively on the foundation of the Russian national spirit, and should be based on Russian organizations in this country. The Russian organizations in this country can survive only as the result of the presence and growth of Russian national consciousness and Russian spirit among the Russian-American young people. An ample proof of the truth of this axiom may be found in the life of other national groups in this country.</p>
   <p>The better united, and the more conscious nationally, the people of a given country, the more powerful is the country. Such people may not fear dangers <span class="page-break">\3</span>from the outside. In our times, no nation in the world except Russia has allowed itself to become a helpless guinea pig for the experiment in internationalism. Therefore, no nation has suffered more than Russia from the results of this experimentation, only because the Russian people have allowed various international adventurers to get hold of the reins of the nation.</p>
   <p>For us Russians, the most striking instance of national unity to admire, and the best example to follow, is furnished by our Slav brothers, the Poles and the Czechs. The Poles and the Czechs in this country, because of their national unity and their highly developed national consciousness, have succeeded in winning for themselves a high and responsible place in American public life.</p>
   <p>You, young Russian people who now enter the new phase of your lives, will do well to base all your plans for the future on the Russian national cause in this country. We of the older generation will build the Russian schools, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and you of the younger generation will learn therein the Russian language, Russian literature and Russian art. You yourselves, however, should organize Russian clubs, where you can cultivate and develop the Russian spirit. All young Russian-Americans should remember that wherever they turn, whatever circle or organization they may try to join, everywhere they will be looked upon as strangers. For this reason the young Russian-American people should have their own organizations and their own clubs, and should be inspired by their own Russian cause. Those young Russian men and women who are sons and daughters of members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society may justly be proud of the things planned for them by their fathers. The new buildings of the Independent Society, which are now under construction at Wood Street, when finished, may serve for many years to come as the center for all the activities of the Russian-American Youth belonging to the Society.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, we appeal to all Russian-American youth in this country to learn the Russian language, to become imbued with Russian spirit, then get <span class="page-break">\5</span>together, join the organizations of your fathers, organize your own schools, clubs, dramatic circles, orchestras. You can count on aid and advice from us, the elders.</p>
