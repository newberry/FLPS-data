   <p>In the olden times people in Russia would speak of America in a somewhat disparaging way.</p>
   <p>"The land of buying and selling! A soulless country! The land of machines and dollars!"--such characterizations of America could be heard very often in the olden times.</p>
   <p>Comparatively little was written about the ideals of this "soulless country", about its political structure, its fabulously swift progress.</p>
   <p>In the years subsequent to the war the attitude of Russians towards America was very considerably changed.</p>
   <p>Many Russian scientists, writers and prominent journalists began to talk and write a great deal about America.</p>
   <p>And their appreciations of this country were more in harmony with the truth. Behind the seeming soullessness a soul was discovered. People would speak with enthusiasm about the Americans business ability, American political institutions and principles, and the fabulous development of American technique.</p>
   <p>This change of attitude was greatly enchanced by the following circumstance; while at that time our old Europe had become stagnant in all respects, in America a continual progress could be observed both in technique and in the realm of spiritual achievement.</p>
   <p>In connection with all this many prominent Russian scientists and writers foretell an alliance of the two great countries: the United States and Russia.</p>
   <p>As to that a very striking statement has been made by the writer Gusev Orenburgsky who is now in Chicago. His article, entitled "Russia and America", has appeared on the pages of the almanac Vremennik.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gusev Orenburgsky discusses in this article the problems of the Russian immigrants in America. Then, taking up the subject of America, he says what follows:</p>
   <p>"But American society must also help its guests--the Russian workmen. Because in the nearest future there will arise a natural alliance--that of Russia and America. For a long time already it seemed as if hands belonging to brothers have been stretched towards each other across the Bering straits. Soon these hands will clasp each other firmly. This will be achieved by the building of a railroad bridge of which the project has been worked out already a long time ago. These hands will be clasped in token of a perpetual and fruitful friendship; and the light kindled by this friendship will attract also all the rest of the world which has gone astray. The two countries--Russia and America-- are sisters. They are the two greatest powers of the world, with totally different cultures which seem to complement each other in principle. The greatest, the most fabulous material technique--such is the culture of America. The greatest achievements and victories in the realm of spirit--such is the culture of Russia. Both countries need each other; and, foreseeing in the future a natural alliance with the purpose of exchanging the gifts of their cultures, these two countries should begin to cooperate with each other in a friendly way. From this standpoint we, Russians, are friends of America who have come from a great country; the two countries are sisters and allies. And therefore American society, in the person of its organizations should come to the rescue of Russian immigrants and refugees. It should help them not only by giving them the possibility of devoting their forces to the common work, of living and grappling with life in their own way, but also by assisting them in all possible ways to learn all the details of some special work, and also by giving them the opportunity of developing their capacities to the utmost.</p>
   <p>This is the way of thinking of many prominent Russians at the present time. In Russia they are eagerly expecting now the restoration of friendly relations with America.</p>
   <p>The day when the two greatest republics of the world, Russia and the United States, will be united for a perpetual and fruitful friendship will be a bright Holiday for Russia and all Russian citizens.</p>
