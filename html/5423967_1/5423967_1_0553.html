   <p>During the years of economic depression, the Federal and State authorities have spent immense sums of money for direct relief to the unemployed. Only an insignificant number of the unemployed were placed on public works construction projects, while the great multitude of the jobless received direct financial aid from the Federal or State government.</p>
   <p>According to the latest reports from Washington, direct relief to the unemployed will be discontinued with the end of this year. The Roosevelt Administration, after a thorough study of the relief problem, has come to the conclusion that direct financial aid to the unemployed has too many objectionalbe features and should be discontinued. Henceforth, only invalids and those physically unable to do any work will be eligible to direct relief. All others must work <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>for their money.</p>
   <p>The labor unions and other working-class organizations have also voiced their objections to the continuation of the direct relief system.</p>
   <p>This general opposition to direct relief for the unemployed may be explained by the following facts:</p>
   <p>1. The people as a whole do not receive anything in exchange for the great sums of money spent for relief--money which the government takes from them in taxes.</p>
   <p>2. Cash relief is humiliating to those who are forced by circumstances to accept it for any length of time. It places able-bodied men in the position of paupers depending upon society for their support. Self-respecting workers hate to live on public donations; they want to have a steady, well-earned income and to live a normal, decent life.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>3. Continued financial aid received regularly over a long period of time tends to demoralize the recipients. Gradually they develop a dislike for work, and they begin to shun all effort. They become truly afraid, not of the continuation of the economic crisis but of its passing, because then they may lose their relief money and may be forced to work for their living.</p>
   <p>4. As a result of taking hundreds of thousands of men off public relief rolls and putting them on public works projects--on the construction of roads, bridges, buildings, parks, and other improvements--, a large demand will be created for a wide variety of materials, the production of which will give additional employment to thousands of men in private mills, factories, shops, railroads, etc.</p>
   <p>These public works projects, which are to be developed in many cities and towns, in the fields and forests, and on the rivers, may cost the government and the people of the United States billions of dollars. The whole nation, however, will be able to see and appreciate the tangible results of these great <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>expenditures. Instead of receiving money for doing nothing, the unemployed now on relief will create new material values, new wealth, and will receive for their work some definite remuneration.</p>
   <p>When Congress convenes, President Roosevelt will ask the legislators to appropriate twelve billion dollars for the five-year public works program proposed by the President.</p>
   <p>In addition, a broad plan of social legislation is in the offing. The proposed legislation, such as the social security and unemployment insurance acts, if and when enacted, will change the entire social structure of the United States, and no doubt will give much-needed economic protection to the American workers.</p>
   <p>All the foregoing facts foreshadow great social reforms which will soon descend upon this country, and which will improve the lot of the American working people.</p>
