   <p>The Soviet government, following in the steps of Nicholas II, has restored the state monopoly of the sale of liquors.</p>
   <p>As in the days of old, taverns will flourish in Holy Russia; only on the shields of these taverns, the coat of arms will be different. Instead of the double-headed eagle, there will be emblazoned the sickle and the hammer.</p>
   <p>The people will be besotted, not with the tsar's vodka, but with Soviet vodka. All the rest will be just the same as it was before: drunkenness, ignorance produced by it, and the filching of hundreds of millions of roubles from the peasants' pockets for the "needs" of the government.</p>
   <p>If to this state monopoly of the sale of whiskey we add the intolerance of the Soviet authorities to all those who oppose their ideas, their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>denial of the freedom of conscience, speech and the press, we must come to the conclusion that there is no difference whatever between the Soviet government of the communists and the government of the tsar.</p>
   <p>One is involuntarily reminded of the anecdote which tells how Lenin and Trotsky have been wandering in Russia along the by-ways, took a road leading to the right and came to the Nikolayevskaya highway.</p>
