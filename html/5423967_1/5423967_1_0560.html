   <p>Resolved: That the Supreme Assembly of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, which convened in regular session on the 17th day of May, A.D. 1931, at Walsh's Hall, 1014 North Noble Street, Chicago, Illinois, go on record and state that it is our belief that all Russian Mutual Aid Societies in America, which do not pursue any political ends and whose sole aim is the fraternal aid and assistance to their members, should unite into one great fraternal organization avoiding the present competition of similar societies, and presenting a united effort, to ease the existing industrial crisis, and to reach farther with its moral and material support.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved that we, the delegates of 2,000 wage earners constituting the Society, believe it to be to the best interest of the people of the United States that the National Legislative Body should take immediate steps to relieve the unemployment situation, and that we, the delegates, strongly urge, recommend and endorse the enactment of National, State and <span class="page-break">\2</span>Municipal legislation the purpose of which is to procure additional employment and thus to end the long depression.</p>
   <p>Be it further resolved that copies of this Resolution be sent to His Excellency. Herbert Hoover, the President of the United States, to each member of the Congress in whose states and districts the Society has branches, and to the Russian Press of Chicago.</p>
