   <p>In the twelve months from July 1, 1880, to [June 30], 1881, 210,000 Germans came to the United States, besides some 40,000 Austrians and Swiss, who are considered Germans in this country. No special emphasis need be placed on how highly welcome this influx is to our German-Americans because every new contingent of a hundred thousand Germans delays the Yankee intention to Yankeeize all immigrants and makes it certain that our future Americanism will have a definite, fair, proportionate German element.</p>
   <p>In Germany, however, the nonsensical opinion still seems to prevail that the emigration to America represents a misfortune, or at least a great loss to the German Empire. For years the people abroad have figured that every capable German worker represented a capital of so many thousand reichsmarks, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and that through this emigration the Reich was losing millions and even billions in actual money.</p>
   <p>This conception, in the main, is traceable to the old ideas which prevailed about free trade, which, however, have now been proved to be in the main fallacious by the crash of 1873. The theory maintains that a nation is wealthy only in proportion to the productive capacity of its people without regard to the consumption of goods--the ability to buy. This doctrine is really antiquated; it teaches that a man can produce so much in goods, and hence he is worth so much, and that value is lost if he leaves the country.</p>
   <p>Although such reasoning appears to be very simple, it is also highly misleading since the main factor is entirely lost sight of. The chief problem arising is this: Can the labor be utilized? A bag full of pearls is not worth so much to a famished man in the desert as a canteen of water, and if a land has an oversupply of labor, then an ever-increasing number of additional <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>laborers whose work cannot be utilized will be a curse and not a blessing.</p>
   <p>If the matter is considered from this angle, then one must conclude that Germany ought to be very glad to find an outlet for its surplus workers instead of lamenting the constant emigration. Germany's over-population and the evils arising therefrom will at least be somewhat mitigated if some of its people go to America.</p>
   <p>After all, is there any danger of Germany's becoming overpopulated? Professor Ruemelin of Tuebingen says definitely yes, and he gives the following reasons:</p>
   <p>"In the nine years from 1871 to 1880 there were 11,000,000 deaths in the German empire and nearly 16,000,000 births. This gross increase of 5,000,000 means an actual increase of 4,135,000; the remainder, 865,000, leave the country. This is equivalent to the population of a large state, comparable to the annexation of a new province more populous than Alsace-Lorraine, Baden, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and Hesse and representing an addition of one tenth to the nation's total population, but there is no increase in area in this instance."</p>
   <p>Ruemelin estimates the increased national expenditures arising therefrom at 1240 million marks yearly, since he figures the per capita need at 300 marks per year. Translating these figures into requirements, drain on national resources, food, etc., then one may peruse the estimates given by Viebahn thirty years ago, when he established the average person's needs. He considered the following figures as the minimum requirements per person per annum: 362 pounds of grain, 51 pounds of meat, 360 liters of milk, 60 eggs, 21.15 pounds of wool, 5 yards of linen, and 16 yards of cotton goods. If these figures are multiplied by the actual increase in population, 4,135,000, then we need today 14,968,700 hundredweight more of grain than was required in 1871, 2,108,850 hundredweight more of meat, 1,488,600,000 more liters of milk, 248,000,000 more eggs, 9,000,000 more pounds of cotton, 20,000,000 more yards of linen, and 66,000,000 more yards <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of cotton goods. The additional grain alone requires 1,750,000 acres of land, and 1,000,000 more milch cows must be provided.</p>
   <p>Ruemelin feels convinced that German agriculture cannot cope with the increase in population, that is, that it cannot increase agricultural production accordingly. Germany's dependence on imports to support its people is therefore bound to mount continually. According to the present average rate of increase in the population, Germany will have 50,500,000 people within the next ten years and nearly 57,000,000 inhabitants toward the end of the century. [Translator's note: Germany had 56,000,000 people in 1900 according to the census report.] Is the national increase in wealth sufficient to meet the demands of a larger population? Industry and commerce would have to solve the problem; but are these branches of our economic order able to provide a solution at this time? And what about the future, with its ever mounting demands? The additional amount of labor which is provided by each separate individual must be taken into account, of course; but these workers produce <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>no food, and the industrial products must be exported and find a market in foreign lands. Is there any possibility that this market will always be available, now that North America and Australia, for instance, are already becoming industrial countries, and tariff rates will [soon] be raised every where? Are there prospects that sales will be greater? And do not the German people, in part, already live on the capital which they saved in better times?</p>
   <p>None of these significant questions are satisfactorily answered either by the liberal element which favors free trade or by the followers of Bismarck's economic reform policies. At best, if industrial values rise in Germany, the nation will steadily approach the status of England, which is entirely dependent on imported food. But there still would be one great difference: England, even now, has foreign markets and can readily dispose of its products, but Germany must first find an outlet, and as long as Germany follows the principle of "cheap and shoddy", it will be difficult, if not impossible, <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>to do business in foreign countries.</p>
   <p>All the bad features in Germany's economic life are attributable to over-population, according to Professor Ruemelin. The decline in business, the oversupply of workers in all vocations and trades, the horde of middlemen trying to eke out an existence and the ruthless competition arising there from, vagrancy in all its phases, increase in crime--it is all explained by Ruemelin as a by-product of overpopulation. He knows of no remedy. Laws appertaining to marriage, industry, and relief may help somewhat but would not be sufficient. At long last he points to a natural regulation--want. Since hunger and love rule the world according to Schiller, his Swabian countryman expects that these two, instead of working in harmony, will eventually counteract each other and thus save the world.</p>
   <p>The French are not waiting for this eventual contest between hunger and love, and therefore they practice birth control to some extent. Much has <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>been written about French families and their disinclination to have more than two children; in fact, the literature on the subject is virtually a flood of moral indignation. Nevertheless so much is irrefutable:</p>
   <p>France's economic superiority over Germany is definitely the result of this system. If Germany during the last ten years had been less busy raising children, then the economic situation of the nation would not present so unfavorable an aspect. Considerable expense is entailed up to the time when children reach their earning period, and if they die before that time, all the money spent on them is lost.</p>
   <p>As long as Germany feels proud of its prolific families and its increase, it must be content with the great exodus confronting the country and even be glad of it. Of course, the great majority of the people who leave Germany are grown up and capable of earning whereas the natural increase not only produces nothing in the first fifteen to eighteen years but actually requires expenditure. Nevertheless it is better that emigrants should make <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>room for the new generation than that they should remain and increase unemployment. To illustrate: the prevention or restriction of emigration from Germany would be just as disastrous to the nation as it would be to interfere with the free drainage of matter accumulating within a sick person. Such a procedure would cause blood poisoning. Instead of denouncing emigration to America German statesmen should be glad that fortuitous circumstances have provided a land which can absorb Germany's surplus population and thus mitigate the serious situation which now confronts the country.</p>
