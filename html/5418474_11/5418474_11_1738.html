   <p>Mr. Walter Groves here, received this morning the following telegram from Springfield:-</p>
   <p>"My dear Groves:-</p>
   <p>The Governor has authorized me to inform the representatives of the Chicago Labor Unions that he will speak on Labor Day. But we expects, that the organized laborers keep order in every way and under no circumstances permit any uproarious demonstrations. I therefore hope, that absolute order will rule and that the parade will become the most magnificient that has ever been arranged for such occasions.</p>
   <p>In hurry</p>
   <p>George E. Schilling."</p>
