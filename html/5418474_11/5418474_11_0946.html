   <p>The thirtieth anniversary of the German nation's regeneration under the leadership of an emperor, was celebrated yesterday evening by the members of our local veterans clubs at the North Side Turner Hall. Although the veterans are lan-abiding citizens loyal to their newly adopted country, they nevertheless have the right to celebrate this important historical day, which has been of such tremendous significance to Germanism. They fought during that epochal period to attain the unification of Germany, and others who were too young at the time to participate in the conflict, became recruits later and are still proud of having belonged to the best army of the world.</p>
   <p>The former soldiers were by no means the only ones who celebrated; hundreds of Germans, with an enduring sentiment for their native hearth, came to commemorate the event.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The Arrangement Committee, consisting of members of the German Warriors Club of Chicago, the Landwehrverein [Reserves, the older contingents], Alliance of German Veterans, Association of German Comrades at Arms, German Veterans Club of Chicago, the Warriors Club of Town of Lake, the South Chicago Warriors Club, and the Lake View Warriors Club did their utmost to provide an excellent program and left nothing undone to promote the festival in a manner befitting the occasion.</p>
   <p>The hall was splendidly decorated with green garlands and the flags of these and other military clubs.</p>
   <p>Great enthusiasm prevailed throughout the festival, and when the presiding official, Wilhelm Schmidt, acclaimed Germania and Columbia, i. e., the German Kaiser and the President of the United States, a mighty roar filled the immense hall, a thunderous release of pent up emotions, the like of which is not often heard. We noted a repetition of this intense public approval when the German <span class="page-break">3</span>consul, Dr. Walter Wever, ended his masterly, patriotic speech with a "Hail to America," and asked the assembly to sing the "Star Spangled Banner," a request to which everyone gladly and enthusiastically complied.</p>
   <p>The festivities commenced promptly at eight o'clock. Kretschmar's "Coronation March" was selected for the introductory number, followed by Weber's "Jubilee Overture," whereupon Wilhelm Schmidt addressed the assembly:</p>
   <p>"Esteemed festival participants [Verbatim]: Thirty years ago, the Germans conquered their hereditary enemy. At that time, they brought into captivity more than one half of the French army, including Emperor Napoleon and his famous marshals, and surrounded proud, royal Paris with an iron belt. The German officers, leaders of a victorious army, entered the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles, remnant of the bygone glory of the once almighty Ludwig XIV. Downtrodden Germany consisted of a heterogeneous assembly of states. It was molded into a brotherly unit through the creation of an empire, <span class="page-break">4</span>which orginated in the palatial environs of Versailles. There the King of Prussia became Emperor of Germany.</p>
   <p>"'We wish to be a single people, but brothers all, never separating in danger and distress.' Thus resounded the troth in the halls of the great castle.</p>
   <p>"It was King Ludwig II, of Bavaria, who magnanimously accepted the proposals of the Great Bismarck and the German potentates, presenting the emperor's crown to the King and hero, Wilhelm I, of Prussia. Through this act, the Hohenzollern family became the hereditary imperial ruler of Germany. [The name "Hohenzollern" means "High Tariff."]</p>
   <p>"The old Prussian King, who had led the united German army to repeated victories, accepted the imperial emblem and promised, in his inauguration speech in the presence of the German leaders and generals, that he should always defend Germany's <span class="page-break">5</span>cause and honor.</p>
   <p>"After this festive act, wherein circumstances conspired that the German army should represent the German people, Germany became united again, a single nation led by one leader, the Emperor.</p>
   <p>"The glad tidings traveled fast and far everywhere, and reached even this land, where the Germans had commenced to create a name for themselves. The occurrence brought a happy response abroad and here, as the Germans knew that reuniting of the various German peoples is destined to give the nation the rank and place it deserves in the world, position to which it has been entitled for centuries.</p>
   <p>"And the German government, the German Emperor, proved it during the last thirty years, and has not forgotten the peregrinating countrymen who, in the interim, became citizens of other nations.</p>
   <p>"When the oldest German Veterans Club of the United States, the German Warriors <span class="page-break">6</span>Club of Chicago, asked the former emperor, Wilhelm I, in 1876, to honor the association with a flag, the great leader did not hesitate. He sent the precious gift to Mr. Claussenius, German consul in Chicago, requesting him to present it to the club in His Majesty's name.</p>
   <p>"At that time a huge throng of Chicago Germans appeared. It happened in this hall where we now celebrate the new birth of Germany.</p>
   <p>"And the present Emperor, Wilhelm II, has also followed the precedent of his departed, noble grandfather. When, in the year 1899, the German Ambassador von Holleben submitted the wish of the Central Alliance of the German Military Clubs of Chicago and vicinity to the Emperor, His Majesty did not hesitate, Emperor Wilhelm II sent the present to the local consulate, and requested that the chief respresentative of the German nation in America shall give it to the Central Alliance in the name of His Majesty. His Excellency von Holleben gladly complied, and conveyed the Emperor's greetings to the former members of his army.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"During the presentation address, the ambassador said: 'His Majesty is fully aware that the comrades of the Central Alliance are mostly citizens of the United States, but he desires above all that they shall show the same sterling qualities as American citizens as it behooves their former standing as German soldiers and burghers.' This then expresses the Emperor's definite wish.</p>
   <p>"Now, gentlemen, I feel certain that we have heeded his desire in the past and shall follow it in the future. We are loyal citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>"But our love and esteem for our old Fatherland, the native shores, Germania, will never disappear, and that is why we congregate here today to celebrate the re-creation of Germany, the thirtieth anniversary of German unification under a single leadership.</p>
   <p>"The military clubs which arranged the festivities asked me to bid you welcome. I gladly accede to this request, and on this occasion let us acclaim our old <span class="page-break">8</span>Mother, Germania, and our new Mother, Columbia. I ask you to rise and repeat the acclamation, 'Germania, the German Empire and its great leader, Emperor Wilhelm II; and Columbia, which gave us such a friendly reception, the glorious Republic of the United States and its representative, the President, Hail! Hail! Hail!"</p>
   <p>After the tumultuous response subsided, E. L. F. Gauss, assistant librarian, recited the prologue, a masterly poem of his own creation, which brought well nigh unending applause.</p>
   <p>'Though hundred years ago,</p>
   <p>Germany had great men,</p>
   <p>And the World became aware</p>
   <p>Of what the German mind created;</p>
   <p>Though we had ambitious youths,</p>
   <p>Likewise German faith and duty;</p>
   <p>Though one spoke of German virtue,</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Germany did not exist.</p>
   <p>Disintegrated within its boundaries,</p>
   <p>The sordid fate of a glorious land;</p>
   <p>Whilst the cultured contemplated,</p>
   <p>And the brave strained their fists.</p>
   <p>It remained apathetic, dormant,</p>
   <p>Enshrouded by midnight dreams.</p>
   <p>Frogs croaked in dismal swamps;</p>
   <p>The people were not aroused.</p>
   <p>Motivated by special interests,</p>
   <p>Everyone lived in a small state.</p>
   <p>It provided food,</p>
   <p>And a small harvest.</p>
   <p>Of what concern are the others,</p>
   <p>Who cares for a Fatherland?</p>
   <p>If he does not prosper,</p>
   <p>He merely, merrily migrates.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>[Altogether, ten verses, classical in conception and expression, in which the poet compares the German Kaiser of the 1870-71 period to Moses, who united his people. He speaks of the coronation in the enemy's stately hall, Versailles, France; of the German eagle on the nation's coat of arms, and ends by saying, "The last century gave us a mighty heritage, a fatherland, magnificent and astounding. Let us again proclaim our affection on this thirtieth anniversary."</p>
   <p>Hermann Dietz, the well-known German baritone, sang and was rewarded with great applause. He selected an aria by Milloeker, "Black Clouds."</p>
   <p>Then the orchestra played "Militaria," a medley by Stetefeld, after which followed the address of Dr. Walter Wever, German consul. Let it be recorded here, that the Consul's speech was interrupted constantly with outbursts applause. "The Star Spangled Banner" was the next number on the program, <span class="page-break">11</span>the entire assembly participating.</p>
   <p>Dr. W. Wever's Speech</p>
   <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen. The program lists the song "Germany, Germany above all," but I ask you, with due permission of the Chairman, to sing the American National Anthem, "The Star Spangled Banner," because my speech is dedicated to your new Fatherland. You know, that as consul, it is one of my principal duties to promote amity and do my share in the furtherance of mutual good will between the two nations. The manner whereby such reciprocal sentiments may be attained, depends on the countless and ever present daily occurrences; even chance.</p>
   <p>"Words cannot define it, but formalities, such as the present festivity, are calculated to foster such friendly relations.</p>
   <p>"The founding of the German Empire, in the midst of the Old World, created a <span class="page-break">12</span>nation which no other power dared attack during the last three decades, and, likewise, it produced an empire which is self-sufficient and shows no inclination for aggrandizement through conquests. This dual status also created the tremendous commerce which is such a blessing to the New and Old World, a fact of incalculable significance, particularly to these two nations, whose fortunes are so closely interwoven, that our festivities cannot be emphasized enough, especially in foreign countries. My vocation necessitated considerable traveling. I saw a large part of Europe, South America, and lately the United States of North America; and everywhere I made the same observation: The German was only tolerated in foreign countries, but since the unification of Germany he became an honored, respected member of his community.</p>
   <p>"May you be ordained to bring increasing honor to your German origin, here, in America. The German West already is regarded as a mighty factor in American politics, and Chicago, German Chicago, is classified as the astounding city of this wonderland. The entire world centers its attention on this mercantile <span class="page-break">13</span>empire, a ceaseless force of mental and physical labor. Allow me, as a non-American, to give tribute in common with the universal admiration, and let us all proclaim, 'The new homeland, America, may it endure for ever!'"</p>
   <p>Professor von Klenze's Speech</p>
   <p>"We are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the German empire....The ungratified yearning of centuries, the dream of German patriots, have reached fruition; it appears now in all its splendor, the new empire, a young colossus after ceaseless striving. The promises have been, fulfilled. No country, not even the recently founded cultural nations, surpass it in its superabundant vitality.</p>
   <p>"Mightily it developed, and nowhere does it take a secondary place in the great race for supremacy. But this emblem of strength is not detrimental to other people; time and again this great power asserted itself to assure <span class="page-break">14</span>the peace of Europe.</p>
   <p>"Never has a nation been more justified to look with pride and gratitude upon its statesmanship than Germany, after it realized a unification of its separate factions. People, as a whole, have something in common with individuals. Some are blessed with constant development and reach their goal quickly, whereas others are doomed to long, incessant labors, endless disappointments, and, when courage reaches its lowest point, success appears at last ....</p>
   <p>"May God grant continued growth to Germany during the ensuing centuries; may it always be a protectorate of the weak and the pride of the strong!"</p>
   <p>His rhetorical masterpiece was rewarded with unstinted, merited recognition.</p>
   <p>The assembly then sang "We Shall Remain Steadfast and True." The Male chorus <span class="page-break">15</span>added "The Faithful German Heart."</p>
   <p>The final vocal selection was Mr. Dietz's solo, "The Wanderer's Song," which aroused intense enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>Dueppeler's "Trench March" ended the program, that is, its official part.</p>
   <p>A ball followed, and the younger element remained until dawn.</p>
   <p>Mayor Carter H. Harrison was present.</p>
   <p>Finally, we may add that the leader of the 58th Infantry Regiment, Roderich A. von Manstein, a witness of the coronation at Versailles, was among yesterday's celebrants. He is the proud owner of the Iron Cross of the Second Class and the Red Eagle Medal, with swords; honorary awards for his prowess in 1870 and 1866.</p>
   <p>The following telegrams were received in the course of the evening:</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>A message of regret from Mr. Holleben, Washington, D. C., who is detained and therefore cannot be present...</p>
   <p>Reminiscent greetings of the Central Alliance of German Warriors and Veterans, Philadelphia, Pa.</p>
