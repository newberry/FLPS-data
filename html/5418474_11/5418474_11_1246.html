   <p>The City of Chicago honored the merits of this American of German descent, in a most appreciative way, by naming the first real thoroughfare "Wacker Drive".</p>
   <p>Charles Wacker was born August 29, 1856 in Chicago of German parentage. After finishing school he studied at the universities of Stuttgard, Germany, and Geuf, Switzerland. He traveled extensively through the United States, Europe and Africa. Later he took active part in his father's business, the Wacker and Birk Brewing and Malting Company.</p>
   <p>He has two sons, Frederick and Charles H. Jr. The number of societies of which Charles Wacker was a member, cannot be given in a few words. As a real estate dealer he was a member of many outstanding organizations of his profession, and many societies and clubs besides, can count him as a member.</p>
   <p>Forever, his name will be tied to the Germania Club and especially more so with the Chicago Singverein whose president he was for many years. The SchabenVerein counted him as a member for 47 years.</p>
