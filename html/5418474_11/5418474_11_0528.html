   <p>The entire evidence for those who favor the "Lodge-bill" is based on these two sentences. 1.) Immigrants who are not educated are undesirable; 2.) Undesirable Immigrants are those who are not educated. And for each of these two sentences, its defenders have no proof. We are the last who would belittle a good school-education. In the first instance, the required proof of education (the evidence that one can read or write) is not an assurance, that one has been properly tutored, that one can think independently and reach sensible (logical) conclusions. Secondly, a school education, even the best, is not the primary cause why immigration has always been necessary, in former years as well as to-day. Where is the state in the Union, who would not prefer 100,000 strong fisted, healthy farmers, who know how to cut timber, pull stumps and convert the wilderness into tillable farms, to a similar number or even one tenth of this sum, of writers, bookkeepers, schoolteachers, lawyers or other literary and cultured individuals? Is there anywhere a city or state in this country where there is a dearth of store or office help, or any other kind of work where the knowledge of reading and writing are of most importance? Are not these the labors to which the native youth rushes? The efforts, which are regarded as "genteel" where no exertion of the body is needed, where the young man(or Mr. Boy)can take good care of his hands, manicure his fingernails and where his clothes enable him to play the "dude." Do the United States suffer from an insufficient supply of "Clerks" and"Bookkeepers", stenographers and typewriting artists or do we need people with muscular arms and strong fists, who are able and willing, to perform the arduous, disagreeable and dangerous labors, which the mass of the indigenous Americans shuns? Do we need more agents, "office-sitters" and desk-ink blotters or more people who know how to handle a pick and shovel? Who, in the future is to extract the coal from the dark recesses of the earth, or build railroad enbankments in the torrid heat of the sun, dig canals, pave the streets and remove the dirt , if the dispised, "ignorant" foreigners who always did this work, are not allowed to come to our shores? Their presence which is greatly to be appreciated made it possible for the native American to select the more pleasant, easier, the better and more profitable callings. Somebody must do this manual work. If they are not performed by the immigrants, then they must be done by the natives, and the American laborers will have to retreat, while heretofore they rode onward and upward on the banks of the ignorant foreigners, who always held the lowest jobs. For such dirty work which has always been done by the despised "Huns and Dagos" and others of their ilk but which the native and the better educated and skilled immigrant laborers disdain to do, for such work, it is surely not absolutely necessary to have that school education, without which no one is to be given admission. It is plain nonsense, that the unschooled immigrant is undesirable, merely, because he is not educated.</p>
   <p>The second sentence is not any better, which describes the undesirable immigrants as uneducated. We know of no more undesirable workers than those who shy away from honest work, the lazy and the vermin who "with the aid of their smartness" live at the expense of others, the cheaters, counterfeiters, thieves and other crooks of all sorts. And these, as a rule are not recruited from the ignorant class. To the contrary the higher their degree of education the more dangerous they become to the community.</p>
   
   <p>The mass of the immigrant always consisted of honest, capable, and willing workers, regardless of their school-learning. There is no evidence to prove why the immigration of the next century should not be as useful to this land as it has been during the past hundred years. There is no reason for a legal restriction, since experience has shown, that immigration controls itself, whenever our conditions make an influx of labor unprofitable. If the gentlemen Lodge and Associates really have such great fear of the people who lack schooling, then above all things, they ought to fight the ignorance in their own country where a rich field is available.</p>
   <p>The largest is there, where the native American is least affected by immigration.</p>
