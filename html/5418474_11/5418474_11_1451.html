   <p>Peter Bratzen the Democratic Candidate for the city treasury may prepare a surprise for his rival.</p>
   <p>His reputation as Building Commissioner under the Dunne administration from 1905-1907 is unimpeachable; equally his Presidency of the County-board in the following years, although the hostile press gave him the nickname,"Battling Pete."</p>
   <p>Only a few Germans know of his generosity towards the poor Germans during his official position in the County administration. Many Germans are of the opinion that five terms of office are sufficient for a Mayor of the City, but six terms are too many for a family.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that over 655,000 registered citizens will vote.</p>
