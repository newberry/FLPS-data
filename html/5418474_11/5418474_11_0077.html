   <p>The German clergy, we regret to say, is only weakly represented in the labors of aid and reconstruction that need so many helpers. In the German Aid Society, according to our information, only two clergymen are active, all the others so far have kept away. This is all the more to be regretted as public invitations to share in the work have not been lacking. The Relief and Aid Society and its special committee have not seen much of German clergymen. A single case has occurred in which a German preacher who formerly had never bothered about charity work, asked for support for his flock. He answered that he had to use the usual avenues.</p>
   <p>That the German clergymen provide for their community members from money put at their disposal by outside communities is very likely; but they also should assume a part of the work for the common good as the present emergency demands it, and should not retire with indifference into their own sphere.</p>
