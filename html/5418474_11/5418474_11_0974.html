   <p>"I received lately many complaints about people, using the German Eagle or Imperial Coat of Arms on letterheads, various stationery and literature for business-propaganda and even for fraudulent purposes. I am investigating all reported cases individually and want to make it known, that I am the only authorized German Consul for the following territory: North and South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin and Wyoming. My office is located on the 5th floor of the Kedzie Building, 120 E. Randolph Street. Any person using my name, office or Imperial Seal, is guilty of misrepresentation and will be prosecuted without delay. I owe this publication to the interest of all Germans and German-Americans of the said territory."</p>

   <p>German Consul.</p>
