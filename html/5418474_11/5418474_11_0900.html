   <p>Local Austrian and German consulate have practically abandoned plans for transporting reservists to Europe. Hugo Sylvestin, Austrian consul, expressed the opinion yesterday that it would be impossible while war is in progress to send Austrian reserves in America to the aid of the fatherland. Baron Kurt Von Reiswitz, the German consul, gave out an interview discouraging German reservists from making futile efforts to reach their native country. Unless the situation clears it will be impossible for the 4,000 men who have registered at the two consulates to comply with the imperial commands calling them to service.</p>
   <p>It was hinted that possible interference with transports by Great Britain has deterred Germany and Austria from attempting to avail themselves of the assistance of reservists in America.</p>
