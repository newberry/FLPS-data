   <p>Governor Altgeld arrived somewhat late Saturday evening, at the Central Music Hall. The immense crowd, which thronged before the meeting place on State Street, pushed and pressed, so that it was almost impossible for the Governor and his large retinue to gain entrance to the Hall, even here, the staircase was so overcrowded, that the speaker of the evening could only laboriously manage to push his way through to the Hall.</p>
   <p>The Hall, naturally was filled to the last seat. Mr. Robert Lindblom opened the meeting with a short speech, a quartet sang a campaign song, and as a quarter of an hour passed, without anything being done to amuse the public, they became restless. At last Mr. Altgeld appeared, and he could be well pleased with the applause which greeted him.</p>
   <p>He began his speech, by pointing out, that the Republicans promise anew, they would, through introduction of high protective tariffs, cause a decided improvement <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the present conditions. They are trying to deceive about the fact, that the fiscal year 1894, in which the McKinley tariff expired, closed with a deficit of $70,000,000. Messrs. Schurz and Cockran, whose statements about the currency question, the speaker desires to contradict, were both opponents of the McKinley tariff.- Without wishing to identify himself with the positive efforts of the Republicans, they allied themselves with those who wish to maintain the gold standard. Mr. Schurz said, that the free silver coinage, would immediately drive $6000,000,000 in gold, out of the country. As far as could be ascertained, there is , at present not much more than $2000,000,000 in gold, in the United States. Mr. Schurz claims, that the overproduction of silver, caused the depression of this metal. In the 60 years, from 1792 to 1852, twice as much silver was produced as gold, but nevertheless silver did not depreciate in price; from 1852 to 1873, more than twice as much gold was produced as silver, but gold did not depreciate on account of it; up till then both gold and silver have been considered as equal coinage values. From 1873 to 1892 the production of silver somewhat exceeded that of gold, but gold became dearer and only for the reason, that it became the only money of full value.</p>

   <p>With the price of silver, the price of merchandise also went down. As far as the wage question is concerned, Mr. Schurz says, that the wages have doubled since 1860. In fact, the advance of wages took place between 1840 and 1873, after 1873 the wages were considerably reduced, in 1879 they went up again, but they never reached the previous height. (Speaker did not touch on the buying power of wages, which rose considerably since 1873;) Mr. Schurz said, that the price of silver, in case of its decline, would affect its coinage. That is not so. The different countries, have not acted a-gainst silver, at the same time, and it took a while, before the consequences would show, to their fullest extent.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schurz also claims, the decline of the wheat prices, is caused through over-production. According to statistics, there was on the market, since 1880, the same quantity of wheat, every year, therefore no overproduction took place. Mr. Cockran claims, the prices of gold and silver are determined by the cost of production of both metals. This is not true. The main factors in regulating prices are supply and demand. By artificially reducing the demand for <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>silver, and increasing the demand for gold, they shifted the ratio of both metals' value. Mr. Schurz declares, it is a matter of honor for the Nation, to repay its creditors with the same kind of money, they borrowed from them.</p>
