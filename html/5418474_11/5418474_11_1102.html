   <p>Arthur R. Seyferlich, Chief of the Chicago Fire Department, died today at the Henrotin Hospital after a long illness. He was sixty-five years old. With his death, a German-American has passed away who was the embodiment of the best traditions of German-Americanism, and who distinguished himself by his faithfulness to duty, his unselfishness, and his efficiency in the public service, characteristics which won him the respect and esteem of thousands.</p>
   <p>Arthur Seyferlich was, to a certain extent, a victim of his beloved profession. At the huge fire in the stockyards last summer he suffered a minor foot injury which, as a result of the fact that he was a diabetic, became dangerous and finally developed into gangrene. Seyferlich refused to have his foot amputated.</p>

   <p>The physicians did everything possible to save his life. They made provision for the draining of the gangrenous foot and performed a blood transfusion, which resulted in a temporary improvement.</p>
   <p>Seyferlich awoke this morning from a long and refreshing sleep, but he suddenly lost consciousness. He died a few minutes later, of a heart attack.</p>
   <p>Arthur R. Seyferlich was born in the Forty-fourth Ward of Chicago, on February 23, 1869. His father was a native of Bremen, while his mother came from Mecklenburg. In 1849 his parents came to the United States and settled in Chicago. After losing all their hard-earned savings in the Great Fire, they returned to work with renewed zeal.</p>
   <p>After attending public school Mr. Seyferlich turned his attention to learning a trade and became an apprentice in the upholstering business, where he devoted himself chiefly to the upholstering of furniture.</p>

   <p>In 1890, when he was twenty-one years old, Seyferlich became a fireman. He rose from the ranks and held successively higher positions until, in 1921, he was appointed fire marshal. This post he held until 1927, when the Thompson administration removed him from office.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seyferlich had six brothers and three sisters. He was the second eldest son. He married in 1891, and had one son.</p>
   <p>After the great fire in the stockyards on December 22, 1910, Mr. Seyferlich's brother was appointed fire marshal, and held this post until his death in 1914.</p>
   <p>Mr. Seyferlich is survived by his widow and one son. Mrs. Seyferlich was at her husband's bedside when he died.</p>
