   <p>A reporter of the Abendpost elicited detailed information regarding the Physicians' Expedition to Germany. This is the third expedition which the German-Americans are sending to the Fatherland, and the first which has been organized in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dr. Harry M. Richter, a staff-physician of the Wesley Hospital, said: "We shall leave on Monday, February 14, 1916, on the 'Twentieth Century Limited' for New York and then take passage on the steamer 'Oscar II,' of Ford Peace Commission fame. From Copenhagen, our point of debarkation, we leave for Berlin, and thence to our final destination, Oppeln, in Upper Silesia."</p>
   <p>Doctor Richter, leader of the expedition, will be accompanied by two assistants and two nurses from Chicago, one assistant and two nurses from New York, and <span class="page-break">2</span>his wife, who is a professional nurse.</p>
   <p>"This personnel," declared Doctor Richter, "is only the nucleus of a much larger farce, which will be added later in Germany, probably seventy-five people. Our sojourn in Germany is scheduled for six months at present, but may be prolonged to eight months or more."</p>
   <p>The expedition will be financed through the efforts of the American Physicians' Committee, with headquarters in New York. Donations are given by Germans and German sympathizers. The enterprise is independent of the Red Cross. The latter makes sure, however, that only hospital supplies are shipped.</p>
   <p>Doctor Richter emphasizes particularly that the departure of the expedition does not signify the discontinuance of all collections; to the contrary, the means should be provided to organize another, and a Chicago Committee is to be formed for that purpose.</p>
