   <p>The German Warriors' Association assembled last night in the North Side Turner Hall to receive a flag presented by the German Emperor. With this festival the association appeared for the first time in public. Founded Dec. 20, 1874, the association has today about 70 members. Its purpose is the preservation of fellowship ties in the adopted fatherland. Last night the hall was crowded by German fellow citizens, attracted by the festivities. Consul Claussesnius said in his speech: "Some people say that it was not proper for the German Warriors' Association to ask the German Emperor for an association flag. Ladies and gentlemen, many priests, for a long time residents of the United States,have asked the same German Emperor for cannons, bought with blood, to turn them into <span class="page-break">\2</span>bells which would speak of peace. I have never heard this request criticized. Neither does the German Warriors' Association deserve any criticism, as it has the same aim as these churches. Now, Mr. President, I give you this flag in the name of and as a present from the German Emperor."</p>
