   <p>The quarterly meeting of the German Catholic priests from the diocese was held on Jan. 18th, under the leadership of the district club's president, Rev.W. Netstraeter. The session was held at the rectory of St. Joseph's Church; all the priests of the diocese were present. In regard to the transactions, particular mention should be made of their resolutions to become affiliated with the St. Raphael's Club of New York and as such to give help and protection to Chicago immigrants.</p>
   <p>As confidential adviser, Mr. Christoph Frische, owner of the steamship ticket agency at 101 Washington St., has been officially recommended to the New York Club as interviewer of the immigrants. After the above named gentleman has received the New York certification, the local club will do its share in obtaining special privileges for him from the railroad companies. This selection, which resulted after a lengthy deliberation, is a very fortunate one, as Mr. Frische enjoys an excellent reputation among the Catholics of this city. The new arrivals are therefore bound to respect his integrity and have confidence in him.</p>
