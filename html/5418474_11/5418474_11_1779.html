   <p>The Democratic candidate for Governor of Illinois, ex-Judge Altgeld, seems to think that the way to be elected is to disparage native born citizens and give fulsome praise to those of foreign birth. He is not content with rendering reasonable credit to those who have come here from other countries, but insists upon attributing to them about everything that has been accomplished in our national history.</p>
   <p>The Americans, he declares, "can boast of no great things done by themselves". They have prospered, according to his views, mainly by virtue of the help they have received from the foreign element. "It is those states where we have the largest immigrant population", he asserts, "that we find the highest development, the biggest cities, the finest architecture, the best agriculture, the most railroads, schools, churches, libraries and everything that goes to make a great nation." "When the country was in peril, he continues, "almost every man who pointed a rifle at the flag and did his best to destroy the government, was not only American born (and a brother Democrat of Altgeld) but boasted of a long line of American ancestry, while nearly one half of those who went forth to save our institutions were either foreign born or the children of foreign born parents."</p>

   <p>This is the talk of a demagogue appealing to prejudice, of course, but it is also the talk of a man who is asking the people of a great state to give him its highest office, and therefore it deserves rebuke, not less for its bad taste than for its glaring misrepresentations. The men of foreign birth numbered 22% of the native born 78% of the Union Army. There is no disposition on the part of native Americans to underate the services of foreign born citizens in the development of the country whe were loyal to the defence of the government; but when it is claimed that such citizens have virtually done everything that has come to pass for the advantage and glory of the nation, a protest must be entered. (There were just as many copperheads among the foreign democrats as of the native democrats in proportion to their number.)</p>
   <p>It is not true that the best conditions of general welfare and progress are found where the immigrant population is largest. On the contrary, it is where the native American element predominates that we make the most creditable showing in every respect. The highest grade of popular intelligence is in these northern states which have a comparatively small number of foreigners. It is New England and New York State that present the best examples of social, moral and political development; and New England and Western New York have been made what they are by native talent and industry. And the great bulk of Ohio and Michigan have always been native born. Our worst municipal governments are in <span class="page-break">\3</span>cities where the foreign vote is practically the controlling factor, as in New York City.</p>
   <p>It is by native Americans that most of our important enterprises are conducted, and most of our signal victories achieved in all lines of activity. Native Americans have commanded our armies and shaped our legislature; evolved our literature; headed our enterprises; found employment for labor; end built our railroads and telegraph system. They have had the cooperation of the foreign element in a certain degree, but not with the effect of relegating them to a secondary position.</p>
   <p>The characters of surpassing potency in the annals of Illinois have not been foreign born, as Judge Altgeld ought to know. The splendid regiments that Illinois sent to war were mostly composed of home born citizens, as Judge Altgeld can easily ascertain by locking at the records. Whatever has been said in favor of the foreigners, they honestly deserve, and it is not to be denied that they have materially helped to promote the best interests of the country; but the fact still remains that the native American is the true representative of our national character, and the superior factor in the story of our national advancement.</p>
