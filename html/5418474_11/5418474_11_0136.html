   <p>From a special cable dispatch to the Chicago Tribune, with the date line: "With the American Armies in France, August 29,".... [we learn that] Chris Nehmer of Ontonagon, Michigan, said to a group of (German) prisoners: "Folks at home advised me to change my name, but my fighting here proves that that isn't necessary, because it makes my Americanism clearly evident."</p>
   <p>An officer, replying to the question as to why the Americans were so active (at this particular sector of the front), said: "Forty-one percent of this division is of German descent. All are volunteers. Now draw your own conclusions."</p>
   <p>What can the conclusion be? What does it prove? Nothing else but this: This particular division fought so actively and courageously because it consisted--to the amount of forty-one percent--of men who were animated not only by a desire common to all American soldiers, but also by two special objectives which are peculiar to them, namely: to give the lie to the foolish gossip that Americans of German blood should not and would not fight against the Germans--their blood relatives--and to prove by their actions that German blood is also keeping faith with America and is willing to do its duty. Furthermore, [they wanted] to contribute everything possible to overthrow the German military autocracy and to see to it that the German people get what is theirs by right, by carrying the Stars and Stripes--the flag of righteous democracy--for-ward to victory.</p>
   <p>In other words: The special bravery in combat of American soldiers of German origin can be traced to the fact that their love for their people and their country, together with the loyalty of the true American, is coupled with their love for the German people. Their earnest desire is to expose any expression of doubt as to the loyalty of Americans of German origin as an infamous slander, to secure for the German people a speedy liberation from an unworthy rule, and to secure for all progressive nations the right of self-determination.</p>
   <p>For us, the most important fact is that the conduct of "our boys" proves conclusively that men of German origin are as willing to fight against their own blood for the maintenance and advancement of a great ideal as for the maintenance of the dynasties of the high and mighty despots at whose command Germans have fought for centuries.</p>
   <p>The soil of Germany (and of neighboring countries) has been drenched with German blood, shed by Germans in the interests, and at the commands, of their masters. That, in spite of this fact, it was claimed, here and there, that it was a great injustice to ask Americans of German origin to fight against German soldiers, is a mistake that can only be explained by the tremendous emotional and nervous tension of the times. It is indeed fortunate that events have proved this claim to be unfounded, and that, at the same time, the loyalty to duty and the courage of German blood in America have been so clearly manifested--a fact for which we cannot thank too much those brave boys of the division, forty-one percent of whose men are of German blood, and all other boys of German blood fighting in American armies.</p>
   <p>A change of name is unecessary--only the fulfillment of duty counts. That should be clear by now even to the most nearsighted people.</p>
