   <p>Mr. Sigmund Selig, director of the German Theater, is celebrating next Sunday evening his 35th Anniversary as actor. All proceeds from the performance on that night will go to Mr. Selig as an honor gift: Mr. Selig started his actor's career as a vaudeville comedian and came to Chicago about 20 years ago, where he re-organized the German theater. He proved to be a successful theater-manager, and the Germans of Chicaco owe him a lot for the preservation of German dramatic-art and of the German language. Always jovial, polite and never discouraged, Mr. Selig went through ups and downs during his life and won the admiration and sympathy of all Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Reif Reiflingen" is the title of the comedy, which will be played Sunday night, and we hope to see a full House, which will be the highest honor, we can give Mr. Selig, to show the appreciation of the public, which he has served so long faith-fully.</p>
