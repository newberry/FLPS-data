   <p>Mr. Von Frantzius is a descendant of an old patrician family of Danzig. His great business ability, and love for beauty and art are, therefore, an inheritance rather than an acquisition. Mr. Frantzius, who is the head of the banking and brokerage firm bearing his name, is well deserving of the high esteem which he enjoys among his associates in business circles.</p>
   <p>He is a member of the New York and Chicago Stock Exchange, and also a member of the Chicago grain exchange. But he does not permit business to absorb all of his time, for he is an active member of the German and the English Press clubs, the Illinois Athletic Club, and the Palette and Chisel club, the Germania Male Choir, the German Society, the German-American Historical Society, the Chicago Singing Society, the Chicago Art Institute, the Society for Furtherance of Art in Schools, and the Austro-Hungarian Benevolent Society. He has also organized and brought into existence the Society of Friends of American Art, and whenever a lecture or entertainment of the mentioned societies is in the offing, Mr. Frantzius is called upon to do the "lion's" share of the work.</p>
