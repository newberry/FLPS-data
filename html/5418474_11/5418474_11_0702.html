   <p>As one of the lecturers of the Town Hall series, the niece of President von Hindenburg, Baroness Helene Nostitz von Hindenburg, spoke yesterday afternoon at the Palmer House about "her uncle Paul" the German hero, a representative of both the old and the new Germany.</p>
   <p>A large audience was present in the Palmer House ballroom, mostly ladies, who are regular visitors at the lecture courses. Among those who could be regarded as special guests to the lecture by the German visitor, were representatives from the German Consulate General: Vice-Consul Dr. Schueller, Vice-Consul Schaller, Messrs. Ernest Kruetgen and A. Muhlmann.</p>
   <p>The lecture emphasized the thought that Hindenburg must be regarded as the representative of the old as well as of the new Germany, and at the same time it aimed to express in an interesting manner the great love and reverence the niece feels for her venerable uncle.</p>

   <p>The military education of young Hindenburg was mentioned, and at the same time his love for peace was stressed. Hindenburg's eyes - the eyes of a seer - into which his niece looked many times, his simplicity, devoid of pose, his daily life, which is carried on with military precision, his belief in a higher power, which helps him to maintain his calm in exciting moments. Little, but characteristic remarks, such as the one he made when the elevator once got stuck, to the alarm of the others: "It will soon get started again" or a written reply from the seat of war: "I have no time for poems at present, because I am in the war," brought Hindenburg as a human nearer to his listeners. His handwriting is still firm, his eyes clear, and his hands the steady hand of a hunter; so did his niece portray her uncle in his later years. The old and the new Germany, Hindenburg represents them both. For an illustration of the old and the new, a number of pictures were shown: Potsdam with its old castles, Sans Souci, and, in contrast, pictures of buildings of the latest styles, the lines of which are devoid of all romance of former years.</p>

   <p>And then came an abundance of pictures of German youths, who are devoted to sports of every kind, such as climbing, swimming, and gymnastics; pictures of Ebert's funeral, the christening of the "Bremen," Hindenburg before the people after taking the oath, among the children, with his Bavarians, etc., were also shown.</p>
