   <p>Shortly before President Wilson embarked for Europe, a committee of Transylvanian Saxons (Siebenbuerger Sachsen) of Chicago called on him and handed him a memorial containing a well-founded protest against the annexation of Transylvania by Rumania, now that frontiers in Europe are going to be revamped. President Wilson assured the committee that he would study the memorial closely on his trip over, and would ponder carefully the arguments contained therein.</p>
   <p>The local Transylvanian Saxons have called a mass meeting of their fellow nationals and of German-speaking Hungarians for Sunday, December 29, at Siebens Hall, 1457 Clybourn Avenue. At the meeting, speeches and resolutions are to be made. A proclamation prepared for this purpose, which, in its principal parts, is identical with the memorial handed to President Wilson, states:</p>
   <p>"Following the example of our blood brothers in many cities of our adopted country, we, too, wish to hold a mass meeting. During these hard and critical <span class="page-break">2</span>times, do we have to go into details about the purpose of this meeting? Does not everyone of you know what is at stake? Is it not the protection of our national identity (Volkstum) against the encroachments of other nationalities? And isn't that one of our most sacred duties, which none of us must shirk?</p>
   <p>"Everyone of you is familiar with our history, which furnishes proof that we are entitled to independence and self-government. These are historic facts which can easily be proven by documents in the libraries of Transylvania. From 1141 until 1395, the Rumanians in Transylvania, where our forefathers found a second home, are not mentioned at all and no traces of them can be found. The assumption that Transylvania ever belonged to Rumania cannot be substantiated by any historic fact. Transylvania is Saxon soil, guarded from generation to generation by our heroic ancestors as a sacred heritage. Only the numerous wars fought by Hungary, with their inevitable bloody sacrifices, have made the Saxon population of Transylvania a minority. But our democratic <span class="page-break">3</span>spirit was ever on the alert, and it is this same spirit which prompts us now to protest most vehemently against the statement, made in part of the press, that Transylvania was once a part of the Kingdom of Rumania. And even in 1867, when Transylvania was taken over by Hungary, it was done with the understanding that the rights and privileges of the Saxon people would not be violated.</p>
   <p>"It would, therefore, not only be unfair but also in contradiction to the peace objectives of our President if a small but progressive nation, which is eager to assume its place in the world, should be compelled to become, in the future, a part of a backward and patriarchal nation like Rumania. In order to enlighten our fellow citizens in the United States about the true state of affairs, we therefore want to make public protest, which is in harmony with the justice our President desires, against the annexation of Transylvania by Rumania; and at the same time we demand that Transylvania be made a free republic, with self-determination. We protest on behalf of over 30,000 <span class="page-break">4</span>Transylvanian Saxons who live in the United States. We demand a just and adequate treatment for all the three nationalities of Transylvania, for the Saxons, the Rumanians, and the Hungarians, as well as the preservation of their languages and customs.</p>
   <p>"In view of historical facts, explained and set forth in a memorial to the President of the United States, a request has been made that the Transylvanian Saxons also be permitted to represent their interests at the Peace Conference, We ask for this favor because we firmly believe in the democracy our President stands for, and in his determination to protect the rights of small nations. But in order to give this memorial added weight and importance we think it necessary to hold a mass meeting at which we publicly announce our objectives to all the world. This meeting we shall hold on Sunday, December 29. Effective speakers will argue for our cause; among others, Brother Loepprich, who acted as our delegate in Washington and has just returned from there.</p>
   <p>"The Committee</p>
   <p>(signed) J. N. Markel, Fritz Hientz, chairmen Andreas Weber, Georg Daniel, Georg Schnell, John Schneider, M. Edling."</p>
