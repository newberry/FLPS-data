   <p>During the last years before the abolition of Prohibition, one often heard the assertion that the Prohibition question had nothing whatsoever to do with politics. This statement, correct in principle but absolutely wrong in actual practice, emanated from those advocates of compulsory abstinence who feared the approaching danger, that one of the great political parties might favor the abandonment of that blessed dryness, and also from those politicians who were fully neutral toward Prohibition but recognized in it a voting factor which might prove fatal in certain political circles.</p>
   <p>Conditions at the time, in so far as Prohibition is concerned, virtually threatened to poison politics in the United States.</p>
   <p>In many instances the qualifications and the character of the candidates <span class="page-break">2</span>were not the deciding factors any longer--the sole issue was their attitude toward Prohibition.</p>
   <p>The Anti-Saloon League went so far as to advocate candidates who had been given prison sentences for dishonorable acts, and the opponents of Prohibition often voted for candidates who enjoyed the support of notorious bootleggers and gangsters.</p>
   <p>In regard to the problem of the veterans' bonus, an equally threatening situation seems to be developing. That this question will be discussed in Congress during the coming session has already been established, and it also seems to have been decided that both Houses will pass a bill to provide immediate payment of the bonus. The outcome now depends upon the action of the President, whether or not he intends to veto the act of Congress again. The resolution of the Senate is in itself absolutely senseless, because those veterans who actually need the bonus are already being supported by the government, and the payment of the bonus will only result <span class="page-break">3</span>in doing away with the help the veterans are receiving now. The others can afford to wait until the bonus is due in 1945.</p>
   <p>Pat Harrison, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, remarked recently: "I hope we can devise something which will be acceptable to both sides so that this irritating affair can be eliminated. The question never should have been injected into politics, and the quicker we remove it from that sphere, the better." That is the honorable Senator's highly optimistic view. If he really believes that the question can ever be disposed of, he makes a serious error. If the bonus is paid, another demand will be made. The Veterans of Foreign Wars have already proposed a pension bill, whereby every veteran is to receive a dollar for each day that he was in the service.</p>
   <p>The American Legion was for a number of years very modest in its demands, but eventually it acceded to the views of its competitor, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and, after all, one cannot blame the Legion for that. Had <span class="page-break">4</span>the Legion acted differently most of the veterans would have abandoned it and would have joined the Veterans of Foreign Wars. After all, it is only human for people to follow those who make the greatest promises. It is therefore absolutely impossible to exclude from politics the bonus and other pension questions which now rest so tranquilly, yet ominously, in the lap of the future.</p>
   <p>After all, in a democratic country where the majority rules, the politicians must always face the temptation to buy votes with the aid of governmental appropriations. But the pension does not represent the limit. At first it will be restricted to those veterans who were actually at the front and were honorably discharged. Later an attempt will be made to put the pension on a broader base, which means that those who never smelled powder will also be eligible, the "swivel-chair" soldiers and the office guardsmen; in short, that huge number of veterans who never left the country. Then the widows of the veterans will come in for a share, and why should a grateful nation allow its poor, helpless children to suffer? They, too, will be given paternal <span class="page-break">5</span>support as long as Uncle Sam has a nickel in his pocket. One need not be a prophet to predict this. It was always thus, and is bound to be repeated because it represents one of the unavoidable blessings of democracy.</p>
