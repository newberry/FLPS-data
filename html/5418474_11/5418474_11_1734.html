   <p>The speech of Governor Altgeld was an oratorical master-piece and without doubt has made a lasting impression on the audience. Regarding the present depressed conditions, it took in fact a great cratorical skill to find the correct tone and the Governor proved that he possesses this skill. He admitted that on the one side there are foodstuffs and daily necessities in plenty while thousands do starve, but pointed to the suffering of worker and employer, as being alike under the abnormal conditions of business.</p>
   <p>But neither one can be held responsible for it. The speaker reminded the workers of the bravery and heroism needed to meet the new arising conditions and try in union with the government to get rid of them. He warned of acts by force and revoluntionary demonstrations as nothing will be gained by them.</p>
