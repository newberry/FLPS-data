   <p>Peter Schoenhofen died in his home, 2500 Prairie Avenue, yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, after a protracted illness. He grew up with our city until that insidious malady diabetes, ended his destiny. Mr. Schoenhofen had been travelling in Europe and when about to depart from England, suffered a paralytic stroke. He was compelled to remain there for several weeks before he was able to return to the United States, where he recuperated rapidly. During the last week however his condition became serious. He remained in bed from Friday until death ended his suffering yesterday.</p>
   <p>Peter Schoenhofen was born on the 2nd day of Feb. 1827, in Derbach, District of Wittbach, Rhein-provinz, (Province on the river Rhein) where as he grew up he learned the distillery business. After finishing military service in about his 24th year, i.e., about 38 years ago, he came to America. He had no resources whatever, only a willingness to work. He found employment near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., as a cider-presser on a farm. From there he went to Chicago where he was active until death wrote finis to his ambitions. He was worth several millions.</p>
   <p>At first Mr. Schoenhofen worked in the small brewery of Mueller, near Lyons, then <span class="page-break">\2</span>about 1850, he went to M. Best's brewery which at that time was on 16th Street near the lake, where the N. Y. Central sheds are now. After that he had a job as teamster for Conrad Seipp. The latter was not such an extensive establishment as today, which may be gathered from the fact, that on Schoenhofen's wedding day, Mr. Seipp himself had to substitute and drive the beer-wagon team to bring the precious liquid to his thirst quenching dispensaries - his customers.</p>
   <p>We now find Schoenhofen striking out for independence. In partnership with Mathias Gottfried he started a small brewery on Jefferson and 12th Streets, which they operated for about a year; then came the brewery on Canalport Avenue and 18th Street, which gradually developed and became one of Chicago's largest institutions for the manufacture of the Teutonic beverage. About 22 years ago, Schoenhofen bought his partner's share, whereupon it became strictly a family affair.</p>
   <p>He married Elise Knepper, of Baden, (S.Germany) 33 years ago and she survives him, with five of his seven children. Both sons are dead, one in an accident, the other from consumption. Four daughters are married; two, to army officers in Germany. His sons-in-law in this country - Mr. Joseph Theurer and Carl Buehl, have been respectively vice president and secretary, and treasurer of the "Peter Schoenhofen Brewery".</p>

   <p>A twenty year old daughter is still single.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schoenhofen was a life-long Democrat but took no active interest in politics, never having desired nor a acquired any political office. He was a member of the "Germania Bruderbund" (Germany Brotherhood) and one of the first members of the "Germania Maennerchor" (Germania Male Chorus), but otherwise remained rather aloof from social activities. He was a man who did not seek publicity nor did he advertise his generous and far-reaching philanthropy.</p>
   <p>Burial will be on Thursday, 1 P. M. but this arrangement is not definite. He will be interred in Graceland Cemetery.</p>
