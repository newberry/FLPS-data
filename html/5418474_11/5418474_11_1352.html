   <p>According to information received from Vienna, Editor Leo Siegelbaum died there suddenly of a heart attack. The deceased was for several years a collaborator of the "Abendpost", for which he wrote under the name of Leo Thury. Editor Siegelbaum descended from an old Vienna middle class family, and originally studied medicine, but later turned to Journalism and was a member of the Vienna Illustrirte Kronenzeitung since 1899. The world war caused an interruption of his journalistic activity, because he had to join the army. The hardships of the war aggravated his already existing ailment, so that he had to be put as a captain of reserve in the hinterland. He came to America after the debacle, where he became active on the Abendpost for a few months, but finally went back to his old love, the Kronenzeitung. The deceased enjoyed great popularity here as well as in Vienna, on account of his pleasant and humorous disposition.</p>
