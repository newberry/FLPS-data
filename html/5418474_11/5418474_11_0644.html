   <p>...Apparently Mr. Hesing wished to restrict his answer to the approximate length of Mr. Collyer's letter- or he might have mentioned many other and very pertinent things...</p>
   <p>One point, however, he should have brought out more fully: The Saccherine sweet simpering of the Reverend about the nobility and magnanimity that America proves by giving bread to industrious Europeon workers. What the deuce! Do the immigrants come as beggars, who have to be fed out of pity? Or would it be perhaps the normal thing that the Americans devoured them like savage Fiji Islanders, so that one would owe special thanks for not having been devoured? If Mr. Collyer earned more in his first month in America, than in his last in England, he was lucky indeed. But his employer has surely not shown special generosity, except(what we don't believe) if he paid Mr. Collyer more than his work was worth. As regards the writer of these lines, who was not at all ignorant of English when he arrived, he had to earn as a peasant's servant and a woodchopper a very scanty bread and had to suffer hardships for years before he earned again as much as he used to <span class="page-break">2</span>gain in Germany, a country he left voluntarily... If personal experiences are to be taken as proof, then ours are as conclusive as these of Mr. Collyer... When American engineers find employment in Russia or Germany, nobody there thinks of regarding them as charity receivers...Every American statistician calculates with beaming satisfaction the enormous gain the country has from immigration...Very well then, may the country thank immigration and may Mr. Collyer spare us with his whining about the gratitude we owe the country.</p>
