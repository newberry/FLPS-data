   <p>Another contingent of cavalry will leave Chicago for the battlefield--a troop just as brave as Schambeck's boys. Although this company, which consists chiefly of experienced cavalrymen, was accepted for service July 2, it must support itself until it has been sworn for service. However, these men have no means of obtaining a living, since they have ceased working. Therefore, the German public, every patriotic citizen of German extraction, is requested to do his share toward the maintenance of these brave men. A "musical evening" has been arranged tonight at North's Theatre for the benefit of Cavalry Company Number Two, of which Captain Thielemann is the leader. We advise that all Germans read the program which appears in the respective advertisement. It offers plenty of entertainment, and the fact that the purpose is a patriotic one should make it doubly enjoyable.</p>
