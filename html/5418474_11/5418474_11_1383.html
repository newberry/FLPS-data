   <p>The 23 year old Henry G. Weber, born in Chicago of German parentage, who celebrated great triumphs in Europe as a highly gifted musician, will make his debut in the coming season as conductor of the Chicago Civic Opera Company. When Mr. Herbert M. Johnson, the manager of the Chicago Civic Opera Company, reconnoitered in Europe for outstanding musicians, he heard of the talented Mr. Weber, who is a grandson of Henry Weber, a Chicago German pioneer, who settled in Chicago in 1836 to establish the Weber Wagon Works; he informed the President of the Opera Company, Samuel Insull, who appointed the young man as assistant conductor. Mr. Weber, during the coming season, will lift his baton to conduct the big orchestra of the Chicago Civic Opera Company, and so one of his ardent wishes will come true.</p>
   <p>Although he was born in Chicago and although he studied here for some time, he is almost unknown in the United States as a conductor of music, on the other hand he is well known in Germany and Austria, especially in Bremen and Vienna, where he has lived and studied for several years.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Weber was born at Prairie Avenue and 47th Street, where his parents lives at that time. His father, George Weber, had already retired from business and had sold his wagon works to the International Harvester Company. Of youthful age, young Weber came with his parents to Vienna where he attended public school and later High School. As a boy he already showed extraordinary musical talent. He is an excellent pianist and when hardly 9 years old, gave his first concert.</p>
   <p>When the war broke out, he was attending high school. A hard time arrived for him and his family. Mr. Weber said, "We were interned and could not leave Austria. We became financially embarrassed and had to sell our valuables. Every week a painting or rug or valuable vase was pawned. My piano was sold also. I gave instruction in music, and it was at that time, that the thought ripened in me to educate myself to become an opera conductor."</p>
   <p>In 1919 the family finally succeeded in receiving money from the Red Cross in Switzerland to set out on their homeward voyage. Here Henry attended the University of Chicago, where besides his regular studies he carried on with his musical studies. In the year 1921 he returned to Vienna and visited the school of conductors of the musical academy. One day a dispute arose between the director of the academy and one of the conductors. The following day the performance "Maskerade" was to take place, but the conductor was missing. Mr. Weber received the opportunity to fill the gap, and he fulfilled this task so well, that the academy kept him as conductor. Soon after, Schillings, the director of the biggest opera in Berlin, asked him to come to Berlin and conduct the "Freischutz". Mr. Schillings offered him a position as assistant conductor, but Mr. Weber rejected this because of an previous offer he had received from Bremen to conduct at the city opera, where he had already had great success. During the last week of his activity in Bremen he conducted 6 operas in 5 days. "It was always my sincerest wish to find occupation as a musical conductor in the United States," said Mr. Weber, who resides at the present time in the Windermere Hotel, "And I am very much pleased to appear with such a great opera company, as the Chicago Civic Opera Company, in my own home town."</p>
