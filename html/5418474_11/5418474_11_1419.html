   <p>The congregation of St. Peters Evangelical Church, whose place of worship is located at Oakley Boulevard and Cortez Street, has suffered a great loss. Its aged pastor, Gotthilf J. Lambrecht, who has been active for almost half a century, has passed away. There is wide-spread mourning among those of German origin, for the Reverend Mr. Lambrecht, the Nestor of the German Protestant clergy of the city, was known all over and enjoyed great popularity because of his excellent character. He was a great preacher, and was always a cheerful friend and counsellor to the numerous members of his congregation. After a long and blessed life he has passed away into a better world.</p>
   <p>He was born July 13, 1841, in Bernsee, in the province of Brandenburg (Prussia). His parents decided that he should enter the teaching profession and sent him to the seminary at Bromberg (province of Posen, Prussia), from which he graduated at the age of twenty-one. After he had been a <span class="page-break">\2</span>teacher for two years, he decided to emigrate to the United States of America, where friends persuaded the highly talented young man to study theology. For this purpose he entered the theological seminary of the Synod of the Northwest at Lake Zurich. Two years later, on May 16, 1866, he was ordained as a preacher at the Immanuel Church in Addison, Illinois. He first became pastor at the Evangelical church at Hoosiers Grove, from which, after a brief period, he was called to the St. Peters Congregation, which was just being established. Always ready to make sacrifices, he dedicated to this church almost his whole life's work.</p>
   <p>From an insignificant beginning, the congregation, whose place of worship was located, until recently, at West Chicago Avenue and Noble Street, developed into one of the greatest and most respected in the city. The whole neighborhood at that time was almost exclusively populated with Germans, who gladly joined the congregation and so contributed to its growth. Great demands were made upon the Reverend Mr. Lambrecht, who had <span class="page-break">\3</span>to perform Sunday services, weddings, christening and funeral ceremonies, and also give Sunday-school lessons. But he discharged all these duties competently and, after a little while, was counted among the most respected and popular clerics of the city.</p>
   <p>As, in the course of time, the character of the neighborhood changed and the Germans moved further west, it became necessary to abandon the old church. A new one was built at Oakley Avenue and Cortez Street. Every Sunday the congregation gathered here to listen to the sermons of their preacher, whose hair was now turning gray. Two years ago, when he celebrated his fiftieth anniversary as a clergyman, the great attendance and numerous gifts of love gave the best testimony of the general great respect and admiration felt for him.</p>
   <p>In spite of his seventy-five years he enjoyed excellent health until last <span class="page-break">\4</span>summer, when he began to ail; after a severe illness, he has now passed away.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Mr. Lambrecht had been very happily married. His wife Charlotte, nee Heidenfeld, died several years ago. This marriage produced three daughters and one son, namely, Mrs. Ida Burkhart, Mrs. C. F. Weisse, wife of the Reverend Mr. Weisse; Miss Thalita Lambrecht, and Johannes R. Lambrecht.</p>
   <p>The funeral will take place Tuesday afternoon, after a ceremony at St. Peters Church, where the deceased had formerly officiated. From there the funeral procession will move to Montrose Cemetery.</p>
   <p>To give the numerous friends who are not able to be present at the funeral services a last opportunity to take a look at the deceased, the body will lie in state at the church tomorrow night from six o'clock on.</p>
