The intercourse with Freiligrath had a deciding influence upon young Dietz and, in addition to his profession, he devoted himself to poetry. Many of his poems gave proof not only of his poetic ability, but, at the same time they showed that he possessed a true German heart, which he displayed until his death.</p>
