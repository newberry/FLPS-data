   <p>Physicians contend that the era of devastating epidemics, which in former centuries were the scourge of mankind, is definitely past. We regret to say that this does not apply to certain spiritual epidemics which, from time to time, recur. One does not have to be particularily psychic to notice that, for some time, violent baiting of foreigners has been going on. For months the Saturday Evening Post, one of the most widely circulated periodicals in the country, has been publishing articles of a decidedly nativistic character. In one of these articles, statistical proof was given that the country would have no unemployed today if Congress had completely forbidden immigration a few years ago.</p>
   <p>Of course, such proof is perfectly senseless. It has been established beyond any doubt that this country produces considerably more than it can consume. This implies that the country has not enough consumers; but that immigrants, as well as natives, are consumers no one will deny. But this is, of course.</p>
   
   <p>no counterproof, because he who consumes must also produce. At any rate, the purely mechanical figures which are made to show that the country would have no unemployed if no one had immigrated in the last few years, are absolutely untenable. But this contention holds a strong appeal to the masses. Many of the unemployed will now say to each other, "All these years I would have had wages and bread if the d.... foreigners had not snatched it from me".</p>
   <p>In their efforts to make the appeal to nativism even stronger, its protagonists link it with the struggle against communism or radicalism of any kind. These tactics are, for instance, made the background of a bill which Congressman Dies has worked out and submitted to the House. The bill states: "The nation is undermined by communists who would like to destroy our form of government. The country must either be America or Russia. Time for action has arrived, now or never!" The bill introduced by Congressman Dies provides that all immigration shall be forbidden for the next fifty years. At the same time it prescribes that all foreign communists shall be deported.</p>
   <p>In this form, the bill is scarcely compatible with the Constitution and with tradition. According to the Constitution, every citizen has the right to agitate for the introduction of another form of government. This right is actually exercised, for at national elections the Communists' ticket appears on the ballot, and is officially recognized no less than the Republican and Democratic tickets. Yet it is prohibited to agitate in favor of a violent revolution. Foreigners guilty of such action violate American hospitality in a heinous way, and should be deported, regardless of circumstances. No reasonable person would object to that.</p>
   <p>But what has the combating of communism to do with immigration? Is it perhaps the intention of Mr. Dies to say that all immigrants are communists? Even this statesman is not capable of such nonsense.</p>
   <p>More to the point, and much more reasonable, is another bill which is called the Russell-Cramer bill, after its originators. It provides grave penalties for those who advocate a violent overthrow of the present government. It is possible that even such a law may result in hardships and abuses, but there is, at least, meaning and reason in it. One cannot blame a government for wanting to protect itself against violent assaults of revolutionists.</p>
   <p>The problem of immigration, however, cannot be solved by existing methods. It is merely a superficial claim to state that this country has too many people instead of too few. It could, without difficulty, give food to a population ten times as large. But then it would have to end the present immigration policies, and introduce, in their place, a policy of systematic settlement. The land is here to be settled and cultivated, and man should take from it the products bestowed upon it by nature. No nation can ignore this fundamental principle without inviting a grave calamity. Instead of furthering the natural tendencies of co-ordination between overpopulated and sparsely populated countries, certain statesmen now simply want to close the gates to immigrants.</p>
   <p>It is by no means certain that the Dies bill will be passed by this session of Congress. But similar measures will eventually be passed by Congress. Let us not be deceived about that, for the sentiment points in that direction. The articles in the Saturday Evening Post have caused great reverberations in the daily press. A very hateful sentiment is often expressed in articles and cartoons against the immigrant. In the history of this country, nativism has raised its head every so often. It has always been successfully combated by those possessed of sufficient insight to think clearly. But now, because of the depression, conditions are ripe for a successful advance on the part of nativists.</p>
