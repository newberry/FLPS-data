   <p>The election campaign draws to an end and both sides, especially in Chicago and Cook County, try their best to tilt the scales to conform to their own inclinations.....The mass meeting, arranged by the Altgeld wing of the Democratic party, turned out to be a clamorous testimonial to Altgeld, and it could not fail to "impress his good friends" on the other side of the camp, that the cantankerous J. P. is still a factor that must be reckoned with......</p>
   <p>The first speaker was Clarence S. Darrow, that strange man, who represents the interests of great corporations in their dissensions amongst themselves, whenever they hire him for that purpose, and then again takes up the cudgel for the labor organizations, who select him when they come in conflict with the law.....</p>

   <p>Mrs. Dr. J. Holmes Smith, Democratic candidate for Trustee of the University, gave a short address, followed by Altgeld who proceeded to the footlights of the platform. After the applause had subsided he sung his speech in that even-toned manner, impressive indeed, for it did not fail to arouse the crowd to wild displays of unbounded enthusiasm. In regard to the criticism of his antagonists who condemned his administration, he elucidated the various points in a cool, clear, concise manner. He adroitly changed the topic and spoke very sharply about the deficiencies of the Republican applications of law and Tanner's display of friendly service for Mr. Yerkes and the Gas trust, whereupon he recommended Alschuler as a man, who deserves the confidence of the Illinoisans, who may be entrusted with all state affairs and then brought up the subject of the National election. He did not mention the coinage question, not a word, but the expansion politics of the Government with its friendship for the Trusts and their directors, he attacked in the strongest possible terms which human thought can create.</p>

   <p>He referred to the particular predilection of the Republican administration, for the standing army as, contrasted with the Volunteer soldiers. He quoted the home-coming speech with which Gov. Linn of Minnesota greeted the men from a returning volunteer regiment: "The volunteer is a thing of the past, he is not desired anymore in America. In the future we will resort to the professional soldier. The fault of the private soldier is, that besides his rifle, he also displays a conscience. He is invincible, when liberty or hearth need defence, but when it becomes imperative to resort to and perpetrate rascality, then he is unreliable. Reverting to the paramount "Trust" question and refuting the assertion, r that nothing can be done to control "Trusts" and to subjugate them for the protection of the community, the speaker said:</p>
   <p>"Let me draw a parallel, my friends! George William Curtis and other authors of those remote days have given us accounts, just how great the power of the Slave holders has been half a century ago. How they held the reins <span class="page-break">4</span>in the White House and fashioned laws at the Capitol; how the judges were their willing vassals, the Senators and Representatives their subservient lackeys; the Professors on the rostrum, the Editor in his Sanctorum, the preachers on the pulpit, they were all under their thumb. How they dominated society, and, in the refined clubs, their opinions alone were recognized. Their iron hand ruled all social life and endeavor. Each year they became more powerful; each month their dominance increased. Men and women who dared to question the divine institution of slavery, were sentenced, persecuted, ostracized, yea, hanged. Nevertheless, the great clock in the judgement halls of macrocosm does not stop. Just as its regular "Tick-tock" has measured the past milleniums, so its pendulum swings through the years that Curtis described. And finally, the hour struck. The world perceived the droning steps of marching men, a million fighters, and Negro slavery disappeared from the realms of our Republic. Now the parallel:</p>
   <p>"Today the "Syndicate" is entrenched in the Whitehouse and dictates the statutes to the capitol. The courthouses are its City revieres; Senators and <span class="page-break">5</span>Representatives submit themselves as servants; Ministers, Professors, Journalists are obedient. Everything is an exact counterpart of fifty years ago. It seems after all and as a matter of fact, to be a form of insanity, if we regard the syndicate as a God-given, eternal creation. But, my friends, the great clock of the universe with its "Ticktock" has not stopped, Soon again, it may toll the hour and then the world will note not one, but ten million free citizens, not armed with guns, but clutching their ballots to erase the dominating trusts from America for ever."</p>
   <p>Governor-candidate, Alschuler, who came into the stage at the close of Altgeld's speech, was introduced by the presiding officers to the assembly and was given jubilant acclaim. The request that he also should speak, he declined. He said that he had spoken at three prior meetings, besides, it is rather late and "tomorrow is another day".</p>
