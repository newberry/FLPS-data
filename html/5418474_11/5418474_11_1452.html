   <p>Dr. Scherger explain the assertions that the opinions of certain Philosophers influenced the germen people, as silly, and rejects remarks of certain authors as untrue, even to-day the German people are the same as they were in Goethe's and Schiller's time.</p>
   <p>It is an entirely wrong idea that the German people aim to force their distinct culture upon other people; The German word "Culture" means civilization while Education signifies refinement of morals; These two comprehensions are often mistaken.</p>
   <p>The German people are the most cosmopolitan in the world; they are wonderful. No language of the world is so flexible and fit for translation of works of other languages as the german.</p>
   <p>Shakespeare is better known in Germany and his works are more often performed than in England. The Germans know our literature as well as we do. There is <span class="page-break">\2</span>no educated German who will not speak four or five languages at least.</p>
   <p>The only instance which they insist upon to fight for higher morals is against Russia, their neighbor. It is known that of 1,000 Russians 600 cannot read or write, while among 1,000 Germans only 5% are ignorant.</p>
   <p>It does not occur to the Germans to elevate their culture above the culture of England, France or Italy.</p>
   <p>Dr. Scherger, who is very proud of the fact that he was born in America, stated that when 20 years of age he went for 3 years to Europe to study at the Universities of Paris and Germany, he then returned to the University of Cornell where he received his degree of Ph. D.</p>
   <p>The freest place in the world is a German University. A German professor can assail- yes, it is even expected of him-every theory under the sun. The student can choose any subject he is interested in, this is called "Freedom of Teaching". "Science and her Teachings are Free", has been the sacred axiom for hundreds of years. The Universities have rights which are extra-ordinary, and no American University exercises or possesses such liberty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The laws and regulations of the German University are made by the "Senate" which consists of the Professors of the University. Our American University has one President who has the power of a Russian Czar; we have professors who have not the courage to speak their convictions because of fear of losing their positions; many professors of the Chicago University lost their positions because they dared to speak their ideas; the cause of some was made public, but many of them were kept silent.</p>
   <p>What this Country needs is freedom in our Universities - Freedom of Teaching -.</p>
