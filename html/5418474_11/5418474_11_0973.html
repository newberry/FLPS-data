   <p>Among the German War-Veterans, who came from America to participate in the German Warveterans-Festivals at Berlin, was also a group of German Warveterans from Chicago. To honor the American guests, a great banquet was given by the Berlin Singing Society, "Philharmony".</p>
   <p>The excellent music was furnished by a German military Orchestra, which played among other fine musicpieces also a march, composed by a Chicagoan, Mr. Kalbitz. The German general Von Loe made a speech, and greeted particularly the American visitors. Mr. Schlenker, President of the Chicago Warveterans Association, thanked all for the hearty reception in Berlin, and promised the loyalty of German-American Warveterans to the old Fatherland.</p>
