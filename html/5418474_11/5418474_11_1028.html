   <p>With great satisfaction the news was received in the United States that across the ocean, from England and France, considerable sums of money were sent for the aid of yellow pest-stricken cities in the South, and that the collections for this purpose are still going on. But what about Germany? The rude indifference with which it treats its country-men cannot be equalled by any other nation.</p>
   <p>Even educated Germans are so simple-minded, in regard to this crudeness, that they consider the mere expectation of doing something for their many-times sponged country-men in America, an outspoken bad joke. When in 1864 at Lawrence, Kansas, through the brigand chief, Quantrell, about one-hundred mostly destitute German fathers were slaughtered and over three-hundred widows and orphans stranded in abject misery, a call for funds was sent out through Germany's most widely read newspaper, the Angsburger-Allgemeine. Not one penny was received. However, seven years later the German Americans contributed over one-million and a quarter for the wounded, widows and orphans of the Franco-German war.</p>

   <p>The press of Germany did not publish even the least word of thanks and that was not our last silly action in this direction.</p>
   <p>During the years following the crash, the collection bag presented to us across the ocean, went back empty, and in the editor's office of the German-American newspapers, the mass of beggar letters received went into the waste basket.</p>
