   <p>Mr. F. A Diener, who has been for many years a member of the Chicago Public Library Administration, resigned last week in order to join the contracting firm Jakob Fuerst &amp; Sons as partner. Diener was born in Germany and settled down in Chicago, where he began in the contracting business 20 years ago. The Library Administration has lost with Diener a reliable, honest official with pleasing manners and keen interest towards the growing needs of our city Libraries.</p>
