   <p>The German students who, on the basis of the German-American Students Exchange arrangement, are studying at American universities, have arranged a great festival from April 1st to April 5th, which will be called "The Festival of German Youth in America." It will be sponsored by the German-American Students' committee and the Institute of International Education.</p>
   <p>The festival includes a concert at the Aeolian hall, in which the prominent Sigrid Onegin will participate. There will also be a banquet at International House, where Jacob Wassermann, Camilla von Klenze and others will speak. A festival on board the S. S. Munich, which will be a brilliant social affair, will close the celebration.</p>
   <p>In their invitation, the German students in America refer to the help which German students have found in America since the war. The German Student Exchange Society was able to send German students to America for the study of special sciences. Institutions like the Rockefeller and the Carnegie Foundations, opened their doors to the German students who were studying international problems.</p>
