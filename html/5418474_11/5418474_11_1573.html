   <p>Alschuler, candidate for Governor, held his scheduled speech last night at the Central Music Hall. The large assembly consisted mostly of independent political elements which he addressed at the behest of the Municipal Voter's League.</p>
   <p>He declared in an emphatic manner, which left no room for duplicity, that he favors a thorough civil service reform, including the State institutions and he is unalterably opposed to the misappropriations of the Chicago Park Board and the State Warehouse Commission whose obligations should be confined to commerce and not to party-purposes. He is not in favor of State interference in strictly local affairs and further, he advocated, that the commonwealth of Chicago should be given the legal right, to solve its transportation and illumination problems, in conformity to their own belief as to what is most desirable for the community.</p>
