   <p>Of the 246 wealthy gentlemen who have been invited to appear before the Tax Revision Board, at the instigation of ex-Governor Altgeld, only 111 appeared yesterday. The remainder did not consider it necessary to give the requested information or postponed the interview because of other important business which required their presence elsewhere. The examination of those who called, showed, that ex-Governor Altgeld's assumption that these gentlemen belong to the millionaire class, is a grave injustice, and several asserted that their cash reserves are actually less than $100. Charles H. Mulliken, a real estate agent who resides at the Chicago Beach Hotel, swore, that he owns no bonds, mortgages, papers or, in fact, that he possesses nothing of value, and on April 1st of the current year he was devoid of any means whatsoever; absolutely broke. Similar testimony was given by several dozen ladies and gentlemen whose postal addresses are in the aristocratic districts..... A list of names and assessments follows all in the lower brackets from $1,000 to $54,717, and average of $12,695 for the eleven who are listed. This was indeed a fiasco (failure) for ex-Governor Altgeld and the "sensational newspaper" which induced him to proceed against the "millionaires," since amongst those supposedly wealthy people, there appeared an array of waiters, music-teachers and other poor devils who could not comprehend why they should be regarded as prosperous.</p>
