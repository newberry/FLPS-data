   <p>In his best years, Wilhelm L. Berblinger, lithographer, a highly respected and popular personality in German circles, died yesterday after a short but serious sickness. The deceased was born in the year 1849 in Uhn, Wurttemberg, from where he emigrated in the sixties to America, and after a short stay in the East, came to Chicago, which he chose as his permanent residence. He devoted himself to lithography, but later took active part in all political events, and has since occupied a number of offices, in an excellent and honorable manner. His administration as chief clerk in the office of County Treasurer, Charles Kern, is still well remembered. Also as a member of the Chicago Turngemeinde and the Suabian Society, the deceased played a prominent part.</p>
