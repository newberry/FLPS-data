   <p>A Society of Veterans Honor the Anniversary of the Battle of Weissenburg.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was the twentieth anniversary of the battle of Weissenburg; it was also a gala day for the Society of German Veterans, their families, and friends.</p>
   <p>The Society of German Veterans has recently become the possessor of two hand-some silk flags, one being the ensign of the society and the other a splendid specimen of the stars and stripes.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, the twentieth anniversary of the memorable battle of Weissenburg, the first great battle of the Franco-German war, was deemed a fitting time for the dedication of the new colors of the society - hence, the picnic at Ogden Grove yesterday afternoon and evening.</p>
   <p>The music for the occasion was furnished by prof. Weege with his orchestra of forty pieces.</p>
   <p>The German Veterans' Society was organized last September, and now has a membership <span class="page-break">\2</span>of ninety.</p>
   <p>The organization is composed of representative and substantial Germans who have fought in the German wars. George A. Massow is its president and H. Wilhelmy is its secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Manstein in his dedicatory speech spoke of the battle of Weissenburg in commemoration of which, the celebration was held. He stated that the society was organized for the purpose of keeping alive the feeling of brotherhood and fraternity among the German veterans from all parts of Germany.</p>
   <p>Prof. Gauss, who is a German-American veteran who did good service in the civil war, spoke in behalf of his society. He eulogized the word veteran, a title of which anyone may be proud if he has earned it in fact. "The overthrow of the rebel army and the preservation of the American union, and the consolidation of our old fatherland", he said, "are events whose like are few in history. It is quite proper that the presentation of the German flag precede that of the stars and stripes; for to us Germania is the mother of Columbia, whom we honor according to our mother's teachings."</p>
   <p>Prof. Gauss spoke eloquently of the German wars and of the battle of Weissenburg <span class="page-break">\3</span>in particular. He paid a high tribute to the German soldiers, both in the wars of the fatherland and in those of America.</p>
