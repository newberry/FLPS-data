   <p>The United States Senate has adopted the Immigration Bill by a vote of 50 to 7. A few days previous the Bill had passed the House with a large majority. Since the Senate has added a few amendments, the Bill has to go back to the House, and will probably be submitted to a joint conference. If the House should adopt the Senate amendments, or if the joint committee can straighten out the differences, the Bill will go to the President, who will have to make up his mind whether to sign it or to veto it and let the Bill become law without his signature.</p>
   <p>The adoption of the Bill by the House did not present any special interest for us German-Americans. The only noteworthy item in it was the provision which makes immigration dependent upon a "literacy test," which is nothing <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>more than a reading test, for all practical purposes, and by which admittedly no Germans at all and only a few citizens of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy could be barred from immigration. The literacy test is a fake and has been recognized and branded as such for a long time. While it apparently aims to exclude immigrants of low mental capacity, it is in reality nothing but a disguised means of restricting immigration.</p>
   <p>This has long been an established fact and is frankly admitted by the advocates of this provision. They want to hamstring and restrict immigration, and they resort to the literacy test as the only possible means which promises some measure of success and yet does not at the same time cause the "land of liberty and asylum for the oppressed" to "lose face." The measure is especially welcomed by the South, because it promises to curtail the immigration of the "Dagoes" and "Huns"--the southern Italians and southern Slavs--which the [American] Southerners hate. German immigration has nothing to fear from the literacy test. The Bill, in the way it was passed by the House, was in no <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>respect directed against the Germans or against German immigration (regardless of country). The German-American element could afford to regard the fate of the Bill with complacency, and from a purely American point of view. That was what they did, and while most German-Americans who were interested in this problem may have been against the Bill because it is basically wrong and insincere, there might have been a few who though that a restriction of the sort of immigration which the Bill aims to keep away was not such a bad idea after all, and at any rate the German-Americans had no special reason to go to bat for the nationalities affected by the Bill.</p>
   <p>When the Bill passed the House, the Democratic majority was responsible for it. But in the Senate, the Republicans added some amendments which aroused suspicion among the German-American element. One of these amendments was introduced by that very competent, though anglophil, Senator Root, and calls for an exemption from the provisions of this Bill for Belgians who want to <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>do farming. This amendment was to be effective for the duration of the war and one year thereafter. Another amendment, also of Republican origin, would make it the duty of the Secretary of Labor, who is under the influence of the A. F. of L., as everybody knows, to keep a watchful eye on the trend of the labor market and to report to Congress whenever the wage level or the employment opportunities seen to become adversely affected by immigration. The first amendment could be rightly called an unfriendly gesture toward Germany and the German cause, as well as an act incompatible with International Law and one which is bound to cause strife and trouble. The latter provision may be the first step toward a restriction of German immigration as such, and may lead to more extensive anti-immigration legislation, which, at present, may be advantageous for the country, but probably would turn out to be an obstacle in its future development.</p>
   <p>President Wilson indicated some time ago that he was opposed to the literacy test, and he was expected to veto the Bill if this clause was retained. But <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>that was before war had broken out, and conditions have changed since then. For one thing, large sections of our population are now of the opinion that after the conclusion of this tremendous conflict, emigration from Europe will take on huge dimensions, flooding America with a veritable tidal wave of war-weary European immigrants, unless we act in time and erect dams to keep this tide of humanity out. We think that this argument will probably turn out to be wrong, but it is prevalent today and we cannot refute it now. That may be the reason why the Senate voted for the Bill with such overwhelming majority, and our indebtedness is to this body if the Bill becomes a law without the President's signature, overriding his veto.</p>
