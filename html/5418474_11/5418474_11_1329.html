   <p>Professor Julius Mossel of Munich, who became prominent because of his magnificent decorative paintings, arrived here several days ago from Germany with the purpose of adopting Chicago as a field for his activities and of establishing himself here.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, Chicago will thereby benefit tremendously through the introduction of an almost entirely new artistic concept, namely the uniting of painting with architecture. Professor Mossel is regarded as one of the most prominent experts in the sphere of decorative art. Innumerable great paintings in Germany give most eloquent evidence of the creative artistic power of Prof. Mossel.</p>

   <p>He has decided now to select America as his future field of activity because of the unhappy economic conditions prevailing in his homeland. Those conditions made it impossible for him to develop his talents to their fullest extent.</p>
   <p>Prof. Mossel said about his immigration, "The reason I have left my country is because of the improbability of a return of prosperity there for a long time."</p>
   <p>The artist expressed himself about his future as follows: "I have not much time left. I am getting old and desire to rest. I have worked 38 years. I hope that the people in this beautiful country will make use of my services, that is the reason I am here, and I brought along my considerable practical knowledge.</p>
   <p>"I will accept any great or small order, but I decline to accept fees of artisans, because what I do and the way I do it, does not compare with the regrettable insufficiency of such men."</p>

   <p>Professor Mossel was born Oct. 10th, 1871, in Munich. He became a painter and won a reputation as an outstanding artist through his creative power, his tenacious diligence, and his inexhaustible imagination.</p>
   <p>As an interior architect he also created great works of art, and finished numerous paintings in private buildings. He is also prominent as an author of technical and scientific periodicals.</p>
   <p>Professor Mossel's comments about America's productions in the field of decorative art, are very interesting. He said: "I have noticed that here in America the correct application of colors in architecture is seen only occasionally. The element of coloring, so sparingly applied, is probably the result of wrong instruction and education in the field of art for more than a hundred years."</p>
   <p>Professor Mossel has chosen as his home the Madison Park Hotel, 1380 Hyde Park Blvd.</p>
