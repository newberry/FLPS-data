   <p>According to a cable from Berlin, Mr. Henry Claussenius of this city, died after a ten days illness of nervous fever. This sad news, will be received among his friends and acquaintances, with sincere regret, because Mr. Claussenius, during his long activity in Chicago, has taken a prominent part in many public affairs, added a great deal to promotion of sociableness, and through acts of kindness obligated a number of people. The deceased was 72 years old. He was born in Eschwange, in Hessen-Nassau, as the son of a judge. He lost his father at the age of six years, but his widowed mother was able to give him an excellent education. After finishing his studies, young Claussenius devoted himself to teaching, but felt compelled, in the year 1850, owing to the disagreeable reactionary tendency, to turn his back on Germany and to emigrate to the United States. In the first few years of his residence in New York, he worked alternately as a woodcutter, draftsman, and merchant. Afterwards he found employment in the office of the Prussian Consul-General, where he advanced to the position of chancellor. In the years 1867 he became a consul of the North German Federation, and was sent to Chicago. After 1871 he remained as consul for the German Empire, till the German Government sent a professional consul to fill the position. This took place in 1878; in the same year, the Austrian government entrusted him with its representation, and he remained, in this postion, till 3 years ago, when Austria too, organized a professional consulate. Mr. Claussenius engaged here, with great success, in a steamship tickets and money exchange business, which will be continued by his sons Edward and George W. He was one of the founders and the first president of the Germania Men's Choir, and a member of the German Society. He is survived by his widow, and six children, five sons and one daughter, who is the wife of Judge Theodore Brentano.</p>
