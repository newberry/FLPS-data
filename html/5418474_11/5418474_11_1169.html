   <p>The town of Oldeslos in Schleswig, (Germany), conferred upon her son abroad, Mr. Ernest J. Kruetgen, president of the World's Fair's German group, and a leader of Chicago's German element, the honorary citizenship. Acting Mayor Spiess has already forwarded the document which contains the unanimous resolution of the city council.</p>
   <p>It is 50 years since Mr. Kruetgen left his home town and only visited there once, but he has always kept up his connections with the old home, and liberally assisted the town in times of need during and after the war.</p>
