   <p>The memory of John Peter Altgeld is still fresh in Chicago. In a meeting held yesterday he was celebrated as a man of the people, as a fighter for the rights of the masses against the powerful and rich capitalists, grafters and oppressors. Mayor Dunne, one of the speakers said: This is the first time that in Chicago the memory of a politician is honored five years after his death.</p>
   <p>More then a thousand persons were present at the celebration at the Garrick Theater at Randolph Street. Shortly after 2 P. M. the meeting was opened by Daniel L. Cruice. Pastor Thomas E. Cox preached the sermon and the choir of the Sinai Temple sung the Choral "Lead Kindly Light", a favorite song with the deceased. The Chairman presented Mr. Alschuler as the first speaker. Mr. Cruice emphasized in his speech that Altgeld was a pioneer of his time, a deep thinker, who in his political career in the State of Illinois found many problems he had to solve.</p>
   <p>He attracted largely the younger elements and scon had a great number of followers who agitated for higher ideals and the virtues of citizenship.</p>

   <p>No practical politicians were among them. True love for right and his citizens, gave the principal indications of his character. One of his followers accepted the invitation to make a speech at this memorial. Mr. Samuel Alschuler introduced by him and who was welcomed with great applause, made the following speech;</p>
   <p>We are here not only to honor the dead but also to judge his deeds after the short time of five years. The noble character under the great influence of his loving wife shines from the darkness of the past. I will not explain how Altgeld, as the son of a German farmer, has found his way as a railway worker, teacher, lawyer, States Attorney, Judge and Governor, and retired to private life, died as a poor man, but his indefatigable work for the elevation of humanity was fought and envied in the most bitter and poisonous manner. He was called a dreamer by his opponents, an idealist, but the world's progress and progressive development have been based only on the action of such men like Altgeld. His creative mind has assisted in improving impracticable conditions. Many stately buildings for the best of suffering humanity, give a striking proof of his work. "I have no children" he once said to me, and I consider these buildings as my children, to</p>
   <p>give the coming generations my blessings." Some of his greatest social reforms <span class="page-break">3</span>were the Parole System, the Asylum for the Insane in Bartonville, the clinic for Incurables in Peopia. The education of the masses by the development of the schools and education institutions, was one of his principal objects.</p>
   <p>Altgeld's idea was that the working masses, on account of economic contributions, are entitled to special consideration. The world could not exist without the working power of the masses, and their evolution should be promoted in the interest of culture. He was a fighter for mankind and humanity. He was a guide of the people and pardoner of several criminals for humanity's sake. He was called John Pardon Altgeld, though he always stood for public order and maintenance of the law. Not by cruel force, but by educational enlightenment should the evolution of the masses take place. He was against all graft and corruption and made enemies of the crafty politicians. He often said that capitalism makes the law, and corruption is its means. He represented the city in the fight against the charters and concessions for the utilities. His ideals were truth, human love and hard work. After the finish of the speech the choir of the Sinai ensemble sang the hymn by Gaul, "No Shadows Beyond", and then Mayor Dunne was introduced as second speaker. Mayor Dunne said, I am proud, having the opportunity to contribute to the honor shown this man. The rememberance for the dead will <span class="page-break">4</span>survive for many generations. I had the pleasure of knowing the deceased personally, and his good qualities. His sympathy always was on the side of the poor and the oppressed, and he fought for them in word and deed. He was the enemy of the racketeers and regarded them as the enemies of the people. He proved his great courage in the pardon of the anarchists and his reasons created a great excitement in the whole world. His great courage was also displayed at another occasion, when President Cleveland, without demand of city or state authorities, sent federal troupes to Chicago to suppress riots. Altgeld put in an energetic protest against this unlawful action. His stainless honesty is shown at another occasion. When he was elected as Governor he was independently rich, but when he got into financial difficulties he refused a bribe of half a million dollars. A few years later he died as a poor man.</p>
   <p>He fought for the liberty of the small Boer Republic against the greediness of the British. He died in the battle for humanity. Nobody has been more abused and suspected in the State of Illinois than John Peter Altgeld because he fought the power of capitalism. Many of his enemies of the capitalistic group, who died, are forgotten, but his memory shines in a brilliant light and the best inscription for <span class="page-break">5</span>his memorial should be" the friend of the masses".</p>
   <p>The whole meeting stood up and sang, "America", and as a last speaker Mr. Charles A. Towne, National Congressman of New York was introduced. He made the following speech:</p>
   <p>"It is the sacred duty of all acquaintances of Altgeld to oppose the abuses of his enemies upon the memory of the dead. There has been a great change in public opinion after his death, and this great meeting five years afterwards is an important sign of the times. His views, "Equal rights for all, Privileges for none," must be maintained. During his office he was a fearless opponent of all privileges and craft. He was only led by his conviction for right, and when he signed the pardon of the anarchists he knew that he had to give up his political ambition for the senate, but he did not hesitate, ignoring the consequences.</p>
