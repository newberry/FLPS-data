   <p>School Commissioner Greifenhagen has succeeded in his protest against the decision of the School Board to omit exercise halls in the new schools. Assisted by Dr. M. Fattrich and school architect, D. H. Perkins, they obtained the repeal of the former resolution of the School Board.</p>
   <p>It was decided to make additions in the buildings of halls, which can also be used for meetings. They will be 40 X 80 to 50 X100 feet. They will be built strong enough, so that further floors can later be added.</p>
