   <p>At the meeting of the Sunset Club, which took place yesterday, at the Grand Pacific Hotel, the topic, "Immigration" was debated. The chief speakers were S. Thompson, the former editor of America and Fritz Glogauer, the publisher of the German Abendpost. Thompson came to the conclusion that not all immigrants are a benefit to the United States, because Europe is not sending its best citizens over here. He referred to the census of 1880 according to which only 13% of our population is foreign born, but that 17% of the inmates of poor houses, 21.8% of the prisoners, and 28% of the insane were foreigners.</p>
   <p>Mr. Glogauer explained that the reason for the high percentage of foreigners among prisoners is to be found in the fact that usually the small thieves are caught and punished and the big ones go free. Insanity, he rejoined, is in most cases the result of the bitter struggle for existence. Our immigration laws, Mr. Glogauer replied make provisions against the landing of paupers and insane persons, but they are not carried out.</p>
