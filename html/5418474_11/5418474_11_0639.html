   <p>For the American nativists, who consider Americanism as an already accomplished nationality and wish, consequently, to impose their ideals upon others, the census made in 1870 contains a serious lesson. It appears from it that of the 38,500,000 inhabitants of the United States in 1870 - 5,500,000 were born in foreign countries, that almost ten million were children of foreign-born parents, that at least half a million had a foreign-born father, ten million a foreign-born mother and that the births in American-born families are constantly decreasing.</p>
   <p>It is the immigration of that element which is most opposed to the nativist puritanism i. e. the German element which is increasing the most.</p>

   <p>The outlook for American nativism is the worst in the West. With the exception of Texas and Missouri immigration still completely ignores the South.</p>
   <p>German immigration is heaviest in the Northwest. The Irish immigration settles mostly in the East. German nationality is bound to exercise a great influence upon the formation of the future American national character, a greater influence than the Anglo-American knights of the clod and the Puritan blockheads are now dreaming of.</p>
