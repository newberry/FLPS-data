   <p>Assurance of agricultural activity for immigrants is sought by Catholic priests through an organization called "The Catholic Colonization of the United States of America," formed by Catholic priests. This organization will endeavor to assure immigrants, who made a living in Europe in the field of agriculture, of a continuation of this type of livelihood in this country. The organization is putting much stress on the fact that the majority of the immigrants are natives of South and Southeast Europe, where they were engaged in agriculture. Since their arrival in this country they were forced, without discrimination, to be absorbed by our industries, thus becoming common laborers under rather adverse conditions. The program of this new organization consists of sending a number of young priests to Europe, where, with the assistance of local priests, an <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>attempt will be made to acquire desirable immigrants as members of the Catholic agricultural colonies, the organization of which will be sponsored by agricultural societies, preferably in the South. These Catholic agricultural colonization societies must pledge to provide the community with a church and a school as soon as the community grows to 400 or 500 inhabitants. However, no attempt will be made to induce any person engaged in agricultural work in Europe to immigrate to the United States. Moreover, these societies will confine their activities to assist those who are determined to leave their native land and emigrate to the United States, to the land of their choice.</p>
   <p>At the head of the organization is Reverend Julius E. de Voss, of St. John Bergman's community, 2517 Logan Blvd. The vice-president, Reverend P. Bandini, has left for Europe already, to carry out the organization's <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>instructions. The secretary of the society is Rev. V. Tesselaer, and the treasurer is Rev. F. de Lange. The directors of the society are: The Reverends de Voss, Bandini, Tesselaer, de Lange, Glesa, Hynek, Hollinger, Tarif, Riordan, and Hopper.</p>
