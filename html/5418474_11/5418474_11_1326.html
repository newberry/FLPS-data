   <p>Another of the old German settlers of Chicago has been taken by death. John Hetzel, president for many years of the Hetzel Packing Company, died Friday night from a heart ailment.</p>
   <p>John Hetzel, who had lived for over 40 years in Chicago, died after a short illness at his home, 422 Briar Place, at the age of 62 years. He was born in Germany, and at the age of 16 years came to America, settling in Chicago. Here he started his business and from small beginnings, during the course of decades, developed it to one of the most prosperous in Chicago.</p>

   <p>Since 1888, he had been president of the company. The firm today is one of the greatest packing houses of Chicago and its high grade products are well known everywhere. The Hetzel sausage machine, which was his own invention, manufactured the sausages without their having to be touched by human hands. This machine greatly contributed toward the maintenance of the firm's reputation.</p>
   <p>Many years ago, John Hetzel took his two sons into his business as partners and they also contributed their share to the firm's leadership, and undoubtedly will continue the work of the deceased on the same principles.</p>
   <p>For about 15 years the deceased has also been interested in the Western Packing Company, whose president he had been for several years.</p>
