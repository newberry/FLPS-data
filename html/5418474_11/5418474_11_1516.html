   <p>Otto Young was born in Elberfeld on December 20th, 1844, and died when nearly 62 years old. As a five-year old boy he lost his father who was an architect, and a few years later his mother died. The fourteen year old Otto was sent to relatives in New York and attended first, for one year, the Military School in Cornwall-on-the-Hudson. He then returned to New York where he worked in a cigar store for $3.00 a week. By his economy he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>saved from these small wages a small sum that enabled him to start in 1861 a jewelry business. He developed the business and sold it after six years profitably and became a travelling salesman for a New York firm. At the time of the great fire he came to Chicago. His sharp eye recognized at once the great possibilities of this city as an industrial center and so he founded in the building at 149 - 151 State Street, a jewelry wholesale house. When in 1885 the Fair was incorporated Mr. Young bought for $100,000 one half of the stock and took over personally the management of this enterprise, which grew under his able hand to its present height. About a year ago he retired from business.</p>
   <p>Mr. Young left a large fortune, which is estimated at $20,000,000 and consists in a large part of real estate in the city.</p>
   <p>Since the death of his son Otto, Mr. Young gave great care to welfare institutions. In memory of his son he erected for $100,000 an addition to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Home for Incurables at 55th Street and Ellis Avenue, and has since paid for the upkeep of this department. Also for other welfare institutions and purposes he had an open hand.</p>
   <p>Mr. Young married his wife in 1867 in New Orleans. Her maiden name was Murphy and she came from Virginia. During the last years he spent much of his time in Lake Geneva. Last year he sold his interest in the Fair to Mrs. Auguste Lehmann. He belonged to the Directors of the First National Bank and the Chicago City Railway Company.</p>
