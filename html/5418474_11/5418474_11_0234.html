   <p>Many friends and citizens of the North Side have requested that I organize a new militia company to acquaint the members with military exercises and tactics. Since the state government at Springfield has sent another shipment of arms, and has promised me some of them, I appeal to all the citizens of the North Side and others who are interested in organizing a company to report at the German House Wednesday evening, March 12, at 7:30 P. M. All German citizens are especially invited.</p>
