   <p>Pittsburg, April 20th. Emil Gathmann of Chicago, son of the well-known Chicago inventor, Louis Gathmann, visited the Carnegie Steel Works to supervise the preparations for a trial of a new and important invention of his father. Emil G., the son was at one time employed at the Krupp and other famous armament factories, where he held influential positions. The improvement is a sort of explosive bomb, which is considered more dangerous than any projectiles constructed heretofore. They are designed for the large coast-defense guns and are alleged to destroy a warship, if one drops within 300 yards of a vessel. At the Carnegie plant, a dozen sample bombs will be made, and filled with the new substance; after that they are to be sent to Sandy Hook, where Government experts shall conduct extensive trials.</p>
   <p>If the invention fulfills the expectations, then the navy department intends to accept them without further delay.</p>
