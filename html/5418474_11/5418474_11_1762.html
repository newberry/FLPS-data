   <p>Governor Altgeld's condition is improving and if he suffers no relapse, he will be able to start his journey to Springfield on Saturday. For the present, however, the doctor's orders are that he refrain from meeting visitors and that he ramain at home in seclusion, home in this instance being the Palmer House. In consideration of these circumstances, the Iroquois Club cancelled its festival which was announced for this evening; it was to be an honorary reception for Altgeld.</p>
   <p>His inauguration proclamation is nearly finished. It will give a detailed account of the fundamentals which Altgeld intends to apply when he is at the helm of the state, particularly matters appertaining to schools, prisons, how to improve roads, what methods to pursue in order to make the State Commissioners really useful to the population at large, whereby their specific usefulness to politicians, will be abridged.</p>
