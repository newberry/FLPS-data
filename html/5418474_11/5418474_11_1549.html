   <p>P. 3 - 4 Julius Roemheld, the oldest pioneer German chemist and druggist in Chicago, passed away early yesterday morning at his residence, 1 Park Avenue, near Ashland Blvd. He had been a resident of this city since 1850, when he arrived from Darmstadt, Germany, where he was born.</p>
   <p>He opened a drug store at the northwest corner of N. Clark and Kinzie Streets, the first fine drug store in this section of the country. Hunters, trappers, and frontiersmen came from long distances for medicines at this store. In 1869 Mr. Roemheld sold out to Anton Hesing of the Staats-Zeitung, father of Washington Hesing, and Amiel Dietsch,a druggist, and went into the business of a manufacturing chemist at 212 Kinzie St. In the great fire of 1871 the old drug store was swept away.</p>
   <p>Mr. Roemheld left a widow and five children.</p>
