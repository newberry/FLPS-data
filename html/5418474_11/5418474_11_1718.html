   <p>One of the oldest settlers of Chicago, Christoph Thilmann, died yesterday morning at his home 6120 S. Halsted Street, at the age of 71. He was born 1823 in Germany and came, only 18 years old, in 1841 to America. He traveled quite a bit, before he finally settled down in Chicago, about 50 years ago. Thilmann was a successful business man and speculated in real estate, which brought him a fortune of $150,000. He is survived by a widow and four grown up children.</p>
