   <p>With sincere regrets, his friends and acquaintances will hear the news that John Egelhoff died yesterday after a brief but severe illness. An affection of the heart, which had forced him to bed many times before, and which of late was complicated by a disease of the kidneys, ended his life.</p>
   <p>Born in Dorn-Duerckheim, Germany, he came to America in the sixties, settling first in Milwaukee, then in Chicago where he educated himself as a druggist. But he did not remain here long. He was attracted by the sunny South, by Florida and Alabama. Returning to Chicago, he became business manager of a number of drug stores. When, later on, his advanced heart ailment forced him to observe a quiet and careful regime he made his home with his nephew, who lives here. It was here that he closed his tired eyes for the eternal slumber.</p>
