   <p>Governor Altgeld finally found the right way to deal with the Pullman Company. He brought the proof, that this company is receiving far more privileges, benefits and advantages from the State and community than justified by the small amount of taxes paid by the said company.</p>
   <p>According to its own statements, the Pullman Company has a capital of $36,000,000 with reserves of $25,000,000, total $61,000,000.-</p>
   <p>The Pullman Company is making good profits and is paying to the shareholders regularly about 8% dividends.</p>
   <p>At the same time the property of the same company has been valued only at $7,500,00 and therefore is paying only a very small part of her due share in taxes.</p>
   <p>Governor Altgeld has ordered a revaluation of the Company's tax obligations.</p>
