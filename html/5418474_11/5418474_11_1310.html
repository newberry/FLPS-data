   <p>Dr. F. Huxmann, the dean of German dentists in Chicago, celebrated his 79th birthday in physical and mental alertness, at his home, 2832 Burling Street. Numerous friends came to express their congratulations. Dr. Huxmann expressed his thanks to all of them and told stories of his memories of the Chicago of old days, where he settled 60 years ago.</p>
   <p>His eyes sparkled with amusement when he mentioned the introduction of the first street car on the North Side, which ran from Kinzie Street to North Avenue, in which, during the winter, the passengers' feet had to be wrapped in hay or straw in order to prevent them from freezing.</p>
   <p>He also recalled the times when it was permissible to hunt in Lincoln Park; when the "Bavarian Heaven" was in its prime and "Beringer's Garden" was the principal amusement park of all Germans, even though they had to walk from North Avenue through the deep sand of the highways to reach the place.</p>
   <p>Dr. Huxmann, like many others, had to fight hard for his living. He spoke with special devotion of his father, who, as a teacher was not so well remunerated and therefore was unable to help him financially during his early struggles. But he gave him his blessings and these good words: "Do right and fear no man."</p>
