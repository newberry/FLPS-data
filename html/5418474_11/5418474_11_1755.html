   <p>About 8:30 o'clock last night Mr. Louis Nettelhorst closed his eyes forever in his home, 46 Wisconsin Street. To his family and friends the catastrophe came suddenly and unexpectedly, for he had withheld from them his condition. Last Sunday, upon the urgent request of his family, he finally sought aid of medical science, but it was too late. Human skill could not save him any more.</p>
   <p>The physicians, Dr. P. H. Matthei, and Dr. H. Geiger diagnosed the case immediately as a shrinkage of the kidneys; however, they were unable to do anything else but to ease the sufferings. The disease started apparently two years ago when he was ill with influenza.</p>
   <p>The illness increased steadily, and may have been accelerated through the unceasing work of the patient. Nettelhorst possessed, as is well known, a marvelous energy for work. Next to his regular business responsibilities, he devoted his time to club activities, and he also took an active part in political affairs. As late as last Monday, when he already was in the grip of death, he came to his office to attend to his daily duties.</p>

   <p>Nettelhorst was very highly esteemed by his fellow citizens. Frequently, posts of honor were offered to him, and on the day of his death, the Citizen's Council, which met in the Sherman House, intended to offer him a position of high honor and trust, i. e., that of city treasurer.</p>
   <p>One of his most highly esteemed traits was his frankness, and this, combined with his integrity and iron will, made him very influential in business, as well as in social life. Everybody knew that Nettelhorst's words could be trusted and depended upon.</p>
   <p>Nettelhorst was born on February 4, 1851, in Bremem, Germany. In 1870 he emigrated to Chicago, where with but a few interruptions he lived the rest of his life. At first he went into the insurance business, but later he took up general merchandising. In 1875 he became a bookkeeper at C. Emmerich &amp; Co., and after twelve years of service he became a partner of the same firm.</p>
   <p>During all this time he was very active in gymnastics and social life. The Chicago Turngemeinde (Athletic Club) elected him in 1880 as its first speaker, and for twelve years he retained this honorable position. The choral society, Fidelia, made him its president in 1875, and its success was in a large measure due to his leadership.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Germania Men's Choir, and he also was an esteemed and beloved member of the Oriental Free Masons, the German Press Club, and the Men's Club of the Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>Nettelhorst was unusually successful as a member of the School Board, to which he belonged for six years, being its president for two years. Due to his energetic efforts, gymnastics were introduced in public schools, and the continuation of German instruction is, to a certain extent, also due to his activities. Last summer he resigned voluntarily from this position. In recognition of his services, the school located at Evanston Avenue and School Street was named after him.</p>
   <p>Repeatedly, Nettelhorst refused to run as candidate for congress. He was not seeking political honors. However, two years ago he was persuaded by Harrison to accept the candidacy for city treasurer, but he was defeated in connection with the party ticket...</p>
   <p>In 1873 Nettelhorst married Miss Betty Roegeneck. One daughter and two sons were born to them. They are now seventeen, sixteen and nine years old, respectively. This family loses in him a most devoted and loving provider; <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>his firm a capable and energetic partner; the gymnastic and other clubs lose one of their most successful promoters, and the country loses one of its most unselfish and loyal patriots.</p>
