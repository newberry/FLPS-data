   <p>Mr. William S. Forman, has now received an answer to his open letter to Governor Altgeld. The Governor declares, the accusations which the former congressman of the 21st district, and present candidate of the Sound Money Democrats for the office of States Attorney, brought against him, are unfounded and false.</p>
   <p>He would not have paid any attention to them, had Forman not accused the late John W. Lanehart. The Governor analyzed the personality of the writer, of the letter, and declared him to be a very unreliable fellow, who even by his closest friends is called "foxy 'William". A year and a half ago,Forman came to him and tried to become friendly. But he, Governor Altgeld, told him frankly, that he did not trust him, partly on account of his action in congress, partly on account of his slippery personality. Shortly after,Forman tried through the mediation of third parties to obtain an appointment as member of the Railroad and Warehouse Commission, or to the Board of Superintendents of the Southern State Penitentiary.</p>
   <p>The Governor closed his answer as follows: "If I can not look into the face of honest people, then I do not want to be Governor of Illinois, therefore, I repeat, what I said on previous occasions: "If my election depends on your vote, then I renounce it.'"</p>
   <p>It is up to Mr. Forman, to bring proof for his accusations, or to give the lie to Governor Altgeld, if he is able to do so.</p>
