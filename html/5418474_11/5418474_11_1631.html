   <p>Ex-Postmaster, Waghington Hesing, is no more. Although but forty-eight years old and seemingly in the best of health, he died suddenly of heart failure two days ago while taking an after-dinner nap, at his home in the private Hotel, Maison Du Lac, on Michigan Boulevard. When Mrs. Hesing returned, shortly after 4 o'clock from an errand, she found her husband failing rapidly. A physician was summoned but the patient did not rally.</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing, born in 1849, in Cincinnati, was an only son and came with his parents at the age of six to Chicago. Anton C. Hesing endeavored to give his son an excellent education. He sent him to American and German schools and universities, and it was his heart's desire to transfer to him not only the business management, but also the editorial leadership of the newspaper enterprise that had brought power and esteem upon himself. The son tried to his best ability to fulfill the desires of his father, but from the start he inclined more toward the political platform, and personally to share in the party fights, than to keep himself strictly within the barriers drawn by his profession. In this he followed the example of his father with whom he went campaigning for the first time in 1871. This nomination as Postmaster of Chicago by President Cleveland, gave him a few years ago the first opportunity to practice his administrative talents. As all postal employees who worked under him now admit, he succeeded in bringing about valuable improvements during his term as Postmaster. How the deceased, last spring, let himself be induced, by his ambition, to sacrifice the office of postmaster for a doubtful candidacy as Mayor, is still fresh in the memory of all. The overwhelming defeat which he suffered, and other worries, contributed to undermine his health. Lately, Mr. Hesing had an attack of influenza, but did not pay much attention to it, and was probably like his friends, convinced that he would reach an old age. His wife, Henrietta, nee Weir, had no children.</p>
   <p>The deceased was at present President of the Staats-Zeitung Company, of the (English) Press Club, and the Association of Former Yale Students. He was also a member of the Germania, Iroquois, and Union League Clubs. The funeral will take place Wednesday morning, 11 o'clock from the Cathedral, Superior and Lake Streets.</p>
   <p>For a conclusion the following notice of the German Press Club may find room:</p>
   
   <p>The German Press Club of Chicago has learned with deepest regret the news of the sudden death of its member, Washington Hesing. It has always viewed Mr. Hesing as a brave pioneer of the American Germans, and as an able and courageous German-American journalist, and feels in his death a great loss. To the Widow of the deceased the Club expresses its profound condolence.</p>
