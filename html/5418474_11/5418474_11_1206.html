   <p>Fritz Renk, who is well-known in the German circles of Chicago, is arranging a concert at the Civic Theater in the new Opera house building. The program includes compositions of Paganini, Kreisler, Vieuxtemps, Elmann and other composers.</p>
   <p>Fritz Renk, Chicagoan of German descent, after completion of his studies, appeared first in Baden-Baden and Paris and soon won the recognition of leading artists. Later he appeared in the United States together with Clair Dux, Florence Macbeth, Vittorio Arimondi and Titto Ruffa. For a certain length of time Fritz Renk was the conductor of concerts in the Northside Turner Hall and incidentally the youngest conductor of these concerts during its sixty-fifth year of existence.</p>
   <p>During last winter's season, Renk gave concerts in different parts of the country and achieved great success.</p>
