   <p>Dr. F. R. Muehlhaus, a physician, who came here two years ago, has received the information that his two-year-old daughter, Rea Maria, is to be regarded as a foreigner and, for this reason, can be admitted here as a visitor only. The child will have to be sent back to Germany soon after Christmas, while the parents may stay in the country.</p>
