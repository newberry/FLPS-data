   <p>We just received a telegram from Philadelphia, that the noted German-American scientist Oswald Seidensticker has died after short illness. He was born 1825 in Goettingen (Germany) and studied philology there. He came in 1846 to America and accepted a position as teacher in Philadelphia. Soon afterwards he founded a school of languages in Chicago, but returned in 1852 to Philadelphia, where he stayed until his death as Professor of the German language at the University of Pennsylvania. Prof. Seidensticker is next to Friedrich Kapp, the most important historian of our country. His numerous works are known all over the United States. The most out-standing books he write, are "Franz Daniel Pastorius and the formation of Germantown" and "The First Century of Printing in the United States."</p>
   <p>His interesting articles on German activity and German contributions towards the educational development of America were regularly published in the "Pennsylvania Magazine of History" and "The German Pioneer" at Cincinnati.</p>
