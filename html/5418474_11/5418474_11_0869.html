   <p>A local American morning paper prints the world-terrifying news that the Chicago architect Louis Guenzel has been chosen to revise the map of East Russia. That's just what the paper announces.</p>
   <p>Mr. Guenzel informed a reporter of the Abendpost today that the Alliance for the Aid of Eastern Prussia commissioned him to draw the plans for Ragnit, a locality southwest of Tilsit, in Eastern Prussia. The German government has bequeathed the war godfathership to the aforesaid association and the architect, incidentally, has also been asked to supervise the construction. The township of Ragnit had 34,000 inhabitants prior to the Russian occupation. Five thousand residents of the city of Ragnit and at least four thousand people from several villages in the district were dragged into Russia, where most of them disappeared. The Russians also <span class="page-break">2</span>did much damage in this territory.</p>
   <p>At present Mr. Guenzel has no idea of the requirements, neither is he informed about the new public and private dwellings which must be erected, since a detailed report of the German administration, which was due in November, has not arrived. It undoubtedly enjoys English hospitality. As Mr. Guenzel cannot travel to Germany now, because of easily definable reasons, further decisions must be held in abeyance. The preliminary work here requires maps, topographic photographs, then a declaration about arms, and elucidation on a hundred subjects, which at present are interwoven in an undertaking of this kind. If the German officials are willing to wait until after the war, then Mr. Guenzel will travel to Germany and remain there, either to complete the renovation, or at least long enough to enable some representative to continue it according to the original conception.</p>
   <p>Otherwise the news of the morning paper is given correctly.</p>
