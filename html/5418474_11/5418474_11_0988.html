   <p>It is a well-known fact that Germany is taking part in our World's Fair. The government and its citizens are earnestly working for the success of this international celebration on American soil.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of German-Americans to acknowledge and appreciate these efforts and also this friendly attitude towards our adopted father-land. Likewise we should express our admiration for the marvelous products of German art and industry.</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors of the World's Fair has arranged that each country shall have the opportunity to demonstrate its special achievements on a specific day. Since June 15th. is the appointed day for the Germans, it was decided by the promotion committee to request the German-American organizations of Chicago, as well as all the German-Americans near and far, to assist in making this day most brilliant and memorable.</p>
   <p>We should prove to our German brethren in Europe that we gratefully appreciate their efforts to increase Germany's honor and reputation, and that we gladly <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>welcome these tokens of lasting friendship between the land of our birth and the land of our choice.</p>
   <p>A meeting will be held Friday evening, May 26, in the banquet hall of the Athletic Club, North Clark Street, to arrange the necessary preparations for this grand and extraordinary demonstration. Every German organization of Chicago should be represented. United we can achieve great things.</p>
   <p>All Clubs and Societies should act promptly. All who desire to help, are invited to attend this meeting.</p>
