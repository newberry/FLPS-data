   <p>To overcome war hatreds, to prepare a way for a better understanding between Germany and German-Americans, to give the two nations opportunities to become better acquainted and to value each other more, - to fulfill these aims the Karl Schurz Society was founded.</p>
   <p>The name is in remembrance of this man of whom Bismarck said: "As a German I am proud of Karl Schurz, a man who fills the highest positions in the United States, and yet has never forgotten his homeland." This society is composed of such men as Robert Bosch, Anton Erkelanz, and Dr. Mittelman.</p>
   <p>Citizens of the United States who are to visit Germany will receive helpful advice. Germany in its turn is going to send prominent speakers to America for whom requests had been made. However, the society refuses to accept any payment for its services, because it is not a business concern, and does not intend to become one. Its work shall be devoted entirely to the promotion of better understanding between the two nations.</p>
