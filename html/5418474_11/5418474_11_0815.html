   <p>"May your visit to this country contribute to the cooperation of the two great Republics, Germany and America, as before the war, as protectors of peace and as supporters of culture." With these plain but significant words Mr. Frank Vande Westerlaken, president of the Germania Club closed his address welcoming officially the visiting German delegation to the Interparliamentarian Conference yesterday evening in the Germania Clubhouse, in the name of Chicago's Germans. It was an evening, which no doubt will long be remembered by all those who were present. The invitations were issued jointly by the Germania Club and the German Club, and about 500 persons, among them the most prominent German Americans of the city, responded.</p>
   <p>What especially distinguished the arrangement from similar ones on other occasions was the spirit which prevailed from the beginning. Early in the evening the entrance of the German guests into the festive hall, decorated with American and German flags, offered the opportanity for a demonstration coming from and going to the heart. The assemblage rose like one man, when the German people's representatives entered; Fritz Renk and his orchestra struck up "Deutschland uber Alles" and everybody <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>joined in singing. With this the keynote was given for the evening: Quite a few more German songs were heard during the meal, and the visitors were in the right humour to listen to a number of speeches later on. A better toastmaster than Mr. Ernst Kruetgen, could not be found. As one of the city's best known German Americans, the former president of the Germania Club stands in high esteem of his fellow citizens. At his right sat the president of the German parliament Mr. Paul lobe, and to his left the former German chancellor Dr. Joseph K. Wirth. On the table of honor, which occupied the whole broad side of the large Hall, were seated besides the representative of the German Government Dr. Rudolph Steinbach and his wife, the minister to Hungary, Theodore Brentano, who is here on furlough at present, the two presidents of the clubs, Frank Vande Westerlaken and A. F. W. Siebel and, colorfully mixed with the German visitors, distinguished men of science, and prominent business men. U. S. Senator Charles S. Deneen who had gladly accepted the invitation extended to him, was compelled to his great regret to excuse himself at the last moment, a severe cold which he caught while attending the funeral of his colleague Ralston of Indiana, confined him, on the advice of his physician, to his home. Ex-Senator James Hamilton Lewis, who was prevented from attending wrote a letter in which he expressed his regrets at not being able to be present. Miss Lora Bodeins, soprano, and a double quartet of the United Men's Choir, brought a welcome change in the program by their performances. The round of speeches was opened by Mr. Kruetgen, who said:</p>

   <p>"Greetings:</p>
   <p>"Highly esteemed quests, Ladies and Gentlemen! A short time ago we were honored by the presence or one of Germany's great sons, Dr. Hugo Eckener, who made the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in a dirigible. Let us hope that this is not the last of a Zeppelin, crossing the ocean. This evening we have the honor to welcome in our midst leaders of the New Germany, men who are entrusted with the welfare of the German people, from whom we also are descended on whom we hang with allthe threads of our hearts. We were true to our Fatherland, its struggle was our struggle. We suffered with the German people, we protested against the war, we protested against the black disgrace, we protested against the invasion of the Ruhr by the French. We sent our protests to Washington, to the president, to congress - the German-Americans could always be found on the side of justice.</p>
   <p>"Only when the German people were exhausted and unarmed the French invaded German soil, amidst trumpets and kettledrums with heavy cannons, they marched into the Ruhr. This was a breach of peace and of the Versailles peace treaty. Today we welcome men who are working on Germany's rebuilding, and I think I am speaking in the name of all German-Americans, when I say: 'We salute you'. We honestly hope, that your mission which brought you to us, will be fulfilled, and that you will <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>return with the consciousness, that on the other side of the Atlantic German hearts are beating for German liberty. Not long ago we celebrated here the German day, on which occasion 35,000 members of the same race, publicly professed their belonging to Germanism. This evening we are following the voice of German blood, when we welcome the honored guests from the old Fatherland, and the great people, a heroic nation, which fought for 41/2 years against a world of enemies for their homes and liberty, of a people whose blood runs also in our veins, a people whose culture fructified all old nations beneficially.</p>
   <p>"'Might is right' seems to be the pattern of the world, and the German people were humiliated by having the Versailles treaty, the greatest crime of civilization forced upon them. The war guilt! But truth is powerful and will be victorious. Truth is also our problem, and it is our duty to open a street to truth, to the honor of our country, of our German Fatherland and the rest of the world. Our hearts belong to this great Republic, but we also acknowledge ourselves to be true to Germany, and whoever insults the soul of our nationality, we shall know how to keep him within bound!"</p>
   <p>Loebe speaks: "Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"When we accepted the invitation of President Coolidge, to deliberate with the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>representatives of forty nations, we knew that a special mission was awaiting the members of the German delegation, to offer their hands to the German-Americans who have done so much for the building-up of this country. To these we bring the greetings of the German parliament, and the German people. German-Americanism, when we were prone on the ground extended its hands to us. It shall be left to the leading members of parliament, to deal more closely with this theme. But we wish to awake your confidence for the new Germany, as it arose after the debacle. You may listen to us, and form your own opinion.</p>
   <p>"Once upon a time, old Europe looked upon America, as a youth, who developed healthily and happily. Now it looks upon a giant. We saw your proud Chicago, how it brought forth soil from the lake and created new places of development for its population. We saw the skyscrapers in New York reaching steadily higher towards the sky; we saw a Babel of languages; we saw new lines of transportation being opened up. And today we saw in your stock-yards a mass production, which cannot be adequately described. This is only a symbol of a wonderful development. Until 1914 both of us were growing. Then came the Great Catastrophe, which threw Europe back, while the development of America grew. For instance farming in old Europe decreased fifty percent, while on the other hand it rose here. In 1914 the United States imported 40% of the worlds silk, in 1921 it was 90%. Thats the way things have changed, and how Europe looks today. If Europe wants to remain it has to follow new ways. This also is Germany's problem, if it wants to regain its wealth."</p>
